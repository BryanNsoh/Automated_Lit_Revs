    Listen Urban stormwater refers to water transferred in built environments from
    rainfall or snowmelt (Müller et al. 2020). In the past centuries, with the development
    of the economy and society, there were more and more built areas all over the
    world. In these built environments, biodiversity and ecosystems services related
    to stormwater are reduced due to impervious surfaces such as streets, parking
    lots, and rooftops (Berland et al. 2017), and as a result, many environmental
    issues have arisen (Prudencio & Null 2018). These environmental issues include
    but are not limited to (i) urban flooding due to reduced water infiltration that
    is also linked to climate change (Cousins 2017), such as floods in Zhengzhou City,
    China on July 20, 2021 (Wang et al. 2021) and (ii) water contamination due to
    stormwater runoff over polluted impervious surfaces (Gasperi et al. 2014; Becouze-Lareure
    et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2019; Müller et al. 2020). Since the middle of the 19th
    century, modern storm drains, gutters, and underground systems which are also
    known as gray infrastructures are constructed in cities worldwide (Qiao et al.
    2018; Fu et al. 2019). The last decades have also seen the emergence of green
    infrastructures including wet ponds, constructed stormwater wetlands, bioretention,
    infiltration facilities, permeable pavement, swales, green roofs, and rainwater
    harvesting systems, etc., also named nature-based solutions (NBSs), stormwater
    control measures (SCMs), best management practices (BMPs), with issues related
    to their design, operation, and long-term performance (Fletcher et al. 2015; Cherqui
    et al. 2019). Traditionally, stormwater quantity and quality in the infrastructures
    mentioned above are monitored by water technicians using accurate and expensive
    instrumentation (Salehi et al. 2020; Thebault et al. 2020; Nickel et al. 2021).
    Because of resource limitations, it is difficult in theory and impossible in practice
    to monitor stormwater in these infrastructures with high temporal and spatial
    resolution. The drawbacks of this condition are numerous and include (i) lag in
    urban flood warning and relief decision-making due to inaccurate rainfall estimates
    (Wang et al. 2021); (ii) lack of proactive response to water contamination due
    to the inadequacy of data (Pule et al. 2017); and (iii) lack of maintenance due
    to lack of monitoring and leading to failure of the stormwater infrastructures
    themselves (Thomas et al. 2016; Wong & Kerkez 2016; Al-Rubaei et al. 2017). Facing
    the above-mentioned drawbacks of insufficient monitoring, thanks to the development
    of open-source hardware, wireless communication technology and sensors in the
    last few years, a promising paradigm for soil, air and water monitoring appeared
    and a large number of papers have emerged in this area (Montserrat et al. 2013;
    Gaddam et al. 2014; Rai et al. 2017; Morawska et al. 2018; Valente et al. 2020).
    In this paradigm, high-resolution spatiotemporal and relatively reliable data
    are collected by using a ubiquitous network of low-cost sensors. The potential
    benefits of applying such a paradigm for stormwater monitoring are (i) supplementing
    conventional stormwater monitoring; (ii) enhancing the capacity of urban flood
    warning; (iii) improving the ability of water contamination detection; (iv) accumulating
    a wealth of new knowledge on stormwater and stormwater infrastructure management
    and maintenance; (v) provide the means for real-time control of infrastructure;
    and (vi) making the most of the Big Data approach to discover new beneficial information.
    Therefore, this paradigm attracts urban hydrologists like the authors of this
    review to devote themselves to this attractive but unfamiliar area to build their
    own monitoring network to support research. Indeed, as urban stormwater management
    rapidly evolves worldwide toward numerous decentralized source control facilities,
    widely disseminated across catchments and cities, there is a growing need for
    monitoring these facilities, to obtain spatially distributed information and data
    about their functioning. With traditional reliable and well-known but expensive
    sensors and monitoring systems, only a few of these facilities can be monitored.
    This is why it is worth evaluating the potential of massively using low-cost sensors
    to monitor these numerous decentralized stormwater facilities, with particular
    attention to their levels of reliability, accuracy, and uncertainty, along with
    adapted specifications. An example of the applicability of the crowd-sourcing
    approach to urban rainfall monitoring with low-cost sensors used by citizens has
    shown that it could, under some conditions, overperform for rainfall runoff modeling
    compared to a sparse traditional rain gauge network (Yang & Ng 2017). This review
    is linked to the collaborative project Cheap''Eau, funded by the French Rhône-Méditerranée-Corse
    water agency (http://graie.org/othu/progr_cheapeau.htm, visited on 28 Feb. 2023.).
    Cheap''Eau aims to evaluate if and how low-cost sensors can be used by researchers
    and practitioners for stormwater monitoring. In addition to this review, various
    low-costs sensors are presently tested for monitoring stormwater facilities like
    green roofs, detention tanks, and trenches (Cherqui et al. 2020). Results and
    conclusions of the on-going Cheap''Eau project will be published separately. Three
    technical parts can be distinguished in this emerging paradigm: open-source hardware,
    communication protocols and low-cost sensors. Open-source hardware and communication
    protocols are relatively reliable and there are a few commonly used solutions.
    These solutions have been in development for several years and are designed, developed,
    promoted, and guaranteed by professional companies such as, e.g., Arduino and
    Raspberry Pi. On the contrary, low-cost sensors are a more complex part. Most
    of them were originally designed for teaching purposes, small parts for other
    goods or for do-it-yourself (DIY) use by electronics enthusiasts. Their reliability
    is questioned (Kumar et al. 2015). As a trade-off of price, some of them do not
    have a clear manufacturing company and brand, and do not provide end-users with
    (detailed) datasheets. There is also no universally agreed definition of ‘low-cost’
    sensors. In this context, there have been some high-quality reviews in scientific
    papers about low-cost sensors for monitoring air quality, with recommendations
    to end-users (Rai et al. 2017; Morawska et al. 2018). But the authors of this
    article could not find similar reviews in the field of low-cost sensors for stormwater
    monitoring. This undoubtedly may hinder the large-scale application of low-cost
    sensors in this field. To fill this gap, we review scientific articles about using
    or assessing 12 types of commercially available low-cost sensors for monitoring
    stormwater and related meteorological variables. The method for literature selection
    is presented in the next section. Three categories of low-cost sensors are distinguished:
    (i) meteorological sensors for monitoring air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation,
    and rainfall; (ii) water quantity sensors for monitoring water level, water flow
    and soil moisture; and (iii) water quality sensors for monitoring pH, conductivity,
    turbidity, nitrogen, and phosphorus. In this review, a sensor is identified to
    be low-cost according to two possible criteria: (i) its price is at least 10 times
    lower than equivalent traditional sensors or (ii) it has been reported in the
    literature to be working with open-source hardware to build a low-cost monitoring
    unit. The authors of this article speculate that the main readers of this review
    are stormwater researchers who are aiming to conduct stormwater monitoring projects
    with full control but a limited budget. On the one hand, one may to some extent
    assume they are low-cost sensor hobbyists: the information provided in this review
    is important to design and build their own systems. On the other hand, they are
    researchers who must ensure reliable and robust best practices in stormwater monitoring.
    Performance criteria like trueness, repeatability, and uncertainty, etc. are of
    key importance in their evaluation of low-cost sensors and in their possible use
    of such sensors for data acquisition to support research conclusions. To the best
    knowledge of the authors, this review is the first one on a diversity of low-costs
    sensors that could potentially be used for stormwater monitoring, by gathering
    and summarizing information from various sources. Special attention is devoted
    to the metrological performance criteria of the sensors, for example, trueness,
    repeatability, reproducibility, and uncertainty to provide objective information
    to potential users and clarify the current level of knowledge of such technologies.
    It reveals that such information is frequently missing in the reviewed papers,
    which indicates that further work is necessary to reach the required level of
    maturity and reliability for efficient routine use of such sensors in urban hydrology.
    Low-cost sensors could potentially hold the promise to complete (and not replace)
    both the traditional (e.g., Bertrand-Krajewski et al. 2021; Sambito & Freni 2021)
    and emerging (e.g., Yaroshenko et al. 2020) monitoring systems in the urban drainage
    field. METHODOLOGY Paper selection Listen To make this review paper as comprehensive
    as possible, there are no specific price restrictions when using the term ‘low-cost’.
    We reviewed scientific literature that contains low-cost or related expressions.
    Web of Science and Google Scholar (Martín-Martín et al. 2021) are used to search
    papers in which commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) low-cost sensors are used in sensing
    networks. In the advanced search query builder tool of Web of Science, for example,
    query ‘ALL = ((Low-cost OR cheap OR frugal) AND (sensor OR instrument) AND (off-the-shelf
    OR commercial) AND (sensor network OR sensing network) AND (water flow OR discharge
    OR flow rate))’ is used to search the usage of COTS low-cost water flow sensors.
    The search timespan is from 2012-01-01 to 2022-12-31 (publication date). And then,
    all results are browsed. A paper which indicates the usage of specific COST sensors
    is selected to review. In the advanced search tool of Google Scholar, similar
    queries are used. Google Scholar is also forced to return articles dated between
    2012 and 2022. Papers are sorted by relevance based on full text matching and
    information on journal, author, and citation. The results in the first five pages
    are browsed to select papers to review due to the very high number of references
    (several tens of thousands) returned by Google Scholar. When a specific sensor
    model is detected, Google Scholar is used to search papers that give the performance
    assessment of this specific type of sensor (e.g., search ‘SHT20’, ‘HC-SR04’, ‘SEN0161’).
    Papers are sorted by relevance. The results in the first three pages are browsed
    to select papers to review. Numbers of search results and final selected papers
    are given in Table 1. Table 1 Number of Web of Science and Google Scholar search

    reviewed by authors for this review. A general concern is that these low-cost
    sensors very quickly evolve thanks to the rapid development of technologies. There
    is a lag between the application of sensors in projects and the publication of
    papers. During the review, we found that most low-cost sensor models are sold,
    tested, and used for several years which proves they have a stable design and
    supply. This review also included some abstracts to enhance its timeliness. Sensor
    performance evaluation Listen Even though the evaluation of sensors is dependent
    on application scenarios, contexts, and purposes, the authors of this review believe
    that the greatest challenge is to identify sensors which are not only low-cost,
    but which can generate useful data over an extended period. Like any sensors,
    the performance information of low-cost sensors is collected and classified by
    parameters as shown in Table 2. Table 2 Major performance criteria for the performance
    assessment of low-cost sensors Parameters Description Trueness  Output closeness
    with the reading of the reference measurement at the same place and same time.  Repeatability  Output
    closeness under a set of repeatable conditions of measurement (NF EN 17075 2018).  Reproducibility  Dispersion
    between measurements obtained using different sensors of the same model (Rai et
    al. 2017).  Resolution  Smallest change in a quantity being measured that causes
    a perceptible change in the corresponding indication (JCGM 2012).  Response time  Time
    interval between the instant when a continuous measuring device is subjected to
    an abrupt change in the measurand value and the instant when the readings cross
    the limits of (and remain inside) a band defined by the 90% and the 110% of the
    difference between the initial and final value of the abrupt change (NF EN 17075
    2018).  Sensitivity to environment  Effect of environmental factors (temperature,
    relative humidity and so on) on sensor output (Rai et al. 2017).  Maintenance
    needs  Frequency and hours dedicated to the maintenance of sensors (including
    controls and cleaning).  Longevity  Time of operation before replacement (Kumar
    et al. 2015).  Information from manufacturers and scientific literature of every
    type of sensor is connected as much as possible. Many low-cost sensor''s datasheets
    use the term ‘accuracy’ to describe their sensor''s performance, combining and/or
    likely confusing trueness and repeatability. In the tables of this review, we
    put manufacturers'' accuracy metric into trueness criteria. As in low-cost air
    quality field (e.g., Rai et al. 2017), due to the lack of a standard calibration
    protocol specific for low-cost sensors, studies have used dissimilar calibration
    methods, against a variety of reference instruments, which makes intercomparison
    between them infeasible. Nevertheless, these studies provide valuable information
    about the performance of low-cost sensors under a variety of operating conditions
    (Rai et al. 2017). Some authors used subjective judgment vocabulary such as ‘good’,
    ‘acceptable’, ‘reasonable’, ‘satisfactory’, ‘not severe’ to describe the performance
    of low-cost sensors. We use quotation marks to indicate that this is the judgment
    of the authors of the papers, and not our own opinion. Various performance metrics
    have been cited in this review and their definitions are given and harmonized
    in Table 3 in the order of their appearance. All notations are unified in this
    review, where n is the number of samples, is the reading of low-cost sensors,
    is the reading of reference sensors, and are the average values of and ⁠, and
    are the ranks of and ⁠. When computing dynamic residuals (DR), is the averaged
    linear model output of the given sensor (Araújo et al. 2020). When computing pooled
    relative standard deviation (SD) (sr,p), k, ⁠, m and are the index of the current
    series, number of measurements in series k, the total number of series, and corresponding
    SD of the series, respectively (Adla et al. 2020). Table 3 Performance metrics

    only a very limited number of papers reporting about sensitivity to the environment,
    maintenance needs and longevity of the tested sensors. Consequently, we provide
    this information only when it is available. The review revealed that low-cost
    sensors are frequently poorly documented and described in the literature, with
    many of the criteria listed in Table 2 not provided, or, when provided, given
    without or with insufficient details or references to the protocols and methods
    used. To reflect this finding, we indicate ‘NA’ when information is missing. In
    the same way, the review also shows that the available literature on low-cost
    sensors is not always sufficiently detailed, according to metrology good practice
    requirements, which leads to some difficulties in interpretation. These difficulties
    are discussed further in Section 6. LOW-COST METEOROLOGICAL SENSORS REVIEW Listen
    In this chapter, performance assessments of four low-cost meteorological sensors
    are reviewed: air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and rainfall, which are
    typical components of weather monitoring stations. The reason for measuring air
    humidity, wind speed and solar radiation is that a critical component of the water
    cycle in urban areas and green infrastructures is evapotranspiration, which can
    be estimated by the FAO Penman–Monteith equation using air humidity, radiation,
    and wind speed data (Ndulue & Ranjan 2021). In addition, the optimization of management
    and maintenance of some SCMs such as wet ponds, wetlands, swales, and green roofs
    also depend on these local weather data (Czemiel Berndtsson 2010). Accurate rainfall
    measurements are essential for the effective management of stormwater. Historical
    rainfall records are used extensively in the design of water infrastructure, while
    at finer scales, real-time rainfall measurements are a key component of flood
    forecasting systems. But current methods for measuring precipitation often do
    not provide the spatial resolution or measurement quality required for real-time
    applications (Bartos et al. 2019) despite the progress of rainfall radar measurement
    with high spatial resolution (Vos et al. 2018). Large-scale ubiquitous low-cost
    rain gauge sensor networks hold promise to fill this gap. Air humidity sensors
    Listen There are three basic types of air humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive,
    and thermal. Lorek (2014) tests the capacitive sensor Sensirion SHT75 in low vacuum
    (10–1,000 hpa) and temperature (−70–25 °C) ranges and reports that it works ‘reliably
    and with reproducibly measured values’. Most low-cost humidity sensors mentioned
    in the scientific literature are DHT11 (Adepoju et al. 2020; Hernández et al.
    2020; Hussein et al. 2020; Leonowicz et al. n.d.; Morales-Morales et al. 2020),
    DHT22 (also named AM2302) (Math & Dharwadkar 2017; Azma Zakaria et al. 2018; Morón
    et al. 2018; Arzoumanian et al. 2019; Bankar & Sagat 2020; Institute of Electrical
    & Electronics Engineers & Università di Napoli n.d.; Pereira et al. 2020; Sulzer
    et al. 2022), BME280 (Lee et al. 2020; Tagle et al. 2020; Cowell et al. 2022;
    Radogna et al. 2022), 808H5V5 (SM et al. 2019), SHT20 (Moreno-Rangel et al. 2018;
    Nouman et al. 2019), HTU21D (Farhat et al. 2017), and HIH4000 (Bastos et al. 2020).
    According to manufacturer''s manuals, DHT11 cannot read the full range of relative
    humidity (only 20–90% RH), and 808H5V5 and HIH4000 cannot provide satisfactory
    performance (trueness of 808H5V5 at 25 °C, over the range 30–80% RH is 4% RH,
    trueness of HIH4000 at 25 °C, over the range 0–59% RH is 5% RH and increases to
    ±8% RH over the sub-range 60–100% RH). HTU21D is observed presenting significantly
    biased data (Araújo et al. 2020). We thus do not discuss them further. The sensors
    we consider the most promising ones (low cost, full humidity range, best accuracy)
    are presented in Table 4 including their main technical specifications. About
    the performance assessments of SHT20, DHT22, and BME280, Table 5 gives a summary
    based on manufacturers’ data and tests in scientific studies. Table 4 Specifications

    al. (2018) test five SHT20 used in Fooboot FBT0002100 air quality monitor compared
    to a validated instrument from GrayWolf and show 2 days of data. bSmith (2018,
    2017) tests six DHT22 and nine BME280 with reference to saturated solutions and
    distilled water. cAraújo et al. (2020) test three AM2302 and three BME280 inside
    a controlled climatic chamber (Aralab© Fitoclima®) with reference to Lascar Electronics
    EL-USB-2. dTagle et al. (2020) compare the output of three BME280 with three regulatory
    air quality monitoring stations (HMP 35A, Vaisala) in three sites. For each parameter,
    the source of the information is given in the superscript and when available,
    criteria are given (associated formulae can be found in Table 2). NA stands for
    not available. Moreno-Rangel et al. (2018) report that for SHT20 deviations are
    from −0.78 to 1.08% RH and the average deviation is −0.01% RH, Spearman''s rank-order
    correlation (rs) are from 0.935 to 0.948, p-value < 0.001. About its reproducibility,
    deviations are from −1.86 to 0.75% RH and the average deviation is 0.52% RH, rs
    are from 0.985 to 0.991, p-value < 0.001. They conclude that SHT20 inside air
    quality monitoring has ‘very low variability’ in trueness and ‘very strong uniformity’
    in reproducibility. According to the datasheet, trueness is 3% RH, repeatability
    is ±0.1% RH, the resolution is 0.04% RH and response time is 8 s. About DHT22
    (also named AM2302), Smith (2018, 2017) report that its trueness is expected to
    be around 5%, repeatability in a range 0.5–1% RH and reproducibility is around
    5% RH, response time is about 30 s (30-s delay in response compared to other humidity
    sensors). The authors of this review think this delay may be due to a mistake
    in the Arduino library. Smith also reports that the sensor output shows a dependence
    of up to 8% RH over the temperature range 10–40 °C. We cannot understand this
    statement because relative humidity itself is a quantity related to air temperature.
    About longevity, in this test, two sensors failed after about 1 year and five
    failed after 3 years, with output which may suddenly increase or even saturate.
    Araújo et al. (2020) report that AM2302 showed mean error −4.4 to −4.2% RH at
    30% RH, −4.2 to −2.5% RH at 50% RH and 0.0–1.5 at 80% RH when the temperature
    is 10, 24, and 40 °C, respectively, and SD of mean errors is 2.7% RH. When using
    a linear model to fit AM2302 output p and reference output P, they get with R2
    = 0.992 and dynamic residual is 3.5% RH. They concluded that AM2302 is ‘overestimating
    the relative humidity variations’. In all above situations, the average SD of
    repeatability is less than 0.70% RH. The sensor datasheet claims that trueness
    is 2% RH, repeatability is ±1% RH, the resolution is 0.1% RH and response time
    is 2 s. About BME280, Smith (2018) reports that it performed within specifications.
    Its output values had a dependence of less than 3% RH over the range 10–40 °C.
    Araújo et al. (2020) report that BME280 showed mean error −1.4 to −3.9% RH at
    30% RH, −3.0 to −1.2% RH at 50% RH, and 0.7–2.2 at 80% RH when the temperature
    is 10, 24 and 40 °C, respectively, and SD of mean error is 2.1% RH. When using
    a linear model to fit BME280 output p and reference output P, they get with R2
    = 0.995 and dynamic residual is 2.3% RH. In all above situations, the average
    standard deviation of repeatability is less than 0.60% RH. In the comparison work
    of Tagle et al. (2020), some of their BME280 modules show output saturation (at
    30% RH) and underestimate 100% RH, this indicates its poor reproducibility. The
    sensor datasheet claims that trueness is 3% RH, the resolution is 0.0008% RH and
    response time is 1 s. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends the
    following accuracy performances: 1% at high values of relative humidity (80% or
    more) and 5% at moderate values of relative humidity (Araújo et al. 2020). According
    to available literature, trueness, repeatability, and resolution of SHT20, DHT22,
    and BME280 modules are close to this recommendation. Their resolution and response
    time can meet every minute of monitoring. We do not think they have maintenance
    needs, because it is more convenient to replace them when using separate modules.
    The main problems of these low-cost air humidity sensors are their reproducibility
    (high variability from sensor to sensor) and longevity (output saturation or underestimation).
    Facing these problems, we recommend end-users to purchase them from reliable sources,
    take care of data quality and replace them every year. The sensor housing is another
    key concern. We note that these low-cost sensors are provided with naked circuit
    boards, plastic housings or waterproof probes. What housing is more suitable for
    field use and the effect of the housing on sensor performance are issues that
    need to be investigated. Wind speed sensors Listen Many types of anemometers exist.
    When examining the low-cost anemometers cited in the literature, we found that
    three-cup anemometers are used in many applications due to their simplicity and
    low-cost features. The modules mentioned in the papers are SKU: SEN-08942 (Khattab
    et al. 2016; Prabhakaran & Ravindran 2019; Sarkar et al. 2020), SKU: SEN-15901
    (Flores 2020; Kaewwongsri & Silanon 2020; Fortes et al. 2021), WS-2080 (Tai et
    al. 2017; Domínguez-Brito et al. 2020), and SKU: SEN0170 (Nouman et al. 2019;
    Semenov et al. 2019; Hussein et al. 2020). Based on the information available
    on the internet, SEN-08942, SEN-15901 and WS-2080 are weather station kits. SEN-15901
    is the new version of SEN-08942 and has the same appearance as WS-2080. It seems
    that the difference between SEN-15901 and WS-2080 is that SEN-15091 has only mechanical
    parts and does not contain electronic parts such as a controller and monitor.
    The separate anemometer module used in SEN-15901 is called WH-SP-WS01. SEN0170
    is a separate anemometer module. Specifications of WS-2080, WH-SP-01 and SEN0170
    are presented in Table 6. Table 7 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost
    anemometer modules by manufacturer and tested by scientific studies. Table 6 Specifications

    in user manual is ‘whichever is greater’. bThe original text in the datasheet
    is ‘wind speed 0.33 m/s causes the switch to close once’ in Chinese. cThe original
    text in the datasheet is ‘a wind speed of 2.4 km/h causes the switch to close
    once per second’ in English. dDomínguez-Brito et al. (2020) undertake an experimental
    comparison in real conditions with scientific-grade Thies Clima anemometer model
    4.3159.00.140 for 90 min. eTai et al. (2017) use WS-2080 at northern Lake Tahoe.
    fNouman et al. (2019) test performance of SEN0170 compared to a TESTO Air Flow
    Probe 06280143 whose accuracy is ±0.03 m/s. About the anemometer part of WS-2080
    or named WH-SP-WS01, regarding its trueness, in the test of Domínguez-Brito et
    al. (2020), data were collected at 1 Hz, and they applied a centered median filter
    with 30 s threshold to cancel noises in the wind speed data. They report that
    between low-cost sensor and reference, the regression analysis coefficient is
    0.951, but they do not give the function, mean bias error (MBE) is −0.167 m/s
    and mean square error is 0.468 m/s. They consider these results ‘to be a good
    fit’ because that ‘sensors not being mechanically identical and not being situated
    at exactly the same position’. Regarding its longevity, Tai et al. (2017) use
    it in the field for 1 year and do not mention any running problems. According
    to the user manual of WS-2080, the maintenance need is cleaning the connectors
    once every 1–2 years. Unfortunately, user manual of WS-2080 and data sheet of
    WH-SP-WS01 give three resolutions to convert raw signal (close of reed switch)
    to wind speeds (0.04, 0.33, and 0.67 m/s) and Domínguez-Brito et al. (2020) do
    not report the value that they use. About SEN0170, it showed poor trueness (R2
    = 0.3162) as it is not sensitive to wind speed below 0.8 m/s (Nouman et al. 2019).
    According to the datasheet, accuracy is 3%, resolution is 0.1 m/s, and it is recommended
    to work in air humidity range 35–85% RH (no condensation). We do not find assessments
    of other criteria. In general, it seems that the only low-cost anemometer choice
    is WH-SP-WS01. The maintenance need is that the connectors should be cleaned every
    1 or 2 years and users can avoid this if they do not use the original connectors.
    The main problems of WH-SP-WS01 are (i) unknown repeatability and reproducibility
    which is especially critical when using many of them to model a wind field and
    (ii) unknown true resolution to convert the close signal of internal reed switch
    into wind speed: this problem can be solved when comparing it with a reference.
    Solar radiation sensors Listen Broadband solar radiation or global irradiance
    is an electromagnetic spectrum in the wavelength range of 300–3,000 nm (WMO) or
    350–1,500 nm (ISO) (Azouzoute et al. 2019). Pyranometers are designed to measure
    this physical quantity. They are standardized according to the ISO 9060 (International
    Organization for Standardization 2018) standard, which is also adopted by the
    WMO. This standard discriminates three classes: the best is called Class A (old
    name: secondary standard), the second-best Class B (old name: first class), and
    the last one Class C (old name: second class). There are three kinds of pyranometers:
    thermopile pyranometers, silicon photodiode pyranometers and photovoltaics (PV)
    reference cells (Karki et al. 2021). Thermopile pyranometers measure irradiance
    with a spectral response from 280 to 2,800 nm. They usually cost thousands of
    euros, are often considered as Class A standards and are used as reference devices
    to test other types of pyranometers. Silicon photodiode pyranometers usually cost
    hundreds of euros. They are a low-cost and lower-maintenance option compared to
    thermopile pyranometers but can only measure irradiance with a spectral response
    from 300 to 1,100 nm (López Lorente et al. 2020). Recently, an emphasis focused
    on the use of separate photodiodes which cost tens of euros to measure solar radiation
    (Espinosa-Gavira et al. 2018; Tohsing et al. 2019; Salgado et al. 2020). As for
    photovoltaic reference cells, we found that their prices were hundreds of euros
    in 2010 and decreased due to the price decrease of photovoltaic modules. The authors
    of this review believe that there are hundreds of commercially available pyranometers
    on the shelf. There are no need and necessity to list them all out. We present
    four widely used and representative sensors: Apogee CS300 (Schenk et al. 2015;
    Patrignani et al. 2020), ISET (Azouzoute et al. 2019), Si1145 (Burgt 2020; Theisen
    et al. 2020), and ML8511 (Burgt 2020). Their specifications are given in Table
    8. Table 9 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost pyranometers given
    by the manufacturer and tested by scientific studies. Table 8 Specifications of

    level of 1-alpha = 95%. cSchenk et al. (2015) compare three CS300 with a Kipp
    & Zonen CMP11 thermopile pyranometer that is installed 250 m away and then use
    CS300 in field. dAzouzoute et al. (2019) compare ISET sensor 02581 with a Hukseflux
    thermal sensor SR11 classified as a Class B specification sensor at same site
    and give the results in June and December, respectively. eTheisen et al. (2020)
    compare output counts of Si1145 with LI-COR pyranometer that has an accuracy of
    ±5% from August 2018 to March 2019. fBurgt (2020) calibrate and validate output
    of ML8511 and Si1145 compared with pyranometer Davis Instruments Vantage Pro 2.
    About CS300, regarding its trueness, Schenk et al. (2015) reported that, compared
    to the reference, the mean deviations of three CS300 are 6.2, 9.1, and −10.4 W/m2,
    respectively, and standard deviations are 43.2, 41.4, and 47.1 W/m2, respectively.
    They conclude that CS300 is ‘the most economical solution’ compared to the two
    semiconductor pyranometers they tested. After this test, Schenk et al. (2015)
    use 20 CS300 in the field for more than 1 year and report that CS300 show ‘good
    agreement between the sensors’ when they are not shaded but do not give any metric
    details. The manufacturer of CS300 indicates that it is calibrated against a Kipp
    & Zonen CM21 thermopile pyranometer and has an absolute accuracy of ±5% for daily
    total radiation, its resolution is 0.2 mV per W/m2, its response time is less
    than 1 ms and it needs to be checked and cleaned every month. About the ISET sensor,
    Azouzoute et al. (2019) read its output every 10 s and compare it to the reference
    in time resolution 1min. Regarding trueness, they report that in June, MBE is
    −19.57 W/m2, root mean square error (RMSE) is 45.946 W/m2, normalized root mean
    square error (NRMSE) is 11.292%, t-statistic (TS) is 82.381, SD is 41.569 and
    coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.993. In December, MBE is −2.398 W/m2, RMSE
    is 13.027 W/m2, NRMSE is 3.913%, TS is 30.975, SD is 12.804, and R2 is 0.999.
    They conclude that ‘the reference cells underestimate the plane of array irradiance
    values. This underestimation is much higher in the summer than in the winter,
    which is completely understandable, since the PV cells are highly affected by
    the high-temperature values’, even though the ISET sensor has an integrated Pt100
    temperature sensor to compensate for its output. According to the manufacturer,
    it is professionally calibrated and came with a certificate. It has a relative
    measurement uncertainty of <± 5%, and a resolution of 0.1 mV per W/m2. About light
    sensors Si1145 and ML8511, they are not initially designed to be a pyranometer.
    Theisen et al. (2020) find there is a linear correlation between the downwelling
    global solar radiation measured by the LI-COR pyranometer P and the output counts
    p of Si1145: ⁠. But Si1145 has three outputs: infrared light counts, visible light
    counts, and UV index, and Theisen et al. (2020) do not describe which Si1145 output
    they use. Using this calibration function, they report that from August 2018 to
    March 2019, every month RMSE is from 34.14 to 81.64 W/m2 and the correlation coefficient
    is from 0.96 to 0.99. Burgt (2020) connects ML8511, Si1145 and reference pyranometer
    to a Wemos D1 Mini microcontroller and uses an analog-to-digital converter ADS1115
    to read the output of ML8511 and reference pyranometer. All his measurements are
    taken every 2 s. He reports that the calibration function is where P is the output
    of the reference pyranometer in W/m2. The authors of this review guess that is
    the UV index output of Si1145, is the visible light counts output of Si1145, is
    the infrared light counts output of Si1145 and is the output voltage of ML8511
    but we do not know their units. About this calibration function, the adjusted
    R2 is 0.995, the SD is 23.93, the significance F is 0 and all p-values are below
    0.05. In the 2h validation test on a sunny afternoon, RMSE is 46.37 W/m2, but
    there is a negative ‘offset of about 50 W/m2, when the solar irradiance is at
    a value of about 200–400 W/m2.’ (Burgt 2020). The datasheet of Si1145 indicates
    that its resolution is 100 microlux. When designing a solar radiation sensing
    network, there are two main choices. One choice is to use commercial pyranometers
    such as CS300 and ISET: they are calibrated by manufacturers and provide reliable
    trueness, repeatability, reproducibility, resolution, response time and longevity
    (Schenk et al. 2015; Azouzoute et al. 2019). Another choice is to use cheaper
    light sensors such as Si1145 and ML8511. In that case, users need to calibrate
    and house them (Burgt 2020; Theisen et al. 2020). If funds allow, it is highly
    recommended to use a Class A thermopile pyranometer as a reference. WMO standard
    specifies a resolution of 5 W/m2 and uncertainty of 8% hourly totals (5% daily
    totals for Class B pyranometers). According to the authors of this review experience,
    the output of CS300, ISET, and ML8511 is a voltage signal and the analog-to-digital
    conversion module of Arduino is not accurate enough, it is thus necessary to use
    an additional analog-to-digital converter such as an ADS1115. All pyranometers
    are recommended to be checked and cleaned every month. Rainfall sensors Listen
    In stormwater management, accurate and timely rainfall monitoring is a prerequisite.
    Rain gauges are the key standard equipment for monitoring rainfall. A variety
    of rain gauges exist. To compare rain gauges based on different measuring principles,
    the WMO organized field intercomparison from October 2007 to April 2009 in Vigna
    di Valle, Rome (Italy) involving 30 different types of rain gauges. Results indicate
    that synchronized tipping-bucket rain gauges (TBRG), using internal correction
    algorithms, and weighing gauges (WG) with improved dynamic stability and short
    step response are the most accurate gauges for 1-min rainfall intensity measurements,
    providing the lowest measurement uncertainty with respect to the assumed working
    reference (Lanza & Vuerich 2009). But this report does not mention any gauge model
    or any manufacturer. We identified four low-cost rainfall sensors mentioned in
    the scientific literature: droplet detector YL-83 (Rivas-Sánchez et al. 2019;
    Islam et al. 2021), tipping-bucket rain gauge WH-SP-RG (Abeledo et al. 2016; Chan
    et al. 2021), optical rainfall detector RG-11 (Bartos et al. 2018) with no guaranteed
    accuracy to measure rainfall intensity, and Pluvimate drop-counting rain gauge
    (Michelon et al. 2020). According to information available on the internet, WH-SP-RG
    is part of the weather station kit SEN-15901 or WS-2080. RG-11''s manufacturer
    also provides a new version named RG-15 with guaranteed accuracy. Their specifications
    are given in Table 10. Table 10 Specifications of low-cost rain sensors Model

    J2. According to the datasheet from VASALA, YL-83 capacitive sensor has a housing
    which makes it waterproof. But only its bare circuit boards can be retrieved and
    purchased online. Although some applications have been reported (Rivas-Sánchez
    et al. 2019; Islam et al. 2021; Wisudawan 2021), papers do not mention any evaluation.
    Rivas-Sánchez et al. (2019) calibrate YL-83 with the value (ON/OFF) to detect
    if there is rainfall or not and they show the output voltage change of YL-83 during
    a rainfall event. But they do not describe the method of calibration and the correspondence
    of the output of YL-83 to the rainfall intensity. Dias (2019) reports that YL-83
    is oxidated after the first occurrence of rain. Probably because RG-15 appeared
    more recently on the market, there is no scientific literature reporting the application
    of RG-15. RG-15 and RG-11 appear very similar and there are some scientific papers
    about RG-11. Table 11 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost rain
    gauges given by the manufacturer and tested by scientific studies. Table 11 A

    manufacturer. fColoch Tahuico (2021) checks the resolution of WH-SP-RG by pouring
    a known volume of water inside it and then counting the tips. gTai et al. (2017)
    use WS-2080 at northern Lake Tahoe. hSteele et al. (2014) compare RG-11 with manual
    rain gauge (typically are cylindrical and totalize the rainfall accumulated between
    visits to the field site). iMoore et al. (2020) use RG-11 in Zadko Obervatory.
    jBenoit et al. (2018) evaluate the performance of eight Pluvimates. kMichelon
    et al. (2020) claim that Pluvimate is a low-cost sensor, and they use 12 Pluvimates
    in the Swiss Alps for 3 months. WH-SP-RG appears as part of weather station kits
    WS-2080. Coloch Tahuico (2021) increases its collector area from 55 to 314 cm2
    (calculated from the design drawing, he describes it in the text as 1,000 cm2,
    which may be a mistake). And then he pours 1.6–1,000 mL water and the sensor output
    1–434 tips. he concludes that sensor resolution is 2.5 ± 0.08 mL/tip (R2 = 0.98).
    The authors of this review do not think this a correct dynamic calibration method
    because pouring much water into the tipping-bucket rain gauge means always simulating
    an unrealistic heavy rainfall and it seems that a curve function is much more
    suitable in his calibration chart. Coloch Tahuico (2021) does not mention any
    in field test results. Tai et al. (2017) use WS-2080 at northern Lake Tahoe for
    1 year and did not mention any running problems. According to the user manual
    of WS-2080, WH-SP-RG has an accuracy of 10% and a resolution of 0.254 mm, but
    according to the datasheet of WH-SP-RG, its resolution is 0.2794 or 0.3 mm/tip
    in different languages. About RG-15, its appearance is very similar to RG-11.
    Steele et al. (2014) report that the average absolute percent deviation of RG-11
    from a manual rain gauge is 86.9% and linear regression produces an R2 of 0.75.
    They find that RG-11 tended to overestimate large rainfall events and underestimate
    smaller rainfall events. Moore et al. (2020) used RG-11 for 1 year in the field
    to detect rainfall events without error which is a reference to the longevity
    of RG-15. The manufacturer indicates that its accuracy is ±10% but field accuracy
    will vary. It has a resolution of 0.2 or 0.02 mm depending on the selected option,
    and its maintenance need is only replacing the lens after 7–10 years. About the
    Pluvimate sensor, Benoit et al. (2018) report that after bias correction for rainfall
    intensities 5–20 mm/h, the measurement uncertainties of seven Pluvimates sensors
    are less than 5% and one was slightly exceeding this value. For its reproducibility,
    they pass a known amount of water through the funnel and compare the recorded
    water depth to the known input (i.e., static calibration). The measured bias of
    eight sensors ranges from 2.8 to 23% with a mean bias of 13.9%. Michelon et al.
    (2020) do a dynamic calibration of a Pluvimate and report that the calibration
    curve is ⁠, R2 = 0.998, where P is the generated rainfall intensity and p is the
    measured rainfall intensity in mm/h, which means that the measuring uncertainty
    is below 5% for 0 to 20 mm/h generated rainfall intensity and reach −10% of error
    at 60 mm/h and −15% at 150 mm/h. They used it in the field for 3 months. The manufacturer
    indicates a resolution of 0.010 mm and maintenance needs include checking its
    filter and drain hole. In general, rain gauges WH-SP-RG and RG-15 deserve further
    tests. The drawbacks of WH-SP-RG are (i) a small collection area (only 55 cm2),
    and (ii) in case of heavy rainfall events, water tends to splash because it has
    no visible cone or funnel (Coloch Tahuico 2021). So WH-SP-RG needs to be adapted
    or transformed to be used in the field. The resolution of WH-SP-RG needs more
    investigation. It needs to check and clean every month to avoid drain hole blockage.
    For the optical rain gauge RG-15, the point is to test whether it can really deliver
    the performance claimed by the manufacturer. We think that it is better to check
    and clean the surface of RG-15 every month like pyranometers. LOW-COST WATER QUANTITY
    SENSORS REVIEW Listen In this chapter, three water quantity parameters are selected
    for review: water level, flow, and soil moisture. Water level sensors Listen Water
    level is one of the most important parameters when monitoring stormwater. The
    correct and timely monitoring of this quantity is also related to the ability
    to achieve good urban stormwater management. There are many types of water level
    measurement devices such as float systems, pressure-measuring devices, capacitive
    devices, ultrasonic devices, radar devices, and radiation devices (Morris & Langari
    2016). When narrowing the range to low-cost sensors. according to available comparisons
    and wireless system design, two types of water level sensors are commonly used:
    non-contact ultrasonic sensors and contact pressure sensors. There are many kinds
    of ultrasonic and pressure sensors reported in the literature. We only focus on
    representative and validated sensors. Five sensors are selected: HC-SR04 (Intharasombat
    & Khoenkaw 2015; Shrenika et al. 2017; Sumitra et al. 2017; Nasution et al. 2018),
    JSN-SR04T (Andang et al. 2019; Cherqui et al. 2020; Dswilan et al. 2021), MS5803-01BA
    (Cherqui et al. 2020; Kombo et al. 2021; Shi et al. 2021), Kingspan Watchman Anywhere
    Pro (Zhang et al. 2019), and TL231 (or named TL-231, TL136, ASL-MP-2F) which has
    not been investigated in scientific papers. Their user manuals specifications
    are listed in Table 12. In addition, we noted that JSN-SR04T has different versions.
    In some papers, it may be the original version while the version indicated in
    Table 12 is version 2.0 with higher specifications. Kingspan Watchman Anywhere
    Pro is a complete off-the-shelf solution with an ultrasonic transducer, control
    board, communication module, battery and housing. Table 13 gives a summary of
    the performance of the low-cost water level sensors given by the manufacturer
    and tested by scientific studies. Table 12 Specifications of low-cost water level

    test HC-SR04 comparing to manual measurement in a distance to water surface in
    the range 0.8–1.3 m. cAndang et al. (2019) test JSN-SR04T by measuring the water
    level of a river compared with the manual distance measurement results. dCherqui
    et al. (2020) test the performance of JSN-SR04T and MS5803-01BA in laboratory
    in a water level range 0–2 m using an automatic system they developed with a reference
    sensor OTT PLS pressure transducer that has an accuracy ≤± 2 mm. eZhang et al.
    (2019) compare the output of four Kingspan Watchman Anywhere Pro with nearby hydrometric
    station for one month and use nine along the River Dodder. fShi et al. (2021)
    test MS5803-01BA in laboratory for 2 months and in field (pipe) for 1 year comparing
    with a Hach probe. About HC-SR04, Sumitra et al. (2017) report that its mean error
    is 0.97% but they only record data in centimeters and do not describe the calculation
    details of water level from echo time. Nasution et al. (2018) do a laboratory
    test and report that the average accuracy is 96.6% (they define accuracy as measurement
    value/reference value) but in their test, the measurement value is always lower
    than the true value, we think there may be a systematic error that is not corrected,
    and they also do not describe the calculation details. About JSN-SR04T, Andang
    et al. (2019) use where D is the distance in meter and T is the echo time in seconds
    and they assume that sound speed is always 340 m/s. They report that the errors
    between JSN-SR04T and reference are always less than 5 cm in a range 0–200 cm
    and that the error rate is 0.74%. Cherqui et al. (2020) report that its distance
    measure range is 0.225 to1.9 m, and expected accuracy can be less than 10 mm when
    adjusting the speed of sound for the correct temperature and humidity (error can
    increase up to 130 mm with a 40 °C difference and increase to 23 mm with a 100%
    relative humidity difference), its repeatability is 7 mm and it should be installed
    far from obstacles because it has a wide beam (70 degrees). During the laboratory
    experiment, JSN-SR04T recorded a total of more than 300,000 values without fault
    or drift. The maximum measurement time is 250 ms (includes the measurement itself,
    processing of the measure by the microcontroller and transfer to the computer
    to be stored via serial). They believe that the ultrasonic sensor needs very little
    maintenance because it is not in contact with water so that it will be not fouled
    by sediment, debris or algal growth. According to the datasheet of JSN-SR04T,
    its resolution is 1 mm. About Kingspan Watchman Anywhere Pro, Zhang et al. (2019)
    report that during their four units in field comparison in a water level in the
    range 0–1.2 m, Spearman''s rank correlations between Kingspan sensor and reference
    outputs are 0.9907, 0.9893, 0.9736, 0.9786, respectively, and mean absolute errors
    are 0.92, 0.76, 1.12, 0.74 mm, respectively. They conclude that ‘the low-cost
    remote sensor measurements are very close to the reference Dublin City Council
    (DCC) stations.’ But the authors of this review found that in their comparison
    chart of the unit which has a mean absolute error 0.74 mm, at many reference water
    levels, the Kingspan sensor''s output has a deviation of around 50 mm. Zhang et
    al. (2019) also report that throughout the duration the deployment in the field
    for more than 2 years with sample rates of 15 min, there is no field maintenance
    need, but one sensor is influenced by spider nests and two sensors are destroyed
    by somebody. About the liquid pressure sensor MS5803-01BA, Cherqui et al. (2020)
    report that it includes temperature compensation, but that there is a need to
    use a second sensor to measure atmospheric pressure to calculate the relative
    pressure. They report that for two MS5803-01BA sensors (one under water and one
    above water), trueness is ±5 mm and repeatability is 3 mm when measuring water
    levels ranging from 0 to 1.9 m. During their test, like JSN-SR04T, MS5803-01BA
    can also output more than 300,000 measurements without fault or drift and the
    maximum measurement time is 150 ms. Shi et al. (2021) also use two MS5803-01BA
    to measure water level. They report that MS5803-01BA drifts clearly in water and
    they think this is because of water uptakes in the layer of white gel protection
    in the sensor. Facing this drawback, Shi et al. (2021) report that during manual
    recalibration, for three test sensors, absolute errors can decrease from −20.6
    to 34.4 mm to −8.4 to 2.3 mm in the laboratory. In their field test, they install
    the reference sensor 76 mm higher than the low-cost sensor because that reference
    sensor is impacted by sediment loads and the low-cost sensor is not, but do not
    explain why. With automated recalibration every 14 days, absolute errors decrease
    from −18.1 to 110.8 mm to −36.7 to 33.8 mm. They find that even without calibration,
    MS5803-01BA can still ‘adequately detect the water level trend’ (almost the same
    results as the reference with R2 ∼ 1). They also report that two MS5803-01BA have
    0.72 mbar difference in air which is an indicator of reproducibility. According
    to the datasheet, trueness is about 25 mm and resolution is about 0.12–0.65 mm.
    Complete solutions like Kingspan Watchman Anywhere Pro with reasonable price allows
    for rapid deployment. In this way, end-users can focus on data collection and
    processing. For ubiquitous sensor networks, non-contact ultrasonic sensors HC-SR04
    and JSN-SR04T installed above water have almost no maintenance needs except spider
    nest interference and man-made damage. But sensor outputs will be noisy in case
    of events. It is important to correct sound velocity by air temperature (correction
    for humidity is not really necessary). HC-SR04 is not waterproof, which means
    additional development work is required. JSN-SR04 is waterproof but its maximum
    accurate measurement range is only 2 m. Contact pressure sensors installed under
    water can avoid human damage and situations where the water level cannot be monitored
    from above (e.g., presence of vegetation). However, Shi et al. (2021) report that
    MS5803-01BA experiences a drift issue in water due to water absorption of the
    sensor''s white protective layer so that MS5803-01BA needs to be re-calibrated
    at least every 2 weeks to achieve ‘accuracy’ ±10 mm. TL231 is a sensor worth testing.
    Although slightly expensive, it provides waterproof metal housing and possible
    manufacturer calibration. Water flow sensors Listen Water flow monitoring is crucial
    for hydrological monitoring. In this review, water flow (discharge) sensors are
    sensors that can measure the velocity of water in a river, a stream, or a sewer.
    Low-cost flow sensors currently off-the-shelf are relatively scarce. The most
    frequent type of sensors are Doppler velocity radars. We identified two representative
    works. Alimenti et al. (2020) propose a prototype of a low-cost continuous wave
    (CW) Doppler radar sensor, able to monitor the surface flow velocity of rivers.
    Their field results show a residual velocity SD of 0.07 m/s compared to a commercial
    handheld radar sensor Decatur SVR. There are some 24 GHz radar modules off-the-shelf
    such as CDM324 (or named IPM165), SEN0306 (SKU, from DFRobot), and 10 GHz module
    HB100. We cannot find papers describing in detail the usage of these sensors for
    water flow monitoring. Fulton et al. (2020) use a Doppler velocity radar QCam
    to measure surface velocities and river discharge. Compared to conventional stream
    gauging methods, percent differences were 0.3, 2.5, −10.4, 7.3, and −18.8% in
    five flights. They thought QCam was relatively inexpensive (compared to traditional
    radar sensors) but still cost about 6,000 €. In addition, some papers reported
    the use of the low-cost flow sensor YF-S201 (or other similar models such as G1/2),
    initially designed for pipelines, to measure flow rate in open channels or natural
    watercourses (Jegadeesan & Dhamodaran 2018; Koshoeva et al. 2021; Yuniarti et
    al. 2021). However, these papers are poorly informative for our review. The specifications
    of YF-S201 are given in Table 14. Table 14 Specifications of YF-S201 low-cost

    Output duty cycle: 50 ± 10%. Output rise time: 0.04 μs. Output fall time: 0.18
    μs. 450 pulses per litre. In general, water flow monitoring does not have low-cost
    solutions. Image-based methods (e.g., Sanyal et al. 2014; Patalano et al. 2017;
    Giordan et al. 2018; Koutalakis et al. 2019; Zhu & Lipeme Kouyi 2019) may be low-cost
    in the future thanks to advances in electronics and artificial intelligence technology.
    It seems unrealistic to send all the images to a centralized service for processing:
    images need to be processed locally. Flow rate information can then be sent to
    a server by means of a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) and checked photographs
    can be sent only in case of high flow rates. There are some sensors off-the-shelf
    based on Doppler velocity radar, but they are still too expensive to be used on
    a large scale (Fulton et al. 2020). Given this situation, it may be feasible to
    develop a water flow velocity measurement system using commercially available
    Doppler radar modules such as CDM324 and SKU: SEN0306 which cost about 50€. But
    we cannot estimate the workload required to have a fully operational equipment.
    An alternative option is using a pipeline water flow sensor like YF-S201 to develop
    an immersed water flow monitoring system. However, we do not find high-quality
    literature about this solution. Another interesting work is focusing on the presence
    or absence of water flow. Moody & Martin (2015) use resistor type instruments
    to develop overland flow detectors (OFDs). Hinrich Kaplan et al. (2019) use time-lapse
    imagery, electric conductivity (EC), and stage measurements to check the presence
    of streamflow. Chamber et al. (2020) use EC sensors (soil moisture sensors in
    fact) to develop their autonomous OFD. Assendelft & Ilja van Meerveld (2019) chose
    electrical resistance (ER) sensors, temperature sensors, float switch sensors,
    and flow sensors like YF-S201 to monitor temporary streams. They define the percentage
    of correct state data (the percentage of the state data derived from the sensor
    data that corresponded to the state data derived from time-lapse photographs)
    and the percentage of correctly timed state changes (the percentage of the state
    changes derived from the sensor data that corresponded in timing with the state
    changes derived from time-lapse photographs) to assess the performance of sensors.
    They conclude that ER sensors (99.9% correct state data and 90.9% correctly timed
    state changes) and flow sensors (99.9% correct state data and 90.5% correctly
    timed state changes) perform best. EC and ER sensors are presented in the next
    section dedicated to soil moisture sensors. Soil moisture sensors Listen As mentioned
    just above, soil moisture sensors can work as OFD. Of course, the objectives of
    soil moisture monitoring are more numerous: large-scale soil moisture sensing
    networks can provide information about rainfall, runoff, water cycle and ecosystems
    (Robinson et al. 2008). Due to the important use of soil moisture sensors in agriculture,
    there is a large number of off-the-shelf sensors now and some are very cheap.
    In the field of science, the most frequent expression of soil moisture is volumetric
    water content (VWC) whose definition is volumetric soil content (%) = [volume
    of water (cm3)/volume of soil (cm3)] × 100. There are several methods to measure
    VWC, e.g., gravimetry, time domain reflectometry (TDR), and time domain transmission
    (TDT). Two methods are usually low-cost (less than €100 approximately): ER and
    capacitance methods (Adla et al. 2020). Resistive soil moisture sensors, which
    are extremely cheap, have been reported as inaccurate. Saleh et al. (2016) report
    that resistive soil moisture sensor EC-5 show an average percent error rate above
    10% and is corroded after 1 month of use, which is a serious problem for continuous
    monitoring. Adla et al. (2020) tested resistive soil moisture sensors YL69 and
    YL100 with reference to a secondary standard sensor Delta-T ThetaProbe ML3 and
    concluded YL69 and YL100 are also not accurate (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of YL69 were
    4.13, 5.54, and 0.41; MAE, RMSE, and RAE of YL100 were 3.51, 5.21, and 0.37, respectively)
    and they cannot work as standalone sensors. As for capacitive soil moisture sensors,
    Adla et al. (2020) recommended SM100. There are also SKU: SEN0193 (DFRobot, Shanghai,
    China) (Akhter et al. 2018; Nagahage et al. 2019; Placidi et al. 2020, 2021; López
    et al. 2022) and 10HS (Mittelbach et al. 2011; Panjabi et al. 2018), and a low-cost
    TDR sensor VH400 (Bitella et al. 2014; Tebbs et al. 2019) which are reported.
    It is also worth mentioning the Chameleon sensor was developed and commercialized
    by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) for
    agriculture in low-income countries (Mdemu et al. 2020). Specifications of all
    the above sensors are given in Table 15. Table 15 Specifications of low-cost soil

    20–50 kPa (moist) and Red > 50 kPa (dry). According to the manufacturer, the Chameleon
    sensor measures how hard the roots of plants must suck (the tension required)
    to extract moisture. So that it does not need to be calibrated for different soil
    types. The sensor can provide a quantitative measure (based on resistance measurement)
    but for irrigation applications in agricultural production, a qualitative measurement
    is proposed (it can only report if the soil is wet, moist, or dry). Mdemu et al.
    (2020) reported large increases in yields of green maize by using tools like Chameleon
    sensors and implementing other changes, but they did not assess the performance
    of the Chameleon sensor. Table 16 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost
    soil moisture sensor SEN0189, SM100, 10HS, and VH400 modules given by the manufacturer

    gravimetric weight and ThetaProbe soil moisture sensor in fluid and four kinds
    of repacked soils. iSalman et al. (2021) compare soil moisture measurements by
    the gravimetric method and SM100 readings in two sites. jPanjabi et al. (2018)
    do a soil-specific calibration for 10HS in laboratory. kBitella et al. (2014)
    test VH400, in laboratory in three kinds of non-saline soils. lPayero et al. (2017)
    test VH400 in four soil texture types (loamy sand, sandy clay, sandy clay loam
    and sandy loam) with the reference of gravimetric VWC and output of VH400 was
    measured by FLUKE 117 electrician multimeter. Nagahage et al. (2019) report four
    SEN0189 sensors to have a significant sensor-to-sensor variability according to
    the analysis of variance (ANOVA). It is not sensitive to high mineral content
    soil. They suggest this is because SEN0189 sensors ‘operate in low frequencies
    and are thereby more sensitive to effects of soil textural variances and salinity’.
    The calibration function of SEN0193 for organic-rich soil is where P is gravimetric
    soil water content and p is mean raw analog-to-digital counts output of two SEN0193
    with R2 = 0.98. After calibration, at a gravimetric water content of 60–80%, the
    RMSE of SEN0189 is 5% VWC. Akhter et al. (2018) reported that after site-specific
    calibration (linear calibration function, R2 > 0.98), in 6 months, the max errors
    are 6.2 and 4.3% and correlation coefficient are 0.76 and 0.73 between reference
    value (oven-dry method) and reading of SEN0189 for two sites, respectively. They
    also use a one-way ANOVA test (Tukey''s multiple range test) to check sensitivity
    to the environment and report that soil temperature and measuring depth had no
    significant effect on the SEN0193 output. But the output of SEN0189 increases
    with an increase of the bulk density (if the bulk density is either higher than
    1.3 g/cm3 or lower than 0.9 g/cm3), resulting in statistically significant differences
    (p-value < 0.05). About SM100, Adla et al. (2020) report that using the manufacturer
    calibration equation, the average Spearman''s rank correlation coefficient (rs)
    between sensor readings and the actual VWC is 0.94. The average comparison of
    the precision performance of SM100 is 0.41%. Using a piecewise linear equations
    calibration function (R2 = 0.94), MAE = 1.67%, RMSE = 2.36%, RAE = 0.21. It follows
    an expected positive temperature effect (at the actual VWC values of 7.63 and
    18.38%, respectively, an increase of 30 °C resulted in an increase of estimated
    VWC by 7 and 2.99%) and is not sensitive to changes in salinity (R2 = 0.85). Salman
    et al. (2021) report that after site-specific calibration at one site, the RMSE
    values for SM100 changed from 2.68% before calibration to 0.91%. At another site,
    the RMSE values changed from 3.09 to 1.03%. According to datasheet, resolution
    is 0.1% VWC. Panjabi et al. (2018) report that their calibration function of 10HS
    is with R2 of 0.9299, where P is the soil moisture content in % by volume, p is
    the 10HS reading in mV. They use it in the field for about 2 years, but do not
    discuss data validation. According to datasheet, resolution is 0.08% VWC and the
    response time is 400 ms. About VH400, Bitella et al. (2014) report that for all
    soil texture types, three parameters logistic model fits data (VH400 output and
    VWC getting from gravimetric water content) ‘very well’ (R2 = 0.89), training
    RMSE = 2.63, validation RMSE = 2.61, and NRMSE = 0.09 in cross-validation (leave-one-out
    method). They also test its sensitivity to the environment, report that its output
    increases by 70 mV between 3 and 50 °C and that it is sensitive to small changes
    in water content but without details. Payero et al. (2017) report that VH400 responds
    linearly to changes in VWC for four soil types (R2 > 0.90). An analysis of co-variance
    (ANCOVA) shows that soil texture has a highly significant effect (p < 0.001) on
    the output of VH400. In general, resistive type soil moisture sensors are reported
    as inaccurate and easy to be corroded by water. Capacitive sensor SKU: SEN0193
    is very cheap but shows significant sensor-to-sensor variability. There is also
    a soil moisture development board named HiGrow including SKU: SEN0193, microcontroller,
    and DHT11 on the same board, which is reported of very poor quality (Flashgamer
    2019). Low-cost capacitive sensor SM100, 10HS and TDR sensor VH400 are worth trying.
    It is absolutely required to conduct a site-specific calibration before deploying
    these sensors because soil moisture sensors are impacted by many environment quantities
    such as soil texture, bulk density, temperature and salinity. Another worth trying
    sensor is Chameleon which claims no need to be calibrated thanks to its measurement
    principle. LOW-COST WATER QUALITY SENSORS REVIEW Listen As all sensors cannot
    be reviewed here, five water quality parameters are selected for review: pH, conductivity,
    turbidity, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Among the numerous water quality parameters,
    we chose these five ones considering the technology development and the needs
    related to stormwater monitoring. We note that producers and sellers of water
    quality sensors usually categorize their products into two types: laboratorial
    usage and industrial usage. We cannot find any unambiguous definition of this
    categorization. Usually, laboratory usage requires sensors with high quality and
    accuracy, operated under strictly controlled conditions. Industrial usage requires
    monitoring in a more demanding environment (temperature, pressure, electromagnetic
    compatibility, resistance to shocks, and lightning shield) and robust sensors
    which deliver data continuously over weeks, months and years with online transmission
    to a control room. Industrial usage is closer to what is expected in the field
    of in situ stormwater monitoring. In addition, we find low-cost water turbidity
    sensors which are originally used in household appliances such as washing machines
    and dishwashers. Therefore, in this chapter, we propose three categories: laboratory,
    industry and household appliances. pH sensors Listen There is an extensive literature
    (e.g., Zhou et al. 2017; Qin et al. 2018; Alam et al. 2020) describing the development
    of low-cost pH meters based on optical fiber, metal oxides, and micro-electro-mechanical
    system (MEMS) techniques. Their works are, however, only in the laboratory development
    stage and not related to low-cost commercial products yet available on the market.
    Commonly used pH sensors in low-cost water quality monitoring systems are SKU:SEN0161
    and SKU:SEN0169 from DFRobot (Harun et al. 2018; Saha et al. 2018; Nasution et
    al. 2020; Ilyas et al. 2021; Kelechi et al. 2021), pH sensor from Atlas Scientific
    (Faustine et al. 2014; Faustine & Mvuma 2014; Zakaria & Michael 2017; Bartos et
    al. 2018; Demetillo et al. 2019; Shamsi et al. 2020), pH sensor from Phidgets
    (Rao et al. 2013; Nazer et al. 2018), and pH sensor from SensoreX (Lambrou et
    al. 2014; Al Haji & Al Odwani 2015; Sun et al. 2016). Some papers only state the
    brand but no model. Common models in reviewed papers are ENV-40-pH from Atlas
    Scientific (Faustine et al. 2014; Faustine & Mvuma 2014; Zakaria & Michael 2017).
    Alumno et al. (2021); Baéz Rodríguez & Rodríguez Jarquin (2019) use PC2121-5M
    from Phidgets. Specifications of the above models are given in Table 17. Table
    18 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost water PH sensor modules
    given by the manufacturer and tested by scientific studies. Table 17 Specifications

    (2020) use the function P = (7-output)/59.16 where P is the pH value and output
    is the SEN0161 output in mV. This formula has been first established by Shahrulakram
    & Johari (2016). In Nasution et al. (2020)''s field test, the deviation between
    SEN0161 output and a handheld pH meter is 0.02–0.26 pH at around 8.0 pH. But they
    do not provide calibration details. Yuzhakov et al. (2021) report that its calibration
    function is ⁠, where is the measured voltage in mV, with ⁠. But using this calibration
    function, for a change of 1 pH unit, only a voltage of approximately 0.12–0.13
    mV would be necessary. SEN0161, therefore, seems highly susceptible to electrical
    interferences. A possible explanation could be that Yuzhakov et al. (2021) in
    fact use volt to record SEN01610 output. In addition, the number of digits in
    a and b is too high for measuring pH with an accuracy of ±0.1 pH according to
    the supplier. After calibration, its reading was ‘similar’ to the stationary pH
    meter OHAUS Starter 3100 which had a ±0.01 pH measurement error. Mahardika et
    al. (2021) use ADS1115 to measure its output voltage and report that its calibration
    function is where P is the measured pH and p is the measured voltage in mV. After
    calibration, the error is from 0.02 to 0.12 and the average error is 0.068. Akhir
    (2021) reports that using the manufacturer calibration function, in 3h immersing
    test, the error rate increases from 1.11 to 5.45%. In the 5-day in situ test,
    the outputs pH of SEN0161 are from 7.15 to 11.27. Akhir (2021) indicates that
    ‘SEN0161 can only be effectively performed in the range of pH 6–8 so that the
    sensor is not in optimal working condition’ but does not give any further explanation
    and test results. According to the datasheet, response time is less than 2 min
    and longevity is more than 6 months but depends on the frequency of use. About
    SEN0169, Moyón Rivera & Ordóñez Berrones (2019) report that its absolute error
    is ±0.1 pH, but they do not give the calibration equation. Saputra et al. (2017)
    report that compared to a reference, the average deviation is 0.0766 pH. The maximum
    deviation is 0.16 pH, but their reference sensor has less valid numbers than SEN0169
    and they also do not give a calibration equation of SEN0169. The authors of this
    review think the researchers mentioned above use the manufacturer''s Arduino code
    and calibration equation. According to the datasheet, response time is less than
    1 min, and longevity is more than 6 months with 7 × 24h use but depends on the
    water quality. Demetillo et al. (2019) report that their Atlas Scientific pH sensor
    ENV-40-pH output p shows ‘good’ results compared to the reference sensor output
    ⁠: with R2 = 0.9731. In their test, the maximum difference is 0.60 pH at around
    8 pH. They deploy their WSN system in two creeks for 2 weeks and do not mention
    any operation problems. The datasheet of ENV-40-pH indicates that resolution is
    0.001, response time is 1 s and calibration should be done every year. About the
    PC2121-5M, Baéz Rodríguez & Rodríguez Jarquin (2019) use analog-to-digital converter
    (ADC) of Arduino to read its output and DS18B20 to account for temperature compensation.
    When using buffer solutions of, respectively, pH 8.86 and pH 9.7, the value measured
    were pH 7.00 and 9.2. They think these errors are due to improper calibration
    but do not give any further results. According to the datasheet, trueness is ±0.09
    pH, resolution is 0.018 and response time is less than 10 s. This sensor has many
    usage cautions, and it is recommended to store it in a storage solution. There
    are already some low-cost off-the-shelf pH probes and interface circuits with
    Arduino and other open-source hardware. According to the available literature,
    after calibration, at least all these sensors can indicate the acidity or alkalinity
    of the tested liquid. But most reviewed papers do not report the influence of
    temperature on pH measurement. Further research could focus on the following points:
    (i) the true performance of ready-to-use pH sensors with open-source hardware.
    For example, trueness is reported very differently for different sensors, e.g.,
    0.1 pH for SEN0161 and 0.002 pH for ENV-40-pH, which is meaningless for sensors
    based on the same measuring principle; (ii) can these sensors be suitable for
    submersion measurements in stormwater for months? (iii) can these sensors perform
    at the expected performance with as little maintenance as possible? It is worth
    mentioning that there are some on-going projects on the subject such as the Setier
    project (Prost-Boucle et al. 2022). Conductivity sensors Listen Measuring the
    EC of water can indirectly provide information on the water quality condition
    or identify a specific water source (rainwater or groundwater for example) in
    relation to the increase or decrease of conductivity. In addition, total dissolved
    solids (TDS) concentration has an approximately proportional relationship with
    water conductivity (Rusydi 2018). Commonly used low-cost conductivity sensors
    are SKU: DFR0300 from DFRobot (Nazer et al. 2018; Saha et al. 2018; Alimorong
    et al. 2020), and conductivity sensor from Atlas Scientific (Faustine et al. 2014;
    Lockridge et al. 2016; Siyang & Kerdcharoen 2016; Bartos et al. 2018; Shamsi et
    al. 2020; Othaman et al. 2021). A commonly used TDS sensor is SKU: SEN0244 (Ula
    2020; Mahardika et al. 2021). Table 18 A summary of performance characteristics

    kUla (2020) compare SEN0244 with TDS meter. About DFR0300, Saputra et al. (2017)
    report that in 27 min of measurement and around 650 ppm, comparing to the reference,
    deviation is from 0 to 6 ppm and average deviation is 2.1 ppm, but they do not
    give calibration details. Rozaq et al. (2020) report that the calibration equation
    of DFR0300 is with where P is the salinity value and p is ADC counters of Arduino
    Due. Using this calibration equation, the error rates are from 5.7 to 17.6% and
    average error rate of DFR0300 was 9.5%. But they do not divide the calibration
    and validation dataset and their reference values are integer and DFR0300 outputs
    are with two decimal places. According to the datasheet, longevity is more than
    6 months but depends on the frequency of use. Othaman et al. (2021) report that
    for ENV-40-EC all the percentage differences between measured EC and manufacturers''
    suggested values are less than 0.02% and EC values are directly proportional to
    temperature (R2 ∼ 1). Lockridge et al. (2016) report that compared to the reference,
    RMSE is 1.35 parts per thousand, approximately 10% of the observed salinity range
    and outputs of ENV-40-EC-K1.0 and reference are ‘highly correlated’ (R2 = 0.96).
    They think this deviation is a slight offset/bias that is likely of a physical
    nature such as the distance between them (0.5 m). They also report that instrument
    biofouling is a significant issue during the summer in the field test, and commonly
    results in sensor drift after 3–4 weeks of deployment. The manufacturer claims
    that trueness is ±2%, response time is 1 s and longevity is 10 years. About SEN0244,
    Mahardika et al. (2021) use ADS1115 to read its output voltage and report that
    its calibration function is where P is the output of the TDS meter and p is the
    output of SEN0244 in mV. After calibration, its error is from 0.18 to 12.9 ppm
    in a range from 400 to 700 ppm and the average error is 4.896 ppm. But they do
    not divide calibration and validation datasets. Ula (2020) reports that at about
    820 ppm, the error rate of SEN0244 is from 2.54 to 0.24% and the average error
    is 1.89%; at about 400 ppm, the error rate is from 5.12 to 8.29% and the average
    error is 6.00%; and at about 170 ppm, error rate is from 0.47 to 7.39% and average
    error is 2.90%. But he does not provide the calibration details. The average error
    rate of the three experimental samples is 3.59%. There are two other interesting
    works we identified: Geetha & Gouthami (2016) used resistive soil moisture YL-69
    to measure water conductivity, but it is doubtful how long this resistance sensor
    can work continuously in water as aforementioned YL-83 and EC-5 are easily oxidated
    (Saleh et al. 2016; Dias 2019). Shi et al. (2021) built a DIY water conductivity
    sensor using two small stainless-steel rods with a simple voltage divider circuit
    (a resistor of 100 Ω and water as another resistor) and calibrate it comparing
    to a HANNA meter (linear calibration function in 0–10 mS/cm with R2 = 0.9871).
    At four sites tested, they claim that their DIY EC sensors have ‘highly linear
    correlation’ with a HANNA meter even though relative uncertainties are from 17.42
    to 31.12%. And they do not give temperature compensation details in test results
    and the longevity of their DIY EC sensor. In general, in situ water conductivity
    measurement appears promising. There are some low-cost sensors off-the-shelf and
    even DIY sensors can give useful water quality information. It is mandatory to
    compensate EC readings with water temperature and DS18B20 is a commonly used waterproof
    temperature sensor. Like water pH sensors, the long-term performance of immersed
    EC sensor is also unstable because of, e.g., biofouling, so a self-clean or self-maintenance
    system is necessary. Turbidity sensors Listen Turbidity is an optical determination
    of water clarity and total suspended solids (TSS) is a total quantity measurement
    of solid material per volume of water. These two parameters are related but not
    in a simple linear relationship. Turbidity is usually reported in nephelometric
    turbidity units (NTU). We found four low-cost optical turbidity sensors in scientific
    papers. They are SKU: SEN0189 from DFRobot (Ammari et al. 2019; Hakim et al. 2019;
    Hendri et al. 2019; Iskandar et al. 2019; Mwemezi 2020; Gusri & Harmadi 2021;
    Kelechi et al. 2021), TSD-10 and TSW-10 from Amphenol (Faisal et al. 2016; Camargo
    2017; Nguyen & Rittmann 2018; Valenzuela et al. 2018), and TS-300B (Yuan et al.
    2018; Angdresey et al. 2021). Specifications of the above models are given in
    Table 21. Table 22 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost turbidimeter
    modules given by manufacturers and tested by scientific studies. Table 21 Specifications

    NTU calculated from weight of sediments in portable water. cGusri & Harmadi (2021)
    compare SEN0189 with Lutron TU-2016 meter. dTrevathan et al. (2020) modify SEN0189
    and only retain its original LED and IR phototransistor. They calibrate the modified
    sensor with Hach turbidimeter (relative error < 0.5%) using Formazin calibration
    samples. And then they deploy the sensors in various water bodies for several
    months. eFaisal et al. (2016) calibrate and compare TSD-10 with a Hach 2100N.
    fAngraini et al. (2016) compare TSD-10 with a turbidimeter and test it in a river.
    gValenzuela et al. (2018) calibrate TSW-10 with a reference T-100. About SEN0189,
    Hakim et al. (2019) report that at 25 °C, the calibration function in the range
    0–1,000 NTU is where P is the turbidity of water in NTU and p is the output voltage
    of SEN0189 in V, with R2 = 0.9762 but they do not validate the relation between
    water NTU and the weight of sediment in the water. Gusri & Harmadi (2021) report
    that at 1 NTU, the error rate of SEN0189 is 31.37%; at 55 NTU, the error rate
    is 6.28%, and other error rates are less than 3.5% from 75 to 228 NTU. The average
    error rate is 7.7% but they do not give details about their calibration function.
    Trevathan et al. (2020) report that the performance of the original LED and IR
    phototransistor of SEN0189 is different so that it should be calibrated one by
    one. About their modified sensor, they believe that it is ‘accurate for all turbidity
    levels’, the actual changes due to temperature are ‘not that significant’ but
    do not give any details data such as calibration function and RMSE. In their 7
    months in field test, they find that their sensor is influenced by ambient IR
    and in some water bodies, the sensor needs to be cleaned regularly because of
    fouling. According to the datasheet, output deviation is less than 10% in low
    temperature, thermal shock, damp heat, and vibration tests, and response time
    is less than 500 ms. Faisal et al. (2016) report that at the range 0–700 NTU,
    the TSD-10 calibration curve is where P is the turbidity of water in NTU and p
    is the output voltage of TSD-10 in V, with R2 = 0.99. After calibration, its average
    measurement error is 6.51% but the measurement error is 24.63% when measuring
    at 37.8 NTU. They think this low sensitivity to low NTU is due to the fact that
    the range 0–4,000 NTU is mapped to over 0–1,023 digital counts and the IR phototransistor
    of TSD-10 is not sensitive enough. Angraini et al. (2016) calibrated TSD-10 in
    the range 169–771 NTU. The calibration equation was where P is the turbidity of
    water in NTU and p is the output voltage in mV, with ⁠. After calibration, the
    average relative error is 9.35%, and the error is large at low NTU (24.77% at
    169 NTU). But they also do not separate calibration and validation datasets. In
    their field test, they find that at a point, sensor output NTU is abnormally lower
    than others and think this is because the light intensity at this point is higher
    than others. About TSW-10, Valenzuela et al. (2018) report that in the range 0–180
    NTU, the calibration equation is ⁠, where P is the turbidity of water in NTU and
    p is the output voltage in V, with ⁠. After calibration, all the relative errors
    in 50 samples are in a range from 2.0 to 5.0% and the average relative error is
    3.86%. Camargo (2017) reported the calibration equation in datasheet is where
    P is the turbidity of water in NTU and p is the output voltage in V. Four sensors
    are originally used in washing machines (and thus already widely used): SKU: SEN0189,
    TSD-10, TSW-10 and TS-300B. Because their principles are the same, and appearances
    are very similar, we can discuss them together. Dedicated case-by-case calibration
    functions (linear to cubic depending on the NTU range of interest) are absolutely
    necessary. The reproducibility appears rather poor, may be due to the difference
    in performance of the LED and IR phototransistors inside them. Their resolution
    depends on the ADC that is used to read their voltage output so that an additional
    analog-to-digital converter such as ADS1115 is necessary. Their response time
    is sufficient for every second of monitoring. They are sensitive to ambient infrared
    light interference and temperature compensation is not mandatory. They should
    be cleaned regularly because of fouling. Their longevity depends on the remodeling
    work because they are not designed for field operation. Nitrogen and phosphorus
    sensors Listen We identified three commercially available technologies to monitor
    nutrients in water: optical (UV) sensors (>15,000 €), wet-chemical sensors (>10,000
    €), and ion-selective electrodes (ISE) (<1,000 €). It seems that only ISE could
    be a choice for ubiquitous low-cost sensor networks. ISE advantages are easy to
    use, fast response, no influence of color or turbidity, and availability for both
    ammonium and nitrate. Disadvantages are low resolution, accuracy and precision,
    ionic interferences, high instrument drift, and limited shelf life (Pellerin et
    al. 2016). Kotamäki et al. (2009) used a s::can spectrometer probe. Wollheim et
    al. (2017) used a submersible ultraviolet nitrate analyzer from SUNA. Jones et
    al. (2020) used Hach Nitratax SC Plus to measure nitrate in water continuously.
    All sensors are optical (UV) sensors which are not low-cost. Wade et al. (2012)
    used Systea Micromac C to determine the total reactive phosphorus (TRP), nitrite
    and ammonium. Yu et al. (2021) used a Sigmatax sampler combined with a Phosphax
    Sigma auto analyzer to measure total phosphorus (TP) and Amtax combined with a
    Filtrax automatic sampler to measure ammonium. The devices mentioned above are
    large cabinets and thus are also not low-cost. It is expensive to use a colorimetric
    method to measure phosphates in water and low-cost microfluidic and electrochemical
    methods to determine phosphorus in water are still in their laboratory development
    phase. Therefore, in terms of nutrient monitoring in water, the only current comparatively
    low-cost option is ISE probes to monitor nitrate or ammonia. Some ISE sensors
    are used: nitrate and ammonia ISE from Vernier (Rossi et al. 2015; Abu-Baker et
    al. 2016), Cooking Hacks (Ramadhan 2020), HYDRA (Menon et al. 2017), and Thermo
    Scientific (El-deen et al. 2018). Specifications of the above models are given
    in Table 23. Table 24 gives a summary of the performance of the low-cost nitrogen
    sensors given by manufacturers and scientific literatures. Table 23 Specifications

    al. (2016) use Vernier nitrate and ammonium ISE probes to test water samples from
    the Muskingum River. fRamadhan (2020) connect Cooking Hacks ISE probe with ESP8266
    and test it in laboratory and then use in five water station 24h a day for 10
    days. gEl-deen et al. (2018) design interface circuits to use Thermo Scientific
    ammonia ISE probe with an Arduino Nano, calibrated the probe by Orion/mV benchtop
    meter and test his system on a fish tank. About the Vernier nitrate and ammonium
    ISE probes, Abu-Baker et al. (2016) report that outputs are within the range of
    the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) results, but do not give details of
    comparison. According to the datasheet, repeatability is ±10% of reading, but
    depends on calibration. About sensitivity to the environment, the nitrate ion
    probe works in the pH range 2–11, the ammonium ion probe works in pH range 4–7.5,
    both work in the temperature range 0–40 °C and do not have pH and temperature
    compensation. The datasheet does not indicate a working flow rate and we think
    they can only work in stable water, and both interfere with some other ions. About
    the Cooking Hacks nitrate ISE probe, Ramadhan (2020) report that its readings
    are in the range 10.5–11.7 mg/L in laboratory test and this results ‘show good
    agreement with laboratory results’ but did not give any comparison details. The
    system is equipped with a sensor that was ‘functioning correctly’ over 10-day
    in situ tests. According to the datasheet, it works in a pH range of 2–11 and
    a temperature range of 5–50 °C and interferes with many other ions. The manufacturer
    does not mention the water condition when using it. About the HYDRA nitrate or
    ammonium ISE probe, Menon et al. (2017) do not mention any performance assessment.
    The manufacturer claims that trueness is ±3%, response time is 1 min, working
    temperature is 0–50 °C, that it can measure flow velocity from 0.1 to 3.0 m/s,
    and that its longevity is 4–6 months. About the Thermo ammonia ISE probe, El-deen
    et al. (2018) claim that the performance of their own interface circuits is ‘similar’
    to Orion/mV benchtop meter. They use three segments of linear functions to represent
    the relation between the electrode output potential in mV and the logarithm of
    the NH3 concentration, and claim that this curve is ‘similar to direct calibration
    curve mentioned in Thermo Scientific user guide’ but do not give comparison details.
    In their fish tank test, the ammonia probe is output 0 and they think this is
    due to the fact that there is no ammonia in the fish tank. The manufacturer indicates
    that reproducibility is ±2%, samples and standards must be adjusted to above pH
    11, and the temperature range is 0–50 °C. In conclusion, there are some low-cost
    ISE probes to determine nitrate and/or ammonia concentrations, but no true low-cost
    option exists now to measure phosphorus in the water. ISE probes are designed
    for specialized equipment, and there is, therefore, need for extra work to combine
    them with open-source hardware such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This undoubtedly
    requires a certain amount of specialized hardware knowledge. It is possible that
    some commercial pH probe adapter boards as discussed in low-cost pH sensor part
    can also work with nitrate ISE probe. DISCUSSION Listen In this review on low-cost
    sensors ready for ubiquitous stormwater sensing networks, we included off-the-shelf
    low-cost sensors referred to by open-source communities and scientific literature
    as systematically as possible. Various low-cost sensors, using different devices
    and methods in different environments, have been tested. There is to date no existing
    literature review dedicated to low-cost stormwater monitoring with a unified metrological
    framework considering numerous parameters and providing feedback from commercially
    available sensors. Performances of off-the-shelf low-cost sensors are summarized
    in six indicators: (i) trueness, (ii) repeatability, (iii) reproducibility, (iv)
    resolution, (v) response time, and (vi) sensitivity to the environment, maintenance
    needs and longevity. Of course, when building a node of a sensing network, according
    to the experience of the authors of this review, there are many other aspects
    that must be considered. For example, the built-in real-time clock of some Arduino
    is easy to drift over time. Most open-source hardware does not have shielding,
    which means that they are easy to be disturbed by external interferences. Power
    efficiency is also essential for outdoor autonomous systems. However, the global
    performance of the sensing node is largely governed by the sensor it uses. The
    present review is nevertheless positive in the sense that several low-cost sensors
    and solutions already exist. Low-cost sensors have been identified to measure
    continuously and in situ several quantities of interest for urban hydrology (research)
    and stormwater management (operation), including meteorology and water quantity.
    There are many low-cost sensors for monitoring air humidity, wind speed, solar
    radiation, rainfall, water level and soil moisture. But many of their performances
    and their uncertainty still need to be better quantified by means of further tests
    and evaluations. Water flow monitoring needs more creative sensor modules and
    system design, but they are not far away from giving relatively reliable results.
    Compared to meteorological and water quantity, water quality monitoring by means
    of low-cost devices is more knowledge intensive, and users clearly need specific
    skills, with adaptation to the water matrix of interest (stormwater in this paper,
    but could be drinking water, and river water). Reviewed papers do not sufficiently
    report repeatable examples with references to metrology literature and methods.
    For example, a comparison between sensors, even a traditional more expensive one
    used as a reference, is not equivalent to a true calibration. To a higher degree
    compared with traditional sensors, the quality of data generated by low-cost sensors
    not only depends on the sensors themselves, but also on the user and his/her knowledge,
    skills and metrological practice. This is why users of low-cost sensors and monitoring
    systems shall not only have skills in electronics and informatics. They must be
    trained in metrology, including measuring principles, indispensable periodic calibration
    and verification of both sensors and measuring chains and systems, and uncertainty
    assessment. Regarding the trueness of low-cost sensors, it seems that every metric
    in Table 3 can be used to describe this parameter. There are several discussions
    about its assessment: (i) many papers do not consider the trueness of reference
    sensors when they test low-cost sensors and give their results. (ii) Many papers
    do not distinguish calibration and validation datasets when they test low-cost
    sensors. (iii) Very different to traditional sensors, the output of low-cost sensor
    is frequently very primitive. Many low-cost sensors identified in this review
    deliver output voltage signals such as pyranometers, soil moisture and water quality
    sensors. It is better to use high performance ADC such ADS1115 to read their output.
    Using the build-in ADC of Arduino will introduce a higher system error (e.g.,
    Arduino nano has a build-in 10-bit ADC while ADS1115 is a 15-bit ADC, which means
    that ADS1115 provides a resolution 32 times better (iv) As the output of low-cost
    sensor is very primitive, there is almost no manufacturer calibration to adapt
    the output, which gives users more freedom but also involves more preparatory
    work in using the sensors. The trueness of low-cost sensors really depends on
    building a good calibration equation by users. For example, the output of the
    ultrasonic water level sensor is the echo time. Users can improve the trueness
    by compensating for the change in wind speed by temperature and humidity. (v)
    Some users use unsuitable methods to calibrate low-cost sensors: for example,
    pouring too much water into a rain gauge means simulating an unrealistic heavy
    rainfall event. Regarding the repeatability and reproducibility of low-cost sensors,
    some papers use pooled relative SD and ANOVA to check them. But many papers ignore
    these two important criteria. Almost no paper checks the reproducibility of low-cost
    sensors intentionally. In fact, this should be the manufacturer''s duty to ensure
    each sensor is calibrated in the factory. But low-cost sensors often involve no
    guarantee of repeatability and reproducibility, and this is the buyer''s duty
    to verify it. For example, the Pluvimate rain gauge has a mean bias of 13.9% in
    the reproducibility test even though we are skeptical of the test method. Specific
    tests of every low-cost sensor are mandatory before usage (as it should also be
    the case for any sensor), but this introduces another problem: when we plan to
    use tens to hundreds of low-cost sensors, testing all of them one by one is too
    costly and develop automated testing systems may facilitate this task but remains
    expensive. In many cases, users cannot test the resolution of low-cost sensors
    because they do not have the required equipment. There is a risk of uninformed
    use of low-cost sensors if users only rely on information provided by manufacturers.
    Indeed, some datasheets of low-cost sensors are of poor quality (insurance quality
    and reliability are costly). For example, the datasheet of weather station kit
    SEN-15901 gives different resolution values in different languages as discussed
    in the wind speed and rainfall sensors subsections. There is another issue as
    many low-cost sensors only deliver voltage: using an ADC with more bits can increase
    resolution in theory but requires a case-by-case adaptation. However, more importantly,
    the original analytical performance of some of the low-cost sensors is low constrained
    by its principle such as low-cost turbidimeter. In addition, some low-cost sensors
    have a higher resolution than the reference sensors used to test them. For example,
    the optical rain gauge RG-15 has a resolution of 0.02 mm. Regarding the response
    time, it appears that reviewed low-cost sensors can afford measuring every minute.
    In some cases, it may be better to read the output signal every several seconds
    and then compare to reference for calibration, or to calculate mean or median
    to improve repeatability. Very rare information is given about the sensitivity
    to the environment, maintenance needs and longevity of low-cost sensors. Some
    papers use an ANOVA to check sensitivity to the environment. Indeed, most low-cost
    sensors need retrofit to make them suitable for in situ application: enclosure,
    coating, etc. So, this is not only related to low-cost sensor itself. For example,
    air humidity and water level sensors with waterproof housing should have longer
    longevity. We speculate that all the low-cost water quality sensors discussed
    in this review will be fouled when immersing in stormwater and/or wastewater for
    months, which will (i) require frequent cleaning and (ii) reduce longevity. It
    would be valuable to develop a plumbing system that can automatically sample water
    and clean water quality sensors. FUTURE OUTLOOK Listen In one word, users of low-cost
    sensors should accept a trade-off between price and quality. The time needed to
    use operationally a low-cost sensor can be significant and lead to significant
    human resources costs: time to acquire the expertise, and time for prototyping,
    testing, calibrating, adapting, and assembling the commercial products into a
    ready-to-use monitoring equipment. There is another important task to be accounted
    for: connecting traditional sensors to open-source hardware such as Arduino. Facing
    this situation, we believe the lack of top-level planning really hinders the large-scale
    application of low-cost sensors in urban hydrology. Most of the low-cost sensors
    come from hobbies of open-source geek communities, school teaching needs and other
    initially non-scientific monitoring areas. This market grows and evolves very
    rapidly, with decreasing prices. It attracts the attention of the urban hydrology
    scientific community and an increasing number of stormwater management operators
    who would like to use them to obtain spatially distributed data and information
    allowing developing knowledge, modeling, operation performance, maintenance planning,
    and providing support for decision-making. But it is clear this was not the original
    intent of the developers of low-cost sensors. It would therefore be highly beneficial
    to organize the urban hydrology and stormwater management community like international
    institutions such as WMO. Uniformed international guidelines for the sensor production,
    interface, performance, calibration and system design, installation and data validation
    of low-cost sensors become necessary. This will greatly regulate and facilitate
    the sharing of experience and knowledge. Low-cost sensors are challenging the
    way we monitor urban water systems: they bring new ‘problems’ (related to any
    DIY component) but also open new perspectives (full control, large deployment
    and high spatial resolution of monitoring networks, low-energy consumption, communication
    capabilities, fast evolving technologies, and very high diversity of sensors).

    1 INTRODUCTION Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or Drones are technology growing
    increasingly with a huge potential used for offering different efficient solutions
    in smart applications in the real world. As the demand for civilian UAVs is rapidly
    increasing, which makes it necessary to integrate the use of civilian drones in
    our daily lives. UAVs are an example of an emerging technology that met the widespread
    need of the growing requirement of the application owing to its potential for
    diverse implementation.1 Applications of UAVs are growing exceptionally due to
    their advanced use in 5G and is considered as one of the Internet of things (IoT)
    components. The most important civilian UAVs applications are including delivery
    goods,2 quarantine regions,3 atmospheric sensing,4-7 access unreachable area,8,
    9 deliver communication service,10 smart house,11-13 monitoring traffic,14-21
    healthcare,22-28 and so on. However, UAVs are used to improve IoT applications
    such as data gathering from the nearest distance,29 public safety,30 disaster
    mitigation and recovery,31 and so on. The UAV classification, according to the
    civil applications, is shown in Figure 1. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    UAVs classification according to the civil applications. UAVs, unmanned aerial
    vehicles Moreover, many applications are required for UAVs collaborations to perform
    complex tasks efficiently in real-time such as disaster recovery,32 wireless communication
    for large areas,33-37 monitoring events,31 and so on. UAVs have the capability
    of delivering services and goods in real-time. The smart UAVs are capable of revolutionizing
    the field of communication providing novel advancements in a wide range of applications
    that are likely to dilute the risks and provide cost-effective solutions in civil
    infrastructure. To provide cellular network coverage, UAVs are used as flying
    global system for mobile communication base stations.38-47 The information captured
    by UAVs either in the form of videos or images is highly valuable and sensitive
    as it contains essential information such as global positioning system (GPS) coordinates,
    time, date, location, and so on. The wide applications of UAVs include data collection,
    emergency services, atmospheric mentoring, object detection and tracking, distributed
    processing, surveillance, and traffic monitoring. First, it''s enticing to be
    able to offer some services through drones. Second, these airborne machine''s
    mere operation, which relies intensely on their potential cyber pose a great menace
    to individuals and property.48 In disaster, UAVs have been widely used for collection
    of data,49 missions including search and rescue (SAR),50-57 triage,58 surveillance
    (urban,59 base station,38 border60) and monitoring,53, 61-65 imagery.51, 61, 66
    This study covers the vast applications of UAVs from military to disaster situations,
    thereby finding its way in numerous applications of the real world. To the best
    of the author''s knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to use the three
    powerful techniques [blockchain, machine learning (ML), watermarking] for securing
    UAVs applications. Although many works in the literature have been carried out
    in terms of UAVs security, none has used the collaborations of the powerful techniques,
    as discussed in this survey. This survey not only focuses on UAVs security but
    it also fully exploits the various advantages and disadvantages of the techniques
    in various real applications of the day today life. The research challenges and
    opportunities section guides the readers that by integrating these powerful techniques,
    the UAVs security can further be increased. At last, the future work mentioned
    this survey would pave a new way for researchers to improve the security of UAVs
    applications. The contribution of this survey focuses on the optimal techniques
    for securing UAVs in terms of blockchain, ML, and watermarking: We discuss the
    advanced use of blockchain technology for securing UAVs applications. We introduce
    the intelligence techniques, which are used for securing UAVs applications intelligently.
    We address the watermarking techniques, which are used for securing UAVs applications.
    This study is divided into different application scenarios in which UAV systems
    are being used, and the study shows how these powerful techniques can boost their
    usefulness. This survey article focuses on the three essential and advanced techniques,
    that is, blockchain, ML, and watermarking, for securing data transmission of UAVs
    applications. However, we did not discuss traditional techniques for securing
    UAVs applications because such techniques are easily inclined towards getting
    attacked. Furthermore, we did not discuss quantum techniques for securing UAVs
    application due to limit existing work in this domain. The rest of the survey
    is outlined as shown in Figure 2. Section 2 provides a comprehensive overview
    of the related works. This section also highlights the security of UAVs for improving
    IoT applications. Furthermore, it also emphasizes on swarm security for UAVs collaboration
    applications. Section 5 provides an overview of the preliminary studies that assisted
    us in our survey works. Section 6 provides a comparison of existing surveys with
    our work. Blockchain, ML, and watermarking for securing UAV are discussed in Sections
    7 to 9, respectively. Section 10 discusses the possible research challenges and
    opportunities in the recent optimal techniques for securing UAVs applications.
    Section 14 puts light on possible future directions for securing UAVs applications.
    Finally, Section 15 highlights the conclusion of our work. FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Survey structure 2 RELATED WORKS UAVs have the capability to
    deliver and sense in large coverage of locations, and therefore, they offer the
    advantages to IoT applications for improving smart applications in the real world.
    UAV communications have recently attracted great interest because of various benefits
    such as high mobility, low cost, and on-demand deployment.67-69 The authors of
    Reference 70 proposed a secure UAV communication by using the UAV trajectory method
    and traditional power. By contrast, the authors of Reference 71 applied secured
    commercial-based UAVs from security attacks such as Denial of service (DoS) and
    buffer-overflow attacks. At the same time, the authors of Reference 72 presented
    a biometric framework to encrypt UAV-computer base station contact. Once UAV is
    targeted, the UAV is sent to a secure “home” position by a security mechanism.
    UAV is not just like a miniature plane that can be remotely controlled but can
    be seen in different forms, in civil aviation or flying in military missions as
    integral members. This makes the protection and safety of unmanned systems very
    seriously. The authors of Reference 73 represented a differential game theoretic
    approach of an aerial jamming attack on a UAV communication network. The authors
    of Reference 74 implemented a novel intrusion detection and response scheme to
    detect malicious anomalies and behavior of the drones and accordingly categorize
    them in an appropriate list (suspect, normal, abnormal, and malicious) according
    to the detected cyber-attack. To overcome various attacks, the UAVs need to be
    secured.75-78 The communication between UAV to UAV and between ground station
    can be secured with the help of various security techniques such as blockchain,67,
    79-83 ML,84-92 digital watermarking,93-99 and so on. Security is one of the major
    concerns that need to ensure data transfer between UAVs and ground stations is
    secure. The various traditional techniques are used for securing UAVs, which include
    coding, decoding, quantum key distribution, and so on. Various cryptographic primitives
    such as hash functions, symmetric block, and media access controls are required
    (hardware related and very fast)48 for secure transmission. The elliptic curve
    cryptography methods could be used in place of Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman in
    establishing stable networks which demand a public key network. They operate for
    shorter keys and thus need fewer resources computing for signature operations
    and key generation for the same level of security. Public key algorithms are computationally
    expensive, which could cause significant delays that may be undesirable for secure
    drone operation. Therefore, it is necessary to use a dedicated crypto processor
    to perform these computationally expensive operations. The authors of Reference
    100 introduced cryptographic techniques such as one time password to provide security
    of transmitted data as well as high encryption speed even on the substandard hardware.
    With large and reliable networks, UAV communications require security and consistency.101
    In Reference 101, the intruder could compromise with keys and intercept communication
    leading to an infringement of privacy. In Reference 50, the authors examined the
    danger of drones that may pose a threat to data protection and privacy, whereas102
    investigated aspects of public safety, cybersecurity, and privacy in future smart
    cities in the context of drones. In Reference 103, it was proposed to use UAVs
    to increase a smart city''s sensing capacity, but the researchers'' advice a data
    broker for managing security issues and privacy about data sharing among subscribers.
    A secure communication protocol is needed for the protection of communicated data
    (namely, secure communication between smart objects and drones).104 In Reference
    105, the research describes many security systems that ensure data integrity so
    that it is not possible to alter data before or after it is sent. The cryptographic
    protocols are desired for the protection of the data because it is prone to malicious
    attacks. UAVs become invisible killers in their mass application to deliver goods,
    track the urban environment, and monitor investment projects. In the future smart
    cities, drones would be commonly used for wireless approaches, delivering supplies,
    and safeguarding smart cities. The authors of Reference 106 represented the artificial
    neural network (ANN)-based solution schemes for the major challenges in UAV-ITS
    communication and security. To provide protection of data and validation of entity
    to robot swarms, the introduction of new security models and methods could be
    applied, making them ideal for trusted applications.107 The various security issues
    that arise in the context of UAVs can be addressed as cyber-physical attacks in
    which it is categorized into data link attack and flight control and ground station
    attack. The authors of Reference 108 described an attack carried on UAVs that
    requires revelation, disruption, and knowledge capabilities. These attacks could
    either result in taking control of the UAVs or crash them. In the case of a data
    link attack, this type of attack is carried on the data link between UAVs and
    ground stations, in which an attacker violates the integrity and the confidentiality
    of the communication. The studies109, 110 shows an interception attack on UAV(AR
    UAV parrot quadcopter) as data link communication in which were not encrypted.
    DoS attack could be launched on mini UAV to halt their operation; such drones
    can fly up to 200 ft with relatively short flight duration. By injecting the false
    wireless commands, the man-in-the-middle attack could be executed. It can also
    be accomplished by the injection of false wireless control commands using the
    link into data. Therefore, the attacker controls the drone by blocking the communication
    between UAVs and ground stations. In the case of the flight controller and ground
    control station (GCS) attack, attacks do not require the data link. The intruder
    can access and exploit the internal system communication or produce sensed physical
    properties in the environment. Jamming of GPS signal disrupts the UAVs external
    navigation feed through putting UAV into a startled state. Therefore, UAVs can
    eventually crash. The spoofing attack on GPS can also be carried out by embedding
    the GPS receiver with a malware, which produces a different location from the
    one calculated by satellite signals. Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast
    signals (unencrypted and unauthenticated) lead to drone collision. Hardware and
    software Trojans both affect the ground control unit as well as a flight controller.
    The authors of Reference 111 introduced a software known as Maldrone (virus infecting
    civilian drones), which allowed the attacker to take charge of the UAV once installed
    on the drone. Trojans from hardware may be deliberately designed in UAV chips
    to bypass certain security mechanisms and may have catastrophic consequences if
    they are enabled. Table 1 maps the UAVs applications with use cases, requirements,
    and challenges. TABLE 1. UAVs applications: Use cases, requirements, and challenges
    Applications Use cases, requirements, and challenges Surveillance With many applications
    such as border surveillance and disaster surveillance, the design of UAV systems
    with secure and stable connectivity is imperative. UAVs are most likely integrated
    for use in IoT platforms for surveillance applications. IoT has enormous powerlessness
    surfaces that can build the vulnerabilities of utilizing UAVs for surveillance
    applications. Delivery of goods Secure and reliable connectivity is significant
    for utilizes case, for example, giving down to earth conveyance frameworks, and
    creating UAVs for delivery of goods utilizing IoT frameworks that permit to track
    and screen the conveyance procedure whenever anyplace. Utilizing UAVs for the
    delivery of goods is successfully incorporated with IoT frameworks to monitor
    and track the conveyance framework anyplace adequately. Still, IoT frameworks
    can expand the weakness surfaces of UAV frameworks. Infrastructure and constructions
    inspections For applications such as efficient long-distance infrastructure inspections
    and successful and real-time progress monitoring of construction, secure and stable
    connectivity is important. Security problems can be found in isolated areas in
    particular. In particular, communication links in challenging areas can be unreliable
    when using UAVs for infrastructure inspections. UAVs are highly mobile for inspection
    of facilities that can interrupt the transmission of data to the central server.
    Wireless and cellular systems Designing the UAVs framework with reliable and secure
    connectivity is the key accomplishment to utilize UAVs as a flying base station
    that can convey a wide scope of wireless networking applications. A productive
    arrangement of multi-UAVs for wireless system applications requires different
    complex tradeoffs associated with different UAV arrangement situations to be considered
    for giving ideal wireless coverage. Transportation Structuring UAVs framework
    with a secure and reliable network has a noteworthy job for a few use cases, for
    example, tracking moving vehicles at differing speeds, incorporating UAVs into
    IoT framework to achieve a keen transportation framework. Intelligent transport
    means a moveable target; moving UAVs can, therefore, lead to unstable connection
    links for efficient tracking. The implementation of UAVs in intelligent transport
    leads to high UAV versatility and dynamic network topology, which can impact the
    latency of data transmission to the central server. Intelligent transportation
    uses IoT devices to link all components in the networks efficiently and to monitor
    and communicate with devices remotely; however, the usage of IoT systems will
    increase the vulnerability of UAV systems by potentially requiring internet attacks.
    Healthcare and medical systems Safe and effective communication is highly essential
    in all cases of healthcare use, provided that human life cannot be compromised
    as a high priority. Utilizing UAVs for healthcare and medical services has the
    benefit of accessing places that are hard to access beforehand. In such an environment,
    UAVs may have unreliable communication connections, which can undermine their
    missions. Medical networks can be a stable framework for responding in real-time.
    Yet the trade-off in medical networks between security and real-time responsiveness
    is a concern. Having systems highly protected can lead to complicated designs.
    Conversely, providing highly flexible real-time response systems can lead to less
    secure systems. Abbreviations: IoT, Internet of things; UAVs, unmanned aerial
    vehicles. 2.1 Securing UAVs for improving IoT applications Due to the use of drones
    for sensitive applications, securing drones becomes essential to perform application
    in a good manner and a trusted way. Wireless networking technologies have developed
    quickly, incorporating a heterogeneous variety of devices from traditional smartphones
    and tablets to cars, cameras, wearables, and drones.112 Furthermore, the drone
    is considered as one component of IoT. By substituting “Things” with “Drones”
    while adding the same properties, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is considered to
    be an important milestone in UAV production. In the world of IoD, multiple drones
    combine during transmission and reception of data. The drones can be operated
    remotely via IP addresses through the internet. Drone and IoT cooperation may
    also offer a feasible alternative to tasks such as delivering humanitarian assistance
    and medical supplies to disaster-affected areas.31 Energy efficiency, ultra-low
    latency, reliability, and high-speed uplink connectivity in an IoT framework are
    key challenges; traditional mobile network users are not usually as crucial.113
    Figure 3 shows the security challenges in the IoT framework. FIGURE 3 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint IoT security challenges. IoT, Internet of things The
    article114 has addressed the various security challenges and IoT application technologies
    in the agriculture field. The most important issue to be tackled in the smart
    water management platform project is the multitude of IoT device behaviors. The
    article115 describes the organization process of communication that enables a
    multiagent system (MAS) to decide about their activities. In addition to the drone''s
    numerous advantages, they present major challenges and public issues that need
    to be addressed.116 IoD improves storage capabilities and encourages algorithmic
    approaches, which in turn allows cooperative training strategies inspired by ML
    and artificial intelligence (AI). In case of emergencies or public safety communications,
    IoD plays a vital role during network communication. Due to the limitation of
    IoT, such as battery-restricted, IoT devices cannot transmit for a long distance.
    To overcome such a challenge associated with IoT, UAVs represent the potential
    solution. UAVs fly closer to IoT devices; the communications between IoT devices
    and drones are in the small distance; so, energy is efficient and more secure.117-120
    Hence, UAVs position closer to IoT devices, allows IoT to link to the network
    successfully using minimum transmission power. Throughout much of their life,
    the idea of green IoT came about to hold sensor nodes in sleep mode to save resources.121,
    122 Furthermore, the authors of Reference 123 addressed the effective and efficient
    techniques for enabling greening IoT. The authors of Reference 124 introduced
    reliable communication protocols for drone-IoT collaboration for making city smarter31,
    125, 126 with improving greening and a healthy environment.122 For SAR teams who
    carried IoT devices for monitoring environment, the drones collaboration can provide
    support for IoT services via the transport of cameras, sensors, communication
    devices, and so on.30 2.2 Securing swarm UAVs collaboration applications Swarm
    robotics systems are intended as a significant part of both academic and worldwide
    applications.127 It is the new approach towards managing large numbers of relatively
    simple robots. The method is influenced by the systemic working of social insects,
    which reveal three desired features in multirobots: scalability, robustness, and
    flexibility. Swarm robotics while performing their duties can be used in various
    applications such as military,72-75 monitoring,76, 77 healthcare,128-131 disaster
    relief.132-137 Swarm robots could either communicate tacitly or directly.138 Direct
    communication can be accomplished through broadcast or direct messages, which
    mostly include infrared and radio frequency technologies for swarm robotics. Tacit
    communication involves interaction through sensing of other robots and their actions
    and interaction through the environment, which serves as a kind of shared memory
    known as stigmergy.139-141 Figure 4 shows the key capabilities and benefits of
    swarm intelligence. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Key capabilities
    and benefits of swarm intelligence The mobility of the swarm robot is rather unusual,
    but it does provide security in any mobile environment with some interesting features
    that may make it easier to deploy some security services than associated technologies.
    Determination of whether it communicates with a legal entity may be very necessary
    for swarm robots. The origin and authentication of the data involve an understanding
    of identity, which is a major problem where individual identity is undesirable
    within a swarm.142 In a robot swarm, security services eventually need cryptographic
    key management.143 Such keys determine what robots can be used by pairs (or groups).
    Once robots leave and enter a swarm, this key material may need to be modified.
    Thus, the synergetic and high-octane character of a swarm poses advanced challenges
    in management. It''s sometimes called intrusion when a foreign entity joins a
    network. Network intrusion detection systems are a tool for intrusion detection.
    The freedom of robots and the evolving collective behavior of the swarm makes
    it difficult to detect aberrant activity. If an intruder is detected, it is important
    to articulate the appropriate response using an intrusion protection system. The
    identification and protection of intruders look particularly difficult in a swarm
    of robots and need a personalized approach. Some applications are required many
    drones to perform required tasks effectively and efficiently at a low cost. However,
    communication between multiple drones is required in order to avoid collision
    and to control their speed and to fly to reach the goal. Swarm robots are revolutionizing
    in many industrial applications, from the production of specific materials to
    precise agriculture. With a significant initial impact on nature and bio models,144,
    145 swarm systems are recognized for adaptation to various situations146 and tasks.147
    In the advancement of swarm systems, distributed decision-making algorithms are
    indispensable.148-150 Several robotic applications are having to implement such
    algorithms.151-153 However, its provision on a large scale is still a quandary.154
    3 PRELIMINARY''S STUDIES Presently UAVs are working on everything from disease
    control to food delivery and more. UAVs have the capability of delivering services
    and goods in real-time. The smart UAVs are capable of revolutionizing the field
    of communication providing novel advancements in a wide range of applications
    that are likely to dilute the risks and provide cost-effective solutions in civil
    infrastructure. Only a few countries have implemented UAVs privacy and data protection
    regulations. Although the majority of UAVs are mostly used in security and military
    areas, the problems that are faced generally pertain to privacy, ethics, safety,
    and security. This rise in UAVs volumes raises more challenges such as increased
    air traffic, cyber-physical attacks on UAVs, optimized routes and the development
    of flight plans, and the emergency response and control of UAV swarms. Research
    shows that these issues can be alleviated with effective techniques such as blockchain,
    ML, and watermarking. Furthermore, Table 2 summarizes the predicted value of UAV
    solutions for several applications.155 TABLE 2. Predicted value of UAV solutions

    can also be deployed in unreached environments to provide a strong and secure
    network. Blockchain technology enables drones to be carried with cryptographic
    schemes to guarantee secure communication and reduce the security risk of industry
    applications. Blockchain technology is evolving Bitcoin-based technology, shows
    that by integrating cryptographic algorithms and Peer-to-Peer networks, a group
    of agents may come to a pact on a particular state of affairs and record it without
    the inclusion of a controlling authority. Although blockchain technology is in
    its nave stage, it is the capability to expand functionalities applications and
    exhibitions. Furthermore, blockchain is a distributed system that is supporting
    features such as pseudonymity, transparency of data, and so on as shown in Figure
    5. All transactions characterize blockchain are interconnected; single-node transactions
    incite a corresponding variation in each node''s ledger; there are a transmitter
    and a receiver; a public key is used for identity authentication, to verify that
    the transaction was made with the respective private key; and asset verification
    is not performed by the usual account balance, but by calculating all past transactions,
    no data is stored but is computed on an ongoing basis. Blockchain technology has
    been applied in many fields including IoT,156-166 economics,167, 168 medicine,169-171
    software engineering,172-174 smart cities,175-183 and so on as shown in Figure
    6. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Pivotal characteristics of blockchain
    FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Potential applications of the blockchain
    The six main layers that essentially compose a blockchain are data layer, network
    layer, consensus layer, incentive layer, contract layer, and application layer.
    The consensus layer is of great importance as it consists of various consensus
    algorithms that are required for untrusty parties involved in the blockchain network
    to reach consensus. Consensus between participants is the key to avoid the need
    for a centralized body. There are four main consensus mechanisms in current blockchain
    systems184: PoW (proof of work),185 PoS (proof of stake),186 practical Byzantine
    fault tolerance,187 and delegated proof of stake188 as shown in Figure 7. Many
    consensus algorithms exist besides these, such as Stellar,189 Tendermint,190 Ripple,191
    proof of bandwidth,192 proof of reliability,193 proof of elapsed time,194 PoA
    (proof of authority),195 and so on. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most common
    blockchain systems that use the mechanism of PoW. Ethereum also includes PoA mechanisms
    (ie, Kovan public test chain196) and several other cryptocurrencies, such as PeerCoin,
    ShadowCash, and so on, use PoS mechanism. To show the credibility of the data,
    the PoW system uses a solution of puzzles. The puzzle is typically a complicated
    but simple to check the computational problem. If a node builds a block, a PoW
    puzzle needs to be resolved. The PoW puzzle will be passed to other nodes until
    it''s resolved to achieve consensus. PoS system uses cryptocurrency ownership
    to check data credibility. In PoS-based blockchain, users are required to pay
    a certain amount of cryptocurrency when creating blocks or transactions. If it
    is possible to verify the generated block or transaction, then the cryptocurrency
    is returned as a bonus to the original node. It''s going to be charged otherwise.
    In the PoW process, much computation is required, which leads to a loss of computation
    resources. By contrast, the PoS method will substantially minimize the amount
    of computation and thereby improve the total blockchain network. The application
    layer is the top layer in the blockchain that contains the implementations in
    various fields of operation such as IoT, finance, AI, and so on. In this article,
    we also discussed the applications of UAV blockchain in the application layer
    part. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Consensus classification ML techniques,
    in principle, allow UAVs to generalize their findings to undiscovered network
    states and so can be applied to large networks so that they are suitable for UAV
    applications. Moreover, the convergence of AI integration and ML in wireless network
    technologies may use intelligence to solve different problems. AI is commonly
    used in automated systems. It has a wide range of applications, from aviation
    to healthcare. The convolution neural networks (CNN) are mostly used for adjacent
    pixels. CNN is one of deep learning (DL) techniques in which a model learns directly
    from texts, images, sounds, or videos to perform tasks based on classification.
    CNN is used in applications such as face recognition and self-driving vehicles.
    As a result, in various areas and applications and across network levels, the
    combination of the AI/ML and UAV seems strongly interconnected, offering unparalleled
    efficiency improvements and reduced complexity. Figure 8 shows the AI intrarelationships.
    FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint AI intrarelationships. AI, artificial
    intelligence Watermarking is an approach for hiding the data and has already confirmed
    its suitability for numerous multimedia applications. Generally, the watermark
    can be applied to different digital media or cover objects such as images, videos,
    audios. The main components of watermark are including watermark generation, watermark
    embedding, and watermark detection. The watermark generation process yields the
    desired watermark, which can rely on specific keys as a choice. The generated
    watermark is often based on an embedding key, is induced in the cover item by
    the process of watermark embedding. In the detection process, the watermark is
    embedded in the cover object is extracted and verified. The objectives of watermarking
    are classified into security objectives and nonsecurity objectives. Figure 9 shows
    various watermarking techniques. FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Classification
    of various watermarking techniques 4 COMPARISON OF EXISTING SURVEYS WITH OUR WORK
    Drones are commonly used for wireless approaches, delivering supplies, and safeguarding
    smart cities. In addition to the drone''s numerous advantages, they present major
    challenges and public issues that need to be looked into.116 IoD improves storage
    capabilities and encourages algorithmic approaches, which in turn allows cooperative
    training strategies inspired by ML. Besides, UAV communications need accuracy
    along with their protection with wide and stable networks. The survey article31
    focuses primarily on assessing smart cities smartness, that is, quality of life,
    environmental aspects, management of disasters, and public safety. In,48 critical
    aspects of safety, privacy, and security are provided related to the implementation
    of civilian drones in the national airspace. The study1 represents a blockchain-based
    data acquisition mechanism where information is collected using UAV as a relay
    and stored securely on the mobile edge computing (MEC) server in a blockchain.
    Designing smart cities has an objective to create a sustainable place where people
    can live, work, and play. The authors of Reference 112 examined different aspects
    of drones used in future smart cities such as privacy, public safety, and cyber-security.
    Furthermore, the authors of Reference 197 proposed the secure, heterogeneous,
    autonomous, and rotational knowledge protocol for swarms to ensure safety over
    smart cities of swarm drone applications. The authors of Reference 31 discussed
    drones collaboration for improving the smartness of smart cities. In addition,
    the security of drones collaboration for improving smart cities application is
    discussed in detail. Furthermore, the authors introduced ML techniques for drones
    detection of public safety applications, while the authors of Reference 30 discussed
    the drones collaboration with IoT for public safety in smart cities with considering
    quality of service (QoS). The authors of Reference 198 reviewed the AI techniques
    for space robotics communications, including drones. However, the authors of Reference
    32 discussed ML techniques for space robotics collaboration, such as drones collaboration
    based on connectivity, mobility, and QoS to improve swarm of drones performance
    efficiently. The authors of Reference 56 addressed CNN for near real-time object
    detection from UAV imagery in avalanche SAR operations. The authors of Reference
    199 addressed the security issues in the IoT system using blockchain for smart
    homes, smart cities, and smart everything. Furthermore, the authors of Reference
    200 introduced blockchain technology for swarm robotics, such as a swarm of drones
    for disaster recovery. On the other hand, the authors of Reference 107 introduced
    the security of cellular UAVs-based communication and data transferring. The authors
    of Reference 60 established general networking specifications related to scalability,
    connectivity, privacy, adaptability, and protection of UAVs. Moreover, the authors
    of Reference 106 aimed to provide a detailed analysis of DL or ML approaches to
    establish an elevated security line for IoT set-up. The authors of References
    201, 202 used watermarking technique for securing videos taken by UAVs. By contrast,
    the authors of Reference 203 used a watermarking approach for securing digital
    images in cyber-physical space. Moreover, the authors of Reference 204 used ML
    inspired sound-based amateur drone detection for public safety applications. Table
    3 summarizes the comparison of existing surveys and the present work. TABLE 3.

    aerial vehicles. In this survey, the techniques for securing the information (either
    in the form of images or videos) captured by UAVs include ML, blockchain, and
    watermarking, as shown in Figure 10. Since we know that the wireless channel is
    more prone to malicious attacks, therefore, before sending the information to
    the data and archival center through the wireless channel, the security techniques
    need to be applied for data encryption. Security techniques are essential for
    secure data transmission because data includes sensitive information such as health
    records, disaster situations, monitoring, or emergency situation. FIGURE 10 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Techniques used for UAV security. UAV, unmanned aerial
    vehicle 5 BLOCKCHAIN FOR SECURING UAVS APPLICATIONS Blockchain has been seen as
    a means of improving and monitoring the UAVs more safely, reliably, and easily.
    Blockchain technology can secure dynamically updated data, such as smarter contracts,
    hashing, consensus protocols, private and public keys, and so on. This is, therefore,
    suitable for very dynamic UAV applications. For operational purposes, the majority
    of UAVs applications require collaboration with other robots or UAVs, which makes
    them appropriate candidates for blockchain membership. To meet future needs, a
    new framework would be required to provide adaptability, scalability, and the
    ability to deliver efficient and rapid services. Blockchain technology is regarded
    as a way of creating a system that can be used in the commercial UAV industries
    to fix these issues. Blockchain types, including public, consortium, and private,
    as shown in Figure 11. Furthermore, it summaries the blockchain characteristics
    based on centralization, efficiency, and consensus process. FIGURE 11 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Blockchain taxonomy and characteristics With the increase
    in UAV air traffic density, there is an increasing need to monitor its travel
    and use, connect it with the air-traffic-control (ATC) network, by using blockchain,
    this can be easily achieved. UAVs can make independent choices on their flight
    routes by using their blockchain onboard copy, providing details about other UAV
    flight routes and ATC input data. Wireless signal interruption from the UAVs to
    the GCS can be fatal if the GCS commands depend on the flying control and navigation
    systems. For the entire system, it can be a single failure point. With a decentralized
    blockchain network, this dependency can be eliminated, and UAV network vulnerability
    for signals can be reduced. UAV networks, in their essence, are extremely sensitive
    and complex. An opponent UAV can enter the network, inject false data, or change
    the original data. The consensus blockchain system can be applied to counter these
    attacks. When any UAV detects illegal activities, it can be registered in the
    blockchain, and if the numbers of such UAV entries exceed a certain default threshold,
    a malicious UAV can be detected. UAV networks are vulnerable to communicational
    connectivity threats such as spoofing, DoS, eavesdropping, and assaults on data.
    Blockchain allows the UAV networks to encrypt information and store it in the
    blockchain such that it is not visible to someone without a valid decryption key.
    Table 4 summarizes the applications of blockchain in other developing fields.

    Smart healthcare 278 Smart communities 279-283 Due to the use of decentralized
    blockchain in network security management, the blockchain network itself is exceptionally
    secure.255 Individuals of private key sets are generally used to provide sufficient
    security against the threat of wild restriction hack or display of two customers
    generating almost the same private key. The authors of Reference 154 introduced
    blockchain to a UAV swarm environment. Furthermore, the authors of Reference 284
    proposed UAV registration keys to allow UAVs to send data to a cloud database,
    but a step forward can be taken for swarming operation in which each UAV is needed
    to login before being recognized as a legitimate actor in the system. Therefore,
    UAV Swarms could be effectively shielded from malicious attacks by blockchain
    technology.285, 286 The blockchain security stems from the fact that blocks are
    cryptographically connected in a manner which allows modifications to all successive
    blocks in the chain by changing one block. In the blockchain, each node has a
    copy of the blockchain, and therefore, the attacker has to change about 51% of
    the nodes in order to transfer false information. Hence, blockchain makes security
    harder to attack. The authors of Reference 200 combined blockchain technology
    and swarm robotics to provide novel solutions to entity validation and data confidentiality,
    safety regulation, collaborative missions and distributed decision making, flexibility,
    where each robot is considered as a node of network nodes and encapsulating their
    block transactions. Furthermore, the authors of Reference 183 proposed a stable
    blockchain-based localization scheme. The proposed algorithm took advantage of
    blockchain''s distributed and decentralized functionality to provide a trustworthy
    node and share information framework. To prevent malicious node fornication of
    sending a false location, the accuracy of the reported position was checked before
    added to the blockchain. More specifically, under the appearance of 50% of malicious
    nodes, the implemented security mechanisms reduced the localization error to 1/4
    in comparison with the nonsecure versions. The study280 shows how smart contracts
    and decentralized Ethereum blockchain technology are used to manage the communication
    between agents. In the proposed scheme,1 data was encrypted with the aid of a
    UAV before being sent to the MEC server. Analysis of security carried out to illustrate
    the feasibility of the proposed safe scheme. In article,80 the authors proposed
    the autonomous intelligent robot agent (AIRA) protocol for blockchain consisting
    of MAS through ensuring safe interagent communication. The authors of Reference
    154 introduced blockchain technologies (eg, Hyperledger Fabric) to provide innovative
    options for CIA property protection. Furthermore, the authors of Reference 287
    discussed blockchain applied secure communication, authenticate users, discover
    legit devices, and configure devices. Moreover, the authors of Reference 205 represented
    a blockchain-based vehicular network model used for allowing vehicles to identify,
    share, and build a vehicle''s network for generating value-added services. A significant
    amount of work has been conducted in the market for blockchain applications to
    improve systems protection together. Planned UAVs applications rely on heavy data-technologies
    such as cloud technology, ML, image processing, and many other complex information
    gatherings, processing, and sharing technologies. Blockchain technology will,
    therefore, be necessary to ensure that data in a network is safe and trusted.
    We list some challenges, which have been addressed and solved by the integration
    of blockchain in drones network. Table 5 summarizes the blockchain techniques

    FOR SECURING UAVS APPLICATIONS For UAVs to operate autonomously, ML has become
    an increasingly important AI approach. The use of advanced ML algorithms (eg,
    DL algorithms) will aid the UAV system to draw better decisions. DL will play
    a crucial role in the development of feasible solutions to these problems as well
    as help to make valued decisions, including accurate environmental forecasts to
    achieve the best from UAVs and avoid collusion in securing manner with the help
    of blockchain. In particular, DL is advantageous for extracting features from
    the raw measurements received by UAV onboard sensors.106 In article,143 a vision-based
    algorithm for the identification of armature drones used in the application of
    public safety is suggested. In order to detect the drones, a classification technique
    is used to extract the features from captured images. For classification, CNN,
    that is, resnet50 to extract features and support vector machine, was proposed.
    The proposed model was tested using 400 images with different challenges such
    as blurriness, occlusion, and variance in size, low illumination, and background
    noise. The authors of Reference 107 proposed an ML scheme for data sharing between
    UAV swarms in order to protect attacks. For a swarm of UAVs, federated learning
    can be applied to overcome this challenge. This will, in essence, elucidates the
    vulnerability of raw data transmission between UAVs and thereby mitigate the chance
    of adverse ML. The authors of Reference 288 represented the architecture of three
    prototypes for UAVs automated and real-time identification of power lines. Through
    integrating a powerful neural network (NN), that is, AI, and using suitable and
    effective sensors, the systems could detect various failures and defects on power
    lines with high precision automatically. Besides, the AI interface is encoded
    to the remote control (RC), making it cost-effective, with no big data storage
    space. Moreover, the authors of Reference 104 proposed a new framework to solve
    the small detecting boats in conjunction with UAV. UAV is used to send a signal
    to a server, in which NN was used to process the image and long term evolution
    as communication technology. The proposed system was described and involved security
    to ensure data integrity. ML can be used to develop and automate wireless communication
    UAV systems.289 Table 6 summarizes ML techniques used for securing UAVs collaboration
    applications. TABLE 6. Major contributions in ML for securing UAVs applications

    after it is sent. Used in case of emergencies such as SAR. It has been tested
    using the attribute-based encryption algorithm, while efficient algorithms for
    detection is required. Abbreviations: AI, artificial intelligence; ANN, artificial
    neural network; ML, machine learning; SAR, search and rescue; UAVs, unmanned aerial
    vehicles. In many socioeconomic facets of our society, the robots have made tremendous
    progress. In this way, intelligent robots have the potential to know themselves,
    to organize themselves, and to replicate them by themselves. Together with AI
    and robotics, a computer can perform certain human tasks. In future robots will
    be seen everywhere and will support people anywhere at any time. Efficient connectivity
    between robotics itself and humans is an imperative capacity for future robotics
    in order to achieve such an objective. The prospect for AI on embedded edge devices
    at mass is known as edge intelligence. Edge intelligence means to shift process
    from cloud to network edge devices.290 The authors of Reference 291 discussed
    various prospects and opportunities offered by edge intelligence. Therefore, the
    authors of Reference 204 applied ML techniques to compare the efficiency of the
    amateur drone detection system. The proposed ML scheme has a detection accuracy
    of more than 17%. In particular, UAVs demonstrate their functionality in increasing
    forest environmental monitoring for fire safety.292 Furthermore, the authors of
    Reference 293 focused on the application of ML for monitoring activities with
    a limitation according to actual monitoring scenarios. Presently, UAVs come with
    Wi-Fi and communicate with a hand-held device for control and video streaming
    (eg, smartphones). The identification of UAVs through wireless transmission complements
    the traditional mechanisms for physical detection. The authors of Reference 294
    introduced a classification framework to treat encrypted data flow as time series
    and extract statistical characteristics-based exclusively on packet size and time.
    Briefly, processing capture data closer to robots helps robots to take action
    in real-time and improve decentralization. Furthermore, processing capture data
    by using ML plays a vital role in improving the smartness of robots to perform
    complex tasks effectively and efficiently. Moreover, Table 7 shows the mapping
    and comparison of various methods and applications in UAV systems. TABLE 7. Mapping

    APPLICATIONS Watermarking has many applications such as copyright protection,
    source tracking, banknote authentication, video authentication, broadcast monitoring,
    and so on. To the best of author''s knowledge, we use watermarking for securing
    purpose based on image and video watermarking. Therefore, UAVs security is concerned
    image and video, and therefore, watermarking is the most useful technique for
    securing images and videos captured by UAVs. Image watermarking has pulled considerable
    interest in the researches for two main reasons, that is, readily available nature
    and carries redundant information. On the other hand, digital video plays a crucial
    role in the court of law as forensic evidence. The video files must be authenticable
    when served as the forensic evidence with the capability to detect the tamper,
    hence watermarking could be used for this purpose. Generally, the watermark generation
    and embedding properties include blindness, visibility, and capacity of embedding
    and similarity of perception. Robustness, blindness, probability of error, and
    so on are studied detection of watermark. Once the watermark is embedded, it may
    undergo many attacks. Therefore, to secure our data from the intruders, we used
    various watermarking techniques. In various digital signal processing applications,
    the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) transform
    has been widely used. Referring to the domain in which additional information
    is embedded, we differentiate the spatial and transform domain used for watermarking.
    Transform domain algorithms are more commonly used than spatial domain because
    the high robustness can be easily obtained in the transform domain. Out of the
    various proposed algorithms, the most commonly used are DCT304 and DWT305 domains,
    since joint photographic experts group (JPEG) and JPEG2000 (most common standards
    for lossy compression) work in these domains. The various other transforms used
    are one dimensional DWT,306 DCT in connection with singular value decomposition
    (SVD),307 DWT-DCT,308 Shur,309 Counterlet,310 Fourier Mellin.311 Whereas, in the
    spatial domain, watermarking algorithms rarely appear.312 The authors of References
    313-315 used the combination of DCT-DWT approaches for securing digital images.
    Whereas the authors used,203, 316, 317 used DCT for image security. Moreover,
    the authors of Reference 201 used DWT and202 used DCT for video security. The
    authors of Reference 318 represented an effective approach of electromagnetic
    watermarking that incorporated data in the target so that it was tested its presence
    at the incident. Thus, against all these possible attacks, the watermark is very
    robust. Here, we limit our survey to digital images and video applications applied
    for UAVs. The authors of Reference 201 addressed the issue of transparency, leakage
    of UAV captured videos by creating an improved video watermarking algorithm to
    conform to UAV metadata hiding applications. The algorithm''s imperceptibility
    and robustness have been improved to offer an optimum trade-off. Algorithm''s
    performance has been verified by its testing against different attacks and video
    distortions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated for normal size videos. Using
    big data and large files with video watermarking can be considered a challenge.
    In article,203 the authors addressed the security of UAVs in cyber-physical space.
    A technique of cryptographic encryption and a discrete cosine transformation for
    the encryption and compression of the image was suggested. These methods have
    been engaged in providing multiple layers of protection for the transmitted image,
    and the results have been seen to be very reliable. The proposed approach was
    resistive against statistical and brute force attacks. Thus, we conclude that
    using such approaches, the robustness, and imperceptibility of the images/videos
    were guaranteed. Moreover, various algorithms used were tested under various attacks,
    and the results concluded that the algorithms could withstand various attacks
    such as brute force, geometric distortion, and statistical attacks. To the best
    of the author''s knowledge, very few works have been carried out in the domain
    of watermarking for UAVs security. Keeping this in mind, we aim that this survey
    article will pave a new way for researchers to extend the watermarking techniques
    and advantages in the domain of securing UAVs for various applications. Table
    8 illustrates the various watermarking techniques and applications in the literature.

    UAV, unmanned aerial vehicle. The authors of Reference 93 used visible light communication
    mapping for metadata embedding in UAV video in which the peak signal to noise
    ratio obtained was greater than 40 dB. The article203represents the use of DCT
    watermarking for securing the images captured by UAVs. The cryptographic method
    is used to mask the content of the image before the implementation of the discrete
    cosine function. The discrete function is used to compress the image. The proposed
    approach can withstand various attacks such as statistical and brute force attacks.
    The total entropy and arithmetic mean of the images after encryption remained
    the same. The proposed method was successful for all images, and at the end of
    the process, there was no pixel expansion. However, there was a significant loss
    of pixel value during the encryption process, but it was insignificant to the
    image''s visuals. The simulation platform used was MATLAB. The authors of Reference
    201 used metadata hiding for UAV videos based on digital watermarking in DWT transform.
    The authors of Reference 319 represented a hybrid solution between SVD and combination
    of stationary wavelet transform and DWT to boost contrast in the low light of
    thermal images taken by UAV. Table 9 summarizes the watermarking techniques used

    8 RESEARCH CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES This section discusses the possible research
    challenges and opportunities in the recent optimal for securing UAVs applications.
    8.1 Blockchain Although the distributed nature of the UAV network has many advantages
    concerning scalability and autonomy, it also does pose various challenges, which
    require careful attention to the communication platforms as well. When incorporating
    blockchain and UAVs effectively and efficiently, several key challenges and research
    issues have to be addressed. We addressed several important challenges: security,
    smart contracts, privacy, storage capacity, scalability, resource constraints,
    adverse sensor information, lack of standards and regulations, and data storage
    cost. Security: There are both benefits and drawbacks to blockchains distributed
    nature. There is no single point failure to support a distributed network. Blockchain
    proves resilient against a wide range of security attacks, but their very existence
    makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack called a 51% attack (mostly on the bitcoins).
    A miner node controls more than 50% of the blockchain computing power and hash
    speed in this attack. This occurs in a UAV network when over half of the UAVs
    are hacked in an enclosure. Thus, a robust solution to enhance the protection
    of the entire UAV network is required. Smart contracts: Smart contracts are a
    computer code that is vulnerable in the absence of good programming practices
    to different security assailants. Testing smart contract solutions could be a
    step forward, and special techniques for this could also be developed. Privacy:
    In the UAV system of blockchain, every UAV has a copy of the distributed ledger
    that contains sensitive and confidential information that is passed on to all
    UAVs involved. The UAVs should give enough information to the other UAVs to navigate
    and operate properly. The limited sharing of information among UAVs is a feasible
    solution, but it is a very difficult issue for researchers to address well. Storage
    capacity: Blockchains storage ability has been under consideration, but UAVs will
    generate gigabytes of data (audio and video data) in real-time in connection with
    UAV communication. Blockchain might not be adapted to UAV networks in this sense.
    Therefore, that may be a constraint on the system proposed. Scalability: It is
    essential in the communication with the UAV swarm (group) that if the community
    is small, then the blockchain platform is well equipped, and transactions can
    be performed at speed necessary. But, if groups are large, it may be least preferable.
    Blockchain''s most common platforms, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, can execute
    up to 12 transactions per second. If small UAV swarms need to interact in real-time
    for synchronization of movements, a research problem might be the number of transactions
    per second. There are several new platforms developed to boost transaction time
    and consensus algorithms. Yet much more research is needed as UAV swarms expand
    daily in almost every field of a smart city in the future. Resource limitations:
    UAVs are low-computing weight flying vehicles. Nevertheless, blockchain requires
    a high computational capacity to perform smart contracts and consensus-based UAV
    algorithms to update all copies of ledgers. Researchers have discovered ways of
    building UAV processors faster and more effectively (in terms of power/energy).
    Therefore, the maximum time of operation from a restricted-energy (battery power)
    resource is extremely significant, since energy consumption depends on UAV movement,
    transmission, and internal processing. In summary, the application of these innovations
    by researchers is a long way from now, and several challenges must be addressed.
    Adverse sensor information: The UAVs are designed for data collection from the
    surroundings with several sensors. The sensors might be able to read adverse data
    from the surroundings, which could harm or misguide the UAVs. Lack of standardization
    and regulations: IEEE''s several successful initiatives are taking place in blockchain
    standards to make blockchain implementations future-proof, but it needs correct
    guidelines, rules, regulations, and policies. Newer implementations of blockchain
    would thus remain consistent with current ones. The creation of acceptable technical
    standards, policies, and regulations for the efficient deployment of blockchain
    in UAV networks, therefore, requires a lot of research in this field. Data storage
    cost: While blockchain improves data security in UAV communication, but also increases
    the cost of data storage. Many researchers claim that this challenge needs to
    be addressed. 8.2 Machine learning The recent developments in AI/ML technologies
    have opened up new possibilities for UAV-based applications, due to the development
    of fully autonomous UAV operations while enhancing performance, safeguarding security
    and reducing human faults in complicated and dynamic scenarios. Moreover, there
    are open research challenges that would need attention and should be discussed.
    During the operation of UAV-based distribution systems, security issues include
    CP attacks aimed at hijacking the UAV transmission and destroying or stealing
    its package. In addition, for multimedia systems that rely upon UAVs, disrupting
    the transmission of UAVs by modifying their identities could have a serious impact,
    particularly in networks that contain a large number of UAVs. Moreover, compared
    with single UAVs, a swarm of coordinated UAVs can perform missions. Swarm of UAVs
    interacts with each other during the flight to reach agreement on their particular
    task and, therefore, can react autonomously to changing circumstances. Nonetheless,
    this scheme of data sharing among a swarm of UAVs is usually vulnerable to adversarial
    ML attacks where an intruder may enter the swarm and modify their shared data
    resulting in nonharmonious movements as well as collisions. For a swarm of UAVs,
    federated learning can be adopted to address this problem. There are still a few
    problems in ML-enhanced PLS situations that are not addressed by the existing
    solutions. Besides, online learning in GPS-Spoofing scenarios will enhance the
    security provided by the NN, and unsupervised ML will perform classification before
    processing and delay reduction and enhance accuracy before processing. Future
    research should be dedicated to integrating these methods with the traditional
    techniques for detection, such as camera photography and video, radar echos, and
    acoustic recording, in order to further enhance the efficiency of current ML inspired
    detection methods. In addition, future research could also concentrate on the
    use of various types of UAVs with different speeds for the same studies, the study
    of the effects of interference and noise, and on the analysis of measured data
    with different controllers. ML has the capability to deal with big data for deciding
    real-time inside blockchain to control the chain. Therefore, security can be greatly
    improved and build better models through the decentralized nature of blockchain,
    which encourages shared data. For operating UAVs autonomously, ML represents the
    key role in aiding the UAVs to draw better decisions. For swarm drones collaboration,
    decentralization is required to avoid network partitioning that may lead to collision
    during the mission. Therefore, ML offers high security and reduce the costs in
    decentralized swarm UAVs collaboration.146 ML can judicially pick appropriate
    places for watermark integration to increase image/video robustness and imperceptibility
    boost.309 Identifying and mitigating threats in IoD pose various challenges in
    the research issues that need to be addressed through safe and effective approaches.
    The work on the frameworks for threat detection and risk evaluation strategies
    for IoD should be discussed. Optimizing and intelligent techniques are used to
    forecasting network changes for ensuring safer operations. For drones collaboration
    in any real-world application, reaching an agreement for performing required tasks
    is a challenge in an unknown environment.31 Due to swarm drones formation and
    update location is challenging, particularly in highly dynamic scenarios. For
    instance, swarm drones in the same environment at the same time, when one drone
    leaves the group for any purpose need or malfunctioning drone. Blockchain is a
    key technology to identify this drone and keep connectivity between others in
    high authenticate and secure.200 The noise in the collected data is also a revenant
    challenge, which may lead to wrong decision making in swarm drones collaboration.
    ML techniques such as classification techniques are required to identify specific
    and accurate data from hacked and noise data based on shared data of neighbor
    drones in the blockchain technology network.289 8.3 Watermarking Watermarking
    techniques can be implemented using various intelligent modes such as genetic
    algorithms, ANN, or genetic programming, and so on. The combination of blockchain
    technology with watermarking, which is known as Forensic watermarking, shall revolutionize
    digital rights management. It also monitors digital content and tracks required
    copyright transfer, content alteration, and other trails associated with multimedia
    data. Even though it has already been used but not to its fullest, it will pave
    a new way of improving scalability and security by providing secure and highly
    trustworthy privacy protection. DL will play a crucial role in the development
    of feasible solutions to these problems as well as help to make valued decisions,
    including accurate environmental forecasts to achieve the best from UAVs and avoid
    collusion in securing manner with the help of blockchain.106, 107 9 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
    This section puts light on possible future directions for securing UAVs applications.
    Table 10 shows the generalized research insights and implications for various
    UAVs applications. The future use of UAVs in long-term missions will help with
    a new lightweight, powerful batteries and solutions for energy harvesting. Moreover,
    edge intelligence can be recognized as a future for AI offering an increase in
    security and reduced costs.291 In view of this topic, the efficiency of the computing
    system and the processor architecture, as well as the efficacy of algorithms used
    in ML, should be greatly improved. To increase QoS, multi UAVs can be used for
    data acquisition.30 It''s very challenging to provide security for multi UAVs
    that could be a topic of future research. Moreover, the mobility of UAVs and the
    dynamic distribution of IoT devices during secure data acquisition must be taken
    into account, which may be subject to future work. TABLE 10. Generalized research

    insights and implications Surveillance The surveillance framework should involve
    unpredictable targets that may be needed to travel along unpredictable routes,
    tracking systems, and high-speed and accurate detection methods. Under uncertainty
    mode, machine, and deep learning algorithms may have possible applications for
    target tracking and route planning. Efficient data fusion schemes will provide
    the area to be scanned with diverse data and allow comprehensive scanning. Future
    research for this application should ensure that the scanned area retains its
    privacy, especially in urban areas or human-occupied areas. In particular, if
    the UAV is part of IoT systems, efficient security methods should be developed.
    Delivery of goods When developing UAVs for the distribution of goods systems,
    security issues should be considered. Safe systems for landing and delivery should
    be developed and applied. ML will provide methods to promote safe landing and
    goods delivery. Compared with other conventional delivery systems, the architecture
    of UAVs for the delivery of products should be economical. When designing UAVs
    for the delivery of product systems, the impact of different weights and sizes
    of payload on UAVs flight stability and other flight factors should be considered.
    The design and development of effective tactics will ensure that the products
    meet the exact address of distribution. Infrastructure and construction inspections
    The creation of successful three-dimensional representation schemes is important
    to enhance the research and the monitoring and inspection method. If infrastructure
    and construction need long distance, then network access must be maintained by
    the inspection coverage, ensuring that the correct inspection region is within
    the coverage. Multi-UAV systems that are integrated with technologies such as
    AR, this integration will lead to future applications in the inspection, distribution,
    and assistance of construction and infrastructure. Wireless and cellular systems
    Efficient network planning that can provide an optimum balance between the minimum
    number of UAVs is needed to provide maximum coverage for a given terrestrial region
    effectively. While designing, it is important to consider optimum management of
    various factors, including bandwidth, energy, transmit power, UAV flight time,
    and the number of UAVs. Methods for interference mitigation should be successfully
    established for large UAV application areas. Transportation The usage of data
    from many multi-UAV devices produces rich videos and images. To gain valuable
    insight into the transportation network, it is required to improve the quality
    of images and videos. For fast tracking systems, a minimum of event detection
    time is required. For real-time tracking, minimizing end-to-end delays is required.
    Various methods to protect privacy, such as the position of the car, activity,
    and vehicle description, must be provided. UAVs running in safe areas should be
    protected, especially smart transport systems that require IoT devices that can
    open the door to numerous Internet and cyber-world vulnerabilities. Medical and
    healthcare systems UAV security and its link during the flight should be taken
    into account when using UAV for healthcare applications. In health SAR systems,
    powerful analytic methods are required for emergency cases. Methods should be
    given to ensure privacy security, such as patient location, name, and records.
    Abbreviations: ML, machine learning; SAR, search and rescue; UAV, unmanned aerial
    vehicle. In Reference 32, future work shall be based on the use of highly sophisticated
    drone detection models and will also be focusing on new drone projects in the
    communications market. Drones shall be used more credibly for connectivity and
    security in future smart cities.31 It plays a crucial role in military applications.
    In Reference 80, upon the implementation of blockchain technology, swarm robotics
    exhibits a significant process. This approach will open new doors to the researchers.
    The market application also finds its base on the business models by dint of this
    technology. In article240 as future work, it can be extended by using Raspberry
    Pi devices to enforce the proposed stable localization scheme on a real platform.
    In article288 there are other changes left for future work, such as increasing
    the flight time by making use of UAVs with hybrid power supplies or solar-powered
    batteries, integrating route conformance autonomy and lidar-based geofences to
    enhance UAV protection and autonomy, enhancing cybersecurity by implementing updated
    communications protocols between the remote servers and RC of the UAV. The future
    direction in the domain of blockchain can be listed. First, as we know, PoW is
    the most popular consensus mechanism used in blockchain. But the waste of computational
    power is a significant downside of PoW. Ethereum is trying to build a hybrid consensus
    process between PoW and PoS to solve this problem. The research and development
    of more effective consensus mechanisms would play an essential role in the growth
    of blockchain.185, 196 Second, blockchain produces a vast amount of data, including
    contract bytecode, block information, transaction data, and so on. All the data
    stored in the blockchain is still not valid. A smart contract, for example, may
    delete its code through SELF-DESTRUCT or SUICIDE, but it will not delete the address
    of the contract. There are also many smart contracts in Ethereum which contain
    no code or the same code, and many smart contracts never are implemented after
    their deployment. A useful framework for detection and data clean-up is indispensable
    to boost the efficiency of blockchain systems.217 Third, the risk of blockchain
    leakage will become more serious with the growing number of feature-rich decentralized
    applications (dAPPs). The dAPP-Internet communication process faces all risks
    of privacy leakage. Therefore, some interesting strategies can be applied for
    this problem: application hardening, execution trusted computing (eg, Intel SGX),
    code obfuscation, and so on.68, 178, 259 In the case of watermarking in UAVs,
    the quality of images and videos can be improved by using more efficient algorithms.
    In Reference 201, further research and evaluation could be carried out with the
    help of government agencies such as police force using the drone or companies
    using the drone as a service such as surveyors, and so on. Evaluating and extending
    the algorithm for working in real-time videos is a clear prospect. With the proliferation
    of UAV content in both military and commercial environments, watermarking appears
    to be a useful technique for obtaining reliable and safe ways to add metadata
    to a previously redundant bandwidth. With this technique, the unused capacity
    of the signal is utilized.93 10 CONCLUSION This comprehensive review covers a
    detailed analysis of various security techniques for UAVs collaboration applications
    in terms of ML, blockchain, and watermarking. An attempt is made to provide a
    sequential way of understanding the various trends in these algorithms, which
    are used in research and development of UAVs or Drones along with their advantages
    and disadvantages. Results were drawn out of various studies to identify blockchain,
    ML, and watermarking algorithms for providing security in UAVs. From this survey,
    it can be concluded that ML techniques play a vital role in improving UAVs security
    intelligently, while blockchain is recent technology for decentralized UAVs and
    security. Furthermore, watermarking guarantees digital media to be authenticated,
    protected, and copyright. These technologies are used for securing UAVs applications
    in terms of blockchain, ML, and watermarking. This survey contributed to a better
    understanding of the blockchain, ML, and watermarking techniques for securing
    UAVs collaborations and uncovered new lights on challenges and opportunities on
    subject applications. As part of future work, this survey finds that it is challenging
    to provide security for multi UAVs and is one of the areas that could be considered
    for future research. Moreover, the mobility of UAVs and the dynamic distribution
    of IoT devices during secure data acquisition must be taken into account, which
    may be subject to future work. The authors believe that the critical research
    challenges and opportunities described in this survey will help pave the way for
    researchers to improve UAVs collaboration applications in the future. Open Research

    Abstract Reducing agricultural losses is an effective way to sustainably increase
    agricultural output efficiency to meet our present and future needs for food,
    fiber, fodder, and fuel. Our ever-improving understanding of the ways in which
    plants respond to stress, biotic and abiotic, has led to the development of innovative
    sensing technologies for detecting crop stresses/stressors and deploying efficient
    measures. This article aims to present the current state of the methodologies
    applied in the field of agriculture towards the detection of biotic stress in
    crops. Key sensing methodologies for plant pathogen (or phytopathogen), as well
    as herbivorous insects/pests are presented, where the working principles are described,
    and key recent works discussed. The detection methods overviewed for phytopathogen-related
    stress identification include nucleic acid-based methods, immunological methods,
    imaging-based techniques, spectroscopic methods, phytohormone biosensing methods,
    monitoring methods for plant volatiles, and active remote sensing technologies.
    Whereas the pest-related sensing techniques include machine-vision-based methods,
    pest acoustic-emission sensors, and volatile organic compound-based stress monitoring
    methods. Additionally, Comparisons have been made between different sensing techniques
    as well as recently reported works, where the strengths and limitations are identified.
    Finally, the prospective future directions for monitoring biotic stress in crops
    are discussed. Keywords: biosensors; hyperspectral; thermography; electrochemical;

    compounds 1. Introduction Global demand for food, water, and energy, with climate
    change and increasing variability in growing conditions, are among the key defining
    challenges of our time. According to the United Nations, the global population
    is expected to reach 9.55 billion by the year 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100 [1],
    and the demand for food is expected to increase anywhere between 59% to 98% by
    2050 [2]. Considering the unpredictability in climate, reduced land fertility
    from drought, erosion, and poor management, and agriculture’s impact on the environment
    and the ever-increasing public expectation for implementing sustainable practices,
    achieving sustainability in agriculture has never been more important. In order
    to achieve the agricultural output goals in a sustainable fashion, we not only
    need to improve crop production efficiency through precision resource management
    but also reduce yield losses due to stresses in plants. Presently, an estimated
    average of 21.5% of wheat, 30% of rice, 22.5% of maize, 17.2% of potato, and 21.4%
    of soybean yields are lost due to pests and diseases, globally [3]. Overall, an
    estimated 20% to 40% of all crop yield losses are caused by pests and plant pathogens
    (phytopathogens), worldwide [4]. Losses of staple food crops such as, rice, wheat,
    maize, and potatoes directly impact food security and nutrition, while losses
    in key commodity crops such as fruits, nuts, and flowers have major impact ranging
    from household to national economies. Additionally, the threat of plant pests
    and diseases are increased by climate fluctuations causing additional hindrance
    towards achieving sustainability in agriculture. Therefore, reduction in crop
    losses will prove to be a major part of boosting agricultural efficiency, and
    will require significant efforts towards improved management of pathogenic and
    pest related stresses in plants. Traditionally, biotic attacks on crops are determined
    through manual visual inspections based on physiological signatures such as lesions,
    tumors, wilting, stunted growth, discolorations, and cell death. At that stage,
    the majority of the damage has already occurred, leaving little to no room for
    treatments. Alternatively, based on prior knowledge and/or rule of thumb, growers
    may apply agrochemicals like, pesticides, fungicides, or bactericides to prevent
    pest and/or phytopathogenic damages, however, the application is not optimized
    and often the chemicals are used in excess leading to environmental contamination
    as well as economic stress. Therefore, identifying stress responses in plants
    in a timely manner is of critical importance with direct impact on yield, food
    security, agricultural economics, and the environment. The progress made towards
    understanding the defense mechanisms in plants, from the moment of coming in contact
    with a stressor to expressing physiological measures and effects, has paved the
    way for developing sensing techniques for crop health management to improve the
    sustainability of agroecosystems. Methodologies enabling early and accurate detection
    of plant stress due to pathogens and pests provide a way for optimal deployment
    of countermeasures for reducing of losses in yield. Our group has been pursuing
    agriculture sensor design for soil [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17] and plant
    health [18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26], modeling for soil moisture/nutrients and
    plant growth dynamics [27,28], and decision-making for irrigation and fertilization
    for over a decade [27,29]. This article aims to present the current state of the
    sensing methodologies applied towards stress detection in plants caused by pests/insects
    and phytopathogens, while discussing the gap in technologies which may, in the
    future, help reduce crop yield losses bringing us closer to achieving sustainability
    in agriculture. Figure 1 shows an outline of the methodologies discussed in this
    article. The paper is organized into several sections: Section 1 provides the
    introduction, whereas Section 2 addresses the question: how do plants respond
    to stress? Section 3 discusses sensing methods developed for detecting pathogenic
    stresses in plants; Section 4 describes the methods applied towards the determination
    of pest attacks in crops; Section 5 discusses methods for volatile organic compound
    emissions as an indicator of biotic stress; Section 6 focuses on the application
    of active remote sensing technologies for detecting biotic stress in plants. Section
    7 presents discussion and conclusion while Section 8 focuses on the future of
    biotic stress monitoring in plants. Figure 1. An outline of the plant biotic stress
    sensing methodologies discussed in this article. 2. How Do Plants Respond to Stress?
    Plants are constantly exposed to the ever-varying elements of nature, and have
    evolved unique mechanisms for detecting and responding to different types of stress.
    Stress in plants can be defined as any unfavorable condition that causes significant
    disruptions in the plant’s “normal” metabolism, growth, and development processes.
    Stress can be caused by biotic or living agents such as, fungi, bacteria, oomycetes,
    viruses, pests, or by abiotic or environmental factors such as, drought, nutrient
    deficiency, extreme temperatures, radiation, and pollution. As compared to animals,
    plants have evolved a less intricate but effective immune system. Plant defenses
    can be broadly classified into two categories: (i) physical defenses that include
    preformed barriers like, bark, plant cell walls, waxy cuticles, trichomes, thorns,
    spines, and thicker leaves, and (ii) induced defenses such as, accumulation of
    signaling hormones, production of toxic chemicals, release of attacker deterring
    volatile organic compounds, and deliberate cell suicide. Defense responses in
    plants are tightly regulated by complex signaling pathways depending on stimulus
    perception as there is high energy cost and nutrient requirements associated with
    them. This article focuses primarily on the sensing methodologies developed in
    agriculture for monitoring diseases and stress caused due to biotic aggressors—pathogens
    and pests. A recent article by our group provided a comprehensive survey of soil
    moisture and nutrient sensing that cover the key abiotic sources of stress [19].
    This section presents an overview of the responses of biotic stresses in plants
    that enables the development of technologies to detect them. Figure 2 presents
    a brief overview of the recognition mechanisms against phytopathogen and pest/insect
    attacks in plants resulting in the onset of induced defenses and hormone signaling.
    Figure 2. Recognition mechanisms of biotic stresses due to phytopathogens and
    pests. Reprinted from [30], Copyright (2012), with permission from Elsevier. MAMPs,
    PAMPs, DAMPs, and HAMPS refer to microbe-, pathogen-, damage-, and herbivore-associated
    molecular patterns, respectively; PRRs are pattern recognition receptors; PTI/ETI
    and HTI refer to PAMP/effector- and herbivore-triggered immunity, respectively;
    WIR refers to wound-induced resistance; uncharacterized elements are indicated
    by broken lines. 2.1. Responses against Phytopathogens Phytopathogens can be divided
    into three main categories: (i) biotrophs, these pathogens feed silently on the
    living tissue, extracting nutrients gradually while keeping their host plants
    alive and functioning; (ii) necrotrophs overwhelm the plants defenses by producing
    toxins and tissue-degrading enzymes, feeding on the dead tissue resulting in rapid
    loss of nutrients from the host; (iii) hemibiotrophs, these pathogens act as biotrophic
    during initial stages of infection, but turn necrotrophic in later stages of the
    disease [31]. Subsequent to the physical defense barriers, the next line of active
    resistance comes from the induced innate immunity in plants, also known as basal
    resistance. This occurs at the plant cell surface when pathogen- or microbe-associated
    molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs) such as, specific proteins, liposaccharides,
    𝛽 -glucans, chitin, pepetidoglycans and bacterial flagellin, which are commonly
    found on the microbes, are detected on the host (plant) cell surface through special
    trans-membrane proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [32,33]. PAMP/effector-triggered
    immunity (PTI/ETI) is considered to be responsible for non-host specific resistance,
    occurring at or above the species level [34]. Refs. [32,35,36] studied physiological
    responses, local to attack-site, under PTI/ETI that include increase in Ca 2+
    concentration, plant cell membrane adaptations, production of reactive oxygen
    species (ROS), and cell wall fortification. Adapted pathogens can tackle PTI by
    injecting effector molecules, which are microbe-produced proteins/toxins, that
    can suppress the function of host immune regulators, promoting pathogen virulence.
    For example, Pseudomonas syringae (P. syringae) strains contain dozens of such
    effectors like, AvrPto1 of P. syringae, that have been shown to promote pathogen
    virulence by suppressing immune-related proteins in tomato plant [32]. In response,
    plants have developed intracellular immune receptors known as resistance (R) proteins
    that can activate effector-triggered immunity. This second level of immunity is
    commonly characterized by hypersensitive response (HR) which is typically associated
    with programmed cell death at/near the infection site to prevent further pathogen
    transport to other parts of the plant, as well as the production of antimicrobial
    molecules. In contrast to the PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), effector-triggered
    immunity (ETI) is specific to a microbe. Fungi, bacteria, viruses, and microscopic
    nematodes are all subject to induction of HR. A local HR response can also trigger
    immunity against future infections for an extended period of time, this phenomenon
    has been termed as, systemic acquired resistance (SAR) by A. Frank Ross in 1961,
    who discovered it for tobacco plants infected with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)
    [37]. SAR represents a long-lasting, broad spectrum immune response, where resources
    are mobilized throughout the plant for taking quick measures in case of any future
    attacks. Moving immune signals play a critical role in SAR, and understanding
    the signaling mechanisms related to SAR is a major area of research. These signals
    are generated in the infected tissue and are rapidly transported to other parts
    of the plant. The onset of SAR is accompanied by the accumulation of signaling
    plant hormones or phytohormones, major among which include, salicylic acid (SA),
    jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and Abscisic acid (ABA) [32,38]. In general,
    it has been established that phytohormone signaling mediated by ABA promotes abiotic
    stress tolerance while SA promotes biotic stress tolerance [39]. Additionally,
    SA mediated responses have been linked primarily with biotrophic phytopathogen
    attacks whereas JA/ET hormone signaling have been associated with necrotrophic
    phytopathogens and pest attacks [40,41]. Moreover, molecular crosstalk exists
    between the different hormone signaling mechanisms, where under abiotic stress,
    ABA-based defenses suppress signaling of biotic stress-related phytohormones [39].
    Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates mutually antagonistic relation between
    SA- and JA/ET-mediated pathways [38,41]. 2.2. Responses against Herbivorous Pests/Insects
    Plants have evolved specific defense mechanisms to recognize and respond to herbivorous
    pest/insect attacks which include physical barriers such as waxy cuticle, trichomes
    (often toxic), spines/thorns, and hardened leaves, plus the induced defenses which
    are generally triggered by mechanical damage to the plant tissue. Plants can distinguish
    between general wounding and insect feeding based on the presence of elicitors
    contained in the saliva of insects [31]. Similar to PTI/ETI in case of phytopathogens,
    herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) which are insect-derived compounds
    are recognized by receptors on the attack site which leads to herbivore-triggered
    immunity (HTI). Additionally, wounding leads to the release of damage-associated
    molecular patterns (DAMPs) resulting in wound-induced resistance (WIR) [30,34].
    Pests not only cause physical damage to the plant tissue but also act as vectors
    for diseases while providing entry points for carrier phytopathogens through wounds.
    Clear identification of HTI and WIR trigger mechanisms is an active area of research,
    where several studies have been conducted to distinguish HTI (based on insect
    secretions) and WIR (self triggered) [30]. HTI/WIR responses include increased
    to calcium signaling, and release of ROS and deterring chemicals/toxins; their
    detailed roles and mechanisms are described in [36]. Most herbivores inflict much
    greater cell damage than simple phloem feeders, and activate hormone signaling,
    where resistance traits are induced by largely JA/ET pathways. Systemic signaling
    via the vascular system induces defense throughout the plant, similar to the phenomenon
    of induced SAR after pathogen attack. The broad spectrum of defense responses
    induced by hormone signaling pathways include antioxidative enzymes, proteinase
    inhibitors (PIs), and released volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including monoterpenoids,
    sesquiterpenoids, and homoterpenoids that have been known to repel harmful insects
    and attract beneficial predators [31,36]. 3. Methodologies for Sensing Pathogenic
    Fragment/Stress in Plants Sensing methodologies for pathogenic disease detection
    in plants can be classified into two broad categories: Direct versus indirect
    methods. Table 1 presents a general qualitative comparison between the key microbial
    stress detection methods in plants. Detailed comparisons wherever necessary among
    various methods are presented in the subsequent sections. Table 1. Brief comparison
    of the direct sensing methods discussed in this article for monitoring phytopathogenic
    stress in plants. 3.1. Direct Pathogen Detection Methods Direct detection methods
    refer to the techniques where the pathogens are identified directly as a way of
    sensing for diseases. These methods are most commonly used in the laboratory setting
    for high-throughput analysis, but have also recently been reported for use in
    portable and/or in-field sensing applications. Direct phytopathogen detection
    methods discussed in this article can be largely classified into two categories:
    nucleic acid-based methods, and serological/immunological methods. Nucleic acid-based
    methods use various forms of deoxyribonucleic acid or ribonucleic acid (DNA/RNA)
    recognition techniques to identify the disease causing micro-organisms. In general,
    these techniques work by selective amplification and subsequent detection of the
    target DNA. Common amplification choice in nucleic acid based methods include
    polymerase chain reaction (PCR), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), loop-mediated
    isothermal amplification (LAMP), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA),
    and helicase-dependent amplification (HDA). Among these, PCR is the most established
    method and requires thermal cycling for DNA/RNA amplification whereas RPA, LAMP,
    NASBA, and HDA are contemporary methods that operate under isothermal conditions
    while using specific enzyme cocktails for DNA/RNA amplification. Serological/immunological
    methods rely on identifying pathogen specific bio-molecules (antigens). The immune
    reaction in plants (host) is triggered based on the recognition of an invader
    through the ability of specific host proteins (antibodies) to bind to unique pathogen
    proteins (antigens). Following the similar principle of recognition, serological
    methods operate by extracting serum from the infected plant tissue and testing
    for antigens related to pathogens using specific antibodies. Key serological methods
    include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), lateral flow immunoassays,
    and antibody-based biosensors/immunosensors. 3.1.1. PCR-Based Methods PCR is a
    versatile tool that was developed by Kerry B. Mullis for which he was awarded
    the Nobel prize in 1993 [51]. It has since been used extensively in diagnostics
    to detect diseases through pathogen identification by rapidly synthesizing millions
    of copies of specific DNA sequences. As shown in Figure 3, the process begins
    by separating the extracted double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into two single-stranded
    DNA (ssDNA) molecules by heating to 95 ∘ C, the temperature is then reduced to
    40–65 ∘ C allowing for the binding of the primers at each end of the target ssDNA’s
    region to be amplified [52]. The primers are short pieces of ssDNA which bind
    specifically to the target DNA sequence by complementary base paring. Finally,
    the complementary strand to the target sequence in the ssDNA sandwiched between
    the primers is generated at around 72 ∘ C using the thermostable enzyme, DNA polymerase,
    and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). In this way after each cycle the
    number of copies of the target DNA sequence are doubled, and in a few hours, millions
    of such copies can be generated. The overall process requires only a few ingredients
    (DNA, buffer, dNTPs, primers and DNA polymerase) and a programmable heating block
    forming the majority of a PCR machine. Figure 3. General steps involved in nucleic
    acid amplification-based phytopathogen detection. The amplified DNA can be detected
    using methods like gel electrophoresis (most commonly used), colorimetric assays,
    and fluorometric assays. Over time, several advances have been made to the basic
    PCR such as, (i) reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that extends the application
    for replicating RNA by reverse transcribing the RNA templates with the enzyme
    reverse transcriptase to produce complementary DNA, (ii) nested-PCR (n-PCR) that
    improves the sensitivity and specificity through a second PCR reaction using primers
    that recognize a region within the PCR product amplified by the first set [52],
    (iii) multiplexed PCR (m-PCR) where several PCR primers are used in the same reaction
    to identify multiple pathogens, and (iv) quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).Standard
    PCR is not inherently quantitative and may not correctly represent the concentration
    of the target DNA originally present, however, qPCR has emerged as a successful
    technique widely used in laboratory-based as well as portable applications for
    pathogen detection. This technique monitors the amplification of the target DNA
    in real-time via a target-specific fluorescent signal which can also be used for
    quantification. Sample preparation and DNA extraction for PCR molecular analysis
    are critical steps that require precise procedures for reproducible results. Figure
    4 shows a comparison between the standard conventional DNA extraction techniques
    versus a recently reported micro-needle-based approach. According to the extracted
    genomes, RNA, ssDNA or dsDNA, specific protocols for PCR analysis have been designed
    for use in commercial as well as research applications [53,54]. Some of the commonly
    used commercially available PCR kits include, DNeasy and RNeasy Plant System from
    Qiagen, Ultra Clean Plant RNA, DNA isolation kits from MoBio, and the Easy-DNA
    Extraction kit and Extract-N-Amp Plant PCR kit from Sigma Aldrich [55]. In addition
    to the specific sample preparation and DNA/RNA extraction protocols, accurate
    design of primers, oligonucleotides, and probes also play a critical role in molecular
    detection methods for sensing plant pathogens. Functional target sequences can
    be found using the databases such as GenBank® nucleotide sequence search program
    provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda,
    MD, USA). Figure 4. DNA extraction procedures for nucleic acid-based methods,

    (2019) American Chemical Society. PCR-based methods are among the most commonly
    used techniques in plant pathology in laboratory settings, but face several challenges
    for portable operation such as, sample preparation, DNA extraction, portable temperature
    control system, and fouling due to exposure to variable surrounding conditions.
    Despite these challenges, several PCR-based techniques, portable or otherwise,
    for direct disease detection in plants have been reported in the literature with
    key recent works described here. A complete real-time microchip PCR system composed
    of a thin-film heater integrated PCR reaction chamber, a compact fluorescence
    detector for detecting amplified DNA, and a microcontroller that controls the
    entire operation for portable plant disease diagnosis was reported in [57]. The
    disposable microchip requiring 8 μ L sample volume was made of two glass slides,
    where the bottom slide has a stationary reaction chamber holding the PCR sample
    and the top slide has a thin film heater (patterned Cr/Au deposited on glass using
    e-beam evaporation). An optical set-up was used for real-time PCR system based
    on the detection of fluorescence dyes that intercalate with DNA, where fluorescent
    intensity is proportional to the amount of amplified DNA. The dye is excited with
    light emitted from an LED, and the emission light passing through series of filters
    and lenses is detected through a photomultiplier tube. The entire system was 25
    × 16 × 8 cm 3 in size and 843 g in weight, and consumed 110 mAh of power for each
    PCR run. The developed system was tested using prepared samples containing Fusarium
    species and Pseudomonas species as fungal and bacterial phytopathogens, respectively.
    DNA extraction was performed using a commercial kit (Plant/Fungi DNA Isolation
    Kit, Norgen Biotek Corp., Thorold, ON, Canada). The sensor exhibited a detection
    limit of 5 ng/8 μ L sample with a 100% success rate, validated using gel electrophoresis.
    A droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) sensing system for detecting common bunt disease
    (caused by Tilletia laevis) in wheat was reported in [42]. The ddPCR exhibited
    superior detection limit of 30 fg/ μ L as compared to qPCR (100 fg/ μ L). In case
    of qPCR, a parameter called quantification cycle ( 𝐶 𝑞 or threshold cycle, 𝐶 𝑡
    ) is defined which represents the PCR cycle number after which the real signal
    from the sample becomes detectable against background fluorescence. Hence, 𝐶 𝑞
    controls the limit of detection in a given qPCR system as shown in the Figure
    5. Whereas in case of ddPCR, the sample (a few μ L) is divided into hundreds of
    nL droplets suspended in an oil using a droplet generator, and after thermal cycling,
    the droplets are classified as positive or negative based on the fluorescence
    response recorded using a droplet reader. In the presented work, a ddPCR system
    (QX200, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for generating and analyzing droplets,
    where 40 μ L of PCR master mix (containing primers, target DNA, and ddPCR probes)
    and 70 μ L of droplet-generating oil (186-3005, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was
    used as inputs to the ddPCR system. Figure 5. 𝐶 𝑞 value on a quantitative real-time
    PCR amplification curve [58]. A micro-needle (MN) patch-based DNA extraction method
    was reported in [56] to enable a truly portable PCR-based plant disease detection
    system. qPCR was used to detect late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans)
    disease in tomato, where the MN extraction achieved 100% detection rate when compared
    to the conventional gold standard cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based
    DNA extraction method. The leaf samples were collected three days after inoculation.
    The MN-based method significantly shortened the time of plant DNA extraction from
    ∼3 to 4 h in a conventional method to around 1 min as shown in Figure 4, while
    overcoming the requirement for using bulky and expensive equipment. In addition
    to the aforementioned works, several other efforts related to PCR-based phytopathogen
    detection have been reported in the past decade, such as a multiplex RT-PCR (mRT-PCR)
    method for simultaneous detection of five grapevine viroids [59], the use of qPCR
    for the detection and quantification of filamentous fungi and oomycetes within
    host tissue, soil, air, and water [60], a qPCR assay for the detection and quantification
    of Verticillium dahliae in spinach seed resulting in reliable measurements with
    sensitivity limit of about 1 infected seed per 100 [61], and an on-site system
    for detecting soil-borne pathogen (Spongospora subterranea) that causes Powdery
    scab in potato using magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction, and portable
    qPCR (fluorogenic probe-based assay) [62]. Alternative nucleic acid-based methods
    overcoming the need for precise temperature cycling in PCR have also been developed,
    key among which include RPA and LAMP-based methods which are overviewed next.
    3.1.2. Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification-Based Methods RPA is an isothermal
    nucleic acid amplification method which does not require thermal-cycling like
    in PCR-based methods and can generally be performed at a constant temperature
    between 25 to 42 ∘ C, achieving amplification in as little as 15 min [63]. RPA
    mechanism starts when a recombinase protein binds to the primer forming recombinase-primer
    complex which interrogates dsDNA seeking homologous sequence and promotes strand
    invasion by the primer at the cognate site. Next, to prevent the ejection of the
    inserted primer by branch migration, the displaced DNA strand is stabilized by
    the ssDNA-binding protein. Finally, the recombinase disassembles and a strand-displacing
    DNA-polymerase binds to the end of the primer to elongate it in the presence of
    dNTPs [64]. Cyclic repetition of this process results in the exponential amplification
    of the target DNA sequence. An isothermal amplification of target pathogen DNA
    sequences by RPA followed by gold nanoparticle-based electrochemical assessment
    with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was reported in [65]. The RPA coupled
    with gold nanoparticles (AuNP) electrochemical (EC) biosensor was developed to
    detect the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae in Arabidopsis plant. The DNA was extracted
    from plant samples using the solid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) method,
    followed by mixing with the primers for amplification. After amplification, the
    resulting amplicons, containing a barcode sequence on one end and biotin on the
    other, were hybridized to AuNPs using DNA probes complementary to the barcode
    sequence. Streptavidin magnetic beads were then used to enrich for AuNPs/DNA/biotin
    products. The magnetic beads/AuNPs/DNA/biotin products were heated to denature
    the dsDNA amplicons and to release any bound AuNPs into solution, where the electrochemical
    reduction of Au (III) to Au (0) was measured with DPV. The data indicated that
    RPA-EC assay (214 pM) was 100 times more sensitive than PCR-gel electrophoresis
    (21,400 pM). In another work, a rapid, equipment-free detection of Phytophthora
    capsici (oomycetes that infect multiple plant species including Cucurbitaceae,
    Solanaceae, and Leguminosae) using lateral flow strip-based RPA (LF-RPA) assay
    was developed [66]. A 30 s equipment-free DNA extraction method using cellulose-based
    dipstick to rapidly capture nucleic acids was employed. The dipstick method was
    proposed in [67], where a cellulose strip coated with nucleic acid binding proteins
    is dipped in homogenized tissue sample and then washed in buffer resulting in
    a rapid and simple DNA extraction procedure. It was determined that 10 to 20 min
    of DNA amplification time at 40 ∘ C is sufficient for LF strip-based detection.
    LF strips enable detection of biotin- and 6-carboxy-fluorescein (FAM)-labeled
    amplicons produced during RPA. The primers used in DNA amplification were labeled
    with biotin and fluorescence probes (like FAM) that bind to LF strips and causes
    visible changes. The developed method exhibited a detection limit of 10 pg of
    genomic DNA. In addition to the studies described above, several other recent
    works have been reported using RPA-based phytopathogen detection including (i)
    the design of four separate RPA assays for the detection of four pathogens, Xanthomonas
    gardneri, X. euvesicatoria, X. perforans, and X. vesicatoria that cause bacterial
    spot of tomato [68]; (ii) the detection of bean golden yellow mosiac virus, tomato
    mottle virus, and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) in tomato and beans [63],
    where RPA was able to detect 9.6 pg and PCR was able to detect 9.6 fg of purified
    TYLCV DNA indicating the sensitivity of PCR (however, PCR was unable to generate
    visible amplicoms during gel electrophoresis unlike RPA which produced results
    even with crude sample extraction); (iii) the detection of plum pox virus (a disease
    causing virus in stone fruit trees) using a commercial reverse transcription-RPA
    (RT-RPA) platform called AmplifyRP ® , where the whole process from sample preparation
    to results took about 20 min and provided better sensitivity as compared to ELISA-based
    detection [69]; (iv) the rapid detection of Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus
    by RT-RPA, where a detection limit of 0.5 pg of total viral RNA was observed [70];
    (v) the detection of Little cherry virus 2 using RT-RPA, where a crude sample
    extraction method involving homogenization of leaf tissue in a mesh bag with an
    extraction buffer was employed [71], and in which the incubation for the RT-RPA
    was performed at 39 ∘ C for 15 min before visual detection using LF strips. LAMP
    in another prominent isothermal DNA amplification technique applied towards phytopathogen
    detection. In LAMP, four to six target-specific primers (categorized into forward
    and reverse primers) each consisting of a 3’ and a 5’ region and DNA polymerase
    enzyme for strand displacement are required to generate products. Amplification
    begins by denaturation of the dsDNA into ssDNA after which a forward inner primer
    binds to its respective region on the ssDNA and the complementary bases are generated
    by the DNA polymerase. Another different forward primer then binds to target upstream
    (in 5’ to 3’ direction) of the first primer’s site and displaces the strand formed
    by the first primer by synthesizing complementary DNA (cDNA). The reverse inner
    primer now binds to the newly released strand at its respective target and initiates
    reverse (in 3’ to 5’ direction) DNA synthesis using the polymerase enzyme, and
    then another reverse primer binds to target downstream of the first reverse primer’s
    site and displaces the strand formed by the first reverse primer by synthesizing
    cDNA. The strand synthesized by the action of the two forward and reverse primers
    contains two complementary regions which bind together to form a dumbbell shape
    with 2 loops [72,73]. This dumbbell structure forms the basis of cycling phase.
    LAMP-based amplification takes place at a constant temperature around 65 ∘ C and
    is faster than PCR taking about 30 min for detectable results [43,74]. Several
    recent LAMP-based phytopathogen detection systems are reported in the literature
    including (i) the detection of root infecting fungi in turfgrasses [74]; (ii)
    the detection of quarantine plant pathogens such as Xylella fastidiosa, Ceratocystis
    platani, and Phytophthora ramorum, three of the most devastating pathogens of
    trees and ornamental plants in Europe and North America, where a detection limit
    of 0.02 pg/ μ L of DNA was achieved [43]; (iii) a comparative study using LAMP
    and ddPCR for detecting Phytophthora infestans which causes potato late blight
    [44]. It was observed that ddPCR exhibited the lowest detection limit of 100 fg/
    μ L whereas with SYBR green LAMP-based method a detection limit of 1 pg/ μ L was
    observed. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification-based techniques for phytopathogen
    detection have gained momentum in the recent years owing to their simpler equipment
    needs, lower cost, faster operation, and better potential for in-field or portable
    operation as compared to conventional PCR-based methods. In general, utilizing
    the power of DNA amplification technology requires developing specific DNA primers
    and a reliable assay protocol but offers excellent selectivity and reliability
    which has made them a standard laboratory technique for pathogen identification
    and quantification. However, there are some limitations associated with the techniques
    such as large time consumption, requirement for sophisticated equipment, elaborate
    sample preparation, and expert training. Continuous efforts are being directed
    towards making the techniques portable, easy to use, economical, and developing
    new standard procedures/protocols for fast reliable measurements. 3.1.3. Serological/Immunological
    Methods ELISA is among the most widely used serological techniques in disease
    diagnostics for both animals and plants. It is a fairly mature technology with
    several phytopathogen identification kits available commercially [75,76]. The
    basic principle of ELISA involves first, the immobilization of the antigen (target
    protein in the sample) to be detected onto a solid surface through adsorption.
    During this step, the antigen can directly be adsorbed on the surface, or alternatively,
    a capture antibody (or primary antibody), previously adsorbed on the surface,
    can be used to immobilize the antigen. Then, the surface is rinsed to remove unadsorbed/excess
    material. Next, the secondary enzyme-linked antibodies are introduced that bind
    to the target antigen, followed by the addition of the enzyme’s substrate or fluorescent
    dye to detect the antigens through a change in color. Only in the presence of
    specific antigen–antibody interaction is the signal generated. A colorimeter is
    often used to measure the intensity of the color change and calculate the concentration
    of the antigen precisely. In addition to the basic ELISA mechanism (direct ELISA),
    other variants have also been developed such as indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA
    and competitive ELISA [77] along with multiplexed phytopathogen detection [45].
    Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is another major serological/immunological technique
    developed for detecting antigens. LFIA is a low-cost, easy-to-use paper-based
    platform, where a liquid sample containing the analyte of interest (antigen) moves
    under the effect of capillary action through various zones of polymeric strips
    impregnated with antibody molecules followed by colored or fluorescent particles
    (most commonly colloidal gold and latex microspheres) that label the antibody–antigen
    complex, if present (see Figure 6). The sample together then migrates to the detection
    zone where specific immobilized bio-molecules interact with the conjugated antigen–antibody
    complex and produces a recognition signal in form of a visual color change [78].
    In many cases, a control line is present after the detection zone/test line which
    indicates proper liquid flow through the strip. In contrast to ELISA-based detection,
    LFIA-based sensors are more suitable for in-field or portable applications but
    are often less sensitive and exhibit inferior quantitative capability. Figure
    6. Schematic of a general lateral flow immunoassay-based device. Several LFIA-based
    sensors have been reported for phytopathogen detection, where some key recent
    studies include (i) a double enhanced LFIA containing magnetic and gold nanoparticles
    (MNPs and AuNPs) for the detection of potato virus X (PVX; genus Potexvirus) [79],
    where the concentration of analyte was increased in the samples using conjugates
    of MNPs with specific antibodies and visibility of the label was increased through
    MNP aggregation caused by AuNPs. A detection limit of 0.25 ng/mL was observed
    as compared to 8 ng/mL in case of non-enhanced LFIA with operation time of 10
    to 15 min; (ii) a multiplex LFIA for the simultaneous determination of three mycotoxins
    (toxic metabolites produced by fungi) in corn, rice, and peanut [80]. Here the
    LFIA strip consisted of three test lines, one for each mycotoxin, and exhibited
    a detection limit of about 10 μ g/kg to 50 μ g/kg; (ii) another multiplex LFIA-based
    sensor for mycotoxin (aflatoxin B1, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol) determination
    in cereal crops (maize and wheat samples) with a visual detection limit of 0.03
    to 10 μ g/kg [47]; (iv) an Ag-enhanced LFIA for the detection of potato leafroll
    virus [46], where the Ag enhancement is based on the reduction of Ag ions on the
    surface of AuNP (used for labeling) resulting in a significant increase of initial
    AuNP-caused coloration. A detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL and an operation time of
    15 min was observed; (v) an LFIA device for detecting ochratoxin A (a mycotoxin)
    in wines and grapes, where a gold-silver enhancement scheme was implemented. A
    detection limit of 0.9 μ g/L was achieved with an assay time of 10 min [48]. Immunosensors
    or antibody-based biosensors can also be categorised under serological techniques,
    where the general detection mechanism involves the study of antigen–antibody interactions
    and their quantification using electrochemical (EC), optical, and spectroscopic
    methods. The application of immunosensors is a growing area of study in plant
    pathology as they a provide quantitative information while exhibiting potential
    for rapid, portable, and low cost analysis. A few key recent works covering the
    application of immunosensors in plant pathology are discussed here. A label-free
    electrochemical (EC) immunosensor based on electro-deposited Prussian blue (PB)
    and AuNPs for the detection of citrus bacterial canker disease (caused by Xanthomonas
    citri subsp. citri.; Xcc) based on the directly recognizing the effector protein
    PthA was developed in [81]. The sensor fabrication involved sequential electro-deposition
    of PB and AuNPs on multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-ionic liquid nanocomposite
    modified glassy carbon electrode. After immobilization of the anti-PthA antibody
    and blocking with bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein, the immunosensor was used
    for determination of different concentrations of PthA antigen under the optimal
    conditions. The developed sensor was characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV)
    and EC-impedance spectroscopy (EIS), where a linear dynamic range of 0.1 to 50
    nM with a detection limit of 0.028 nM was achieved. An EC immunosensor to determine
    zearalenone (ZEA; a mycotoxin) in maize using carbon screen printed electrodes
    modified with MW-CNTs/polyethyleneimine/AuNPs was presented in [82]. Anti-ZEA
    poly-clonal antibodies were immobolized on the AuNPs, where the immunoassay was
    based on a direct competitive assay between ZEA in maize samples and ZEA labeled
    with horseradish peroxidase enzyme (ZEA-HRP). The EC sensor was characterized
    using amperometry where first, H 2 O 2 (added to the sample solution) was reduced
    to H 2 O by HRP, and then the remaining H 2 O 2 was reduced electrochemically
    leading to an EC signal proportional to the antigen ZEA in the sample. The developed
    sensor exhibited a linear detection range of 10 −4 to 10 −1 ng/mL with a detection
    limit of 0.15 pg/mL. Gold nano-rods (AuNRs)-based fiber optic particle plasmon
    resonance (PPR) immunosensors for the label-free detection of orchid viruses,
    Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV), and Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV), was presented
    in [49]. AuNRs were synthesized by seed-mediated growth method and immobilized
    on the fiber core followed by the functionalization of antibodies for CymMV or
    ORSV via a mixed self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiols using the reagents,
    1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino- propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride, and N-hydroxysuccinimide
    (EDC/NHS). The principle of operation was based on the localized evanescent field
    absorption by the AuNRs upon biomolecular binding, resulting in decreased transmission
    intensity measured at the distal end of the fiber. Using the developed sensor,
    a detection limits of 48 pg/mL and 42 pg/mL for CymMV and ORSV, respectively,
    were achieved. A bioelectronic plum pox virus (PPV) biosensor based on a electrolyte-gated
    organic field effect transistor (EGOFET) was reported in [50], where a poly-crystalline
    gold wire gate electrode was functionalized with anti-PPV. The immobilization
    procedure involved first, covalent binding of a (sub)monolayer of recombinant
    Protein G onto the gold surface followed by anti-PPV antobodies (Abs) adsorption.
    Additionally, a (11-Mercaptoundecyl)tri(ethylene glycol), OEG, self-assembled
    monolayer was deposited to avoid non-specific adsorption to the gold surface spots
    not covered by the ProteinG/Ab. EGOFET was tested by incubating the functionalized
    gate ex-situ, in solutions containing increasing PPV and recording the transfer
    characteristics in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) 50 mM, pH 7.4 to extract transistor
    parameters in linear regime. A calibration curve based on transconductance changes
    as a function of PPV was constructed, where a detection limit of 180 pg/mL and
    a dynamic linear range of 5 ng/mL to 50 μ g/mL was observed. In addition to the
    above-described works, several other recent immunosensing studies have been reported
    in the literature including: (i) an EC immunoassay for detecting Pantoea stewartii
    sbusp. stewartii-NCPPB 449 (PSS) in maize using AuNPs and HRP for dual signal
    amplification, where HRP-labeled anti-PSS antibodies (D-Ab-HRP) were attached
    to the surface of AuNPs and a sandwich immunosensor of capture anti-PSS antibody
    (C-Ab), PSS, and D-Ab-HRP was established. A linear detection range of 2 × 10
    7 to 4 × 10 4 cfu/mL with a detection limit of 7.8 × 10 3 cfu/mL was achieved
    [83]; (ii) a lab-on-a-chip platform consisting of an array of gold inter-digitated
    electrodes functionalized with EDC/NHS/anti-Pectobacterium atrosepticum antibodies
    for monitoring blackleg and soft rot disease of potato. EIS measurements were
    conducted for quantification, where the measured impedance was directly proportional
    to the antigen concentration [84]. A detection limit of 10 4 cfu/mL was observed;
    (iii) an SPR-based biosensor for the detection of maize chlorotic mottle virus
    (MCMV), where 11-Mercaptoundecanoic acid was applied on a gold surface to form
    a self-assembled monolayer, and a layer of anti-MCMV antibody was crosslinked
    on the surface using EDC/NHS-based linkage [85]. Overall, serological/immunological
    methods are uniquely suited for large-scale testing and operate by detecting pathogen-specific
    proteins. The key advantages of the method includes good selectivity, fast operation,
    low-cost, and better potential for in-situ testing as compared to nucleic acid
    amplification-based methods. However, serological methods generally exhibit poorer
    detection limit and specificity in comparison with nucleic acid amplification-based
    techniques, while still providing quantitative results. 3.2. Indirect Phytopathogen
    Detection Methods Indirect detection methods refer to techniques where the plant’s
    responses to the pathogenic stress are identified as an indicator of the disease.
    The stress responses may include morphological and/or physiological changes such
    as variations in the tissue temperature, color, transpiration rate, and accumulation
    of metabolites and hormones. Key indirect methods for detecting phytopathogenic
    stress in plants discussed here include imaging-based techniques such as visible/RGB
    (red, green, and blue)-imaging, hyperspectral imaging, and thermography; visible/infrared
    (VIS/IR) reflectance/transmittance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy; chlorophyll
    fluorescence-based methods; hormone biosensing methods; VOC monitoring-based methods
    (discussed in Section 5). Table 2 presents a qualitative comparison of the mentioned
    indirect phytopathogen detection methods. Table 2. Brief qualitative comparison
    of the indirect sensing methods discussed in this article for monitoring phytopathogenic
    stress in plants. 3.2.1. Visible/RGB Imaging-Based Methods Digital photography
    and imaging have emerged as important tools for crop health monitoring as well
    as phenotyping applications where various types of imaging techniques have been
    developed such as, visible/RGB imaging, hyperspectral imaging, thermography, and
    fluorescence imaging. Table 3 presents a comparison between key recent works on
    visible/RGB imaging-based crop disease detection. RGB imaging refers to the digital
    photographic analysis performed in the visible range of the electromagnetic (EM)
    spectrum, where the captured colored-image can be expressed in the red, green
    and blue channels. Along with the RGB color space, the image can be transformed
    into other spaces such as L ∗ a ∗ b ∗ (L ∗ is lightness, a ∗ is red/green value,
    and b ∗ is blue/yellow value), CMYB (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black), and HSV (hue,
    saturation, value). Additionally, parameters like texture, gray levels, and shape
    can also be defined as features for disease symptom detection and identification.
    In general, the image processing for plant disease detection consists of three
    main steps (see Figure 7): Segmentation of the region of interest. Feature extraction.
    Detection and classification. Table 3. A comparison of the key recent visible/RGB-imaging-based
    sensing methods for monitoring pathogenic stress in plants. Figure 7. General
    workflow of visible/RGB imaging-based plant disease detection. In a recent work,
    a smartphone-based RGB image processing system was reported to detect and automatically
    classify five diseases (Cercospora leaf spot caused by the fungus Cercospora beticola,
    Ramularia leaf spot caused by Ramularia beticola, Phoma leaf spot caused by Phoma
    betae, Beet rust caused by Uromyces betae, and Bacterial blight of sugar beet
    caused by Pseudomonassyringae pv. aptata) in sugar beet [86]. An image database
    was created with infected crop under controlled as well as field conditions with
    over 1870 images of diseased (1420 images) as well as healthy leaves (450 images).
    The data processing started with region detection, where the areas of interest
    were identified based on the shapes and RGB pixel values. Then, feature extraction
    was performed to compute the following values from the RGB values: (i) red-channel
    (R), (ii) green-channel (G), (iii) blue-channel (B), (iv) intensities (INT), (v)
    local binary patterns (LBPs) of intensities (INTLBP), (vi) gradient magnitudes
    (Gmag), (vii) gradient directions (Gdir), and (viii) LBPs of gradient magnitudes
    (GmagLBP). Next, a one-versus-one multi-class support vector machine (SVM)-based
    classifier with radial basis function (kernel) was trained using the extracted
    parameters. The accuracy of the sensing system was given by, 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦= 𝑇𝑁+𝑇𝑃 𝐹𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝑇𝑃
    , (1) where FN = false negative, FP = false positive, TP = true positive, and
    TN = true negative. The accuracy values between 68% (for Phoma leaf spot) and
    90% (Beet rust) were reported. A smartphone-based image processing application
    for plant disease diagnosis was reported in [88], where the developed system was
    tested for vineyard diseases based on photographs of grape leaves. The analysis
    begins by isolating region lesions (areas of interest or disease) from background
    (assumed to be significantly brighter than the leaf by using a white colored background
    while imaging) and healthy tissue through thresholding of the RGB pixel values.
    Then, the following lesion features are extracted: number of spots, their gray
    level and area, followed by a histogram construction indicating the number of
    pixels that have a specific red, green, or blue color level. For test images,
    the color histograms are extracted and compared within the predefined limits,
    and the top three possible diseases are indicated. Success rate of about 90% were
    observed. An imaging system for continuous plant level (single leaf based) monitoring
    of Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) in sugar beet by template matching and pattern recognition
    was presented in [92]. The first stage employs a robust template matching strategy
    called orientation code matching (OCM) for continuously tracking a single leaf
    of a plant over time by searching for its corresponding position based on the
    matching of orientation codes (OC) between two images from adjacent image frames.
    The second stage uses SVM with radial basis function kernel as pattern recognition
    method for classifying CLS against the field background using the following three
    features derived from RGB images as inputs: L ∗ , a ∗ , and entropy × density,
    where entropy and density of an image represent richness of intensity and contrast,
    respectively. Although, high classification accuracy (above 95%) was achieved,
    in case of real-world application, precision values ( truepositive allpositive
    ) between 30% to 83% were observed with better results in case of infection in
    older leaves than younger ones which was attributed to more saturated RGB colors
    (darker green and better contrast) in the older leaves. A multi-plant multi-disease
    detection system using digital image processing was developed in [90], where disease
    identification was performed based on color transformations, color histograms
    and a pairwise-based classification system. Unconstrained set of leaf images were
    taken from 12 different plant species under 82 different stresses (74 biotic,
    4 pests, and 4 abiotic) using common digital cameras and mobile devices with 15%
    in controlled laboratory conditions while 85% in the field. The first task in
    data processing was the leaf segmentation to remove the background, done using
    guided active contour (GAC) method. The second step was symptom segmentation,
    which is identifying the boundary between disease tissue and healthy tissue on
    a leaf. Four segmentation masks were generated as binary functions of the parameters,
    𝑟 1 and 𝑟 2 , which can be defined for each pixel as follows: 𝑟 1 =𝑅/(𝐺+𝑒),𝑎𝑛𝑑
    𝑟 2 =𝐵/(𝐺+𝑒), (2) where R, G, and B are the pixel values of the red, green, and
    blue channels of the RGB representation, respectively, and e is an arbitrarily
    small value for avoiding divisions by zero. Next, the segmented RGB images were
    transformed arithmetically to generate ten new color channels (H, S, V, L, a,
    b, C, M, Y, and K). A color-channel-based pairwise classification approach was
    applied to address the problem that many of the diseases present quite similar
    visual symptoms (classes not well defined), and one approach was to divide the
    problem containing c classes into c(c − 1)/2 binary (or two-class) problems. In
    the training process, a 100-bin reference histogram was generated for each disease
    and color channel aimed at capturing the general behavior of each disease for
    all color channels. The color channels, whose reference histograms correlated
    the least for each pair of diseases, were taken as the ones with the best discriminative
    capabilities for those pairs, and used in the next step. Next, the cross-correlations
    between each selected reference histogram and the histograms of all corresponding
    images in the training set were calculated and averaged, resulting in a consistency
    value (the closer it is to one, more consistent was the color channel for that
    disease). For the test images, the corresponding histograms were generated and
    cross-correlations with the reference histograms as well as the consistency values
    were calculated. Then, a maximum likelihood operation was performed to estimate
    the most likely disease. Accuracy of about 58% was observed while the correct
    disease was ranked in the top two or three likely diseases in about 80% of the
    cases. An image-based multi-plant multi-disease detection system was reported
    in [89], where a public dataset (PlantVillage) of 54,036 images (of 14 crop species
    with 26 diseases) collected under controlled conditions of diseased and healthy
    plant leaves were used to train deep learning networks for classification. The
    applicability of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) with focus on AlexNet
    and GoogLeNet were evaluated for the classification problem. Both the DCNNs were
    computationally intensive during training phase but faster under testing. The
    reported system achieved a top accuracy of 99.35%. However, when tested on a set
    of images taken under conditions different from the images used for training,
    the model’s accuracy reduced substantially, to just above 31%. A monochrome vision-based
    system for detecting Huanglongbing (HLB) disease in citrus trees (particularly,
    orange) was developed in [93], where increased level of starch accumulation in
    HLB-symptomatic leaves was characterized using the rotation of the polarization
    of light by 90 ∘ at 591 nm. The imaging set-up consisted of a monochrome camera
    equipped with a wide lens (6 mm focal length) and a rotating polarizer housed
    inside a wooden box with an light emitting diode (LED) diode panel for illumination
    at 591 nm. Sixty citrus leaf samples were acquired in laboratory setting while
    30 in the field setting from four known classes: HLB-positive, HLB-negative, zinc
    deficient HLB-positive, and zinc deficient HLB-negative. qPCR was performed in
    order to verify the HLB status of all the samples. The gray scale histograms of
    the symptomatic areas were obtained for each image for classification, where gray
    value (ranging between 1 and 255) represented the light intensity for each pixel.
    The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the gray value were extracted from the
    normalized histograms, and were used to train a support vector machine (SVM)-based
    maximum margin classifier. A three-fold cross validation method was employed in
    the classification process in which the dataset was randomly divided into three
    folds, two were used for training and one for validation. This process was repeated
    fifty times, and the average classification accuracy of about 97% was achieved.
    An automatic multi-disease diagnostic system for detecting three diseases in wheat,
    septoria, rust, and tan spot, using common mobile capture devices was reported
    in [87]. The image analysis was carried by first pre-processing the images by
    means of color constancy algorithms to minimize natural illumination variability
    effects. Next, leaf segmentation was performed, where automated as well as user
    assisted approaches were developed. Finally, during disease classification step,
    a primary segmentation was done in order to detect and select any suspicious sub-region
    on the leaf as a disease candidate (hot-spots). Each obtained hot-spot region
    was described by means of two visual descriptors: color and texture. For each
    disease and descriptor, a Random-Forest based classifier was trained providing
    a hot-spot-based disease feasibility value. Then, a meta-classifier module weighed
    all individual decisions to make a global assessment. The algorithm was deployed
    on a real smartphone application and validated under real field conditions in
    a pilot study located in Spain and Germany with over more than 36 wheat varieties,
    where an overall accuracy of 80% was achieved. An image processing-based wireless
    sensor network (WSN) for vineyard monitoring was reported in [94], where each
    sensor node consisted of a webcam mounted on stepper motor (that can rotate to
    cover a wider field) connected with a wireless router for communication. The sensor
    nodes were scattered across the vineyard on 6 m high posts to get a clear field
    of view and avoid any obstruction in the line of sight for communication. The
    image processing began with thresholding, which uses the RGB data as well as the
    hue, saturation, value (HSV) data, derived from RBG images, to distinguish healthy
    (green) leaves from unhealthy (discolored) leaves. Second, the leaf size was estimated
    based on mean pixel variation in the parts of the image corresponding to the healthy
    (green) tissue. It was shown that green (or healthy) leaves appearing smaller
    in the image (due to being farther from the camera) show greater pixel variation,
    or normalized difference index (NDI) which was defined as: 𝑁𝐷𝐼= 𝐺−𝑅 𝐺+𝑅 . (3)
    Next, a set of morphological operations using masks to smooth boundaries, fill
    holes, and remove artifacts were applied to reduce noise without eliminating useful
    features. Finally, in the detection step, the diseased leaves ratio in each image
    was calculated as the ratio of the features left in the mask (after previous operations)
    and the leaf size (to eliminate the effect of dead leaves on the ground), based
    on which the plant health was determined. Overall, a WSN-based sensing system
    at the field level was demonstrated but no performance metrics like accuracy were
    mentioned. In general, RGB-imaging-based methods are particularly suitable for
    general plant health monitoring and in most cases, common imaging devices such
    as smartphones or digital cameras can be employed making the sensing set-up inexpensive.
    However, the classification of diseases is often computationally intensive while
    exhibiting moderate accuracy. 3.2.2. Hyperspectral Imaging Hyperspectral (HS)
    imaging-based systems have emerged as a promising technology for fast non-contact/non-invasive
    sensing and has been successfully applied in the field of plant disease diagnostics.
    In contrast to RGB imaging, where the extracted information is based on color
    spaces, in HS imaging the reflected light from the plants is segregated into hundreds
    of narrow spectral bands across the EM spectrum to obtain a hypercube (images
    comprising of two spatial and one wavelength dimensions), which is then characterized
    using sophisticated data processing algorithms (see Figure 8). Unlike, visible/RGB
    imaging which only captures images from 400 nm to 700 nm wavelengths (visible
    region of the EM spectrum), hyperspectral imaging systems are designed to capture
    spectral as well as spatial information beyond the human vision ranging from ultraviolet
    (UV) to shortwave infrared (SW-IR) wavelengths, between 350 nm and 2500 nm. Different
    wavebands may offer diverse information, where healthy plants typically absorb
    visible light (VIS 400–700 nm) strongly due to chlorophyll/photosynthesis related
    pigments, whereas the light scattered in the near-infrared (NIR 700–1000 nm) is
    largely dependent on the leaf cell structure, and the leaf reflectance in the
    SW-IR (1000–2500 nm) is influenced by the leaf water and chemical content [95].
    Therefore, HS images can offer rich spectral information leading to better characterization,
    modeling, classification, and detection of diseases in plants. Figure 8. General
    workflow of hyperspectral imaging-based plant disease detection. Adapted from
    [96], Copyright (2017), with permission from Elsevier. In addition to specialized
    HS imaging camera set-up, data processing software is also crucial. Various image
    processing strategies in the HS domain have been applied for predictive crop disease
    modeling, including empirical models, and machine learning-based algorithms. Several
    works on HS analysis for plant disease detection have been reported in literature
    of which some of the key recent works are discussed here, and a brief comparison
    is presented in Table 4. Table 4. A comparison of the key recent hyperspectral
    (HS) imaging-based sensing methods for monitoring pathogenic stress in plants.
    An HS reflectance imaging-based early detection system for tomato spotted wilt
    virus (TSWV) in tomato plants was reported in [98], where a machine learning based
    sensing platform named outlier removal auxiliary classifier generative adversarial
    nets (OR-AC-GAN) was developed. OR-AC-GAN is a variant of generative adversarial
    network (GAN), a neural network architecture in deep learning domain [103]. The
    developed method integrates the tasks of plant segmentation, spectrum classification
    and image classification. The OR-AC-GAN model used 83 wavebands between 395 nm
    and 1005 nm and was shown to achieve an average classification accuracy of 96.25%
    before the appearance of visible symptoms, as early as 5 days after inoculation
    (DAI). Additionally, the combination of OR-AC-GAN with three band selection algorithms
    was explored, where maximum variance principle component analysis (MVPCA)-based
    band selection technique provided similar accuracy as stand-alone OR-AC-GAN but
    with 8 spectrum bands. In addition to the spectral features like, reflectance
    or transmittance at different wavelengths, HS images also contain images-based
    spatial features like, textural properties. Traditionally, only spectral features
    are extracted from the HS images, however texture-based variables may additionally
    provide supplementary information leading to better accuracy in classification.
    An early rapid tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection detection system using HS
    imaging in the VIS/NIR spectral region (380 nm to 1023 nm) was reported in [101],
    where both spectral and textural features at selected wavelengths were used for
    four-class classification (healthy, 2 DAI, 4 DAI, and 6 DAI). Coupled with the
    successive projections algorithm (SPA) and machine-learning-based classifiers,
    correlations were established among the reflectance spectra, texture features,
    and the stage of diseased development. Based on SPA, 8 out of 434 EWs were selected,
    where majority of the EWs were found to be in the short-near infrared region.
    A broad set of classifiers were evaluated, including partial least squares-discrimination
    analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation
    neural network (BPNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and least squares support
    vector machine (LS-SVM). The classification was performed for three different
    datasets at the selected EWs: spectral features, textural features (contrast,
    correlation, entropy, and homogeneity), and data fusion (both spectral and textural
    features). ELM classifier resulted in the best overall classification accuracy
    of 98.33% using only spectral features, whereas a maximum accuracy of 93.33% was
    achieved using BPNN classifier with textural variables, and around 95% accuracy
    was achieved with data fusion using BPNN classifier. A sensing system for TSWV
    disease detection in capsicum plants using HS imaging was developed in [95], where
    SVM classifiers on three types of features: the full spectrum, spectral vegetative
    indices (VIs), and features generated using data driven probabilistic topic models,
    were trained on both VIS-NIR and SW-NIR hypercubes resulting in over 90% accuracy.
    The HS imaging system consisted of two push-broom hyperspectral cameras from Headwall,
    the VNIR A-series, and the SWIR M-series, and six 20 W halogen lights for illuminating
    the leaf sample. A thread grid was used to hold the leaf sample flat against the
    plate during imaging, and for reference, the image with camera cap “on” served
    as the 0% reflectance, while the image of a standard white teflon target served
    as the white reference (99.9% reflectance). Prior to classification, hypercube
    pre-processing was performed to segment the leaf from the background in the spectral
    domain (by an unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm), and grid removal (by
    spatial matched filter approach). In another work, an HS imaging-based system
    for early detection of Phytophthora infestans (late blight) and Alternaria solani
    (early blight) diseases in potato was presented in [102], where SVM-based supervised
    learning model was developed using spectral, textural, and contextual features.
    A total of 300 images of potato leaves spread across the three class labels, late
    blight affected, early blight affected, and healthy leaves, were analyzed. The
    images were taken from a publicly available database, plant village (www.plantvillage.com).
    Firstly, leaf segmentation was performed using the mask filtering process to identify
    and select the regions of interest. Next, 10 different features/variables were
    selected for SVM (multiclass with linear kernel)-based classification. Of the
    300 images, 180 were used for training and 120 for testing, where 95% classification
    accuracy was achieved. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based approach
    for automated yellow rust disease (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. Tritici)
    detection in winter wheat using a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based HS imaging
    system was reported in [100], where the study was conducted over a whole crop
    cycle on four 220 m 2 plots, two infected with the disease and two healthy. HS
    imaging was conducted five times using a UHD 185 firefly sensor (Cubert GmbH,
    Ulm, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) mounted on a DJI S1000 UAV system, where reflected
    radiation between 450 nm and 950 nm with a total of 125 bands was captured from
    a height of 30 m (resolution of 2 cm per pixel). Normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) was calculated and used to separate vegetation from bare soil in
    the images, where NDVI greater than 0.3 was labeled as vegetation. In the data
    pre-processing step, sliding window image segmentation algorithm was implemented
    to extract spatial and spectral information. Next, a DCNN model comprising of
    multiple Incetion-Resnet blocks was used for feature extraction followed by an
    average pooling layer and a fully connected layer for transforming the feature
    maps into a three-class classifier: rust, healthy, and other. An accuracy of 85%
    was observed at the field scale. In another work, a 3D-CNN-based model for the
    detection of charcoal rot disease (caused by the fungus, Macrophomina phaseolina)
    in soybean was reported, where the data pre-processing consisted of using RGB
    wavebands of the HS images for the segmentation of the charcoal rot stem [99].
    The RGB images were transformed to HSV color space, followed by segmenting of
    the charcoal rot stem by simple thresholding. Healthy and infected soybean stem
    samples were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 DAI, and 3D-CNN model was used to
    extract features jointly across the spatial and spectral dimension for classification.
    The 3D-CNN model consisted of two convolutional layers interspersed with two max
    pooling layers followed by two fully connected layers, and was able to achieve
    a classification accuracy of 95.73% across 539 test images. Additionally, saliency
    map visualizations of the healthy and infected samples were constructed to study
    and explain the importance of specific hyperspectral wavelengths in classification.
    In a comparative study, a UAV-based and a benchtop-based HS imaging (380 nm to
    1020 nm) system for detecting target spot (caused by fungus Corynespora cassicola)
    and bacterial spot (caused by Xanthomonas perforans) diseases in tomato were developed
    and compared [97]. Tomato leaves were classified into four categories: healthy,
    asymptomatic, early, and late disease development stages, while 35 spectral vegetation
    indices (VIs) were calculated and evaluated for optimal detection response. Two
    different classification methods were utilized: (i) multi-layer perceptron neural
    network (MLP) and (ii) stepwise discriminant analysis (STDA), and compared. Based
    on the analysis, it was reported that the most significant VIs include photochemical
    reflectance index (PRI) for both diseases, the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI850) for bacterial spot in all stages, and the triangular vegetation
    index (TVI), NDVI850, and chlorophyll index green (Chl green) for target spot
    (TS) asymptomatic, TS early, and TS late disease stage, respectively. Of the classification
    methods, MLP-based classifier exhibited superior classification accuracy of 99%
    under field (UAV-based) and laboratory conditions. In addition to the aforementioned
    works, several other HS imaging-based crop disease detection systems have been
    reported in the past decade or so [104,105]. In general, HS imaging is active
    area of research for pre-symptomatic crop health monitoring. Though computationally
    intensive, reasonably selecting spectrum wavebands, and analysis methods can reduce
    the computation time for sufficient accuracy, providing potential for automated
    in-field applications. However, unlike RGB-imaging, specialized hardware (HS cameras)
    is required which make the method expensive. 3.2.3. Thermography According to
    Planck’s radiation law, every object at temperature above absolute zero emits
    electromagnetic radiation (blackbody radiation), and the amount of radiation emitted
    is a function of its emissivity ( 𝜖 ) and absolute temperature (T), and can be
    given according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law as, 𝑊=𝜖𝜎 𝑇 4 , (4) where W is the
    spectral radiant emittance (in W/ m 2 ), and 𝜎 is the Stefan boltzmann constant
    ( =5.67× 10 −8 W m −2 K −4 ). Thermography is a non-contact method for plant health
    monitoring, where surface temperatures of leaves, plants, or crop canopies are
    observed using their inherent thermal radiation. The emitted infrared (IR) radiation
    is recorded using thermographic cameras in the IR wavelength region of 8–12 μ
    m to produce false color images, where each pixel relates to a particular temperature
    value. The principle of detection is based on the disturbances in stomatal conductance,
    photosynthesis, and transpiration in a diseased plant, leading to thermal variations
    in the plant tissue that may act as indicators of stress [106]. An application
    of thermal imaging for rapid diagnosis of crop disease was reported in a recent
    study, where tomato mosaic disease and wheat leaf rust were taken as examples
    [107]. Leaf temperatures were continuously monitored for the two crops during
    the incubation period. The results showed that the maximum temperature difference
    (MTD) of the tomato mosaic disease ranged from 0.2 ∘ C ∼ 1.7 ∘ C, and that of
    wheat leaf rust ranged from 0.4 ∘ C ∼ 2 ∘ C. As the disease progressed, the MTD
    of both plants showed an increasing trend while the average temperature decreased.
    The variations in MTD were evident 5 to 7 days prior to the visible symptoms,
    demonstrating the early disease detection capability of thermography. In another
    work, the suitability of IR thermography was assessed for sensing scab disease
    in apple caused by the phytopathogenic fungi, Venturia inaequalia, colonizing
    apple leaves below the cuticle [108]. It was observed that the fungal growth caused
    localized decrease in temperature before symptoms appeared that significantly
    increased the MTD of leaves. The MTD increased linearly with the size of the infection
    (R 2 = 0.85), and later decreased due to leaf senescence. A UAV-borne thermal
    system for detecting disease-induced canopy temperature increase due to red band
    needle blight (caused by the fungus Dothistroma septosporum) in pine plantations
    was presented in [109]. Sixty sample trees were surveyed and thermal imagery was
    acquired at six different times of a day from an altitude of 60 m. Statistically
    significant correlation between canopy temperature depression (CTD) and disease
    levels was observed with R 2 between 0.27 and 0.41, which may be related to the
    needle damage symptoms caused by the disease, i.e., loss of cellular integrity,
    necrosis, and eventual desiccation. Additionally, the inclusion of light detection
    and ranging (LiDAR)-based structural metrics (changes in canopy structure with
    disease) in the overall disease detection analysis was studied, and only a slight
    improvement was observed. A pre-symptomatic detection mechanism for cucumber downy
    mildew (caused by oomycete, Pseudoperonospora cubensis) using thermography and
    fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was reported in [110]. First, using
    thermal imaging under controlled conditions, it was observed that MTD-based detection
    was possible at 4.42 DAI, whereas visible symptoms appeared after 5.36 DAI. However,
    MTD peaked at around 7 DAI after which it decreased sharply. Second, the FTIR
    spectra was obtained from the regions between the diseased and healthy areas at
    three characteristic wavenumbers: 2977 cm −1 , 1544 cm −1 and 1050 cm −1 for pre-symptomatic
    analysis. At these points, maximum variation between the spectra for healthy and
    disease regions occurred, which was used to distinguish between the pre-symptomatic,
    visually detectable, and later stages of downy mildew disease progression in cucumber
    leaves. Several other works have been reported regarding the use of thermography
    for disease detection in plants including (i) a thermal vision system for identifying
    powdery-mildew and gray-mold disease in rose plants [111], where the regions of
    the interest in thermal images were identified by segmenting the corresponding
    visual images. Performance of the designed neuro-fuzzy classifiers were evaluated
    with the thermal images captured using an automatic imaging setup and correct
    estimation rates of 69% and 80% were achieved at 2 DAI; (ii) thermographic visualization
    of leaf response in cucumber plants infected with the soil-borne pathogen Fusarium
    oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (FOC) [112], where the variations in the MTD, transpiration
    rate, stomatal conductance, and relative membrane injury were studied. Correlations
    between FOC infection stages and the mentioned parameters were observed. Overall,
    thermography-based sensing methods are relatively less computational as compared
    to RGB or HS imaging methods, but require special camera equipment and can only
    provide generalized indication of biotic stress in plants, exhibiting poor specificity.
    3.2.4. Non-Imaging Spectroscopic Methods Non-imaging spectroscopic methods include
    Visible/Infrared (VIS/IR) reflectance and transmittance spectroscopy-based methods,
    and Raman spectroscopy-based approaches. The VIS/IR spectroscopy is a subset of
    hyperspectral imaging where only the spectral information (and not spatial/pixel
    information) in the VIS/IR wavelength region is recorded. Either the reflectance
    of the leaf/tissue surface or the transmitted light through the leaf tissue is
    measured and correlated with the plant health. A VIS-NIR reflectance spectroscopy-based
    system for detecting HLB or citrus greening disease in citrus trees was reported
    in [113], where two portable halogen lamps (as light source) and a field-portable
    SVC HR-1024 spectroradiometer (Spectra Vista Cooperation, NY) were used to collect
    the reflectance data between 350 nm to 2500 nm (989 data points). The complete
    system also consisted of a laser pointer to denote the area for which the data
    were recorded, and was mounted on a mobile platform for in-field operation. Various
    classification algorithms were tested where quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)-based
    algorithm yielded the highest overall average classification accuracy of about
    95%. In another work, NIR spectroscopy was evaluated as a method for detecting
    zebra chip (ZC) disease (caused by Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum bacteria)
    in potatoes [114]. A bench-top spectroradiometer was used for obtaining spectral
    information for each individual potato where two models were tested: (i) direct
    correlation between spectra and ZC, and (ii) correlating sugar content in potatoes
    with ZC. Stepwise regression in conjunction with canonical discriminant analysis
    (CDA) was applied to the raw spectra where a total classification accuracy of
    98.35% was achieved. The same analysis when applied to second derivative spectra
    yielded 97.25% accuracy. Alternately, CDA applied to sucrose, glucose, and fructose
    concentrations previously determined by HPLC yielded 96.7% classification accuracy.
    Several other recent works have been reported on spectroscopic methods for plant
    disease detection including (i) investigation of early detection of potato late
    blight using contact leaf reflectance measurements with a spectroradiometer where
    the leaf was clipped on to a surface and illuminated with halogen light sources
    [115]. The spectral responses were measured for two different genotypes (one with
    a resistance gene) and at different stages of infection: early infection, biotrophy,
    necrotrophy, and sporulation. Three different classification approaches: random
    forest discrimination (RF), partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA),
    and normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) were applied where accuracy between
    60% to 85% were obtained for each technique; (ii) detection of pepper fusarium
    disease under laboratory settings using spectral reflectance and a K-nearest neighbor
    (KNN)-based classifier where a classification accuracy of over 90% was achieved,
    however specificity with respect to other diseases was not evaluated [116]; (iii)
    NIR spectroscopy-based detection of bitter pit disorder in honeycrisp apples where
    the spectra for 40 apples (20 healthy and 20 bitter pitted, kept in cold storage)
    were recorded at 0, 35, and 63 days after harvest [117]. Spectral data in the
    nine spectral bands (though to be associated with bitter pit) between 971 nm and
    1143 nm were collected and classified using QDA and SVM-based classifiers yielding
    an average accuracy in the range of 78% to 87%. Overall, non-imaging VIS/IR spectroscopy
    (VIS/IR-spec) exhibits some unique strengths like simpler experimental set-up
    consisting largely of a light source or lamp and a spectroradiometer making it
    relatively cheaper as compared to HS imaging. Moreover, data analysis procedures
    are relatively non-complex as image pre-processing steps are no longer needed.
    However, unlike HS imaging, VIS/IR-spec lacks spatial information making it difficult
    to implement under field settings (special data capturing apparatus is required)
    as there can be significant interference from the surroundings. Additionally,
    imaging-based techniques can capture textural features providing functional supplementary
    information leading to greater scope for pre-symptomatic crop disease detection
    with relatively higher specificity. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is the other analytical
    spectroscopic technique that provides information related to the molecular structure
    of the specimen based on the molecular vibrations through inelastic photon collisions
    (by shining a laser beam at the object). Figure 9 shows the schematic of a general
    Raman-spectroscopy-based plant health monitoring system. In a recent work, the
    detection and identification of fungal pathogens (spergillus flavus, A. niger,
    Fusarium spp., or Diplodia spp.) in maize kernels using a hand-held Raman spectrometer
    was explored [118]. The Raman spectra from individual maize kernels was recorded
    using a hand-held portable Rigaku Progeny ResQ spectrometer (Rigaku Analytical
    Devices, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA), equipped with a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser. Next,
    multivariate data modeling based on orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant
    analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed where in the final step, 4 predictive components,
    3 orthogonal components, and 391 out of 512 original wavenumbers, were used to
    generate the misclassification table. It was demonstrated that the model was able
    to classify the four disease with 100% accuracy. However, the method was applied
    for post-symptomatic (tissue already damaged) analysis where the information about
    the extent of infection (sampling at a particular DAI) was missing as well as
    the number of sample were not clearly disclosed. Moreover, the kernels were extracted
    from the cob and placed in special apparatus before analysis making the sampling
    process complex. Figure 9. Schematic of Raman spectroscopy-based plant health
    monitoring system. Other recent works on RS-based plant disease detection include
    (i) A handheld RS-based system for the detection of Abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV)
    in Abutilon (ornamental crop) was reported in [119] where spectra of leaves from
    healthy and infected plants were recorded, and difference in the intensity of
    the bands, particularly the one at 1526 cm −1 , was proposed as a basis for the
    early detection. An accuracy of 99% was reported with a coherent intensity variation
    across all bands which indicates the lack of specificity, and may occur due to
    general discoloration of the infected leaf; (ii) diagnosing of citrus greening
    (or HLB disease) from the Raman spectra of citrus leaves, obtained using a SENTERRA
    confocal microprobe Raman spectrometer [120]. The samples were divided in to five
    infection categories: serious, moderate, slight, nutrient deficient, and healthy.
    Identification of spectral peaks of interest and background removal was done by
    taking first derivative and linear fitting while the spectral variables were screened
    using PCA- and SPA-based methods in the range 715.0 to 1639.5 cm −1 . Next, PLS-DA
    was applied for classification and a recognition rate of 100%; (iii) early detection
    and discrimination of two economically important viral infections (caused by tomato
    yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus; TYLCSV and TSWV) in tomato plants [121], where
    manually inoculated plants were monitored over 28 days with samples tested using
    RS and PCR. PCA and PLS-DA-based analyses were performed for feature selection
    and classification, respectively yielding accuracy of over 70% for TYLCSV at 14
    DAI and over 85% for TSWV at 8 DAI. The scope for using RS-based method for early
    detection of common viral diseases in tomatoes was demonstrated. In general, RS-based
    methods hold greater potential than VIS/IR-spec for specific disease identification,
    and a growing number of RS-based studies are being reported with high accuracy
    plant disease detection where hand-held portable systems have been demonstrated.
    However, some drawbacks associated with the technique include relatively higher
    cost of equipment, complex data analysis, and susceptibility to background fluorescence
    from chemical as well as physical (for example, dirt) compounds. Furthermore,
    the sample area of a typical Raman spectrometer probe (laser beam) is of the order
    of 10s of microns which if not focused appropriately may lead misdiagnosis as
    the infection in the plant tissue may not spread uniformly, and the high energy
    beams may lead to undesired tissue damage. 3.2.5. Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging
    Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) imaging is a relatively new method applied towards
    disease detection in plants. Light energy absorbed by chlorophyll molecules in
    the leaf can (i) drive photosynthesis (photochemistry); (ii) be re-emitted as
    heat; or (iii) be re-emitted as light (fluorescence). All the three processes
    compete with each other and can provide information about quantum efficiency and
    heat dissipation, and indirectly the plant health. ChlF is particularly a measure
    of the re-emitted light in the red part of the EM spectrum from Photosystem II
    (water-plastoquinone oxidoreductase; PS-II)-based photo-chemical reaction [122].
    The ChlF-based sensing principle involves illuminating a darkness adapted plant
    and recording the fluorescence spectra, which is dependent on the photosynthetic
    apparatus of the leaf that in turn is dependent on the plant’s health. In general,
    a depression in the ChlF value is observed as pre-symptomatic indication of plant
    disease. Several works have been reported on ChlF-based imaging including (i)
    a thermography versus ChlF imaging for detection and quantification of apple scab
    [123], where it was reported that thermography exhibited higher sensitivity; (ii)
    the detection of sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and sweet potato chlorotic
    stunt virus (SPCSV) in sweet potato using thermal imaging and ChlF [124], where
    it was demonstrated that the operating efficiency of PS-II and photochemical quenching
    were the most sensitive parameters for the quantification of virus effects compared
    with maximum quantum efficiency, non-photochemical quenching, and leaf temperature;
    (iii) an early detection system using HS- and ChlF-imaging in conjunction [125].
    Combining both techniques in one device that also guaranteed integrated and congruent
    images reduced classification errors to less than 5%. Overall, the ChlF imaging
    is mainly applied towards phenotyping applications and provides insight into the
    photosynthetic processes in plants, and is largely applied to plant disease detection
    in conjunction with other imaging methods to improve accuracy [125,126]. However,
    because of the need for dark adaptation before imaging, the method has limited
    potential for fast in-field crop health monitoring. 3.2.6. Biosensing Methods
    for Phytohormones Detection As mentioned previously in Section 2.1, the onset
    of SAR is one of the key ways plants achieve immunity and the phytohormones SA,
    JA, and ET play critical roles in the signaling process. Therefore, sensing the
    levels of these hormones have been used as indicators of stress in plants. Conventionally,
    the phytohormones are detected under laboratory conditions using standard analytical
    techniques like high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS)
    [127,128,129]. In general, these methods require extensive sample preparation
    involving analyte-specific extraction chemistry followed by ionization, separation,
    and quantification of the ions on the basis of their mass/charge ratio. Alternative
    to analytical methods (which are time, cost, and labor intensive while being largely
    restricted to laboratories), several biosensing methodologies for fast, portable,
    and economical detection phytohormones have been developed, including enzymatic
    sensors, aptamer-based sensors, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based sensors,
    and electro-catalysis-based sensors. Key recent advances in detecting primary
    defense-related hormones, SA, and JA are presented here, while sensing methods
    for ET/VOCs are described later in Section 5, as they largely correspond to both
    pathogenic and pest-based stresses in the plants. SA Detection An enzymatic sensing
    approach for the detection of methyl-salicylate was reported in [130], where a
    bi-enzyme recipe containing the enzymes, Salycilate hydroxylase (SH) and Tyrosinase
    (TYR) was employed. The sensors was fabricated on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode
    exhibiting a sensitivity of about 30.6 μ A cm −2 μ M −1 . The principle of detection
    was based on the bi-enzyme-based reactions as follows [131]: SA+NADH+2 H + + O
    2 → SH Catechol+ NAD + + H 2 O+C O 2 ; Catechol+1/2 O 2      TYR o-quinone+
    H 2 O; o-quinone 2 H + +2 e − +Catechol. In another work, a bi-enzyme microfluidic
    electrochemical sensor utilizing the enzymes SH ad TYR recipe on graphene oxide
    substrate was reported [24]. The sensing device consisted of 3-electrode system
    forming a 3D structure and was characterized using chrono-amperometry while showing
    a sensitivity of 34.4 μ A cm −2 per decade change in SA concentration in ( μ M).
    A structure-switching aptamer-based sensor for SA determination was reported in
    [132], where the identified SA aptamer was incorporated onto a nano-structured
    Fabry–Perot interference sensor, and the interference fringes of the reflected
    white light from the sensor were used as transducing signals for SA quantification.
    The sensor exhibited a detection limit of 0.1 μ M with a range of 10 −1 μ M to
    100 μ M, and the sensor was tested for SA determination in rice or Arabidopsis
    leaf samples. Aptamers are oligonucleotide or peptide molecules with affinity
    towards a specific target molecule often accompanied by structural changes during
    binding. The aptamer for SA-binding was developed as follows: the ssDNA library
    was hybridized to a short piece of capture complementary DNA (cDNA) immobilized
    on magnetic beads, where SA-binding induced conformational changes and subsequent
    de-hybridization from the captured cDNA, while the non-binders remained on the
    magnetic beads and could be removed. The SA binding sequences were further amplified
    through asymmetric PCR. In general, aptamers offer advantages like reproducible
    operation, low cost production, and tolerance to a wide range of pH and temperature
    changes as compared to other bio-agents like enzymes and antibodies. A photo-electrochemcial
    (PEC) sensor for SA detection using dual functional MIP-modified organometal lead
    halide perovskite (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ), deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass
    electrode, was presented in [133]. The MIPs precursors were prepared by thermally
    initiated free radical polymerization with SA as the template molecule, methacrylic
    acid (MAA) as the monomers, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the cross-linker,
    and azobisisobutyronitile (AIBN) as the initiator. Next, during film deposition
    of perovskite on the ITO glass, the MIPs precursor solution was added forming
    MIPs/CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 /ITO electrode, which was characterized by recording the
    photocurrent under illumination at different concentrations of SA. The developed
    sensor exhibited a linear relationship between the photocurrent changes and the
    logarithm of SA concentration from 7 × 10 −13 M to 1 × 10 −8 M with a detection
    limit of 2 × 10 −13 M. Overall, the sensor displayed good selectivity and sensitivity
    but had limited range of operation. In addition to aforementioned approaches employing
    bio-agents such as enzymes, aptamers, and MIPs, electro-catalysis-based sensors
    for SA detection have also been reported [25,134,135]. The working principle involves
    the characterization of the electro-oxidation of SA on metallic or carbon electrodes
    using electrochemical (EC) methods such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential
    pulse voltammetry (DPV). The reaction mechanism of SA oxidation involves the formation
    of dihydroxybenzoic acids as the main product, and SA-polymeric compounds as additional
    products [134,135]. A low-cost bio-agent-free EC sensor for SA detection using
    electro-reduced graphene-oxide screen printed electrode was reported in [25],
    where the developed electro-oxidation-based device exhibited a range of 2 μ M
    to 512 μ M, with maximum sensitivity of 600 μ A/mM/cm 2 . The determination of
    SA through EC-oxidation on carbon-fiber electrode was presented in [135], where
    the developed sensor exhibited a linear range of 2 μ M to 3 mM, with a limit of
    detection of 1.7 μ M. A carbon tape electrode modified with handed pencil trace
    for real-time SA detection in infected tomato leaves was presented in [136], where
    a linear range of 10 −6 M to 10 −4 M, with a detection limit of 10 −7 M was observed.
    Additionally, a selectivity test was performed with other common compounds that
    may be present in the plant sap such as indole-3-acetic acid, succinic acid, methyl
    jasmonate, abscisic acid, malic acid, and citric acid, where good selectivity
    was observed. In another work, a paper-based electroanalytical device for in-situ
    determination of SA in living tomato leaves was developed [137]. The sensor consisted
    of MWCNTs/nafion modified carbon tape electrodes, where a piece of the tomato
    leaf (with a small hole punched in) was sandwiched between the fabricated electrode
    and filter paper. The developed sensor exhibited a linear detection range of 0.5
    to 100 μ M. JA Detection Relatively fewer sensing systems have been reported for
    JA detection (when compared to SA sensing) where most of the research has been
    limited to JA determination in laboratory-based settings using analytical methods.
    An analytical method for the determination of JA in plant tissue using HPLC with
    fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) was reported in [138]. Soybean mosaic virus-infected
    leaves were collected and the samples were prepared by grounding the frozen leaves
    (in the presence of liquid nitrogen) in to a powder, followed by addition of acetonitrile
    and ultrasonication at 4 ∘ C, and finally, the extractant was obtained through
    centrifugation. Next, the derivatization (or labeling) of JA was performed in
    the presence of 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-aminozide-difluoroboradiaza-s-indacene (BODIPY-aminozide),
    which exhibits strong fluorescence. Using BODIPY-aminozide as a precolumn derivatizing
    reagent, HPLC-FD was carried out yielding a range of operation of 5 × 10 −10 M
    to 5 × 10 −7 M, and a detection limit of 1.14 × 10 −10 M. In another work, a methyl
    jasmonate (MeJA) EC sensor based on the electro-catalytic oxidation of the alkylene
    group in MeJA molecule using a phosphotungstic acid/graphene oxide (PTA/GO) nanohybrid
    modified graphite electrode was reported [139]. The sensor exhibited a detection
    range of 5 × 10 −7 M to 8 × 10 −5 M with a detection limit of 2 × 10 −7 M in an
    acidic supporting electrolyte medium (0.1 M HClO 4 ). Overall, phytohormone level-based
    plant health monitoring sensors hold great promise for conclusive (as compared
    to imaging-based or spectroscopic methods) stress detection. Understanding the
    role of SA and other hormones in various aspects of plant growth, development
    and interaction with its environment is a rapidly progressing area of research.
    Low-cost phytohormone sensing devices may provide a convenient way for pre-symptomatic
    disease detection and identification. However, in the present state, there is
    a need for developing not only innovative sensing technologies but also definitive
    correlations for hormonal activity and stress in plants. 4. Methodologies for
    Monitoring Herbivorous Pests/Insects Herbivorous insect/pest detection methodologies
    can be classified into three broad categories: (i) imaging-based techniques, (ii)
    VOC monitoring-based detection, and (iii) acoustic methods for pest detection.
    4.1. Imaging-Based Methods for Pest Detection Similar to phytopathogen detection,
    several imaging-based methods have been applied towards plant pest detection,
    and key recent studies are discussed here. Table 5 presents a comparison of the
    key recent imaging-based sensing methods for herbivorous pest monitoring in crops.
    The general working principle is similar to RGB imaging-based phytopathogen detection,
    where the collected insect/pest images are processed to determine and segment
    the regions of interest, followed by the identification and classification of
    the insect/pest-based on the physical characteristics. Table 5. A comparison of
    the key recent imaging-based sensing methods for herbivorous pest monitoring in
    crops. An automated vision-based system for monitoring Asian citrus psyllid (ACP)
    in citrus orchards using artificial intelligence (AI) was reported in [141]. ACP
    is a key pest of citrus due to its role as a vector of HLB disease. The system
    comprised of a modified ground-based vehicle equipped with the following: (i)
    a tapping mechanism to strike tree branches so that ACP may fall on a white board
    (serving as the sampling space), (ii) a grid of cameras to acquire images of the
    white board, (iii) a real-time kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) to
    geolocate ACP detection, and (iv) NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded computational unit
    (NVIDIA TX2 Developer Kit, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for image processing. A two-step
    CNN-based ACP detection system was developed, where the first CNN was trained
    using You Only Look Once (YOLOv3), an object detection system [149] sensitive
    to ACP detection (all possible objects that can be ACP), but not accurate. The
    second CNN, based on YOLOv1, used the images from the first network’s output for
    final classification. The developed system was used to test 90 tress in a citrus
    grove and displayed a precision ( truepositives truepositives+falsepositives )
    of 80% and recall of ( truepositives truepositives+falsenegatives ) of 95%. The
    estimated cost of the automated vision-based ACP detection system was estimated
    to be around $1000. An automatic detection pipeline for identifying and counting
    pests in images taken inside field traps, using deep learning was proposed in
    [146], where Codling moths [150] were identified. Moths captured by pheromone
    traps containing an adhesive liner were imaged using a digital camera. The data
    analysis involved pre-processing using gray-world method to minimize variations
    due to imaging conditions and provide white-balanced images prior to detection.
    Then, a sliding window approach based on CNN was used, where a trained classifier
    was applied to local windows at various locations of the entire image to determine
    the probability (a scalar output between 0 and 1) of the presence of moth in a
    particular patch. Next, non-maximum suppression was performed, followed by thresholding,
    to retain only the windows with maximum local probability, and then only the patches
    over a certain probability were kept. The precision–recall area under the curve
    of about 0.934 was observed. A mobile agricultural robot equipped with photography
    hardware and software for the detection of thrips (Thysanoptera), a pest related
    to strawberry plant, in greenhouses was developed in [145]. The robot moved along
    the rows of potted plants capturing flower images (RGB) using a digital camera
    (Canon EOS M, 18 MP, CMOS, Japan) mounted on the robot arm. The image processing
    was performed as follows: (i) the non-flower regions in the captured images were
    removed by applying the gamma operator. Next, histogram equalization and contrast
    stretching followed by intensity thresholding were used to remove the remaining
    background noise. Then, HSV components were extracted from the RGB values to serve
    as inputs for a SVM-based classifier with radial-basis kernel functions. The classifier
    was trained to not only detect pests but also identify thrips from other insects
    like houseflies, ants, and whiteflies. Moreover, since the shape and color of
    thrips also vary across larvae to adult stages, during the classification, two
    classes, one for larvae and another for adult were dedicated to thrips. Overall,
    a mean percent error (MPE) of about 2.5% was observed in the reported image processing
    system. A human-vision-inspired method for pests detection in tea plants was reported
    in [144], where a collection of 10 categories of insect pests: Locusta migratoria,
    Parasa lepida, Euproctis pseudoconspersa Strand, Empoasca flavescens, Spodoptera
    exigua, Chrysochus chinensis, larva of Laspeyresia pomonella, larva of S. exigua,
    Acrida cinerea, and L. pomonella was investigated. For each category, about 40
    to 70 sample images were collected from online resources. The identification method
    was based on computational models used to model human-vision system. First, the
    saliency using natural statistics (SUN) model was used to extract the region of
    interest. Then a well known model for object recognition with cortex-Like mechanisms
    called Hierarchical Model and X (HMAX) [151] was extended by integrating scale
    invariant feature transform (SIFT) and non-negative sparse coding (NNSC) for improved
    rotational sensitivity of HMAX. Next, SIFT-HMAX model and local configuration
    pattern algorithm were employed to extract the invariant features, which were
    then fed to the SVM-based classifier for recognition. The proposed method achieved
    a recognition rate of 85.5%. An artificial neural network (ANN) coupled image
    processing system for identifying whiteflies (Bemisa tabaci) and thrips (Frankliniella
    occidentalis) on sticky traps in green house agriculture was presented in [147].
    Solid yellow and blue colored traps (to minimize background effects) were digitized
    using Scoutbox sensor (Cropwatch Company, Wageningen, Netherlands), which consisted
    of a closed box, housing a digital camera to insulate light conditions. A total
    of 3185 images were acquired in RGB color format. First, the region of interest
    were identified on each trap based on pixel intensity histograms, where pixels
    with frequency of intensities above 10,000 (predetermined threshold) were set
    as background. Next, a binary image was created from each RGB channel, where pixels
    on the channel outside the background intensity range were classified as objects
    and only solid objects with an area from 50 to 2000 pixels were selected. Image
    segmentation was then performed by first converting the images to L ∗ a ∗ b ∗
    for yellow traps, and HSV format for blue traps. Automatic identification of the
    intensity threshold values was then implemented on each channel, and a logical
    conjunction operation was performed. Subsequently, the morphological features
    (area, convex area, eccentricity, equivalent diameter, major axis length, minor
    axis length, perimeter, centroid, solidity, and extent) were calculated for each
    region of pixels. Finally, a multi-layer feed-forward neural network consisting
    of a two-layer perceptron was trained for classification using 15 previously extracted
    features. The developed algorithm achieved precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.95
    in whitefly identification, while precision of 0.92 and recall of 0.96 were obtained
    for thrip identification. An imaging system powered by deep CNN (DCNN)-based classification
    for identifying five major diseases and pest (banana corm weevil) in banana plants
    was developed in [142], where the dataset comprised of about 18,000 images collected
    under field setting across Africa and Southern India. Images of various parts
    of the plant including the whole banana bunch, leaves, cut pseudostem, fruit bunch,
    and cut fruit were collected. Three different CNN architectures, ResNet50, InceptionV2,
    and MobileNetV1 were trained using the python deep learning library called Tensonflow.
    The diseases were grouped by plant parts, and a different model was trained for
    each plant part, where mean average precision (mAP)-based metric was used to measure
    the accuracy and effectiveness in object detection models: 𝑚𝐴𝑃= 1 #𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑠 ∑ 1
    #𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑠 #𝑇𝑃 #𝑇𝑃+#𝐹𝑃 . (5) In addition to mAP score, a confusion matrix (CM) for
    each selected model was also computed which gave an accuracy per disease (class),
    together with quantitative representation of the classes in which the model was
    mis-classifed or confused. The experimental results achieved accuracy between
    70 to 99%, where MobileNetV1-based architecture provided best results for banana
    corm weevil. In addition to the aforementioned imaging-based pest detection methods,
    several other works have been reported in recent years including (i) a WSN for
    monitoring greenhouse insect pest, where the each wireless sensing node consisted
    of three core components: a Raspberry Pi 3 embedded system, a digital camera module,
    and add-on environmental sensors [140]. Sticky paper traps were imaged every ten
    minutes while humidity, temperature, and ambient light were also recorded. The
    RGB-to-L ∗ a ∗ b ∗ color model conversion was performed, followed by an object
    segmentation by first removing the yellow sticky trap background using static
    binary thresholding. Selective blob detection was then performed on the pre-processed
    image to locate the centroids of the blobs (objects) in the image, where smaller
    (16 × 16 pixels; dirt) and larger (128 × 128 pixels; glare) blobs were removed.
    The cropped 128 × 128 RGB images obtained from the blob centroids were classified
    using an SVM-based classifier, where an average temporal accuracy for insect pest
    counting of 93% was achieved; (ii) a CNN-based architecture named PestNet, developed
    for large-scale multi-class pest detection [143]. An in-field imaging system was
    developed consisting of a pest attracting light, and a pest collection tray fitted
    with a camera to collect pictures. 16 pest classes were considered, where an mAP
    score of 75.46% was achieved; (iii) a computer-vision technique for detecting
    aphids in wheat fields [148]. The original images were pre-processed with filtering
    to enhance the contrast and reduce noise followed by the extraction of histogram
    of oriented gradient (HOG) feature vectors which were subsequently used to establish
    SVM-based classification. Meanwhile, a maximally stable extremal region (MSER)
    algorithm was used on the original images to extract regions of interest and a
    trained SVM was used to identify aphids within the MSERs. An accuracy of 86.81%
    was achieved. 4.2. Acoustic Methods for Detecting Pests One of the key ways pests/insects
    communicate with each other and their surroundings is through acoustic signals
    which can be used as signatures for detecting their presence. Studies on acoustic
    detection of pests have been reported since the early 1900s but have only gained
    momentum in the last two decades [152]. A bio-acoustic sensor for the early detection
    of the red palm weevil (RPW) was reported in [153], where the sensing device was
    composed of an audio probe inserted inside the palm tree trunk, with real-time
    processing circuit, wireless interface for periodic data transfer, and a solar
    panel/battery-based power supply system. A sound representative of the RPW larvae
    feeding action was chosen for detection, where the energy distribution (frequency
    domain representation) of the sound was used as the spectral fingerprint. A detection
    accuracy of about 90% was observed. Several other recent works have been reported
    on acoustic pest detection including (i) an automated acoustic detection platform
    for detecting cicadid pest (Quesada Gigas; QG) in coffee plantations, where an
    SVM-based classifier was developed for distinguishing between background noise
    and QG’s sound [154]. The sensing system was field deployable, costing around
    $30 while exhibiting an accuracy of 96.41%; (ii) the detection of RPW, where piezoelectric
    microphones (inserted inside the tree trunk) were used to collected sound signals
    from a quarantined set of palm trees [155]. The larval feeding sounds: short “clicks”
    and “snaps” in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 8 kHz, and longer lasting sounds
    around 3 kHz were recorded. Manual and automated energy thresholds were used to
    identify pests, where an average true positive rate of 75% was achieved; (iii)
    the exploration of using active sound production of scarab beetle larvae (i.e.,
    stridulations) for species-specific pest monitoring in soils [156]. Acoustic signature
    detection for monitoring pests is a non-invasive, real-time, continuous, low cost
    method which takes advantage of the developed microphone and signal processing
    technologies. However, the method has limited scope as only a small fraction of
    pests make species-specific sounds. Moreover, acoustic signaling-based methods
    are prone to interference from surroundings (natural and man-made) and in general,
    more studies are required to properly access the practical in-field applicability
    of the method. 5. ET/VOCs Detection Methods for Monitoring Biotic Stress in Plants
    Etheylene (ET) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are common to plant
    response under both pathogenic and pest/insect related stresses, and so we discuss
    their detection in their own section here. The hormonal activity of ethylene spans
    a multitude of physiological plant processes including seed germination, fruition,
    and tissue senescence in case of phytopathogen and/or pest attacks. In addition
    to ET, several other VOCs play important roles in general crop health and physiological
    activities such as intra- and inter-plant communication [157], interaction with
    microbes [158], deterring herbivorous pests [36], and inducing defense responses
    [159]. This section describes key methodologies for the detection of ET/VOCs in
    agriculture, involving mass-spectroscopy and electronic nose technology (see Figure
    10). Figure 10. Schematic of an E-nose and a GC-MS-based system for VOC detection
    in plants [160]. Conventionally, gas analysis for plant VOCs is performed using
    standard analytical techniques like the well established gas chromatography-mass
    spectrometry (GC-MS) methods [161,162], and the relatively recent proton transfer
    reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) method [163,164]. In GC-MS-based plant VOC
    analysis, the VOCs can be sampled from the airflow using an absorbent filter,
    which is then rinsed in a solvent and introduced in the heated GC-MS chamber,
    or alternatively, by headspace and solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), where
    the VOC are collected using a solvent coated fiber and directly introduced into
    the heated GC-MS column [161]. The gas molecules are then separated using a mass
    spectrometer (based on the molecular mass). Alternatively, PTR-MS works by ionizing
    the gas sample inside a drift tube by proton transfer (sourced from hydronium
    ion), where the fixed length of the drift tube provides a fixed reaction time
    for the ions as they pass along the tube into a mass spectrometer. The reaction
    time can be calculated from ion transfer properties to separate the gases, and
    the ion signal ratio (proton donor/proton acceptor) can be used to estimate the
    concentration of the analyte, and by combining reaction kinetics with mass spectrometry,
    both identity and quantity of individual organic gases can be obtained [164].
    The main advantage of PTR-MS over GC-MS is its quick response. Although accurate
    and sensitive, GC-MS and PTR-MS require sophisticated equipment, and are thus
    better suited for laboratory-based testing. With regards to portable ET/VOCs sensing,
    bio-mimetic electronic nose (E-nose) devices have emerged as a novel technology
    for gas detection. Several E-nose devices are commercially available [165,166,167],
    and have been employed for VOC detection. E-nose sensors consist of an array of
    chemical gas sensors coupled with transducers such as conductive polymers (polymers
    impregnated gas adsorbing materials resulting in resistance changes), Metal Oxide
    Semiconductor (MOS) device, piezoelectric/acoustic (changes in mass and resonance
    due to gas adsorption) devices, and optical/fluorescent sensors. The signal from
    the transducers is then processed using classification and/or pattern recognition
    algorithms. The sensor arrays can employ gas-specific sensing materials, deposited
    on the listed transducers, which selectively adsorb (or absorb) different gases.
    Gas-specific properties of several chemo-responsive materials for detecting various
    gases are summarized in [168]. Various studies have been reported on the use E-nose
    devices for plant-defense-related VOC monitoring, such as: (i) diagnosing Aphid-stressed
    tomato plants by first using GC-MS and identifying the VOCs emitted by the plant
    under stress including linalool, carveol, and nonane 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethyl
    and enhanced some terpene compounds (e.g., caryopllyllene). Next, commercial E-nose
    devices were employed and a PCA-based algorithm was developed for portable VOC
    recognition with a classification accuracy of 86.7% [160]; (ii) application of
    E-nose for diagnosing grapevine crown gall disease (caused by Agrobacterium vitis)
    [169], where infected grapevine rootstock was sampled in glass tubes overnight
    and target VOCs were determined using HS-SPME coupled GC-MS. Next, commercial
    E-nosed devices were employed and VOC data analysis was performed using PCA and
    linear discriminant analysis (LDA). An accuracy of 83.3% was achieved; (iii) an
    early detection of bacterial disease (fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora
    and blossom blight caused by Pseudomonas syringae) in apple plants by monitoring
    VOC profiles [170], where the possible markers were identified using GC-MS and
    PTR-MS, while the application of commercial E-nose devices were assessed for portable
    operation demonstrating an accuracy of 75% using LDA-based data analysis. In addition
    to the above-mentioned approaches, other ET/VOC sensing have also been reported
    including a smartphone-based VOC fingerprinting platform [171], where the diagnosis
    of late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans) in tomato was demonstrated using
    leaf volatile emissions in the field. The handheld device integrated a disposable
    colorimetric sensor array consisting of plasmonic nanocolorants and chemo-responsive
    organic dyes to detect key plant volatiles at the ppm level within 1 min of reaction.
    Cysteine (Cys)-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) or nanorods (AuNRs) were
    used as plasmonic aggregative colorants for specific recognition of gaseous (E)-2-hexenal,
    one of the main VOC markers emitted during P. infestans infection, with a detection
    limit of 0.4 ppm. Later, a multiplexed sensor array combining Cys-functionalized
    Au nanomaterials and conventional organic colorants were developed for the detection
    and differentiation of a variety of leaf volatiles, including three green leaf
    volatiles ((Z)-3-hexenal, 1-hexenal and (E)-2-hexenol), two phytohormones (methyl
    jasmonate and methyl salicylate), two characteristic late blight markers ((E)-2-hexenal
    and 2-phenylethanol), and three aromatic VOCs (benzaldehyde, 4-ethylguaiacol,
    and 4-ethylphenol) to demonstrate the capability for multiplexing. A molecularly
    imprinted sol-gel (MISG)-based localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensor
    for detecting cis-jasmone (CJ), a plant VOC released in response to herbivore
    insect infestation, was reported in [172]. LSPR involves the interaction of metallic
    nanoparticles (NPs) with EM waves to induce plasmon oscillations at the NP surface
    and can be used as a transduction mechanism for observing changes in the local
    refractive index (RI). Gold nano-islands were fabricated on a glass substrate
    by vacuum sputtering followed by three dimensional imprints of CJ molecules with
    the MISG around the Au nano-islands. It was observed that MISGs containing the
    functional monomer trimethoxyphenylsilane at a 3:1 (v:v) ratio exhibited a higher
    sensitivity and selectivity among the imprints tested while a detection limit
    of 3.5 ppm in air was recorded. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) gas sensor
    array based on MIPs for identifying wood borers infestation by monitoring terpene
    emissions from Platycladus orientalis trunks was reported in [173]. MIPs were
    prepared using the methacrylic acid (MAA) polymermatrix and four characteristic
    terpenes/VOCs ( 𝛼 -pinene, 𝛽 -phellandrene, 3-carene, and cis-thujopsene) as template
    molecules for discriminating between Semanotus bifasciatus (Motschulsky) and Phloeosinus
    aubei Perris (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) infestations. The experimental set-up consisted
    of the four terpene MIPs-based QCM sensors inside a sealed chamber with inlet
    and outlet for gaseous samples. The QCM gas sensors measured the static headspace
    vapors of infested and uninfested trunks after generation for 24 h at 25 ∘ C in
    uniform and suitable Tedlar bags where the absolute value of frequency shift based
    on the sensor response curve was defined as a feature. The response data were
    processed with PCA-LDA for visualization, and for discrimination/classification,
    an SVM-based architecture exhibited a satisfying response with an accuracy of
    93.75%. In another work, a plasmonic crystal-based optical gas sensor for ET,
    methanol, and ammonia detection was reported in [22], where the sensing surface
    consisted of a thin graphene-oxide (GO) layer deposited over a gold coated polymeric
    nanoposts. The working principle involved the gas adsorption by the GO layer modifying
    the refractive index of the plasmonic structure, resulting in a shift in the resonance
    wavelength of the surface plasmon polariton. To distinguish between the three
    types of gaseous species, an array of nanostructured sensors with varying thickness
    of GO were designed as the adsorption of different gases varies with GO thicknesses.
    A principle component analysis (PCA)-based framework was employed to identify
    the three gases, where sensitivities of 0.6 pm/ppm, 3.2 pm/ppm, and 12.84 pm/ppm
    were observed for ET, methanol, and ammonia, respectively. 6. Application of Remote
    Sensing Technologies for Monitoring Biotic Stress in Plants In general, the indirect
    plant disease and pest detection methods discussed so far in this article, particularly
    optical/imaging-based methods, have the potential to be integrated with a satellite
    and/or an airborne carrier and can broadly be classified as remote sensing (RS)
    methods. However, another class of active RS technology which includes radio detection
    and ranging (RADAR) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have also been applied
    towards sensing biotic stresses in plants. RADAR and LiDAR have traditionally
    been used as active methods for measuring distances by recording the travel time
    of emitted electromagnetic waves (radio waves for RADAR, and light/laser sources
    for LiDAR) reflection from a target object. Both RADAR and LiDAR inspired systems
    are applied in plant stress monitoring where some key research works are discussed
    here. The principle of operation of these systems involve capturing structural
    or morphological changes due to diseases and pests. A ground-based LiDAR also
    known as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) system for detecting basal stem rot
    (caused by white-rot fungus Ganoderma boninense) in oil palm canopies was reported
    in [174]. A total of 40 samples of oil palm trees at the age of nine-years-old
    (with heights between 10 to 11 meters) were selected and categorized into four
    disease levels: healthy/disease-free, mildly infected, moderately infected, and
    severely infected. The canopy biometrics were extracted using a TLS scanner which
    was mounted at a height of 1 m, and scans were performed from four different positions
    per palm to obtain a 3D image of the tree. The following parameters were analyzed:
    S200 (canopy strata at 200 cm from the top), S850 (canopy strata at 850 cm from
    the top), crown pixel (number of pixels inside the crown), frond angle (degree
    of angle between fronds), and frond number, where JMP software (SAS Institute,
    North Carolina, USA) was used to analyze the parameters using one-way analysis
    of variance (Kruskal–Wallis test). It was concluded that a linear model consisting
    of all the five parameters provides best results where an average accuracy of
    80% for severity level classification and 86.67% for healthy–unhealthy classification
    was observed. The capability of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for evaluating
    the internal structure of tree trunks and detecting tree decay associated with
    emerging infectious diseases like Ash dieback, acute oak decline (AOD), and Xylella
    fastidiosa was reported in [175]. Measurements of tree trunk samples were taken
    using the Aladdin 2-GHz hand-held CO antenna from IDS GeoRadar (part of Hexagon).
    The core measurement principle involved digital reconstruction of the internal
    tree trunk structure based on Debye properties of the tree layers using the GPR
    system. Two data processing methodologies: modified Kirchhoff migration and reverse-time
    migration were applied for qualitative reconstruction. It was shown that the system
    was able to model the internal structure of the tree trunk, however, further investigation
    with a larger number of samples may be required to fully assess the proposed method’s
    performance. Other recent works on active RS-based methods for plant health monitoring
    include: (i) assessing the potential of dual-wavelength terrestrial LiDAR in early
    detection of bark beetle (Ips typographus) infestation [176]. Two terrestrial
    LiDAR systems (operating at 905 nm and 1550 nm) were used to measure 29 mature
    Norway spruce trees that showed mild to moderate symptoms. Several intensity metrics
    were derived from LiDAR data as inputs and LDA-based analysis was performed yielding
    an average classification accuracy of about 66%; (ii) evaluation of a GPR-based
    system for detection HLB infection in citrus trees by mapping their root architecture
    [177]. A GPR (TRU™ Model, Tree Radar, Inc., Silver Spring, MA, USA) equipped with
    a 1600 MHz antenna was mounted on a mobile cart to generate root morphology. The
    system was able to distinguish between dead and alive roots, based largely on
    the difference between their dielectric properties due to water content variations.
    Qualitative efficacy of the developed system was shown and proposed to be of use
    in detecting soil-borne diseases in citrus trees; (iii) a bistatic LiDAR system
    mounted on a UAV/drone for monitoring strawberry canopies inside a greenhouse
    to detect symptoms of powdery mildew [178]. The principle of operation was based
    on detecting the changes in plant’s carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) flux resulting from
    variation in the photosynthesis efficiency due to infection (CO 2 emissions decrease
    with disease progression). The developed system consisted of a static receiver
    that recorded the LiDAR signal (wavelength between 1572.38 nm to 1572.98 nm) from
    a transmitter mounted on the UAV, and the data was processed to determine the
    CO 2 flux based on the absorption characteristics above the crop canopies. The
    feasibility of the system was demonstrated; however, quantitative performance
    was not reported. Overall, RADAR and LiDAR are well-developed technologies that
    have recently found use in plant biotic stress monitoring applications where extensive
    studies and experimentation is required to fully evaluate their capabilities.
    In addition to detecting plant stress, the active RS technology is employed in
    various other agro-ecosystem monitoring applications such as phenotyping plants
    based on their physical characteristic [179], visualizing plant structures like
    canopies and roots [180,181], and observing pest and/or herbivore behaviors [182].
    In the present scenario, active RS-based systems exhibit a unique advantage in
    terms of feasibility for high-throughput automated drone/UAV-based agricultural
    sensing applications but often come with a high initial cost. 7. Discussion and
    Conclusions This article described the current state of the sensing methodologies
    for monitoring biotic stresses in plants. Key methods for detecting phytopathogenic
    infections and herbivorous pest/insect infestations were reviewed, where the sensing
    mechanisms were described and key recent works reported. Phytopathogen sensing
    methods were categorized as direct pathogenic versus indirect plant response-based.
    Direct methods focused on identifying the pathogen directly using nucleic acid-based
    and pathogen-protein-based (serological/immunological) techniques such as PCR,
    RPA, LAMP, ELISA, LFIA, and immunosensors. Alternatively, indirect phytopathogen
    detection methods identified the plant defense related responses, both morphological
    and physiological. The plant response-based indirect disease detection techniques
    reported here include, imaging-based methods, fluorescence-based methods, spectroscopic
    techniques, phytohormone-level-based methods, and VOC-based sensors. Overall,
    direct pathogen detection methods offer excellent specificity, while the indirect
    ones provide a crop health analysis following plant immune responses. In general,
    indirect methods are relatively less labor intensive and hold greater scope for
    early detection under practical in-field setting. Monitoring primary defense-related
    phytohormone-levels may hold potential for identifying diseases, but more studies
    are required to discover and establish the essential correlations. Summarily,
    in the present state, direct and indirect methods for sensing pathogenic presence/stress
    can be used simultaneously and in conjunction to form a complete system for crop
    health monitoring and response, where the early signs of stress can be monitored
    using plant response-based indirect approaches, while further analysis can be
    performed using the direct pathogen identification methods. The article further
    surveyed the pest/insects detection methods, that included machine-vision-based
    methods, pest acoustic-signal detection, and VOC sensing-based methods. In the
    case of pest attacks, the density of a specific infestation is a critical stress
    parameter, and therefore the sensing techniques largely focus on spatio-temporal
    count and identity of the pest. The common steps involved in imaging-based detection
    are photographing the insect prior to analysis, either directly or on the plant
    tissue or using specially designed traps, and then classify for obtaining insect
    species and count. Several systems have been developed, however, continuous efforts
    are being directed towards improving the accuracy and specificity of imaging-based
    methods. Acoustic-signaling-based approaches, on the other hand, rely on detecting
    the infestation depending on the sounds emitted by the insects while communicating
    or interacting with their environment. These methods are applicable only to a
    small subset of pests and require further studies in order to develop robust in-field
    monitoring systems. Monitoring VOCs have also been reported as early indicators
    of biotic stresses in plants, however clear distinction between VOC emissions
    in plants due to specific pest and/or pathogen attacks are not completely understood.
    However, continuous progress is being made towards forming functional VOC-stress
    correlations as well as developing VOC detection methods. The approaches discussed
    here include: analytical methods (GC-MS), E-nose devices, and other approaches
    (biosensing and optical). Among these, E-nose-based sensors have emerged as an
    effective technology offering great potential for in-field operation where efforts
    are being directed towards effective sampling procedures, improving accuracy and
    specificity, and developing long-term continuous monitoring systems. Where E-nose
    devices focus on detecting common agriculturally and environmentally important
    gases, biosensing and optical methods aim to identify specific VOC emissions like
    terpenes, and other gaseous metabolites (for example cis-jasmone, and methyl salicylate).
    Additionally, active RS technologies like RADAR and LiDAR also find use in applications
    for sensing biotic stress in plants. These technologies are fairly well-known
    and are being progressively used in various aspects of agriculture such as recording
    canopy, plant height and root structures, and phenotyping applications. While
    both RADAR- and LiDAR-based systems commonly provide morphological information,
    LiDAR may have the potential to record plant’s physiological parameters like,
    water content and CO 2 flux. Overall, testing the application of active RS technologies
    to provide plant stress-related information is a rapidly progressing area of research
    that may soon enable large-scale automated crop and forest health monitoring systems.
    8. Future Prospects and Research Directions for Monitoring Biotic Stress in Plants
    In the present scenario, there is great scope for making significant improvements
    in agricultural output efficiencies by reducing crop losses to meet the present
    and future demands of humanity. Use of technology in farming practices is gaining
    rapid momentum where reportedly, the global technology market in agriculture is
    expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% from 2019 to
    reach $34.9 billion by 2027 [183]. As described in this article, there are a variety
    of technologies available for detecting and identifying the different types of
    biotic stresses in crops. However, to increase the applicability and adoption
    of the stress monitoring technologies future efforts may be directed towards first,
    developing functional, easy-to-use, and reliable sensing methods for predictive/pre-symptomatic
    monitoring as well as accurate post-symptomatic diagnosis for enabling effective
    measures to minimize losses while reducing the use of harmful chemicals. Second,
    it is known that biotic stressors vary with plant species as well as locations
    across the globe, therefore, effective site and species specific strategies for
    standardized protocols and minimal sampling needs to be developed for both generalized
    as well as specific plant health monitoring that are cost-effective, portable,
    and high impact. Thirdly, in addition to water, nutrient, and environmental sensing
    data, crop stress monitoring must also be considered as an important parameter
    in agricultural management to accurately access the crop needs leading to sustainability
    through precision in agriculture. Finally, the overall development of the methodologies
    for monitoring biotic stress in plants stem from studies focusing on understanding
    their physiological processes and defense mechanisms hence, continuous progress
    is required in improving our knowledge about the rules of life and survival across
    the diverse flora on earth. Author Contributions Conceptualization, B.K.; methodology,

  description: The advent of autonomous navigation, positioning, and general robotics
    technologies has enabled the improvement of small to miniature-sized unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs, or ‘drones’) and their wide uses in engineering practice.
    Recent research endeavors further envision a systematic integration of aerial
    drones and traditional contact-based or ground-based sensors, leading to an aerial–ground
    wireless sensor network (AG-WSN), in which the UAV serves as both a gateway besides
    and a remote sensing platform. This paper serves two goals. First, we will review
    the recent development in architecture, design, and algorithms related to UAVs
    as a gateway and particularly illustrate its nature in realizing an opportunistic
    sensing network. Second, recognizing the opportunistic sensing need, we further
    aim to focus on achieving energy efficiency through developing an active radio
    frequency (RF)-based wake-up mechanism for aerial–ground data transmission. To
    prove the effectiveness of energy efficiency, several sensor wake-up solutions
    are physically implemented and evaluated. The results show that the RF-based wake-up
    mechanism can potentially save more than 98.4% of the energy that the traditional
    duty-cycle method would otherwise consume, and 96.8% if an infrared-receiver method
    is used.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract The advent of autonomous navigation, positioning,
    and general robotics technologies has enabled the improvement of small to miniature-sized
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or ‘drones’) and their wide uses in engineering
    practice. Recent research endeavors further envision a systematic integration
    of aerial drones and traditional contact-based or ground-based sensors, leading
    to an aerial–ground wireless sensor network (AG-WSN), in which the UAV serves
    as both a gateway besides and a remote sensing platform. This paper serves two
    goals. First, we will review the recent development in architecture, design, and
    algorithms related to UAVs as a gateway and particularly illustrate its nature
    in realizing an opportunistic sensing network. Second, recognizing the opportunistic
    sensing need, we further aim to focus on achieving energy efficiency through developing
    an active radio frequency (RF)-based wake-up mechanism for aerial–ground data
    transmission. To prove the effectiveness of energy efficiency, several sensor
    wake-up solutions are physically implemented and evaluated. The results show that
    the RF-based wake-up mechanism can potentially save more than 98.4% of the energy
    that the traditional duty-cycle method would otherwise consume, and 96.8% if an
    infrared-receiver method is used. Keywords: unmanned aerial vehicle; aerial–ground
    network; energy efficiency; sensor activation; radio frequency 1. Introduction
    With advances in autonomous navigation, positioning, and in general robotics technologies,
    small to miniature-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or colloquially called
    drones) are witnessing their ever-increasing use in engineering practice. Small
    UAVs are low-cost, agile, and flexible in imaging payloads as remote sensing platforms
    when compared with traditional space- or airborne platforms (e.g., satellites
    or aircrafts) [1]. Today’s UAVs have incorporated the latest GPS technology. Many
    small UAVs, especially the multi-motor ones, can fly following predetermined GPS
    waypoints. Some advanced drones have been equipped with lost-cost radar or vision
    sensors, acquiring a minimum level of flying beyond (visual) line-of-sight (BVLOS
    or BLOS) due to their sense-and-avoid capabilities [2,3,4]. This potentially would
    further render small UAVs an attractive remote sensing platform for numerous different
    applications. On the other hand, wireless sensing network (WSN) technology has
    matured in recent years, with applications found in many scientific and engineering
    projects. Many WSN applications focus on ad-hoc tasks, wherein the local sensors
    are deployed with a goal of completing the task in a short time. Therefore, the
    energy consumption is not excessive. However, for deploying WSNs over a geospatially
    large or spatially complex space with an expected long-term monitoring mission,
    both WSN implementation and energy efficiency become the primary challenges. One
    possible application of sensing is in farming land, wherein precision agriculture
    (PA) practice demands data sensing at different granular (spatial and temporal)
    scales [5]. Another application scenario is performing structural health monitoring
    (SHM) for civil structures and lifeline infrastructure systems that are often
    massive and spatially complex (e.g., urban buildings, long-span bridges, and power
    transmission lines/towers, etc.). For structures that are critical to society,
    sensors, and especially WSNs, can be installed in these structures in their lifetimes
    to achieve ‘smart structures’. Continuous health monitoring through these WSNs
    provides stakeholders a basis for ensuring public safety and for decision-making
    when dealing with unexpected natural or technological disruptions [6]. Taking
    the two areas of PA and SHM as the application settings (Figure 1) it is asserted
    that, in both situations, the necessity of combining UAV-based remote sensing
    and WSNs is straightforward. In PA, the traditional practice relies on sensing
    data such as space- or airborne imagery for decision-making and management in
    farming [7,8,9]. However, the high cost and the long revisit period of satellite
    or aerial imagery may prevent applying precision agriculture solutions at any
    location and time around the world. Images taken by low altitude UAVs give an
    alternative solution in the emerging precision agriculture practice [10,11,12].
    In addition, since microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and, particularly,
    the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) sensing technology have been rapidly improved
    in recent decades, many researchers have proposed and implemented different ground-based
    wireless sensor solutions for facilitating precision agriculture [13,14,15,16,17].
    To achieve data fusions and more intelligent and tactical operations in these
    sensing modalities, integration of UAVs and ground-based WSNs becomes a rational
    choice. In the arena of SHM, the traditional approach is to deploy wired or wireless
    sensors to obtain the real-time responses of structures to environmental or hazard-induced
    vibrations [18,19,20,21]. In reality, however, for structures with slight to moderate
    damage, such as local cracking and corrosion, visual or remote sensing-based inspection
    is the most efficient approach to date. In recent years, as UAV technology has
    penetrated into many industrial sectors, small UAVs have enabled remote sensing
    that is low-cost, highly mobile, and is being treated as an emerging tool that
    expands the SHM technology inventory [22,23,24]. This further corroborates the
    necessity of combining WSNs and UAV-based remote sensing technologies. Figure
    1. Conceptual illustrations of the proposed aerial–ground wireless sensing network
    (AG-WSN) for field monitoring: (a) complex 3D field in an urban setting and (b)
    largely 2D terrain field in an agriculture setting. Reflecting on the trends in
    PA, SHM, and other similar geospatial-scale monitoring applications for critical
    missions, we have proposed and developed a prototype to realize a wireless aerial
    imaging and ground-sensing network; in short, it is termed the aerial–ground wireless
    sensing network (AG-WSN) [25]. First, this AG-WSN features the use of one or multiple
    UAVs as the primary imaging nodes, which will serve as the gateway to the ground
    sensors; second, the wireless sensing units are deployed (by UAV delivering or
    manual installation) in the ground (or ground structures) over a geospatially
    large or a spatially complex space. The combination of low altitude imaging and
    ground sensing provides the power of fusing remotely captured images with a high
    resolution and point-based ground-truth data in the field. The high mobility of
    the UAV allows it to be deployed opportunistically according to scheduled tasks
    or in response to unexpected urgencies (e.g., disasters). Combining the collaborative
    aerial and ground sensing and the opportunistic operation modes (e.g., a ground
    node may be only active when the UAV hovers above it and collects data from it),
    we state that the proposed AG-WSN can potentially provide the most high-fidelity
    and most flexible sensing solutions to many monitoring problems arising from the
    need to assess geospatially large and complex built/agriculture environments.
    In this paper we first address the opportunistic nature of the AG-WSN by reviewing
    the related UAV-WSN integration efforts and proposing a conceptual operation design,
    which further motivates the proposition of sensor activation for network energy
    efficiency. Centering around sensor activation, we propose to develop a sensor
    wake-up solution. Related work is reviewed that shows the benefits and drawbacks
    of different wake-up designs and the rationale for choosing an active radio frequency
    (RF) mechanism. Subsequently, a general out-band RF wake-up mechanism is developed
    and demonstrated. For a comparative purpose, the infrared wake-up prototype is
    implemented too. We further conduct a comprehensive study on energy conservation,
    followed by the conclusions and remarks for this paper. The scholarly contribution
    in the design of this work is two-fold: first, it provides a realistic design
    of active RF-based wake-up mechanisms for sensor activation in a novel aerial–ground
    sensing network (AG-WSN), which bears the goals of rapid prototyping and having
    a realistic application in urban- or farming-scale monitoring tasks; second, the
    experimental evaluation reveals the superb effectiveness of the proposed wake-up
    method and its appropriateness for the AG-WSN system. The technical contribution
    in the experimentation of this work also includes (1) the use of a digital imaging
    approach to measure the wake-up time delay and (2) the resulting time-dependent
    rates of the battery-based power consumption using three different wake-up methods.
    2. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Wireless Sensing Network (UAV-WSN) Integration, Opportunistic
    Sensing, and Research Needs To our best knowledge, there were only a few efforts
    that attempted to integrate UAVs with wireless sensor networks. In [26], UAVs
    were considered as mobile sinks for ground sensor data dissemination. This approach
    intended to optimize the route from a given sensor node on the ground to a few
    mobile sinks that move in the area. Authors in [27] presented a different approach
    that kept the sensor network continually connected. It used multiple UAVs to establish
    a reliable relay network to guarantee the delivery of data produced by the wireless
    network nodes on the ground to the users. Given these few simulation-based and
    conceptual efforts, even fewer efforts are found that physically realized a UAV-based
    sensing network system. In a recent effort, the authors developed a WSN using
    a fixed-wing UAV as the aerial gateway for marine data collection [28]. In our
    recent effort, we further investigated the interference between the WiFi-based
    video transmission link and the ZigBee-based ground-data transmission links [25].
    The use of flying single or multiple UAVs, either as a mobile sensor node or a
    data sink, triggers the need to optimize network efficiency between sensors and
    sinks. Energy cost is an inevitable constraint, considering that both the UAVs
    and ground sensors are, to date, usually battery-powered. An opportunistic network
    is the emerging technology that solves such an optimization problem. In [29],
    protocols were proposed to better exploit the durations of high-quality channel
    conditions. Based on that, authors [30] proposed routing protocols that increase
    the throughput of large unicast transfers in a multi-hop wireless network. There
    are also a number of research efforts on optimizing resource and performance in
    wireless sensor networks. In [31], the authors considered a different scenario
    where the paths from message sources to their destinations do not always exist.
    Then the authors analyzed protocols that alleviated the problem of chronically
    disconnected paths by having a node store the packet, carrying it until meeting
    another relay node and forwarding the packet to the other relay node. In a more
    recent effort, researchers also developed middleware that implemented the opportunistic
    network into mobile social networks [32]. It is noted that for general opportunistic
    networking systems (without using a UAV as a gateway node), different protocols
    are proposed, including the flooding protocol and the history-based protocol (e.g.,
    [33,34]). Another possible approach at a higher level is to apply the software
    defined network (SDN) concept into an opportunistic system. In a recent work [35],
    the author proposed an energy efficient SDN framework for wireline–wireless cross
    networks, which can potentially be helpful for large-scale deployment. Last, it
    is stated that these optimization or software-based schemes mostly focus on designing
    improved communication protocols by assuming that either the UAVs or the sensors
    are not constrained by the battery-based power. To illustrate such energy constraint,
    Figure 2 illustrates a conceptual AG-WSN, where (besides being the imaging and
    computing hub) the UAV is designed as a robotic vehicle that flies to ground sensors
    at tactical locations. This operational mode, and furthermore, the possible loss
    of sensors, sensor malfunctions, and out-of-range communication, renders the underlying
    network as opportunistic, which affects energy consumption in the UAV and sensors.
    Figure 2. Conceptual field development of an AG-WSN and opportunistic networking:
    (a) sample field sub-networks; (b) a sub-network case wherein all sensors work
    normally and the UAV receives data directly or via relay without flying to individual
    sensors; (c) a sub-network case wherein some sensor failure is allowed and the
    UAV needs to be mobile to collect data; and (d) a sub-network case wherein the
    sensors are far with each not allowing relay, and the UAV needs to be fully mobile
    to fly to individual sensors for data collection. In Figure 2a four subnets are
    shown, which indicate four physically isolated sensor networks in the fields,
    except that the UAV can fly to each subnet to execute opportunistic sensing. Figure
    2b indicates the idealized situation where sensor failure (or other malfunctions)
    and energy consumption does not need to be considered. Hence, assuming each node
    Nmn can communicate with its neighboring nodes Nm±1,n±1 through a wireless connection,
    when the UAV flies into this sub-network some of the nodes are in the communication
    range of the UAV (within the red dashed-line circle), while some are not. The
    UAV will pick one of the nodes in the range as a relay node, herein which is N21,
    and collect data from any other node in this subnet. Figure 2c illustrates when
    sensor failure happens; the UAV can move from one disconnected zone to another
    one. Figure 2d demonstrates a different scenario where all sensor nodes are far
    away from each other and no wireless connection can be established between them.
    In this case, the UAV will reach within each node’s communication range to communicate
    with individual nodes. Then, the existing optimal communication protocols can
    be used. When the energy consumption of either the UAV or sensor networks is considered,
    optimization in the physical layer (rather than in the communication protocols)
    needs to be addressed. Two apparent scenarios exist: (1) through spatial path-energy
    optimization the UAV finds the optimal flying path through the geospatially deployed
    ground sensors, for which it belongs to a typical traveling salesmen problem (TSP)
    and is being tackled in our recent research [36]; and (2) through a sensor activation
    approach, as being concentrated on in this paper, such that sensors are only active
    when the UAV is in its neighborhood. 3. Sensor Activation and Related Work Although
    solar power or other intermittent energy supply techniques exist, battery power
    continues to be considered as the most reliable source for powering sensors and
    robots. By implementing the commonly adopted duty-cycle method, wireless sensor
    nodes could be pre-programmed to wake up and communicate with the gateway, then
    go back to sleep after communicating. This approach for extending battery life
    has been treated as a default function in many commercial wireless sensors. A
    number of researchers also attempted to optimize power management to further extend
    the battery life of WSNs [37,38,39,40]. However, one key problem that prevents
    us from realizing long-term aerial–ground sensing is the opportunistic nature
    of deploying the UAV (gateway) and the sensor nodes. In an AG-WSN, the gateway
    (as a payload of the UAV) is deployed spatially to proceed toward the ground sensors
    on a non-scheduled basis or randomly upon abrupt events. This further implies
    that the ground sensors do not have ‘knowledge’ or are not programmable to realize
    duty-cycle sensing. If the ground sensors are turned on to include at least the
    microcontroller and communication units (whereas the sensing units may be on or
    off according to the duty cycles), the battery of the sensor nodes may be drained
    quickly. One straightforward approach to such energy inefficiency issues is to
    wake up ground sensor nodes when the UAV is deployed as needed to approach the
    sensors without any preprogramming. In this paper, we first propose to use a radio
    frequency (RF)-based out-of-band wake-up mechanism. Then, comparative studies
    are conducted to investigate their energy saving performance against two other
    wake-up mechanisms. Using a traditional star-like sensor network, the analytical
    and experimental studies show solid evidence that the RF-based wake-up mechanism
    outperforms the other two solutions on energy consumption. Earlier efforts reveal
    that data transmission in a WSN is generally very expensive in terms of energy
    consumption, whereas data collection (or the sensing itself) consumes significantly
    less [41]. For this reason, various methods are developed to extend the life of
    battery-powered WSNs by reducing the power consumption of the wireless modules.
    A significant number of efforts were found that focused on developing lower level
    network protocols by adopting duty-cycle based solutions [42,43,44]. These studies
    aimed to optimize the network protocols, specifically through reducing the energy
    consumption during the idle or the listening time of the wireless modules. For
    example, the authors in [45] proposed an adaptive medium access control (MAC)
    protocol, which introduced a flexible duty-cycle method and claimed to reduce
    96% of energy use compared with traditional protocols. However, the core concern
    for these duty-cycle solutions is that the wireless modules do not know when the
    data transmission is coming or required, and the node must listen periodically
    to limit data latency; thus, the duty-cycle ratio cannot go arbitrarily low [46].
    Also, duty-cycle methods may have problems with delay and synchronism and, hence,
    the protocol is relatively complicated. As such, using waking-up mechanisms to
    answer this concern has been extensively studied. A number of sensor activation
    methods have been proposed to date. Essentially, such an activation approach features
    a waking-up mechanism for activating sensing modules in an as-needed (or on-demand)
    basis. There are two categories of methods when considering wake-up mechanisms
    for use in wireless networks: in-band and out-band. If an in-band method is used,
    a special value is transmitted through the data channel to send out the wake-up
    signal. By contrast, a separate channel is needed to realize such a waking-up
    mechanism in an out-band method. Using in-band methods can reduce the complexity
    and cost of the implementation. A recent study on the in-band wake-up method [47]
    claimed that, by using both game theory and reinforcement learning techniques,
    it achieved very effective sleep/wake-up scheduling. However, it kept the wireless
    communication channel busy and may have required more energy consumption. From
    an energy-efficiency perspective, the out-band approach is more suitable for the
    proposed concept that emphasizes opportunistic aerial-ground sensing. There are
    many studies that employ the out-band wake-up mechanism [48]. In this paper, they
    are categorized into two groups according to their communication medium: (1) non-RF
    based and (2) RF-based. In a non-RF based mechanism, researchers proposed wake-up
    methods using infrared (IR), optical, and acoustic signals. The authors in [49]
    developed an IR LED-based wake-up mechanism, in which the receiver was a photo-detector
    that received IR signal and then generated an interrupt. The authors stated that
    their IR design only consumed 12 μW while listening. It is noted that the obvious
    drawback of this prototype is the sensitivity of the circuits to external light
    and vulnerability to ambient noise. In [50], the authors presented a home-energy
    management system using infrared, signal-based control over a Zigbee network.
    In this system, an infrared receiver was attached to the Zigbee gateway. The Zigbee
    gateway was responsible for communicating with other home appliances, whereas
    the infrared remote control was the out-band wake-up channel used to wake up the
    Zigbee network. Unfortunately, this paper did not mention the power consumption
    of the IR receiver. To our understanding, this type of IR receiver in the paper
    is commercially available and similar to the one used in our experiment, as shown
    in this paper, which has a better resistance to noise at the cost of a much higher
    power consumption, and it may require up to 45 mW according to our experiment.
    Optical communication is another non-RF option for the secondary wake-up channel.
    Two efforts in [51,52] used free-space optical (FSO) communication as the transceiver.
    The receiver, at idle listening, consumes 317 μW and 695 pW. However, the transceiver
    and receiver both need to be placed in line-of-sight (LOS), and the data rate
    is slow. It is impractical for use in a UAV since it mostly does not stay in a
    position that accurately faces the transmitter. Thus, this option is not suitable
    for our application. The AG-WSN scenario may also limit the use of acoustics as
    wake-up methods [53,54] due to the noise produced by the UAV blades. Ultrasonic,
    as stated in [55,56], may avoid the noise made by the UAV. It uses a piezoelectric
    transducer that converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy for generating
    wake-up interrupts. However, most ultrasonic communication and ranging efforts,
    to date, are applied in indoor (short-range) or LOS scenarios [57,58]. In comparison
    to the non-RF based wake-up mechanisms reviewed above, RF-based communication
    has the advantages of not requiring LOS, it has better noise and interference
    tolerance, a higher data rate, and it is more cost-effective. Research on the
    RF-based wake-up mechanism can be divided into two designs: passive wake-up and
    active wake-up, both of which have been well studied in the laboratory environment.
    In a passive design, the RF receiver harvests energy from the transmitter to power
    itself, thus, requiring no power supply [59,60,61]. In [62], the authors simulated
    a passive RF wake-up receiver, in which they indicated that comparing with the
    existing duty-cycle method, their RF wake-up could significantly enhance energy
    efficiency by up to 70%. There are also simulations on both passive and active
    RF wake-up circuits, such as [63,64]; the authors of these efforts later implemented
    the passive RF circuit into a sensor network with a multi-hop capability [65].
    However, among these passive RF-based methods, information on the communication
    range between the transceivers was not found. In addition, it was reported that
    the harvested energy by the receiver may decrease with increasing distance between
    the receiver and the transmitter. The authors in [66,67] showed that the hardware
    setup could only reach a maximum distance of 4 m for a successful wake-up. Considering
    the AG-WSN scenario proposed in this work, the passive RF-based wake-up design
    is not suitable. Regarding the active RF wake-up design, as mentioned in [46],
    there are 13 active RF-based wake-up methods using discrete components, whereas
    there are 29 methods using complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS technology.
    The most significant parameters relevant to these designs and prototypes for the
    interest of the proposed AG-WSN configuration are power consumption, range, address
    decoding capability, wake-up latency, and balancing. For example, the author in
    [68] configured the wake-up receiver using discrete components and claimed to
    achieve 120 m of communication range. However, the receiver consumed 1620 μW at
    the state of idle-listening, which is too high for the battery-powered nodes.
    There is a low-power design in [69], which only consumed 52 μW. Unfortunately,
    the authors did not provide a range test. A favorable design was presented in
    [70] recently. It achieved a communication range of 50 m at idle-listening with
    a power consumption of 1.2 μW. Unfortunately, at the time of our experiment, there
    was no market-ready product or porotype based on this design. In this paper, the
    use of off-the-shelf components is stressed in our prototyping and experimental
    validations, with the goal of rapidly putting the proposed AG-WSN into practice.
    As many researchers have similarly done, the AS393X wake-up receiver has been
    used in many efforts and designs [71,72,73,74,75]. Among these researchers, the
    author in [74] used AS3933, which is the same chip in our experiment, to prototype
    the receiver circuit to have an 87 m communication range, at the cost of more
    than 5000 μW of power consumed when decoding the wakeup signal. Also, in a recent
    paper, the authors compared the RF wake-up mechanism and the low-power listening
    techniques [76]. They concluded similarly what we achieved in our energy evaluation
    results in this paper. However, the authors of this paper did not measure the
    delay caused by the RF wake-up transmission, and their power consumption measurement
    was not based on batteries, but a constant power supply, hence, it lacked a realistic
    configuration. 4. Proposed Energy Efficient Sensing Network 4.1. Topology and
    Implementation In our aerial–ground approach, the UAV was the wireless network
    gateway, which was responsible for communicating with each individual sensor node
    that was deployed in the field. Although there are many wireless protocols that
    can be configured for these sensors, we chose the XBee (a modified Zigbee wireless
    protocol) wireless module for constructing the network, since its power consumption
    is relatively low. The XBee protocol allows three types of network topologies,
    which include: star, mesh, and cluster-tree. Although mesh and cluster-tree networks
    have a very flexible network structure, they both require some sensor nodes in
    the network for relaying data to the gateway. This means that these relay nodes
    have to either always be active or be duty-cycle active, further consuming a significant
    amount of power. Alternatively, the star topology does not require any node to
    relay information, and they can be kept in sleep mode for most of the time. When
    using the star topology, the UAV will be the XBee coordinator (gateway) for collecting
    data from multiple ground nodes in the communication range. More importantly,
    the high-mobility UAV will wake up multiple ground sensor nodes from their sleeping
    state based on the demand of the UAV, which can fly overhead to perform sensor
    activation and data collection on an individual or group of sensor nodes. Therefore,
    the star topology was considered the most appropriate topology for our proposed
    aerial–ground network. One concern is that using UAV as a flying gateway may consume
    more energy per UAV flight than what could potentially be saved in our wake-up
    mechanism. In most cases, the batteries in sensor nodes are hard to replace due
    to a variety of reasons, e.g., the position of the node may be difficult to reach,
    or the battery is sealed in a box and buried in soil or within structures to avoid
    harsh weather conditions. The key concept of our approach is to reduce the consumption
    of the sensor-node batteries in the field as much as possible to sustain service
    times as long as possible. For the power consumption, we state that in reality
    multiple identical UAVs with multiple high-capacity battery backups can be used
    to perform their functions in remote sensing and serving as the network gateway.
    Last, for implementing the sensing nodes, we use Libelium’s Waspmote® (Zaragoza,
    Spain) as our ground sensing nodes [77]. The Waspmote sensing node contains a
    low-power MCU, embedded sensors, and optional wireless module slots. It consumes
    quite a small amount of energy when its sleeping mode is selected. 4.2. General
    Active Out-Band Wake-Up Mechanism As reviewed earlier, an active, out-band wake-up
    mechanism was chosen for the proposed AG-WSN. To understand this mechanism, Figure
    3 summarizes the state and action diagram for the wake-up mechanism and the sensor-node
    operation. A description is given as follows: Figure 3. State and action diagram
    of the ground sensor nodes and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). (1) When the
    sensor node is deployed in the field it is pre-programmed with a duty-cycle sensing
    schedule. It starts off in sleep mode, which we call the initial state. Only the
    wake-up receiver is listening in our example, which is either an infrared or RF
    wake-up receiver. (2) If a wake-up signal is received by the sensor node, it will
    check whether the signal matches the pre-stored pattern. If not, the node ignores
    the signal and changes back to the initial state. (3) If the wake-up signal matches
    the stored pattern the node will wake up, start the XBee module, and turn off
    the wake-up receiver. Then, the XBee begins scanning the gateway on the UAV. (4)
    If the XBee module fails to find the gateway in a couple of tries, the node shuts
    down the XBee module and returns to the initial state. (5) If the XBee module
    successfully connects to the gateway, it starts communication with the UAV as
    programmed (e.g., sensing data or updated schedules). (6) After the communication
    ends, the node returns to the initial state again. It is noted that in this design
    the sensing cycle is preprogrammed and may not match the wake-up cycle when the
    UAV is approaching. This is because the sensing cycle happens more often than
    the UAV data collection cycle. In a practical application such as in an SHM or
    PA sensing system, these sensors may be pre-programmed to wake up serval times
    a day to sense the ground-truth data, while the UAV only approaches these individual
    sensor nodes once a day, or even less frequently in the case of flying on demand.
    In this case, the sensor nodes can store the data locally and send all the data
    to the gateway once the UAV wakes up the nodes. Although this would possibly force
    the sensor nodes to send massive amounts of data in practice, we find the data
    sizes vary significantly in different applications. One example is the environmental
    monitoring project, as shown in Figure 4. In this garden monitoring project, the
    sensor nodes included the modalities of soil temperature and moisture, atmosphere
    pressure, humidity, and temperature. The results showed that each sensing cycle
    produced less than 500 bytes of data to transmit with the sensing cycle setup
    at every hour, and the total data collected from one sensor node was less than
    12 K bytes. In another test the vibration sensors were attached, which required
    the sensor to run for 1 min at 20 Hz for each cycle. The data produced in each
    cycle was about 5 K bytes, which led to a total of 120 K bytes of data for a single
    day if the sensing cycle was set to every hour. That said, the Xbee module adopted
    in this work claims to have a maximum data rate of 30 K bytes/s, which is fast
    enough for the UAV to collect all the data from the sensor nodes. Figure 4. An
    actual WSN deployed in the field, using the same sensor modules tested in this
    paper. 5. Radio Frequency (RF) and Infrared Wake-Up Mechanisms and Implementation
    5.1. Proposed RF Design and Implementation The RF wake-up approach is the latest
    innovation towards achieving energy saving for wireless networks. There are two
    types of implantation methods: (1) the method that uses active wake-up receivers
    and utilizes energy from a battery, and (2) the method that uses passive wake-up
    receivers and harvests energy from the wake-up radio. In our approach, we find
    that active wake-up receivers have a much better performance in range and a higher
    rate of success in changing between listening and wake-up modes. In addition,
    the energy consumption for the RF receiver can be as low as serval µW while it
    is in its listening state. Figure 5 summarizes the RF-based wake-up design proposed
    in this paper. Figure 5. Design for the radio frequency (RF)-based active wake-up
    mechanism. To implement the design in Figure 5 we choose to use a commercial product,
    AS3933, as the wake-up receiver, which is further attached to the Waspmote sensor
    node. AS3933 is a 3-channel low power amplitude-shift-keyed (ASK) receiver, which
    is able to generate a wake-up signal upon detection of a data signal that uses
    an LF carrier with a frequency range of 15–150 kHz. The receiver’s output is connected
    to the MCU’s interrupt pin at the sensor board. When the AS3933 receives an RF
    signal, it decodes and checks whether the signal matches the pre-stored pattern.
    Once confirmed, the receiver will send out a pulse to the interrupt pin to wake
    up the MCU. Figure 6a shows the hardware setup of the three components in our
    RF wake-up prototype. Figure 6. Hardware components of the two wake-up systems:
    (a) RF wake-up and (b) infrared wake-up. By adding the RF antenna to the UAV and
    programming the micro-controller on the UAV to generate a Manchester wake-up pattern,
    we were able to use the UAV as a control hub to wake up sensor nodes in range.
    Since the MCU was in sleep mode using this out-band wake-up method, one interesting
    question was how long it would take for the MCU to wake up after the wake-up signal
    was sent out. If this procedure took a significant amount of time, then we needed
    to consider this delay as a drawback for this RF wake-up mechanism. This potential
    pitfall is carefully studied in this paper. 5.2. Infrared Wake-Up Implementation
    To achieve a comparative setup to justify the proposed RF method, the infrared
    wake-up mechanism was also implemented in this endeavor. Infrared is a commonly
    used solution for simple wireless communication at short ranges [48]. There are
    two basic components in infrared wireless communication: emitter and receiver.
    The emitter first transmits the coded data, generated by the micro-controller,
    to the receiver. When the receiver reads the IR signal, it decodes the signal
    into digital data and then passes the information to its following component,
    i.e., the sensor node. In our implementation we integrated a 950 nm IR LED into
    our UAV and a TSOP38238 IR Receiver Module on the sensor board. Figure 6b shows
    these modules. The emitter was connected to the UAV with the MCU’s PWM-capable
    I/O pin, and the receiver was connected to the MCU’s regular digital I/O pin on
    the sensor board. To achieve the wake-up function, the emitter on the UAV sent
    out the wake-up signal to the receiver only when the signal matched the code that
    was stored in the MCU (on the sensor board). The sensor board then turned on its
    sensors and the XBee communication module. In this setup, the sensors and the
    XBee module could be turned off until the MCU received the wake-up signal. However,
    the sensor board MCU always had to stay on in order to check whether the infrared
    signal matched the specific pattern. 6. Experimentation and Results In the following
    we evaluate the wake-up range as well as the energy consumption for both out-band
    methods (RF and IR), then compare the energy costs with the traditional duty-cycle
    method, all based on the same hardware setup. 6.1. Physical Verification and Comparison
    Infrared communication was directional since the wavelength was close to visible
    light. We used a 950 nm infrared LED as the transmitter, and TSOP38238 as the
    IR receiver diode. In the test, we placed the IR receiver on the ground, facing
    up. The UAV carried the infrared LED hovering above the receiver and continued
    sending signals. It was found that the effective maximum range of the IR communication
    was highly affected by the environmental disturbances and the variations in the
    supply voltage. Under strong sunlight, the IR receiver could still read signals
    from the LED; however, it often failed to decode the pattern in the code when
    the communication range exceeded 3 m by applying a 3.3 V power supply to the receiver.
    We found that by increasing the supply power of the IR receiver to 5 V, this issue
    was resolved. After multiple tests, we concluded that with our hardware setup,
    5 m was a safe distance for the IR communication in an LOS space without obstruction
    and with a 5 V power supply for the receiver. 6.2. RF Wake-Up Distance RF wake-up,
    however, did not require a direct LOS. The receiver, AS3933, had three wake-up
    channels, each connecting to an antenna. In our test, the three antennas were
    set up in a perpendicular fashion. Any antenna that received the correct pattern
    may trigger the wake-up. To test the wake-up range, we used a 125 KHz antenna
    connected to the UAV’s MCU and external power supply. When the supply voltage
    for the transmitter was set to 9 V, the maximum range was around 7 m in an indoor
    environment. A similar result in the outdoor test using the same receiver was
    found in [71], which resulted in a 5 m range using a 12 V supply for the transmitter.
    One question related to the wake-up distance was whether the power consumption
    would increase as the distance became greater. To get more detailed data on the
    wake-up distance and its energy consumption, a ground test was implemented where
    the position of the same transmitter was fixed, and the AS3933 receiver was moved
    away from it. We recorded the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the
    receiver at different distances, and the data is shown in Figure 7. The RSSI was
    measured in digital values with a 5-bit accuracy. The relation to the input voltage
    provided by the AS3933 manufacturer shows an approximately a linear relation [78].
    Combining our testing result in Figure 7 and this information, they gave us a
    general idea that how far the receiver could work and what the voltage was at
    the AS3933 input. Figure 7. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the receiver
    at different distances from the transmitter. Following the RSSI test, we used
    a 6.5 precision meter, Fluke 8845A, to measure the power consumption under these
    distances. In this setup, we programmed the receiver as a standard listening mode
    with three active channels and used the resistor–capacitor (RC) oscillator as
    the clock generator. From the receiver’s manual [79], it showed the typical current
    was 6.1 μA, which was also confirmed by our measurement (Figure 8). Then, we measured
    the current of the receiver while it was decoding the signal from the transmitter.
    The results are shown in Table 1. It was found that as the distance increased,
    the current of the receiver increased. This was mainly because as the distance
    became further, the RSSI value lowered as discussed, and the receiver’s variable
    gain amplifier increased the gain; therefore, the signal could be decoded properly.
    We also observed that, interestingly, within a 2.5 m range the receiver’s working
    duration remained around 200 ms. Once the range passed 3 m, the working duration
    increased to 460 ms, which indicated that more power was consumed. Figure 8. Current
    measurement of the AS3933 in a standard listening mode with three active channels
    and the RC-oscillator as the clock generator. Table 1. The relation of distance
    between receiver and transmitter, the current of the receiver, and the working
    duration of the receiver. As the voltage for the receiver was 3 V, the results
    above indicated that the lowest possible energy consumption was 4.632 μJ (at 0.5
    m), while the highest was 13.053 μJ. Considering that most of the time the receiver
    was in a listening mode with the maximum current of 6.1 μA (with 3 channels on),
    and further assuming that the listening time was 30 min before a wake-up signal
    arrived, the energy consumed during the listening states was 32.94 mJ. Compared
    between 32.94 mJ and 13.053 μJ, the increased energy due to a larger distance
    can be ignored. 6.3. RF Wake-Up Delay Since it took time for the MCU to wake up
    from sleeping, we expected that this may cause a delay in the data gathering for
    the WSN. Other wake-up receiver designs, like the one reported in [80], claimed
    to have a latency of 214 ms, while in [70], the author achieved around 0.9 ms.
    We wanted to compare our setup with other wake-up designs to make sure the latency
    value was in an acceptable range. To evaluate this and measure the time it took
    for the signal to reach the MCU after sending a signal from the transmitter, we
    set up a novel photogrammetric test environment. In the RF wake-up setup we had
    three different components: the wake-up transmitter, the wake-up receiver, and
    the MCU. They are introduced in Figure 6a The measurement operates as follows:
    (1) When the transmitter sends out the wake-up signal, the LED on the transmitter
    will flash. This moment is defined as t1. (2) When the receiver receives the signal
    and decodes it if the signal matches the pre-stored key, then the LED on the receiver
    will flash. This moment is t2. (3) When the receiver sends out the wake-up trigger
    to the MCU interrupt pin, then the MCU wakes up and the LED on MCU board will
    flash. This moment is t3. We used a high-speed camera (Sony RX100 V), which can
    record 1000 frames per second, to record the above sequence in a video format.
    We can obtain the time delay by calculating the video frames between each LED
    light up, as each frame is equal to 1 ms. One picture frame of the video is shown
    in Figure 9. Figure 9. One image captured in the high-speed video. In the center
    is the wake-up transmitter, on the left is the wake-up receiver, and to the right
    is the microcontroller unit (MCU). This image is the frame when the receiver decodes
    the signal and finds that it matches, thus, the LED on the receiver board is lit
    up. After the test, we found that the receiver had some failed wake-up instances
    due to environmental RF noise when simple coding (short pattern) was used. The
    solution to this would be to increase the wake-up single pattern from 16-bit Manchester
    coding to 32-bit, or double the wake-up single pattern length. Four coding conditions
    were considered and tested, and the time intervals between t1 and t2 and between
    t2 and t3 were recorded. Combining all these coding solutions, the time delay
    values averaged over multiple tests are reported in Table 2. Table 2. Average
    time delay (in terms of milliseconds) within the wake-up procedure. The above
    results reveal that with different coding setups for the transmitter and receiver,
    first, the time delay between t1 and t2 increased when longer-bit Manchester codes
    or double patterns were transmitted. This was because both transmitting and decoding
    phases took longer if the coding was more complex. Second, the delay times between
    t2 and t3, as shown in Table 2, stayed comparatively the same. This was because
    t2 was the time when the wake-up receiver sent out the signal through wiring to
    the MCU, when all decoding procedures were already completed. Thus, the delay
    between t2 and t3 only represented the wake-up time of the MCU and would not be
    affected when different coding patterns were used. Regardless, since the total
    delay caused by using this RF wake-up mechanism was less than 80 milliseconds
    (from sending out the wake-up signal by the transmitter to the MCU’s wake-up),
    we safely concluded that this wireless wake-up mechanism did not affect the data
    communication between the gateway and the sensor nodes in the field for most sensing
    applications, specifically when the sensors sense data packets at one time and
    transmit at a different time, then stay idle with much longer durations. The study
    in [81] claimed to reduce the time between t1 and t2 roughly from 13 ms to about
    2 ms using 16-bit and a single pattern with a similar setup in this paper. We
    thought this could potentially further reduce the latency introduced by this out-band
    wake-up mechanism. Another study in [72] using the same chipset claimed the time
    between t2 and t3 was 45.87 ms, which was similar to our experiment. 6.4. Energy
    Consumption Analysis and Verification Energy consumption was one of the primary
    concerns of this paper. Our main study focused on energy consumption in the sensor
    nodes that were potentially deployed in the hard-accessible field. Specifically,
    we classified each sensor module hardware into four subunits represented by the
    primary device: the MCU, XBee module, wake-up receiver, and the sensors. In Table
    3, the typical current consumption with a 3.3 V supply voltage for this hardware
    is listed. We did the comparative experiment on one default (duty-cycle) energy-saving
    mode and two wake-up mechanisms, as explained earlier, and recorded the power
    consumption: Table 3. Nominal current values for subunits within a sensing module.
    (1) Solution 1―the simple duty-cycle method (default in the Libelium sensor network).
    In this method, no out-band wake-up method was used. We used the XBee as our data
    communication as well as the wake-up channel. The XBee module on the sensor node
    stayed in listening mode when no UAV was nearby. Using this solution, the XBee
    and MCU on the sensor board had to always be turned on. (2) Solution 2―infrared
    wake-up method implemented in this paper. The infrared receiver was used as the
    wake-up channel. Since the IR receiver was connected to the MCU GPIO, it required
    the MCU to always stay on, while the XBee module could be turned off. (3) Solution
    3―RF wake-up method proposed and implemented in this paper. The RF was used as
    the wake-up channel. When the receiver was connected to the MCU’s interrupt pin
    the MCU stayed in sleep mode. The MCU only required 55uA of current while in sleep
    mode. We assumed the same schedule for the different solutions, in which Ti, Ts,
    and Ttran represented the duration of the idling state, sensing state, and the
    transmitting state of the sensor node, respectively. Considering 24 h as a working
    period, if every 4 h the node sensed the data and transmitted to the gateway,
    the values of Ts and Ttran in 24 h were usually less than 10 min, and the remaining
    time belonged to Ti. This means that the significant part of the power consumption
    was spent within the Ti period when accumulated over time. Figure 10 illustrates
    the electric current consumption, considering the aforementioned typical durations.
    Figure 10. Energy consumption illustrations resulting from the three solutions.
    The power consumption for one sensing cycle can be calculated by the following
    formula: 𝐸 𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒 =[ 𝑇 𝑖 × 𝐼 𝑖 + 𝑇 𝑠 × 𝐼 𝑠 + 𝑇 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛 × 𝐼 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛 ]  𝑉 𝑑𝑐 (1) where
    Ii, s, tran is the current variable at the state of idling, sensing, and data
    transmitting as defined in Table 3, respectively. The resulting Ecycle defines
    the energy consumption in a designated cycle proportional to the constant battery
    DC voltage. Using this formula and the data from Table 3, we can qualitatively
    state that Solution 3 needed much less energy for the idle state. By algebraic
    calculation based on Table 3 and the assumed typical idling (4 h), sensing duration
    (1 min), and transmitting duration (1 min), Solution 3 required only 1.6% of the
    energy compared to Solution 1, and 6% of energy compared with Solution 2. This
    statement has been similarly stated in [11,13]; however, no physical implantation
    and comparative validation are found in their efforts. To evaluate the qualitative
    statement above, we built a sensing network using Waspmote 1, 2, and 3. Each were
    set up with XBee modules, and the wake-up hardware corresponded to Solutions 1,
    2, and 3. For each implemented solution, the mote was attached with a rechargeable
    6600 mAh lithium-ion battery. We programmed that when the Waspmote woke up, the
    MCU will measure the battery voltage level and calculate the current battery percentage.
    A separate XBee coordinator was placed within the line-of-sight to each network
    of the Waspmote modules, forming a star XBee network in an indoor environment.
    To compare the difference in energy consumption between these three solutions,
    we minimized the possible power consumption from the front-end hardware; therefore,
    no additional sensing units were used in this test. Each Waspmote was woken up
    by using its corresponding methods and joined the XBee network every 4 h. Then,
    they sent a ‘hello’ message to the coordinator, which was always turned on. After
    that, each Waspmote read the current battery level and then went back to its original
    state: XBee idle listening, IR receiver listening, or RF receiver listening, respectively,
    as designed and implemented in Solutions 1, 2, and 3. We monitored the test for
    about 130 h for the three physical prototypes, and the battery levels were measured
    and recorded. The resulting energy consumption results are collectively shown
    in Figure 11. Figure 11. Experimental battery test and capacity dropping for the
    three different solutions. From the above results we found that Solution 1, in
    which the XBee module and MCU were always turned on, drained the battery quickly,
    in less than 90 h. The data transmitted in Solution 1 discontinued after 88 h
    since the battery level dropped to 23%, and the Waspmote stopped working due to
    the low voltage. In Solution 2, we can still see a linear drop in the battery
    level, but with a slower rate compared to Solution 1. As we stated above, most
    energy in Solution 2 was consumed by the IR receiver and the MCU. We concluded
    that the XBee idle and listening states consumed a large percentage of energy.
    Although we did not measure until the mote stopped working for Solution 2, we
    believe the battery level drop was linear, a rate of 0.48% per hour, and would
    last a total of about 208 h (through linear fitting with a fixed intercept of
    100%). Lastly, the battery level of Solution 3 did not drop significantly due
    to the RF wake-up solution. Due to the low dropping rate, we only measured a 2%
    drop during the 130 h test. Assuming a linear rate of consumption (through the
    linear fitting in Figure 11), we expected that the Solution 3 network would continue
    working for about 5556 h (or about a 7.5-month period). This was a remarkable
    improvement compared with both Solutions 1 and 2. Second, all the consumption
    rates were compared (as shown in the linear fitting in terms of the slope values).
    One can see that the power consumption rate from Solution 3 was about 3.8% of
    Solution 2, and 1.9% of Solution 1. This approximately confirms the previous analytical
    studies. In fact, we noted a better result (3.8% instead of 6%) from the analytical
    evaluation based on Figure 10 when comparing Solutions 2 and 3. We believe this
    was attributed to the actual XBee communication time being less than 1 min since
    there was not so much data being transferred in this test. Last, the functions
    obtained through data fitting, as shown in Figure 11, showed approximately linear
    relationships in all three cases. They may be used as predictive models to guide
    the planning of battery use and replacement in practice. It is admitted that caution
    is needed since this test was based on laboratory testing that assumed idealized
    data sensing and collection conditions. More field testing with real data collection
    scenarios is needed if an improved battery management strategy is desired. 7.
    Conclusions and Remarks In this paper we reviewed the concept of using an aerial-ground
    wireless sensing network (AG-WSN) in a remote and geospatially large, complex
    space. We particularly recognized the need of implementing such sensing solutions
    in precision agriculture and structural health monitoring practices. We then recognized
    the technical challenges in achieving energy efficiency in the ground sensors.
    Different wake-up mechanisms are then reviewed and compared. Among those mechanisms,
    we chose an active radio frequency (RF)-based wake-up method and implemented it
    physically. The focus was on evaluating their performances to achieve energy efficiency
    in the battery-powered ground sensors. The following findings were achieved through
    the experimental evaluation in this work: The experimental results in this paper
    indicated that the RF-based out-band wake-up mechanism can save a great amount
    of energy compared with the other two solutions (the infrared wake-up and the
    default duty-cycle methods). A direct comparison between the RF-based solution
    and the infrared-based solution indicated that the RF-based wake-up mechanism
    had a noticeably better performance in the wake-up range, and had a tremendous
    improvement in power consumption. Specifically, the results showed that the RF-based
    wake-up mechanism could potentially save more than 98.4% of the energy that the
    traditional duty-cycle method would otherwise consume, and 96.8% if an infrared-receiver
    method was used. The energy consumption for different RF wake-up distances was
    evaluated in this paper. The results indicated that as the distance between the
    transmitter and receiver increased, the receiver consumed more power (around 8.4
    μJ). However, it was argued that this value could be ignored compared to the energy
    consumed in the listening mode, which was at least 103 times higher. The evaluation
    of wake-up time delay by using a variety of different wake-up signal codes indicated
    that the time delay was below 80 ms; hence, the delay will not affect most opportunistic
    sensing applications (wherein the sensors sense the data at one time and transmit
    at a later time, then the sensors go back to sleep mode until another abrupt event).
    However, it was pointed out that a stricter time delay evaluation needs to be
    conducted if synchronization is critical between the sensors. Given the three
    findings, it was concluded that the RF wake-up mechanism was the first candidate
    for implementing the proposed wireless aerial-ground sensing network for monitoring
    applications in large-scale geospatial or challenging spaces. The technical contribution
    also included the use of a digital imaging approach to measure the wake-up time
    delay, and the resulting time-dependent rates of the battery-based power consumption
    using three different wake-up methods. This experimental and empirical knowledge
    may be extrapolated in similar sensing network research where sensor activation
    needs to be integrated. Last, we point out a few limitations in this effort that
    warrant future exploration. The first limitation is the RF wake-up range with
    the device used in this effort, which was relatively short (0‒7 m) compared with
    the Xbee communication range (about several hundred meters). One practical solution
    for this is to increase the power of the wake-up transmitter and to consider advanced
    antenna design (such as using the multiple input, multiple output, or MIMO technology)
    to increase the sensitivity of the wake-up signal. This may introduce more power
    consumption on the UAV side. With this potential long-range RF-based wake-up mechanism,
    the UAV no longer needs to reach the proximity of the sensor nodes. The UAV path
    planning then becomes a traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods, which was
    covered in our recent research [36]. The second limitation is the star topology
    assumed for the ground-level WSN. It is arguable that a mesh topology with communication
    relays can be used. Potentially, we believe that this decision depends on application
    context. In our context the UAV had two roles: the gateway to wake up sensors
    and collect data, and a remote sensing platform to collect geospatial images of
    the ground. Given this mobility and its dual role, a star topology is considered
    more appropriate. Nevertheless, if a mesh or other dynamic topology is considered
    in conjunction with the UAV-based sensor activation, this will demand a new research
    endeavor. A different scenario that uses the star topology for collecting data
    in a large geospatial area was discussed in our recent work [36]. In this case,
    the whole WSN can be segmented into a few subsets with a star topology, and the
    UAV will stay hovering in each subset for both wake-up and data collection procedures.
    Once the task is performed, the UAV can fly to the next subset. This practical
    treatment is believed to be a feasible solution to use the UAV with the aforementioned
    dual roles in an aerial–ground network in larger outdoor environments. Author

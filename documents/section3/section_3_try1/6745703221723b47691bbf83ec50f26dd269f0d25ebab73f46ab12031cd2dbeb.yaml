    footprint in enhancing agricultural practices with improved production using machine
    learning Pabitha C, Benila S, Suresh A This is a preprint; it has not been peer
    reviewed by a journal. https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3137542/v1 This work is
    licensed under a CC BY 4.0 License Abstract Agriculture shows an important role
    in the enlargement of an economy. The proposed system explores how utilizing digital
    footprints might help improve agricultural practices and production. Agricultural
    data is increasingly available in digital form because of the development of modern
    technology and the spread of connected devices. These data can be utilized to
    produce digital footprints that document the whole lifecycle of agricultural production,
    from planting to harvesting. Farmers may then decide when to sow, water, fertilize,
    and harvest their crops by using machine learning algorithms trained on these
    digital footprints to spot patterns and forecast results. The study examines various
    machine learning methods that can be used to examine digital footprints and shows
    the advantages of doing so, including higher yields, better resource management,
    and lower costs. The timing of crop planting, fertilization, and harvest has long
    been determined by the agriculture sector using conventional techniques and experience.
    However, with the expansion of agricultural data available, there is now a chance
    to use machine learning algorithms to recognize trends and forecast outcomes based
    on this data. This study explores the potential of machine learning methods, particularly
    Random Forest optimization, to improve agricultural practices and boost output.
    The study uses Random Forest optimization, a potent machine learning method that
    can examine massive datasets, to forecast crop yield based on many variables like
    weather patterns, soil quality, and fertilizer application. The study''s findings
    show how well the Random Forest optimization technique predicts crop productivity
    with an accuracy of 99.97%. By giving farmers useful information about forecasting
    crop yields, they may increase their overall productivity by using their resources
    wisely. The report also emphasizes the necessity of additional study and funding
    for the creation of machine learning algorithms that are specifically customized
    to the peculiarities of the agricultural sector, as well as the significance of
    data quality and privacy in the collecting and analysis of agricultural data.
    A combination of hardware and software tools, including data collection sensors,
    data processing equipment, graphics processing units (GPUs), cloud computing services,
    and mobile applications, will be needed for the hardware implementation of increasing
    agricultural practices in production using machine learning with Random Forest
    optimization techniques. agriculture digital footprint artificial intelligence

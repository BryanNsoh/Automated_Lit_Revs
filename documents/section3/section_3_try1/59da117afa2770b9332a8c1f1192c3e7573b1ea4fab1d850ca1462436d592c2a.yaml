    I. Introduction Decision making based on real-time/measured data is critically
    important to boosting revenue/productivity in many industries. Sensor installation
    throughout the industrial process plays a fundamental role in these tools. The
    number of sensors that can be installed is limited by the following two primary
    factors: 1) the cost (including installation/maintenance) of the sensor; 2) the
    power source used by the sensor. Recent advances in electronics/manufacturing
    have effectively solved many of the sensor cost challenges. However, there are
    few low-maintenance/low-profile solutions to delivering power to a multitude of
    sensor systems. Difficulties in power delivery are only amplified when applications
    require monitoring in remote and expansive outdoor environments. This is specifically
    challenging in industries such as farming, where large tracts of land are usually
    far from any electrical supply. Weather-dependent sources such as photovoltaics
    and wind turbines, or the continual replacement of batteries are the only real
    solution to this problem, all of which do not support Internet of Things (IoT)
    scaling. These conventional power methods can be intrusive to the working environment
    as devices can become entangled in or damaged by equipment/livestock/wildlife.
    Motorized equipment (such as tractors) must maneuver around solar and wind charging
    solutions, and as crops, trees, or vegetation mature, they may become completely
    overshadowed and/or entwined. Thus, contemporary power solutions make the installation
    of sensing tools time consuming, costly, and in many cases, impractical as the
    number of sensors are increased. These electric power supply limitations have
    led to wireless power transfer (WPT) research that encompasses both near-field
    and far-field techniques. RF energy harvesting [1] or robotic drones [2], [3]
    have both been developed for transferring electric power to soil sensors [4],
    [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. RF energy harvesting requires the rectification
    of space-wave signals that do not penetrate far beneath the soil surface and require
    a substantial time to collect enough energy to perform a function. Drones, either
    land- or air- based, are generally equipped with a magnetic coupling WPT system
    that transfers energy to sensors when the drone is positioned directly over the
    sensor''s receiver. A drone solution adds navigation complexities, high-power
    consumption for locomotion, high operating/maintenance expenses, and limited spatial
    coverage unless multiple drones are used—compounding all factors. Neither of these
    solutions supports wide area IoT scaling, with both suffering from efficiency
    losses when sensors are buried below 15 cm—as bulk soil is conductive, causing
    high attenuation of an electromagnetic (EM) wave''s magnetic component at the
    frequencies used. Long range forms of WPT (LR-WPT) have also been investigated.
    These rely on the transmission of focused EM space-waves. In this category, the
    following are the two predominant LR-WPT technologies in use: 1) laser power beaming;
    2) RF microwave power transfer (MPT) [11], [12], [13], [14]. Both techniques use
    far-field EM waves to transfer power. Literature has shown that MPT is more reliable
    for transmission between fixed installations [11]. Zhu [12] gave a side-by-side
    summary of present MPT endeavors. These systems either exhibit very low efficiency
    or have short transmission distances [14], [15]. While some companies are commercializing
    laser power beaming and MPT-based systems, they are in the very early stages of
    development with limited prototypes demonstrated [16], [17]. All such systems
    are line-of-sight dependent and require large, complex rectenna arrays to lower
    the power density during transmission to improve safety (as the wavelengths used
    are typically limited to 1 W or lower exposure limits). Neither of these LR-WPT
    systems would make good candidates for powering expansive IoT networks. More obscure
    in present literature is the nonline-of-sight approaches where energy is transferred
    along the surface of the Earth with a ground wave [18], [19]. Viziv Technologies
    is a company that claims to be working on ground-wave propagation for power transfer
    [20], [21]. These systems utilize tall above-ground antenna structures to induce
    charge oscillations at the surface. To date, no physically realized experiments
    have been publicly demonstrated by Viziv and based on the data presented in the
    limited literature, the given distributed electric field (E-field) intensities
    are much too weak for long-range wireless power transfer [20]. It can be concluded
    that there currently exists no other techniques beyond line-of-sight far-field
    radiation that has demonstrated LR-WPT. This manuscript presents a first of its
    kind WPT concept that utilizes conduction currents “through the soil” (TTS) to
    transfer power to surrounding devices. The presented system is not line of sight
    dependent and is observed to be robust in the limited locations tested [22]. The
    geometry of the TTS system is similar to a water well, offering a possible way
    to integrate this LR-WPT technique into existing farming infrastructure at very
    little cost to the user. The theory of operation will be expanded from earlier
    studies by the authors. A horizontal receiver geometry will be presented and an
    agricultural case-study using four IoT devices without batteries will be shown
    as proof of concept. A section on range and efficiency will explore possible methods
    for future improvements to the system. SECTION II. Theory and Derivations This
    section presents methods used to investigate the dynamics of the TTS system. First,
    a lumped circuit model is developed to identify the parameters that affect efficiency.
    Next, a concept based on EM field theory is presented for determining the received
    voltage distribution in the soil as a function of radial distance around the transmitter.
    This same theory also provides an expression for the soil''s impedance, linking
    the source current to the received voltage at a distance. The theory for the potential
    distribution is experimentally verified over 0.8 ha in an adjacent hay field.
    The theory is then combined with the lumped circuit model to arrive at an approximate
    equation for the system''s efficiency with parameters that will serve as metrics
    for future improvements to the system. A. Geometry and Circuit Model The TTS transmitter
    (Tx) utilized a minimum of two conductors (defined as electrodes) in direct contact
    with the soil, where one electrode resided at the soil surface and the other resided
    at a vertical distance below the surface (defined as a vertical geometry). The
    top electrode was formed from a well casing that was installed around the bore-hole
    of the Tx. The well casing was made of low carbon steel that was approximately
    15-m long. The bottom electrode was a 15-m section of brass tubing (50 mm in diameter),
    located 75-m below the surface. The brass tubing was connected to a high density
    poly ethylene (HDPE) tubing of the same diameter that ran from the brass to the
    surface. A 12-gauge insulated wire was fastened to the inside of the brass tubing
    at the bottom, and ran to the surface on the inside of the HDPE. Thus, the wire
    allowed an electrical connection to the bottom electrode from the surface, with
    the wiring being isolated from the surrounding soil via the HDPE tubing. The receiver
    (Rx) for this work was constructed using a horizontal geometry, where both electrodes
    (0.7-m long) resided at the surface. This is shown in Fig. 1 where an annotated
    illustration of the geometry is depicted next to a photograph of the experimental
    system. The horizontal geometry of the Rx was chosen for the ease of deployment
    and measurement. Future investigations will explore vertical topologies for the
    Rx, whose placement will become more permanent. A basic schematic of the system
    and its corresponding circuit is shown in Fig. 2(a) with orange bars indicating
    the electrodes. Fig. 1. (a) Diagram of the Tx topology showing in connection to
    the soil. (b) Annotated photograph of the Tx. (c) Diagram of the Rx topology in
    connection to the soil. (d) Photograph of the Rx with electrodes marked with flags.
    Show All Fig. 2. Coupled circuit model for TTS system. Show All Due to soil strata
    layers being mostly horizontal, currently injected into the ground will follow
    strata layers of lower resistivity and not spread (or fringe) as far within the
    surrounding soil medium [23]. This makes horizontal Tx geometries more prone to
    changes in conductivity due to weather and less effective at transmitting energy
    over the surrounding area. A vertical Tx structure exhibits greater current fringing
    since moving charge must traverse all strata layers (regardless of their variations
    in conductivity). The vertical geometry is therefore a better design choice for
    the Tx. For the Rx, the only geometric constraint is that its electrodes must
    reside at different equipotential lines created by the Tx in order for a voltage
    to be received. The energy exchange between the Tx and Rx was modeled as a pair
    of coupled circuits [Fig. 2(b)]. This model is only slightly different from the
    current controlled voltage-source model presented in [24]. The difference between
    the two models is that the coupled circuit allows impedance variations at the
    Rx to be seen by the Tx, which is expected to occur once the resistive components
    of Z TX and Z RX are made small. The transfer efficiency ( η ) of the system can
    be approximated using this model. Applying loop analysis produces two circuit
    equations − V S + Z Tx I S −j( u e ) I R =0 −j( u e ) I S + Z Rx I R + R L I R
    =0. (1) (2) View Source The direction of the coupling is chosen such that current
    flowing in the received circuit will reduce the reactive component in the supply
    circuit—similar to a transformer. The received voltage ( V R ) takes the form
    V R =j u e I s =Φ(r) (3) View Source where u e is a lumped “Earth impedance” that
    is dependent on the distance ( r ) from the Tx. The potential difference in the
    soil, ( Φ(r) ), is derived in the next subsection. Using (1) and (2), the source
    current ( I S ) and received current ( I R ) are solved for yielding: I S I R
    = ( R L + Z Rx ) V S Z Tx ( R L + Z Rx )+( u e ) 2 = j( u e ) V S Z Tx ( R L +
    Z Rx )+( u e ) 2 . (4) (5) View Source Equation (5) will be used in the next section
    to validate the model. The input power ( P IN ) and load power ( P L ) are P IN
    P L = V S I S = ( R L + Z Rx )( V S ) 2 Z Tx ( R L + Z Rx )+( u e ) 2 = R L (
    I R ) 2 = ( u e ) 2 ( V S ) 2 R L ( Z Tx ( R L + Z Rx )+( u e ) 2 ) 2 . (6) (7)
    View Source Dividing (7) by (6) gives the power transfer efficiency ( η ) η= P
    L P IN = R L u 2 e ( Z Tx ( Z Rx + R L )+( u e ) 2 )( R L + Z Rx ) . (8) View
    Source B. Deriving the Potential Distribution To determine u e , the voltage distribution
    around the Tx must be derived with respect to the radial distance r . The complex
    network of resistances, capacitances, and inductances that would be needed to
    model the soil are difficult to approximate and challenging to measure. Fortunately,
    the Tx geometry is similar to, and can be approximated as, an electric dipole.
    By solving for the E-field of this dipole (modeling the medium as a lossy dielectric),
    it should be possible to integrate the E-field radially to find the potential
    distribution along the ground. The usefulness of the dipole approximation is that
    it links source current injected into the Tx to the voltage distribution, mitigating
    the need of developing a complex impedance model of the soil. Referring to Fig.
    3 for the time-varying electric dipole approximation, the perceived separation
    distance ( d ) of the point charges is first modified from a conventional dipole
    to be the circumference of a toroidal path the current would traverse. ( d ) becomes
    d=2πa (9) View Source where a is the physical separation distance between the
    electrodes in the soil as shown in Fig. 3. Taking the vector potential ( A → )
    expressed in the frequency domain, the magnetic field intensity is A → zs H →
    H → = μ I S d 4πr e −jβr [ u → z ] =∇× A → = I S d 4π (sinθ) e −j(βr) [ jβ r +
    1 r 2 ][ u → φ ] (10) View Source where I S is the source current driving the
    Tx, β is the phase constant, r → is the distance vector from the center of the
    electrodes to the point where the field is being measured, and [ u → φ ] is the
    unit vector in the φ -direction. The E-field is found by applying Ampere''s law
    ∇× H → =ε ∂ E → ∂t + J → =(σ+jωε) E → (11) View Source where ( σ ) is the soil
    conductivity and ω is the angular frequency. Solving (11) for E → yields the E-field
    intensity as a function of the radial distance r E → = 2 I S d 4π(σ+jωε) cosθ[
    jβ r 2 + 1 r 3 ] e −j(βr) [ u → r ] + I S d 4π(σ+jωε) sinθ[ β 2 r − jβ r 2 + 1
    r 3 ] e −j(βr) [ u → θ ]. (12) View Source Fig. 3. Dipole approximation used for
    deriving the potential distribution around the TTS transmitter. Point P corresponds
    to the measurement location. Show All The field distribution of (12) has the following
    three main operational regions [25]: 1) the static region proportional to 1/ r
    3 ; 2) the induction region proportional to 1/ r 2 ; 3) the far region (or radiation
    region) proportional to 1/r . Both the static and induction regions are related
    to the near-field of the electric dipole. In practice, it is the voltage produced
    within the soil that can be directly measured. The potential difference ( Φ )
    is given by Φ=−∫ E → ⋅ dl → (13) View Source where dl → =dr[ u → r ]+rdθ[ u →
    θ ]+rsinθdφ[ u → φ ] . The integral of the dot product produces Φ(r)= I S d(σ−jωε)
    4π( σ 2 + (ωε) 2 ) cosθ[ 2 e −j(βr) r 2 + β 2 e −j(βr) − β 2 Ei(−jβr)]. (14) View
    Source The exponential integral Ei(−jβr) can be expanded using integration by
    parts Ei(x)=− e −x x − e −x x 2 −2∫ e −x x 3 dx…. (15) View Source Since r 3 was
    the highest order term in (12), it is expected that the contributing potential
    should have a maximum order of r 2 due to integration; taking note that the integration
    reduces the order such that the radiation region of the potential becomes a constant,
    the induction region becomes 1/r , and the static region becomes 1/ r 2 . All
    higher-order terms beyond the second order can be neglected. Substituting (15)
    into (14) and rearranging gives Φ(r)= I S dcosθ 4π( σ 2 + (ωε) 2 ) e −j(βr) [(σ
    β 2 + ωεβ r + σ r 2 ) +j(−ωε β 2 − σβ r − ωε r 2 )]. (16) View Source In (16),
    the terms σ β 2 and −ωε β 2 are related to the radiation region and are negligible
    at near-field distances. Similarly, e −j(βr) is approximately 1. Equation (16)
    can be rewritten as Φ(r)= I S dcosθ 4π( σ 2 + (ωε) 2 ) [( ωεβ r + σ r 2 ) −j(
    σβ r + ωε r 2 )]. (17) View Source In order for the soil to appear like a conductor,
    the Tx should be driven within the super low frequency (SLF) to very low frequency
    (VLF) frequency band (30 Hz to 30 kHz). In this frequency range, ωε becomes small,
    making (17) more a function of soil conductivity Φ(r)∝( 1 σ r 2 −j β σr ). (18)
    View Source The real term in (18) is extraneous since conductivity in the static
    region ( 1/ r 2 ) is significantly dependent on temporal charge relaxations [26],
    not spatial distribution. We can therefore neglect the real component of (17),
    taking only the imaginary Im{Φ(r)}= Φ(r)= Im ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ I S dcosθ 4π( σ 2 + (ωε)
    2 ) [( ωεβ r + σ r 2 ) −j( σβ r + ωε r 2 ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ − I S d 4π( σ 2 + (ωε)
    2 ) ( σβ (r) + ωε (r ) 2 ). (19) View Source Equation (19) allows one to calculate
    the approximate voltage radially from the Tx. It should be noted that the E-field
    is polarized in the u → θ -direction and thus the cosθ term is typically one.
    Additionally, since the assumption of this derivation is that the soil acts as
    a good conductor, the E-field at the soil/air interface must be vertical due to
    continuity, which again assumes an E-field in the u → θ -direction and a cosθ
    term equal to one. Taking (19) and dividing it by the source current ( I S ) produces
    the equation for u e , that can be inserted into (5) and (8) u e =− d 4π( σ 2
    + (ωε) 2 ) ( σβ r + ωε r 2 ). (20) View Source C. Theoretical and Circuit Validation
    To validate (19), and with it (20), the Tx was driven at various currents ( I
    S ) from 1 to 9 A and radial measurements were taken using steel stakes as the
    Rx electrodes and a Tektronix THS3024 battery powered oscilloscope to quickly
    measure voltages between two points at the soil surface. The potential differences
    were measured every 2.5 m, within a 50-m radius around the Tx. The data were then
    normalized to a 1-m spacing to compare its value with the safety limit of 25 V
    over 1 m [27]. The theoretical response was calculated from (19) using the soil
    Φ parameters given in Table I. Fig. 4 shows the measured and theoretical traces
    plotted side by side. The theory matches the experimental data well, with slight
    variations due to the simplifying assumption that the soil is homogeneous, whereas
    in reality, soil is a heterogeneous medium. The results of Fig. 4 indicate (19)
    can be readily used to predict the potential difference over the area. TABLE I
    Soil Model Parameters Fig. 4. Experimentally measured data (dashed trace), versus
    calculated values using theoretical model (solid trace) for various peak drive
    currents. The orange dash-dot line shows the setup potential safety limit for
    the system. Show All With u e verified, the accuracy of the circuit model in Fig.
    2 was tested. The electrode spacing was fixed at 1 m, and both front and rear
    electrodes were moved together away from the Tx at 1-m intervals (see Fig. inset
    for illustrated layout). This is plotted in Fig. 5(a). Using the measured Tx and
    Rx parameters in Table I, with a drive voltage that produced 6 A in the Tx; the
    short-circuit Rx current was calculated from (5) and plotted in the figure. The
    circuit model approximately follows the experimental data. Next, the effects of
    the Rx electrode spacing were tested. The front electrode was kept stationary
    at 10 m from the Tx while the rear electrode was moved backwards in 1-m intervals.
    Both the measured open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are plotted in
    Fig. 5(b). The received voltage at the Rx electrodes was found to be the sum of
    the potential between the electrodes, allowing one to utilize (19) to estimate
    the value of received voltage based on the Rx electrode separation at any distance
    away from the Tx. Fig. 5. (a) Plot of the short-circuit Rx current predicted in
    the coupled circuit model versus the measured short-circuit Rx current between
    electrodes spaced 1 m and moved away from the Tx, starting at 10 m and ending
    at 20 m (see inset). (b) Experimental data showing the measured voltage of the
    Rx as the electrode separation is increased compared with what is predicted by
    the theory using (19). Note that the front electrode was placed 10 m from the
    Tx and the rear electrode was moved in 1-m increments away from the Tx. Show All
    From Fig. 5(b), it can be seen that as the electrodes are moved further apart,
    the maximum received power increases. However, the nonlinear distribution of the
    potential decreases with distance (as shown in Fig. 4), putting a limit on the
    received power as the Rx is made significantly long (aka the power does not continue
    to raise indefinitely as the Rx electrode separation is made larger). Long Rx
    geometries are also seldom feasible. For this study the Rx electrodes were kept
    at 3 m, as this gave the minimum received power to operate the sensors while being
    at least a third smaller than the closest tested distance from the Tx (10 m).
    A unique feature of this power transmission technique is that as the injected
    Tx current was raised, the sensors could either support a larger load, or they
    could be moved farther away from the Tx. At 9 A, it was possible to power the
    sensor modules at approximately 20 m from the Tx. D. Simulation With the theoretical
    and circuit model validated, it is important to develop a simulation that matches
    the proper conditions of the TTS system. For this work, Ansys Maxwell was used.
    Future work will utilize this model for investigating better electrode designs,
    whereas the theoretical/circuit model can be used for quick calculations to determine
    Tx drive magnitudes and maximum distance sensors can be placed based on the Rx
    electrode spacing. Fig. 6(a) shows the results from the Ansys simulation for a
    1-A drive current into the Tx. A 1-km, homogeneous cube was modeled as the Earth
    using the same values in Table I. The viewpoint in the figure is top down, depicting
    the E-field at the surface of the cube in the xy-plane and the equipotential regions,
    exemplified with dashed concentric rings. For the Rx to develop a voltage, the
    front and rear Rx electrodes must be located on different equipotential lines.
    Fig. 6. (a) Ansys Maxwell simulation of TTS Tx for a 1-A injection and the accompanying
    E-field distribution over the surface of the Earth. Dashed circles added to highlight
    the equipotential lines. (b) Comparison of the surface potential using the Ansys
    simulation versus the theoretical derivation, versus the experimental measurement
    driving the Tx at 1 A. Show All The simulated values of the E-field were extracted
    from the simulation and integrated with the distance to obtain the surface potential.
    The simulated values of the surface potential were then plotted next to the theoretical
    and experimental values for comparison [Fig. 6(b)]. It can be seen that both the
    Ansys model and the theoretical derivation are all in close approximation to the
    experimental measurements taken in the adjacent agriculture field. SECTION III.
    Power Transfer for IoT Applications A small IoT network of commercial agricultural
    sensors were used to demonstrate the systems ability to wirelessly transfer power
    without batteries or large electric storage elements. Do note that a 1-mF capacitor
    [Fig. 7(b)] was used for dc filtering and did provide energy for the 0.2-W bursts
    the sensor required when transmitting data. The sensors were all powered simultaneously
    within a radius tested between 10 to 20 m around the Tx. Fig. 7. (a) Photograph
    of IoT sensor module showing various components. (b) Schematic of the rectifier
    electronics used to convert the ac conduction currents in the soil to dc, powering
    the sensor module. The module required 3.4 V and 10 mA to operate (60 mA to transmit
    data). Show All The sensor modules are shown in Fig. 7 and include an integrated
    moisture and temperature sensor. The microcontroller ( μ -ctrl) on each module
    is an ATMega32u4 with a LoRa communications IC. Fig. 7(a) is an annotated photograph
    of the sensor module identifying the various components. Fig. 7(b) is a schematic
    that shows the basic rectification electronics used in the module. A full-bridge
    rectifier, connected to the Rx electrodes, converted the conduction currents created
    by the Tx into a dc voltage that was then regulated with a buck/boost converter.
    When the sensors were powered, soil moisture and temperature data were collected
    and transmitted via conventional space waves at 900 MHz, to a receiving ESP32
    at the base station. The ESP32 was only used as a microcontroller, with an attached
    LoRa module to accept the 900-MHz protocol. The ESP32 would then relay the data
    through serial to a computer for storage and postprocessing. Each sensor was waterproofed
    for long-term measurement studies via a box with a rubberized coating. The sensors
    were calibrated prior to their deployment. Fig. 8(a) is a photograph of the experimental

    SECTION IV. Discussion on Improvements in Range and Transfer Efficiency Equations
    (8) and (20) predict that the efficiency of the TTS system is strongly dependent
    on the impedance of the Tx and Rx. Impedance data of the Tx have been collected
    for several years at the Tennessee location, with the first study on the technique
    being conducted in Alberta Canada in 2015 [23]. Fig. 9 is a plot of the impedance
    modulus variations over different seasons, weather types, and locations. In the
    figure, Fair weather is defined as either full or partial sun, the other weather
    descriptors are self-explanatory. It can be seen that the impedance of the Tx
    has a low-Z region and a high-Z region. The high-Z corresponds to a cross-over
    point where the soil begins to function more like a dielectric. The peaks in this
    region are a parallel resonance that occurs with the Tx wiring and is observed
    to have very little energy output into the surrounding media. The high-Z region
    also fluctuates significantly with weather. The low-Z region not only exhibits
    the lowest Tx impedance, its fluctuation is between 30–50 Ω and is fairly consistent—even
    between locations that are 4800-km apart. It is important to note that both the
    US and Canadian locations were conducted on crop growing land—the soil thus had
    a high ion content making it better for plant growth, and consequently more electrically
    conductive. The data show that the system, while dependent on soil parameters,
    is quite robust in the SLF to VLF frequency band. The data also indicate a tendency
    for the system impedance to be lower in more conductive soils with higher moisture,
    ion, or salinity content. This can be seen in Fig. 9, when the soil moisture is
    higher, the Tx impedance tends to reduce–noting that snow in Tennessee is nearly
    always proceeded by rain, so soils are generally highly water saturated by the
    time snow fall occurs. The system is therefore expected to work better in locations
    of higher ion content (which is nearly all farming environments) and have lessened
    performance in drier soils. Fig. 9. Long-term impedance measurements over several
    months, weather conditions, and two different geographical locations. Variations
    from weather in the low-Z region are significantly less than in the high-Z region.
    Show All Improving the efficiency of the system hinges on reducing the Z Tx and
    Z Rx . It was important to investigate the feasibility of altering the impedance
    values of at least the Tx. Literature indicates that the resistance of a soil-grounded
    electrical system can be significantly improved by adding multiple grounding rods
    [28], [29]. With this in mind, an experiment was conducted where the Tx impedance
    was measured using only the top electrode (well casing) [plotted in Fig. 10(a)]
    as the red (circle) trace entitled “no gnd rods.” The well casing in the inset
    illustration was also made red to match the data. The blue (triangle) trace was
    obtained by installing six 3-m long grounding rods within a 3-m radius around
    the casing such that all six rods and the casing formed the surface electrode.
    This new addition was made blue in the inset illustration to match the presented
    data. The simple addition of the grounding rods successfully reduced the Tx impedance
    as shown in the blue (triangle) trace of the figure. Fig. 10. (a) Measured Tx
    impedance using only the well casing (i.e., no ground rods) versus having a surface
    electrode composed of six grounding rods and the well casing. (b) Plots of the
    complex impedance with and without grounding rods. At higher frequencies, the
    inductive component of the Tx is more prevalent, having a peak inductance occuring
    at 10 kHz. Show All The power required to operate four sensor modules was 0.8
    W (when transmitting data on 900 MHz). The Z Rx was measured at 250 Ω for the
    3-m section between the Rx electrodes. Prior to installing the ground rods, it
    required a peak input power of 500 W at 60 Hz to operate the sensor network at
    a distance of 10 m from the Tx. Note that this is the total system input power
    measured from the solar battery bank into the inverter that supplied power to
    the Tx. After adding the grounding rods, the same power delivery of 0.8 W was
    achieved using a 250-W peak, a two-fold improvement in efficiency with an addition
    of only six extra low-cost grounding rods. Experiments are underway to determine
    how low the Tx impedance can be made before the bottom electrode would need modification.
    In its present state, the TTS system is ideally suited for low-power IoT applications
    with relatively infrequent measurements (such as agriculture). In the experiment,
    the field was energized for 1 min every hour and shutdown for the remaining 59
    min, leading to an average power of only one sixtieth of the peak power or 250
    60 =4 W. The benefits of instrumenting a field and expending tens of watts on
    average to know the locations of where to water, fertilize, or spray pesticides
    can make a significant impact on cost savings and the environment. Using renewable
    sources to power the TTS system also reduces the long-term cost of electricity.
    The operation of sensor modules at drive frequencies higher than 60 Hz is currently
    limited by our drive electronics. However, the low-Z frequency spectrum of the
    Tx can give insight into such operations. Fig. 10(b) shows that as the frequency
    increases, the Tx begins to function more like an inductor and less like a resistor;
    with a maximum inductance occurring at 10 kHz. The addition of the grounding rods
    appeared to only affect the Tx resistance, not the reactance. This is important
    since an inductive Tx would not dissipate but store energy in its magnetic field
    every half cycle, allowing for resonant circuits to be utilized for possible range/efficiency
    improvements. The theoretical model also predicts improved efficiency at higher
    drive frequencies. Using (8), the theoretically calculated transfer efficiency
    for a single sensor module, as a function of distance ( r ), is plotted in Fig.
    11(a). The plot shows the response of reducing Z Tx impedances at three different
    operating frequencies. Here, Z Rx and R L were kept the same as the experimental
    data (250 Ω and 56 Ω , respectively). While these theoretical plots of efficiency
    look promising, we are still in the process of validating Fig. 11(a), and will
    communicate such validations in future work. The full system efficiency for the
    proof-of-concept system, while presently low, are similar to values reported for
    MPT and laser-based technologies. Yet unlike MPT/Lasers, the TTS system is not
    line-of-sight dependent and does not require the use of complex/expensive receivers.
    Moreover, the efficiency of the TTS system can be improved by lowering the impedance
    of the Tx and Rx, which is quite achievable via inexpensive grounding rods. An
    MPT/Laser system is instead limited by optical-electric conversion processes and
    beam directionality which has constraints both on safety and complexity/cost of
    the array. Fig. 11. (a) Calculation of efficiency versus range using (8), where
    u e is calculated from (20), as Z Tx is reduced from 30 to 0.5Ω . The highlighted
    areas indicate different operating frequencies. (b) Estimated drive current of
    200 A at 60 Hz using (19), needed to power sensor modules over a 40-ha (100-acre)
    area. Rx electrode separation is 3 m to receive 3.67nbsp;V. Show All Furthermore,
    there does not seem to be a limitation on the TTS transfer range according to
    the derived theory. Taking (19), a drive current of 200 A at 60 Hz is predicted
    to enable power transfer over 40 ha (100 acres) to sensors with a 3-m Rx electrode
    separation (11). 40 ha is the approximate average farm size in the United States
    using statistical data from [30]. Close to the Tx, the step potential safety limit
    exceeds 25 V between 1 m. A 40-m radius around the Tx would need to be restricted
    from access during operation. Beyond 40 m, the step potential is low enough to
    walk freely. It is possible that the system may cause environmental effects/impacts.
    However, there has been no negative effects yet observed in the flora or fauna
    during the course of these studies. Some literature has shown that currents through
    soil can be beneficial to the growth of plants [31]. It was also discovered that
    telluric currents generated from a substation 0.8 km away can be observed at the
    Tx [24]. Measured data show the Tx receives approximately 5.6 V Peak from the
    substation. For a voltage of this magnitude to be measured at the Tx, it can be
    inferred from theoretical models that the magnitude seen at the substation must
    be quite large. Since this is an unintentional byproduct of a substation with
    flourishing trees and vegetation, it can be deduced that the effects on the environment
    are minimal. Moreover, if a substation can produce effects at such a distance
    unintended—the possibility of a designed TTS system achieving the same or better
    level of performance is encouraging. SECTION V. Conclusion In this article, a
    new LR-WPT technique was presented that utilizes conduction currents through soil
    to transmit power to sensing devices. A proof-of-concept prototype was constructed
    that successfully demonstrated power transfer to a small agricultural IoT network
    within a 20-m radius. The energy transfer is not line-of-sight and simultaneously
    powers all sensors in the area; making it an ideal tool for agricultural IoT networks.
    A major benefit of the presented system is that each sensor module does not need
    an individual battery. Instead, batteries can be placed at a central location
    and the energy distributed radially around that location without wires. This work
    has provided theory, simulation, scaling, and transfer parameters that quantify
    the operation of the TTS system. The power transfer range was found to be dependent
    on the injected Tx current while the efficiency was found to be dependent on the
    Tx and Rx bulk impedance. Increasing drive current while developing methods to
    lower the Tx/Rx impedance has the exciting potential to wirelessly power devices
    over great distances. This would revolutionize farm management and transform energy
    security as higher efficiency and power transfer is achieved. Future work will
    focus on the development of TTS communications in tandem with power, methods to
    reduce Tx impedance, and investigations into the effects of frequency and waveform
    shapes on the power transmission. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract The monitoring and control of environmental conditions
    are crucial as they influence crop quality and yield in Chinese solar greenhouses
    (CSGs). The objectives of this study were to assess the spatial, temporal, and
    vertical variability of major environmental parameters in CSGs during winter and
    to provide greenhouse climate/microclimate characteristics in order to facilitate
    the monitoring and control of greenhouse environmental conditions. A wireless
    sensor network (WSN) was deployed in two CSGs: one with crops and one without.
    Sensors were placed at different locations inside and outside the greenhouses,
    and the air temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, light intensity, solar radiation,

    is putting an increasing strain on the Earth’s resources, particularly on agricultural
    land. As cities continue to expand and urbanization takes over farmland, the amount
    of available arable land is shrinking, making it increasingly challenging to produce
    enough food to feed the world’s population [1]. Furthermore, global climate change
    is causing extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heat waves, which
    can adversely impact crop yields [2]. Agricultural production is further affected
    by the depletion of natural resources, including water and nutrients, as well
    as the growing prevalence of pests and diseases [3]. Meeting rising food needs
    while safeguarding natural resources demands creative solutions and sustainable
    approaches. Natural conditions and input availability may challenge optimal crop
    growth [4]. Crop growth is affected by several environmental factors, including
    air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, soil temperature,
    and soil water content [5]. Plastic-covered greenhouses can be utilized to artificially
    control the micro-climate and regulate environmental conditions for crop growth
    [6]. Greenhouses are enclosed environments that can be actively controlled to
    increase the yield of crops and vegetables, especially high-priced vegetables
    and off-season crops. The production of greenhouse crops is generally 2–3 times
    higher than that of open-field crops [7,8]. Due to their benefits for plant and
    vegetable cultivation, greenhouses have become widely used [9]. Chinese solar
    greenhouses (CSGs) are distinctive agricultural structures consisting of a rear,
    north-facing wall, and a transparent, south-facing wall. The rear wall saves energy
    from sunlight in the daytime and releases heat into the greenhouse throughout
    the night. The low operational costs of CSGs, stemming from their energy-saving
    properties, have made them highly popular in China [10,11]. The cultivation of
    vegetables in solar greenhouses in China grew from approximately 3.3 million hectares
    in 2012 [12] to 3.8 million hectares in 2020 [13]. However, during the winter,
    conventional greenhouses often face challenges in maintaining optimum growing
    conditions for crops and vegetables. This is primarily due to the low air and
    soil temperatures inside the greenhouse, which can limit plant growth and development
    [14]. Additionally, shorter day lengths and reduced solar radiation during the
    winter months can further inhibit plant growth and productivity [15]. In winter,
    greenhouse heating expenses can hinder production due to their high energy cost
    [16]. Solar greenhouses offer a solution by harnessing solar energy to create
    a warm environment for cold-climate crop growth. In China, solar greenhouse design
    often integrates passive solar heating methods like insulation, heat storage,
    and angled glazing to optimize solar energy capture [17]. The use of solar greenhouses
    extends the growing season and increases the yields of crops such as vegetables,
    fruits, and flowers [18]. Effective management practices, encompassing ideal temperature,
    humidity, light levels, and proper pest and disease control, are vital for maximizing
    the benefits. The microclimate within CSGs, especially the temperature, humidity,
    and radiation, is critically important for ensuring crop growth as well as high
    yields and quality [19]. The temperature distribution throughout the greenhouse
    and the control of temperature and humidity within an appropriate range is essential
    for ensuring the uniform growth of crops [20]. In tropical areas with strong solar
    radiation, coverings and ventilation are necessary for reducing the air temperature
    of greenhouses. By contrast, cold regions demand regular plant health checkups,
    especially during the harsh winter season [21]. Several studies have analyzed
    environmental microclimate conditions to evaluate and optimize crop growth conditions
    and to improve the energy efficiency of greenhouses. The microclimate and transpiration
    of tomato plants have been investigated [22] in a sunken solar greenhouse located
    in North China. The findings revealed that the sunken design of the greenhouse
    improved the microclimate by lowering temperature fluctuations and increasing
    relative humidity. The greenhouse maintained temperatures over 20 °C higher than
    those outside, leading to robust tomato growth and satisfactory yields. Hou et
    al. [23] studied microclimate parameters in naturally ventilated solar greenhouses
    under various scenarios: mature plants, young plants, and no plants in northwest
    China. The findings demonstrated that ventilation rate, external temperature,
    and humidity affected internal conditions, with up to 5.1 °C and 8.16 °C vertical
    temperature differences in mature and young plant greenhouses, respectively. Liu
    et al. [24] compared the indoor environmental factors in a double-film solar greenhouse
    and in a traditional Chinese greenhouse that were both in a cold region. The results
    showed that the solar greenhouse had a higher air temperature, soil temperature,
    and humidity, while the traditional greenhouse had lower air temperature and humidity.
    The study indicated that using a double-film solar greenhouse in cold regions
    can improve tomato growth and yield due to lower wind speed and higher photosynthetic
    photon flux density. Dong et al. [25] presented a time-dependent model to predict
    the thermal environment of CSGs in Canada. The average inaccuracy in forecasting
    the temperature of the north wall and the ground surface was 4.2 °C and 2.3 °C,
    respectively. The study also found that the thermal performance of greenhouses
    was influenced by factors like insulation properties, ventilation, and heating
    systems. Ryu et al. [26] analyzed the spatial, vertical, and temporal variability
    of ambient environments in strawberry and tomato greenhouses during winter. Significant
    variations in temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration within and
    between the two types of greenhouses were found. The temperature variability was
    higher in tomato greenhouses, while relative humidity was more variable in strawberry
    greenhouses. Furthermore, the variability of CO2 concentration was influenced
    by the greenhouse ventilation and heating systems. Fan et al. [27] monitored the
    microclimate of solar greenhouses at different times of day and found that the
    temperature and humidity indicated the thermal efficiency of the solar greenhouses.
    Ahamed et al. [28] conducted a sensitivity analysis of a heating simulation model
    within a CSG in Canada during the coldest winter months (December to February)
    and found that small changes in the inside temperature and humidity had a substantial
    effect on the heating demand; furthermore, approximately 13–20% supplemental heat
    was required to extend the crop planting period during the winter days. Tadj et
    al. [29] used several heating techniques to study the temperature and humidity
    distribution in greenhouses. Heating pipes increased the uniformity of climatic
    parameters inside the greenhouse. Furthermore, differences in temperature and
    humidity between crops and the air increased the activity of plants and the transpiration
    of crops. Wei et al. [30] characterized CO2 concentration in a solar greenhouse
    through three experiments and investigated the impact of CO2 concentration changes
    on plant yield. CO2 concentration dropped notably in the afternoon compared to
    mornings, with ventilation significantly affecting these levels. In addition,
    certain studies focused on sensor fusion inside the greenhouse for environmental
    monitoring and control. Using a wireless sensor network, Touhami et al. [31] suggested
    a polynomial algorithm for monitoring the microclimate of greenhouses automatically
    and a linear equations model for optimizing plant productivity. Changes in temperature,
    humidity, solar radiation, and soil pH were evaluated through simulation, and
    the execution time was 2.09 s. Wang and Wang [32] proposed a fuzzy-PID controller
    with a wireless monitoring system to control the environmental conditions of greenhouses
    and to monitor their microclimate. The test demonstrated that the sensor nodes
    functioned accurately, collecting multiple greenhouse parameters simultaneously.
    The system can maintain optimal greenhouse conditions by regulating parameters
    such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. Nicolosi et al. [33] highlighted
    the use of a flexible control system to monitor the microclimate of the greenhouse
    using a neural network solution. Based on the outside temperature forecast, heating
    and cooling devices were controlled, and the inside temperature was adjusted and
    improved for crop production. A fuzzy logic-based control system was proposed
    by Azaza et al. [34]. Wireless data monitoring systems were used to monitor and
    control the internal environmental data such as temperature, humidity, CO2, and
    illuminance. Ferentinos et al. [35] observed that environmental variability within
    a greenhouse can be achieved and that it is economically feasible with the sensor
    fusion technique and the installation of multiple measuring points. Balendonck
    et al. [36] suggested a low-cost wireless sensor network to examine the horizontal
    temperature and humidity distribution inside a greenhouse. The static and instantaneous
    variation in average temperature and humidity were found to be 1.0–3.4 °C and
    9–40%, and 5.6–9.0 °C and 11.8–42.3%, respectively. The number of sensors used
    during the experiment affected the accuracy of the measurement of temperature
    and humidity in a larger greenhouse. The data from the sensors were closely connected,
    and redundancy was also avoided. Therefore, data analysis within the different
    nodes should be handled carefully to improve accuracy and reliability under the
    requirements in order to comply with the application’s demands [37]. Analyzing
    environmental microclimate conditions in CSGs is essential to evaluate and optimize
    crop growth conditions and to improve energy efficiency. Monitoring environmental
    parameters such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, solar radiation, etc., helps
    maintain ideal growth conditions, leading to better yields. This information also
    enables the development of smart control systems for automated greenhouse management,
    optimizing resource use, and curbing energy consumption. Utilizing wireless sensor
    networks and integration technologies is essential for the precision control and
    management of greenhouse conditions. To maximize the monitoring and control of
    environmental factors in CSGs, the use of various sensors and their positioning
    depending on the degree of variability in environmental factors is required. The
    objective of this study was to investigate the spatial, vertical, and temporal
    variability of environmental variables in two CSGs during winter, offering insights
    for efficient environmental management through wireless sensor networks and sensor
    location. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Collection Site The data collection
    was conducted using two CSGs of the same size (60 m × 8 m), which were oriented
    lengthwise in the east–west direction at Shenyang Agriculture University, Liaoning,
    China (41°49′46″ N, 123°33′51″ E). This study was conducted under two different
    scenarios: a greenhouse with crops and a greenhouse without crops. Figure 1 shows
    the cross-section of the structure of the two CSGs, which featured a sturdy north-facing
    wall with a partial roof on the north side and a cover over the southern side.
    The north wall (0.45 m thick) was a layered structure of brick with Styrofoam
    insulation and an air layer. The north roof (0.2 m thick) was made of several
    layers of wood, Styrofoam, and other structural materials. The cover placed on
    the south roof (0.00012 m thick) during the daytime was made of polyvinyl chloride
    (PVC) film, and a cotton blanket (0.50 m thick) was laid over the roof each night.
    During the daytime, the south roof of the greenhouse was covered with a thin plastic
    film to allow entry of the sunlight; at night, it was covered with a cotton blanket
    to provide insulation. The front and rear slope elevation angles of the greenhouse
    roof were 32° and 41.20°, respectively, and the rear slope horizontal projection
    was 0.16 m. The vent was opened at 11:00 h and closed at 13:30 h in the daytime
    during the winter season, except on snowy days. Sunrise and sunset were between
    6:40 h to 7:05 h and 16:05 h to 16:25 h, respectively. Figure 1. Experimental
    CSGs at Shenyang Agriculture University, Liaoning, China: (a) cross-sectional
    view of the CSG, (b) exterior view of the CSG without crops, (c) interior view
    of the CSG without crops, (d) external view of the GSG with crops, and (e) interior
    view of the CSG with crops. Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa; variety: Yanli) was
    planted on 10 September 2018 in one of the CSGs, and the soil under the plants
    was covered by a black plastic film. The plant-to-plant and row-to-row distances
    were 15 cm and 20 cm, respectively. The number of rows was two per ridge, and
    the ridge length was 6.90 m. The interval between the ridges was 1.0 m, and the
    total number of ridges was 56. 2.2. Sensors and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)
    Table 1 shows the environmental variables measured in the CSGs and the specifications
    of the sensors used for the measurements. Air temperature and humidity were measured
    using a temperature and humidity sensor (AM2315, Aosong Electronics Co., Ltd.,
    Guangzhou, China). The sensor consists of a capacitive sensor wet component and
    a high-precision temperature measuring unit with a microprocessor. The carbon
    dioxide (CO2) concentration was detected with a CO2 sensor (SH-300-ND, SOHA TECH
    Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) using a cutting-edge NDIR (non-dispersive
    infrared) method. A light intensity sensor (BH1750FVI, Rohm Co., Ltd., Kyoto,
    Japan) employing a photoresistor technique was used to obtain the light intensity
    inside and outside of the greenhouses. Solar radiation was estimated using a silicon
    pyranometer sensor (Watchdog 3670WS2, Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Aurora, IL,
    USA), and an anemometer (Davis 7911, Davis Instruments Corp. Inc., Hayward, CA,
    USA) was used to measure the wind speed and direction outside of the CSGs. Table
    1. Environmental variables measured, and the specification of sensors used. A
    wireless sensor network (WSN) was used to collect data from the sensors using
    an Arduino UNO 328 (Arduino, arduino.cc) microcontroller with a 2.4 GHz radio/wireless
    data transmission module (nRF24L01, Shenzhen Yuzens Electronics Co., Ltd., Shenzhen,
    China) with a wireless data transmission range of approximately 1000 m [38]. Arduino
    is an open-source software and hardware platform, and the core of the Arduino
    UNO processor is the ATmega328. It has 14 digital input/output roads (6 of the
    roads can be used as a PWM output), 6 analog input roads, 32 kB of flash memory,
    and 1 kB of EEPROM [39]. NRF24L01 is a new high-speed (20 bit/s) data transceiver
    for the worldwide 2.4–2.5 GHz ISM frequency band. NRF24L01 has several low-powered
    operation modes, such as power-down mode and standby mode. The wireless system
    consists of nodes, gateways, and servers. The sensor nodes were composed of an
    Arduino UNO 328 microcontroller, respective sensors, power sources, and nRF24L01
    2.4 GHz radio/wireless transceiver modules. For the wireless sensor network gateway,
    nRF24L01 2.4 GHz radio/wireless transceiver modules were also attached to the
    same node. The gateway functions to collect data from each node and sends them
    to the server, which employs the Parallax Data Acquisition Tool (PLX-DAQ) to store
    and display the gathered information to the PC. Figure 2 shows the wiring connection
    between Arduino UNO, nRF24L01, temperature, and humidity sensors in the wireless
    network system. Figure 2. The wiring connection of (a) nRF24L01, Arduino UNO,
    and environmental sensors ((i) temperature and humidity, (ii) CO2, (iii) light
    sensor, (iv) solar radiation, and (v) wind speed and direction) as a transmitter
    node, and (b) nRF24L01 and Arduino UNO as a receiver node. 2.3. Data Collection
    and Analytical Procedure The experimental greenhouse was divided into three vertical
    planes, and each plane was divided into three layers. All measurements were taken
    in these three vertical planes of the greenhouse. The bottom, middle, and top
    layers of each plane were located 0.50 m, 1.75 m, and 3.0 m above the ground,
    respectively, and each layer was also divided into three points for sensor placement,
    which were 1.0 m, 4.0 m, and 7.0 m from the north wall. The bottom and middle
    layers contained three temperature and humidity sensor nodes each, and the top
    layer contained one sensor node at the center point. Each plane contained seven
    temperature and humidity sensor nodes. A total of 21 temperature and humidity
    sensors (Figure 3a, numbered 1-21) were placed inside each greenhouse. One CO2
    sensor and one light intensity sensor were placed in the center of each layer
    of the middle plane. A total of three CO2 and three light intensity sensors were
    placed inside each greenhouse. Five sensors for measuring the outside air temperature,
    humidity, airflow and airflow direction, solar radiation, and light intensity
    were placed 0.5 m above the top of the greenhouse. Figure 3a shows the positions
    of the data acquisition sensor nodes in different cross-sections of the greenhouse
    as well as those for the outside data. Figure 3b shows the distance and height
    between sensors in a cross-section of the greenhouse. All sensors were installed
    inside and outside of the Chinese solar greenhouse, and data were collected. The
    experiment was conducted in two selected CSGs during November and December 2018,
    which lasted for approximately three weeks. This period was chosen because it
    allowed for the cultivation of strawberries at different growth stages, facilitating
    comparative analysis. Due to the consistency in parameter fluctuations seen from
    the preliminary test on various days, a day with the maximum solar radiation was
    selected for this analysis [23,40]. Descriptive statistical analysis methods (average,
    one-way ANOVA, and least significant difference (LSD) all-pairwise comparisons
    test) were used in this study. A software package, Statistix 10 (Analytical Software,
    Tallahassee, FL, USA), was used for the statistical analysis. Figure 3. Wireless
    sensor network (WSN) during the experiment: (a) positions of the sensors in both
    greenhouses, (b) sensor-to-sensor distance inside and outside of the greenhouse,
    (c) arrangement of the sensor nodes inside the greenhouse with plants, and (d)
    positions of the external sensors on top of the greenhouse. During the experiments,
    the WSN recorded all the data from the inside and outside of the greenhouse. The
    sensor nodes consisted of Arduino UNO 328 microcontrollers, sensors, power sources,
    and nRF24L01 2.4 GHz wireless transceiver modules. After wiring the sensors with
    Arduino UNO, a code for each of the sensor nodes was sketched in the Arduino software
    IDE 1.8.7 (Arduino, arduino.cc). This was uploaded, and the program was run for
    data collection. Real-time data were collected from the sensors and were then
    remotely and directly plotted in an MS Excel sheet using the parallax data acquisition
    tool (PLX-DAQ, Parallax Inc., Rocklin, CA, USA) through serial communication.
    The transmitter nodes were referred to as slaves, and the receiver nodes were
    referred to as masters. The slaves transmitted the sensor data, while the receivers
    received it from the slaves. The sensor nodes were calibrated after the system
    was fabricated, as some of the sensors from the same manufacturer might vary in
    their readings. To calibrate the sensors, data were taken for approximately 15
    min under known temperature and humidity conditions. Three replications of this
    calibration were performed. Figure 4a shows the schematic diagram of the data
    receiving, processing, and transmission process when using Arduino Uno microprocessor
    and wireless transceiver modules, as well as the visualization and monitoring
    that was conducted through the PLX-DAQ tool. Figure 4b shows the data visualization
    using PLX-DAQ from the sensor nodes and gateway. Figure 4. (a) Schematic diagram
    of the data receiving, processing, and transmission process, as well as the visualization
    and monitoring using the PLX-DAQ tool. (b) Data visualization using PLX- DAQ from
    the sensor nodes and gateway. 3. Results and Discussions 3.1. Variability in Temperature
    and Humidity The indoor air temperature of a greenhouse can impact various factors
    such as water and carbon fluxes within the plant, fruit quality [41,42], and energy
    consumption [43]. Air temperature also has an effect on the humidity condition.
    Therefore, the proper control and management of indoor air temperature is crucial
    to ensure optimal microclimate conditions in the greenhouse. Figure 4 and Figure
    5 show the overall variability in the temperature and humidity inside and outside
    both greenhouses (with and without crops) during the experiments in the winter.
    The air temperature both inside and outside the greenhouse gradually increased
    to a peak value and then decreased over time. Significantly, the maximum indoor
    and outdoor temperatures occurred at different times, with a delay observed in
    the maximum indoor temperature. The hourly minimum and maximum temperatures outside
    the greenhouses were −9.2 °C (8:00 h) and 3.6 °C (11:00 h), respectively; the
    hourly minimum and maximum humidity outside the greenhouses were 16.1% (13:00
    h) and 94.2% (5:00 h and 6:00 h), respectively. The hourly average temperature
    showed an upward trend from 9:00 h to 12:00 h, followed by a gradual decrease
    thereafter. On the other hand, the humidity exhibited a rapid increase between
    13:00 h and 15:00 h and continued to rise steadily until 7:00 h. The hourly minimum
    and maximum temperatures inside the CSG without crops were 8.84 °C (5:00 h) and
    30.3 °C (12:00 h), respectively, and the humidity was 25.63% (12:00 h) and 94.26%
    (15:00 h), respectively. Similarly, the hourly minimum and maximum temperatures
    inside the CSG with crops were 9.96 °C (4:00 h) and 24.5 °C (12:00 h), respectively,
    and humidity was 32.6% (12:00 h) and 92.1% (5:00 h), respectively. The air temperatures
    within the two greenhouses followed a pattern that was quite similar. The inside
    temperature began to increase once the cotton blanket was removed at 8:00 h and
    reached its maximum temperature at around 12:00 h. Once the temperature started
    to drop, the rate at which the air temperature dropped slowed down when the blanket
    was placed over the south roof at 15:00 h. As shown in Figure 5, the air temperatures
    within the greenhouse were comparable whether crops were present or not, except
    for the lower layer, which was very warm (especially during the night). The temperature
    differences between the layers in both CSGs are also depicted in Figure 5, indicating
    a temperature difference of approximately 2.2 °C between layers in the CSG without
    crops and around 1.4 °C between layers in the CSG with crops. The daily average
    temperature inside both greenhouses was approximately 16.4 °C, which was higher
    than the average outside temperature. Figure 5. Temporal variation in the temperature
    inside both greenhouses in different layers and the temperature outside the greenhouses.
    The humidity differences between the layers in both greenhouses are shown in Figure
    6. In the CSG without crops, the humidity difference was lower throughout the
    daytime, and differences between layers were smaller compared with the CSG with
    crops. The differences during the night were more pronounced, and humidity was
    higher in the lower layer than in the top layer. During the day and night, the
    differences in the humidity between the layers of the CSG with crops were more
    pronounced. During the daytime, the humidity of the bottom layer was lower than
    that of the top layer because the crop respiration rate was higher; however, the
    humidity of the bottom layer was higher than the other two layers at night. The
    humidity inside both CSGs was approximately 15.6% lower than the outside humidity.
    Snowfall was observed during the experiment at night; however, it had little effect
    on the environmental conditions inside the greenhouses due to the cotton blanket.
    Thus, temperature and humidity varied at different times and heights within the
    CSGs. Figure 6. Temporal variation in the humidity inside both greenhouses in
    different layers and the temperature outside the greenhouses. The experimental
    data from both solar greenhouses (with and without crops) with three different
    layers (bottom, medium, and top) were analyzed using the Kriging method in Surfer
    8.0 (Golden Software, LLC, Golden, CO, USA). Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the spatial
    and vertical variability of the temperature using the 1 h average from 11:00 to
    12:00, 16:00 to 17:00, and 22:00 to 23:00 h for the winter experiment in both
    greenhouses. The temperature levels on the three distinct sides were comparable,
    as were the temperatures inside each layer, which were also homogeneous. In the
    CSG with crops, the highest temperature of 28.22 °C was found in the top layer
    of the rear side between 11:00 and 12:00 h, and the lowest temperature of 5.42
    °C was found in the lower layer of the rear side between 22:00 and 23:00 h. For
    the CSG without crops, the maximum temperature reached 27.81 °C in the middle
    layer of the center side from 11:00 to 12:00 h, while the minimum temperature
    was 5.18 °C in the lower layer of the rear side between 22:00 and 23:00 h. During
    the observed time period, it was found that the front and center sides of the
    CSG were relatively warmer, potentially indicating a heat loss induced by the
    structural flaws. To address this, implementing additional heating or repairing
    the defective parts could be effective remedies. Temperature variations were found
    to be consistent across all locations within the CSG. The presence of crops restricted
    air mobility within the greenhouse, leading to a warmer bottom layer compared
    to the bottom layer without crops. As sunset approached, the air temperature in
    both greenhouses decreased. However, the brick wall surrounding the greenhouse
    radiated stored energy during the night, thus helping to maintain a warm environment,
    albeit with slightly cooler temperatures in the bottom layer compared to the middle
    and top layers. Snowfall and rain had minimal effects on the overall temperature
    distribution within both greenhouses. Figure 7. Temperature distribution inside
    the CSG with crops. (a) The average temperature distribution for 11:00–12:00 h,
    (b) the average temperature distribution for 16:00–17:00 h, and (c) the average
    temperature distribution for 22:00–23:00 h. Figure 8. Temperature distribution
    inside the CSG without crops. (a) The average temperature distribution for 11:00–12:00
    h, (b) the average temperature distribution for 16:00–17:00 h, and (c) the average
    temperature distribution for 22:00–23:00 h. Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the spatial
    and vertical variability of the average inside humidity of the CSGs with and without
    crops for the front, middle, and rear sides at different heights. The humidity
    level at the center was lower than that at the front and rear. In the case of
    the CSG with crops, the maximum humidity was 88.32% in the bottom layer of the
    front side from 11:00 to 12:00 h, whereas the minimum humidity was 25.62% in the
    middle layer of the center side from 16:00 to 17:00 h. For the CSG without crops,
    the maximum humidity was 89.41% in the top layer of the rear side from 22:00 to
    23:00 h, whereas the minimum humidity was 23.33% in the middle layer of the front
    side from 11:00 to 12:00 h. The humidity distribution was more stable in the greenhouse
    with crops than in the greenhouse without crops. During the winter, the temperature
    and humidity increased and decreased significantly. Monitoring the temperature
    and humidity with sensors is critically important for determining how the environment
    inside greenhouses could be best controlled to enhance crop growth and productivity.

    distribution for 11:00–12:00 h, (b) the average humidity distribution for 16:00–17:00

    (c) the average humidity distribution for 22:00–23:00 h. 3.2. CO2 Variability
    The average maximum and minimum CO2 concentrations outside the greenhouses were
    504 ppm (10:00 h) and 387 ppm (7:00 h), respectively. The average maximum and
    minimum CO2 concentration inside the greenhouse without crops was 710 ppm (09:00
    h) and 510 ppm (07:00 h) in the top layer, respectively. The average maximum and
    minimum CO2 concentrations inside the greenhouse with crops were 959 ppm (01:00
    h) and 508 ppm (07:00 h) in the middle and top layers, respectively. Plants require
    CO2 for photosynthesis. The optimal level of CO2 varies depending on the plant
    and light conditions in the CSG. When the light intensity decreases in the greenhouse,
    photosynthesis and CO2 consumption decrease. Figure 11 illustrates the daily variation
    in the CO2 concentration at various layers within and outside of both greenhouses.
    The CSG with crops (Figure 11a) demonstrated a considerable daily fluctuation
    in CO2 levels. The cotton blanket was closed throughout the night, and the CO2
    content grew monotonically as a result of plant respiration, which slowed down
    with time and reached 700 to 959 ppm. As soon as the cotton blanket was opened,
    crop photosynthesis caused the CO2 levels to decrease significantly to 500–600
    ppm. Light intensity was in opposition to the trend, which showed a significant
    connection between the two variables. A similar pattern was observed by Zhao et
    al. [44] in tomato plants and by Zhang et al. [45] in their study. In the CSG
    without crops (Figure 11b), there were incredibly small fluctuations throughout
    the day. Figure 11. The ambient CO2 concentrations inside the solar greenhouses:
    (a) with crops and (b) without crops. CO2 levels in ambient air are typically
    about 340 ppm by volume, and all plants grow well at this level [46]. However,
    when CO2 levels are increased by 1000 ppm, photosynthesis rises correspondingly,
    resulting in an increase in available sugars and carbohydrates for plant development
    [47] and inducing a favorable effect on crop yield [48]. According to Figure 11,
    the CSG with crops demonstrated optimal growing conditions between 600 and 1000
    ppm CO2. The maximum CO2 concentration was found at 2:00–3:00 h, and the minimum
    CO2 concentration was found at 17:00–18:00 h in the CSG with crops. 3.3. Solar
    Radiation and Light Intensity As the conditions were sunny during the experiment,
    solar radiation had a direct effect on the CSGs. The maximum average solar radiation
    was 222.40 Wm−2 from 12:00 h to 13:00 h. Figure 12 shows the total solar radiation
    for a day at the experimental site. In accordance with the optical properties
    of the plastic film, the CSG in Shenyang is oriented 5–6° from south to west,
    which maximizes the amount of sunlight entering the CSG through the south roof.
    At the same time, it is particularly difficult to measure the actual radiation
    absorbed by the north wall and the ground [49]. The south roof not only provides
    proper lighting conditions inside the greenhouse but also provides heat from solar
    radiation to the wall and ground. The heat accumulated throughout the day was
    released to maintain a stable environment inside the greenhouse and to fulfill
    the fundamental temperature needs for crop viability when solar radiation was
    not available at night. Furthermore, the capacity of the walls and ground to block
    solar radiation should be taken into consideration while building greenhouses.
    Figure 12. Outside solar radiation at the experimental site. The average maximum
    light intensity outside the greenhouses was 54,612.5 lx (12:00 h to 13:00 h).
    The average maximum inside light intensity in the CSG without crops was 38,612.5
    lx, 44,412.5 lx, and 48,612.5 lx (12:00 h to 13:00 h) in the bottom, middle, and
    top layers, respectively. The average maximum light intensity in the CSG with
    crops was 32,660.19 lx, 36,618.12 lx, and 40,660.48 lx (12:00 h to 13:00 h) in
    the bottom, middle, and top layers, respectively. Figure 13 displays the average
    outside light intensity and the light intensity at different layers inside two
    greenhouses, revealing a significant variation pattern throughout the day. Upon
    opening the curtain at 8:00 h, crop photosynthesis begins, leading to a linear
    increase in light intensity from 8:30 h to 11:30 h inside each greenhouse. Thereafter,
    the growth rate declined between 11:30 h and 12:30 h due to decreased CO2 concentration.
    From 13:00 h to 15:00 h, there was a linear decrease in light intensity, and the
    cotton blanket was closed at 15:00 h. The average minimum light intensity was
    0 lx (20:00 h to 4:00 h) both inside and outside of both greenhouses. It was observed
    that the CSG with crops had a higher light intensity at the bottom layer compared
    to the CSG without crops. Additionally, in the CSG with crops, the light intensity
    was more similar between the bottom and middle layers, whereas the CSG without
    crops exhibited greater disparity between these layers. Thus, the presence of
    crops significantly impacted the light intensity distribution within the CSGs.
    The orientation of the greenhouse plays a crucial role in light distribution.
    Before midday, the eastern side experiences weaker light, while the western side
    receives stronger light, and this occurs vice versa in the afternoon [45]. Figure
    13. Different layers in the light intensity inside and outside the greenhouses:
    (a) with crops and (b) without crops. The weather was windy. At midday, the maximum
    average wind speed was 8.3 ms−1 from the northeast (NE). The wind was from the
    southeast (SE) in the late afternoon. There was hardly any wind at night. Figure
    14 shows the wind direction and speed during the experiment. The wind speed outside
    the greenhouse played a crucial role in maintaining optimal growing conditions,
    promoting plant health, and preventing the various issues associated with heat,
    humidity, diseases, and pollination. Figure 14. Wind speed and direction at the
    experimental site. 3.4. The Scenario of Sensor Location for Optimum Monitoring
    and Control The installation of sensors that are based on variability would be
    ideal for the best environmental monitoring and management in a greenhouse. When
    there is more unpredictability in the environment, it would be desirable to have
    more sensors to monitor the circumstances, but this would raise the cost [50].
    Ideally, sensors should be placed at varying heights as the crops grow, with the
    best positions being near the canopy for luminous intensity and CO2 concentration.
    For temperature and humidity, sensor placement options include near the ground
    surface, halfway up the crop canopy, or both. Spatial locations of sensors should
    consider variability, including average, maximum, and minimum values, as well
    as the positions of components like windows, heaters, and coolers [51]. Potential
    sensor installation areas include the center and sides, where windows and entrance
    gates are located [52]. The specific location of sensors should reflect their
    intended purpose. Table 2 presents the results of a statistical analysis conducted
    on temperature and humidity variations within the CSG with crops and the CSG without
    crops. The aim was to assess whether the data measured at different sensor locations
    were statistically different. Table 2. Statistical analysis on the temperature
    and humidity variations within the CSG with and the CSG without crops. To determine
    the significance, the Tukey HSD test was executed. The bar plots displayed in
    Figure 15 represent the distribution of temperature and humidity data recorded
    at each layer of the CSG with crops and without crops. Different letters are placed
    above the bar to indicate the significant differences (at p < 0.05) according
    to the Tukey HSD test. These distinct letters signify that the groups exhibited
    statistical differences. The analysis revealed significant differences in temperatures
    and humidity measured at various locations for both the CSG with crops and the
    CSG without crops. These findings emphasize the importance of carefully selecting
    the optimal sensor location, as there may be seasonal differences in the internal
    greenhouse environment that affect the air temperature data used for internal
    environment control. Figure 15. The bar graph depicts the measured temperature
    and humidity data from different sensor locations in the CSG with and without
    plants. The letters placed above the bar represent the significant differences
    (at p < 0.05) determined through the Tukey HSD test. The variability of ambient
    conditions within a controlled environment is crucial for sensor-based monitoring
    and control. This study focused on understanding how factors such as temperature,
    humidity, and light levels vary across different spatial locations, time periods,
    and vertical heights within these CSGs. Environmental conditions vary among various
    spatial locations within CSGs, including temperature, humidity, CO2, and light
    conditions. Precisely measuring and managing these factors requires understanding
    these differences. Temporal variability involves changes over time in winter,
    including daily fluctuations. Vertical variability examines the variations in
    temperature, humidity, and light at different heights from the ground. Given the
    challenging conditions for plant growth in winter, this study emphasizes the significance
    of seasonal factors. It seeks to determine how the design and management of CSGs
    impact the maintenance of ideal conditions. Understanding spatial, temporal, and
    vertical variations enables growers to implement precise strategies for optimal
    plant growth and yield, even during unfavorable seasons. Sensor-based systems
    are employed to monitor and control the ambient conditions in CSGs effectively.
    These systems employ a network of strategically positioned sensors within the
    CSG environment. These sensors provide real-time information about parameters
    like temperature, humidity, light, CO2 levels, and other relevant parameters.
    The collected data are then processed and analyzed using advanced algorithms and
    machine learning techniques. By considering the variability of ambient conditions,
    sensor-based monitoring and control systems can dynamically adjust environmental
    parameters to maintain optimal growing conditions for plants. Furthermore, by
    integrating machine learning algorithms, the system can learn from historical
    data and make predictions about future variations in ambient conditions. This
    predictive capability enables proactive adjustments to be made in advance, ensuring
    that the CSG maintains stable and optimal growing conditions. Overall, a consideration
    of the variability of ambient conditions within CSGs is crucial for the successful
    implementation of sensor-based monitoring and control systems. Increasing the
    number of sensors and the diversity of their positions would provide more robust
    insights, although the benefits of using additional sensors should be weighed
    against their costs. By accurately measuring and responding to these variations,
    CSGs can provide consistent and ideal growth environments for plants, leading
    to improved crop yield, quality, and resource efficiency. 4. Conclusions The aim
    of this study was to assess the spatial, vertical, and temporal variability of
    environmental variables in CSGs in winter and to provide basic information that
    could be used to aid the monitoring and control of environmental factors in CSGs.
    The average minimum and maximum temperatures inside the CSG without crops were
    8.84 °C (5:00 h) and 30.3 °C (12:00 h), respectively; the average minimum and
    maximum humidity were 25.63% (12:00 h) and 94.26% (15:00 h), respectively. The
    average minimum and maximum temperatures inside the CSG with crops were 9.96 °C
    (4:00 h) and 24.5 °C (12:00 h), respectively; the average minimum and maximum
    humidity were 32.6% (12:00 h) and 92.1% (5:00 h), respectively. The temperature
    difference between layers in the CSG without crops was approximately 2.2 °C, and
    the difference between layers in the CSG with crops was approximately 1.4 °C.
    The temperature increased during the day, and the temperature of the top layer
    was higher than the temperature of the bottom layer inside the greenhouse without
    crops. In addition, air mobility within the greenhouse was limited by the effect
    of crops; consequently, the bottom layer was warmer in the greenhouse with crops
    than in the greenhouse without crops. The concentration of CO2 in the different
    layers inside the solar greenhouse with crops was highest at night. The average
    maximum solar radiation was 222.24 Wm−2 (12:00 h to 13:00 h). The average maximum
    light intensity in the CSG without crops was 38,612.5 lx, 44,412.5 lx, and 48,612.5
    lx (12:00 h to 13:00 h) in the bottom, middle, and top layers, respectively. The
    average maximum light intensity inside the CSG with crops was 32,660.19 lx, 36,618.12
    lx, and 40,660.48 lx from 12:00 h to 13:00 h in the bottom, middle, and top layers,
    respectively. The crops affected the light intensity inside the greenhouse. At
    midday, the maximum average wind speed was 8.3 ms−1 from the NE. Variability in
    the ambient conditions in the greenhouse should be considered for sensor placement
    and sensor-based monitoring, as well as for effective control of the ambient conditions
    in CSGs. Future research should focus on long-term monitoring, crop-specific effects,
    the integration of advanced control systems, and emerging technologies so as to
    enhance crop productivity and environmental sustainability in CSGs. Author Contributions

  description: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an emerging technology that has
    the potential to transform the way agricultural farms operate. However, deploying
    WSNs in agricultural farms presents a unique set of challenges. Limited coverage

    method has been evaluated in terms of network lifetime of the sensor nodes, routing
    and communication overhead. The results have been compared with the existing M-LEACH
    method and the results show that there is an enhancement of 79.02% for average
    network lifetime. The results also show that the proposed method reduces the average
    routing and communication overhead by 49.17% and 38.37% respectively.

  description: Agriculture is basic source of livelihood of people in india. It plays
    major role in economy of country. But now a days due to migration of people from
    rural to urban there is hindrance in agriculture.Monitoring the environmental
    factor is not the complete solution to increase the yield of crops.There are number
    of factors that decrease the productivity to a great extent. Hence automation
    must be implemented in agriculture to overcome these problems.An automation Irrigation
    system there by saving time,money and power of farmer.The traditional farm land
    irrigation techniques require manual intervention.With the automated technology
    of irrigation,the human intervention can be minimized.Continuous sensing and monitoring

    In recent decades, the climate has changed considerably. There have been changes
    in temperature, rainfall patterns, and weather conditions, according to a number
    of recent surveys and research. By 2050, the global demand for crops is projected
    to rise from 60% to 110% of current levels. The effects of climate change on crop
    yield have already been seen in the majority of countries worldwide  [1]. Most
    countries globally have already witnessed the impact of climate change on crop
    yield. To reduce food security problems, It is crucial to identify the weather
    conditions that influence yields and to create plans for agriculture to adapt
    to climate change in order to lessen issues with food security  [2]. In today’s
    key agricultural regions of the world, crop production is severely hampered by
    escalating drought, climate change, and elevated temperatures. As a result, the
    difficulty of raising food yields to satisfy future demand can be overcome by
    accelerating the identification and adoption of techniques for coping with climate
    change [3]. Accurately identifying the climatic factors influencing agricultural
    output is a crucial first step in adjusting to climate change and reducing its
    impact on crop yield. One choice is, as previously noted, to change the sowing
    date. Precision farming is one of the sophisticated technologies that can be utilized
    to manage the dangers and hazards associated with food that result from population
    growth [4], [5]. Compared to other industries, the agriculture business lags behind
    in adopting new Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, despite the rise in fascinating
    research and innovative smart agriculture projects. The use of sensor technologies
    in farming is necessary to collect information on the soil, crops, various environmental
    factors, animal behavior, and tractor health. Sensor data can offer farmers useful
    information regarding weather conditions and forecasts, crop monitoring and production
    projections, as well as animal and plant disease detection [6], [7], [8]. For
    connecting wireless devices over a mesh network, Zigbee is the most widely used
    communication standard in the wireless sensor network (WSN) paradigm  [9], [10],
    [11]. Almost all crops suffer from pests, diseases, and insects that reduce yield.
    Pesticides and insecticides are not always practicable and can be hazardous to
    all birds and animals. Additionally, it impacts the food chain and the animal
    kingdom’s natural ecosystem [12]. Crop diseases considerably lower the yield.
    According to several academic works, insects, parasites, viruses, animals, and
    weeds reduce agricultural production yield by 20%–40% globally [13]. Furthermore,
    they raise numerous immediate and future concerns for food security worldwide  [14].
    A large amount of agricultural productivity is lost due to pests and diseases
    every year, particularly in the semi-arid conditions that prevail in India’s climate
    [15]. Temperature and humidity levels play a major role in the development of
    insects and the success of agricultural endeavors. Only after understanding this
    relationship, a prediction system can be developed that controls the growth of
    parasites [16]. Some analyses also suggest that temperature and rainfall are essential
    factors in insect growth [17]. Increased rainfall also helps spread plant diseases.
    Monitoring weather factors such as rainfall, humidity, and condensation is therefore
    critical to avoiding pest outbreaks and reducing the frequency of insecticide
    and fungicide application. Pest occurrence in crops is also strongly related to
    the soil environment and soil management  [18]. In this proposed work, a system
    is designed that maximizes yield by finding the higher growth windows for Rice
    and Sugarcane crops and finds poor breeding conditions of pests attacking these
    crops. There are two contributions to the proposal. First, we set up a network
    of wireless IoT sensors to collect agricultural field data. Second, we identify
    the most appropriate planting window with the highest yield and the lowest incidence
    of pest invasion. An IoT crop monitoring network is to be deployed, which is used
    to capture regular samples of climate characteristics and generate crop cycle
    data sets [19], [20], [21]. Also, the collected meteorological data were used
    as training data by the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to improve the
    rule base of fuzzy logic-based prediction systems. Also, the collected meteorological
    data were used as training data by the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm
    to improve the rule base of fuzzy logic-based prediction systems. Barometric pressure,
    daily temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation are all measured and included
    in the collected data. The information is gathered by the sensor node, then transmitted
    to the base station in a manner that supports multi-hop communication, and finally,
    it is stored in the cloud. The data that is kept in the cloud has already been
    predefined in order to account for inputs that may fluctuate owing to low battery
    voltage or sensor calibration issues. The analysis of conditioned data allows
    for the capture of the correlations between the temperature, humidity, and precipitation
    that are necessary for the breeding of a specific insect. For the proposed fuzzy
    system, the Cauchy membership function is used. The attributes are subdivided
    and assigned five linguistics variables, i.e., (VLOW) is assigned to very low,
    for low, (LOW) is assigned, (MODRT) is assigned to moderate, (HIGH) and (VHIGH)
    to high, and very-high, respectively. The variance, width, and the center of each
    linguistic variable are calculated and is coded as a chromosome for processing
    in the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA). The novelty of the proposed
    work is summarized as follows: • Deployment of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless IoT enabled
    sensor network monitoring infrastructure in medium grass vegetation. • Implementation
    of multi-objective optimized fuzzy inference system, that identifies the most
    suitable planting window with the highest yield and the lowest incidence of pest
    invasion. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the
    related work in the literature. The discussion on deployed IoT monitoring infrastructure
    and its network parameter is done in Section 3. The modeling of the Fuzzy inference
    system and multi-objective declaration is presented in Section 4. The result analysis
    and validation are discussed in Section 5 and finally, work is concluded in Section
    6. 2. Related literature The Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics (DA)
    are getting serious attention as potential solutions to the problem of how to
    feed the globe in the next years [22]. There were an estimated 30 million installations
    of IoT devices in agriculture in 2015; experts anticipate that number will more
    than double by 2020, reaching 75 million. It is anticipated that the utilization
    of IoT and DA would make smart agriculture possible, which will then give high
    operational efficiency as well as high production [23], [24], [25]. Wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) have been used for smart farming and food production for a variety
    of applications, including environmental monitoring, precision farming, automation
    of machine and process management, and product tracking and tracing [26], [27],
    [28]. Self-organizing, self-configuring, self-diagnosing, and self-healing make
    WSN ideal for smart agriculture and the food sector. The wireless sensor network
    (WSN) is an integrated system that includes RF transceivers, sensors, microcontrollers,
    and power supplies [29]. However, because to the rapid development of IoT, a paradigm
    change has occurred, moving away from the utilization of WSN for smart agriculture
    and toward IoT as the primary driver of smart agriculture. The Internet of Things
    is an integration of many currently existing technologies, such as wireless sensor
    networks (WSN), radio frequency identification (RFID), cloud computing, middleware
    systems, and end-user applications [30], [31]. Improved agricultural output, product
    quality, and financial returns are all possible thanks to the Internet of Things
    (IoT) because of the decision tools and automation technologies it makes possible
    to apply across a wide range of agricultural contexts. It is possible to estimate
    agricultural output with the use of data such as rainfall, leaf area index, leaf
    moisture content, and soil parameters [32], [33]. The Internet of Things has found
    a number of uses in the agricultural sector. Crop and livestock monitoring [34],
    [35], machinery [36], irrigation and water quality monitoring [37], weather monitoring
    [38], soil monitoring [39], disease and pest control [40], automation and precision
    [41] , to name a few. In agriculture, accurate data analysis is crucial for enhancing
    production and efficiency. The requirements of various Internet of Things applications
    have led to the division of data analytics into several categories [42]. Massive
    analytics, memory analytics, business intelligence analytics, and real-time analytics
    are all part of this category [43]. The data comprise of sensor data, audio, pictures,
    and video. Disease identification in leaves, stems, and fruit quality [44], weed
    detection and irrigation [45], and many more applications have all made substantial
    use of image processing in agriculture. Recently, farmers have been using image
    processing with the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve yields and decrease crop
    failure. Drones will be used to take periodic aerial photographs, and Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices will be used to monitor the weather and other environmental
    conditions [46]. Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have
    led many researchers to apply predictive models to solve problems in different
    disciplines in real-time [47]. Researchers use machine learning in agriculture
    to study seed varieties, plant physical types [48], weed classification [49],
    [50], pest classification [51], crop disease control [52], etc. All crops require
    special climatic conditions for ideal growth and higher produce. Various work
    in the literature has been conducted to determine the effective sowing periods
    according to different climatic conditions [53]. Many studies have used agro-ecological
    models to determine climatic fluctuations and their effects on crop production.
    The model uses different types of data related to soil, climate, and crops [54],
    [55], [56]. Pests and their diseases are the determinants of yield quantity and
    quality of crops. The main pests of Sugarcane prevalent in Indian Territory are
    Sugarcane stem borer, Green bug, Chinch bug, and Pink stem borer [57]. Rice cultivars
    are affected by leaf folder, brown plant hopper, yellow stem borer, gall midge,
    and gundhi bug [58]. The development of these pests in plants is correlated to
    the traits and anatomy of the crop; thus, they are related to management practices
    primarily associated with climatic characteristics, which particularly raise fluctuations.
    Recent work in precision agriculture is using deep learning techniques to develop
    models for real-time monitoring of insect development in the field [59], [60].
    Zhang et al. (2017) proposed a comparative study of various machine learning models
    to find pest occurrence regions [61]. Machine learning is useful for data analytics
    to generate automated predictive models [5], [62]. The field of computer science
    deals with pattern recognition using the computer learning theory of artificial
    intelligence. One can derive the most important insights from the big data collected
    in the data analytics and machine learning field. It reveals hidden relationships
    between parameters that affect agriculture, such as temperature, soil salinity,
    and humidity. The most popular and relevant machine learning techniques for predicting
    pests and diseases of crops by analyzing the weather data include artificial neural
    networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and fuzzy
    logic. For example, the author proposed a machine learning system based on SVM
    to classify two diseases of apple trees. The leaf images were used as the input
    to train the model [63]. K-Nearest Neighbor is used for the detection of anthracnose
    rots [64]. Similarly, the multi-layer perceptron is used for the prediction of
    Verticillium fungus in the farmlands of the United States [65]. However, there
    are no bibliographic studies on disease prediction algorithms in the Indian region.
    Latest advancements in computer vision and image processing have enabled a comprehensive
    analysis of crop-related properties, providing scientific assessments and increasing
    productivity. For example, CNN was used to classify images of wheat spikelets
    and spikes accurately and to track the location of wheat spikelets and spikes
    correctly [66]. Similarly, image processing techniques were employed to enumerate
    the spikelets of wheat crops and concluded that the leaves and spikelets of the
    crop differ in texture and color. Therefore, he used the law of energy texture
    as a specific property for forming the neural network model. A deep convolutional
    neural network was used to detect the number and width of stems in sorghum crops
    since this attribute is used to estimate the annual yields of most crops [67].
    Fuzzy systems help to solve many decision-making problems in agriculture and often
    provide the best input-based decisions and knowledge-based rules. Fuzzy systems
    are a division of intelligent systems that facilitate the widespread use of human
    expertise to detect insufficient structural problems and handle insufficient incomplete
    data. Fuzzy systems are intelligent systems that apply information and inference
    processes to address critical problems. For example, fuzzy logic has been used
    for sustainable node deployment in the farmland for crop monitoring [68]. A prototype
    that used artificial intelligence and machine learning to assess the severity
    of diseases in rice cultivation has been developed [69]. In this work, the authors
    used the K means and fuzzy logic to calculate the extent of disease in rice. Their
    model showed 86% accurate results [69]. In another work, fuzzy logic to get the
    best crop model in agriculture. The results showed that the model needs to be
    modified, and the proposed ecological model is used to maximize crop productivity
    [70]. However, most of the work are using image processing. Despite huge advantages,
    IoT also has limitations. There is a wide variety of sensor types, each with its
    own communication interface and incompatible communication protocols, which leads
    to a high software and hardware footprint and challenges in future growth. Embedded
    gateway middle-ware is essential to the IoT, although its study and implementation
    are still in their infancy. The majority of research on monitoring and perception
    of agricultural IoT is concentrated on data collecting and processing by a single
    equipment; however, there is a dearth of studies on full application systems.
    Research and implementation of IoT-enabled intelligent farm equipment have mostly
    centered on improving the performance of isolated technologies. When it comes
    to transferring large amounts of data, agricultural IOT depends heavily on the
    availability of a fast wireless-WAN. High-speed data transfer is not practical
    given the poor wireless connection signal present in the isolated agricultural
    area. As a result, the only thing we can do to guarantee the system’s ability
    to function effectively in real-time is to increase the data coding efficiency.
    The proposed work focus on the deployment of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless IoT enabled
    sensor network monitoring infrastructure in medium grass vegetation. The data
    collection is done in the real-time and can be scaled to similar medium grass
    vegetation. 3. Network setup The aim of this work is to implement a low-power
    IEEE 802.15.4 CC2538-2592 SoC microcontroller to establish a sensor node network.

    high processing power. The sensor node processing unit is designed with a 2.4
    GHz Arm Cortex-M3 32-bit multi-protocol wireless MCU and is equipped with three
    LG CS318650 lithium-ion cells (3.6 V, 2200 mAh) connected in parallel [71]. A
    node is equipped with a capacitive soil moisture sensor, photo-resistor, and a
    TMP36 multi-probe temperature sensor in the area. The node is surrounded by a
    PLA enclosure and placed on a PVC conduit above the ground to protect the node
    from environmental hazards. The physical layer of the Contiki 3.0 implementation
    of RTOS uses DSSS-OQPSK (Direct Sequence Spectrum Shift Orthophasic Phase Shift
    Keying) modulation. A data rate of 250 kbps is maintained and a bit error rate
    of 2% is used for all measurements. Each byte is divided into two 4-bit symbols.
    Each symbol is assigned to 16 pseudo-random sequences, and each sequence has 32
    elements. The chip sequence is sent at 2 Mchips/s, with each symbol’s least significant
    chip (C0) sent first. 4. Proposed methodology The main goal of precision farming
    system modeling is to understand how to tune the model to handle the type of data
    set in question. Agricultural datasets contain the massive amount of uncertainties
    that are very fluctuating in nature and are correlated to other parameters, making
    it difficult to determine a system capable of resolving these uncertainties [72].
    Research and experimentation have shown that fuzzy logic models can deal with
    fluctuation associated with environmental and agricultural data sets. Fuzzy logic
    and fuzzy set theory work similar to human understanding and, due to this ability,
    are used to solve the inaccuracy, uncertainties, and subjectiveness associated
    with application-based models and are used in various decision support systems
    [73]. Fig. 3 illustrates the proposed model. The weather parameters chosen for
    the modeling of the proposed system are soil temperature (STem), daily temperature
    (ATem), relative humidity (RHum), and rainfall (Rain). These parameters are chosen
    based on the literature reviews suggesting the apparent correlation between weather,
    crop growth, and pest breeding conditions [17], [74]. Table 2, Table 3 shows the
    weather conditions for pest and crop growth. Once the attributes are given as
    input to the fuzzy inference system, each attribute are further divided into five
    linguistic variables. Based on the expert opinion rule base and the knowledge
    base of the fuzzy inference system is designed. The rule base is optimized using
    the NSGA2. The model outputs the cropping window which has a higher crop growth
    rate and minimum pest growing probability. Download : Download high-res image

    November early 4.1. Fuzzy inference system preparation The initial step is to
    normalize the dataset to the range [0,10]. (1) After normalization, using Eq.
    (1), the assignment of the Linguistic Variables (LV) is done for each attribute
    . Each parameter is sub-categorized into five linguistic variables using the Cauchy
    membership function. In the model training step, all possible combinations of
    features are taken as input and are used to generate a crisp output. The training
    data is then transmitted to the FIS (Fuzzy inference system). The fuzzy inference
    system’s membership distribution, knowledge base, and rule base are initialized
    using the data collected through the deployed IoT infrastructure. To each linguistic
    variable a fuzzy set is associated. These values are calculated using the membership
    function distribution with a constraint that there must be one maximum value equal
    to 1 associated with each linguistic terms. Table 4 shows the attribute name and
    the associated linguistic variable. Table 4. Linguistic variables assigned to
    attributes. Input attributes A Linguistic variable Rainfall Atmospheric temperature
    Soil temperature Relative/absolute humidity 4.1.1. Formation of membership function
    The Mamdani linguistic fuzzy inference system (MFIS) was used to identify the
    suitable growing season and predict the spread of pest infestations on crops.
    describes the behavior of the system based on explicit rules made up of linguistic
    variables (LVs) that assume the values of a series of words with real meaning.
    MFIS modeling includes rule-based design, database design, and Defuzzyfication
    type design. The proposed entry in MFIS is a dataset . The dataset includes input
    parameters like daily temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, soil temperature,
    and planting time of the crop in a particular month of the year i.e.,  . The is
    the minimum and is the maximum value for attribute , and are the upper and lower
    limits of the attribute range shown in Table 2, i.e.,  . The rule base of a fuzzy
    inference system consists of a large number of fuzzy rules, where, is the set
    of all possible MFIs rules. Furthermore, for a particular set of attributes as
    input, the number of fuzzy rules is limited by the and values i.e.,  . Fuzzy rules
    are associated with a set of fuzzy inputs for element and a set of fuzzy outputs
    for elements. For the proposed model, the input set consists of temperature, humidity,
    precipitation, soil temperature, and outputs are identified i.e., suitable planting
    windows and the possibility of insect infestation. Therefore, and , respectively.
    The CMF value of the attributes is shown in Table 5. The relationship between
    and is represented by a membership function , where, . The membership function
    database is created using the Cauchy function and is given as follows: (2) where,
    , , and , are the center, half-width, and slope at the crossover point of the
    membership function. The CMF values for input attributes are presented in Table
    5. The structure of the rule base is given as follows: (3) Table 5. CMF values

    7.577 5.880 4.1.2. Design of knowledge base is a set of rules for a fuzzy classifier
    associated with the following assumptions. First, at least one fuzzy rule must
    exist for each output class i.e.,  . Second, the number of fuzzy rules in any
    set must be between a minimum and maximum value i.e.  and . To every fuzzy set
    there is an integer value associated, which is generated from the hierarchical
    output set and normalized attribute set . To obtain accurate results, the defuzzification
    method (CoG/CoA) is used. The resulting contiguous membership function identifies
    and aggregates centroids from all subareas to obtain a fuzzy output. 4.1.3. Calculation
    of firing degree The degree of activation, usually referred to as firing degree
    of the rule associated with the input data is the degree of persistence of the
    if part of the fuzzy rule, expressed by and determined using Eq. (4). (4) Hence,
    the degree of activation equals to the t-norm operation done on complete dataset
    and the fuzzy set generated from . The summation of all the firing degree of all
    the rules with a restriction that the output is equal to , the equation for calculation
    of the degree of association between input dataset and output set can be given
    as; (5) 4.1.4. Calculating degree of classification The degree of classification
    accuracy of the classifier is represented by the . If the degree of association
    is highest, the classification is considered more accurate, that is; (6) 4.2.
    NSGA-II based multi-objective model formulation The objective for formulation
    of proposed multi-objective model is to accurately identify extensive fuzzy system
    for identification of ideal crop plantation time and low pest breeding time identification.

    Objective 1: Objective 2: Constraints Constraint 1: Constraint 2: Constraint 3:
    . Range condition Condition 1: Condition 2: 4.2.1. Objectives declaration The
    proposed system is a two-objective model with three range conditions and three
    constraints as represented in Table 6. The first objective is to identify the
    suitable window for sowing of the crop such that the harvest is highest and is
    calculated from Eq. (7). (7) where, represents the attribute and represents the
    mean value of the attribute. Since the growth of the crop is dependent on the
    weather parameter, the inverse of the difference of and gives the better growing
    window for the crop. Next, a maximization function is applied on the equation
    to find the maximum yield. The second objective is to find the time slot of the
    year in which pest breeding probability is low. This is calculated using the following
    equation. (8) 4.2.2. Constraints identification The model is build with three
    constraints, namely constraint 1, constraint 2, and constraint 3. Constraint 1
    ensures in each fuzzy set the number of rules lie within the defined range, i.e.,  .
    Constraint 2 reduces the equivalences between fuzzy sets. (9) (10) The duplicate
    values or quantities within a fuzzy set are represented by the equivalence function
    and checked by calculating overlapping input variables between two fuzzy variables,
    which must not be greater than , i.e.,  . is set to 0.005 to ensure minimal overlap
    in the proposed model. This means that only 5% of overlapping is the maximum allowed.
    Constraint 3 ensures the number of distinct fuzzy rule within a set must be less
    than the pre-ordained value i.e.,  . is calculated by following equation. (11)
    where, denotes the shortest distance between the centers of two different fuzzy
    sets. 4.2.3. Selection of multi-objectives To each individual chromosome in the
    population set, for every input attribute , a variable number of fuzzy rules are
    associated. The connected fuzzy set is represented using real numbers and are
    the center and variance, respectively. For this, and are chosen for model interpretation,
    such that at least 48% of any fuzzy set will be within the variable. The value
    of and is tweaked manually for individual attributes. The operation is performed
    to avoid the convergence of the optimization operation to a local optima. Two
    discrete parameters and , where, , respectively are associated with each individual
    to perform crossover and mutation. 4.2.4. Initial population generation and chromosome
    representation For maintaining the diversity within the initial population, all
    chromosomes are distributed equally so that the rules associated with it lie between
    the minimum and maximum values, with a constraint of association of at least one
    rule with each individual. The next is the encoding of all the linguistic variables
    in the form of the chromosome. The five linguistic variables, i.e., very low,
    low, medium, high, and very high, are represented by the first 15 bits of the
    chromosome. The number of bit allocations is determined by Real-Value Encoding
    with Binary Code (REBC). The output is the slots that has maximum growth probability
    and minimum pest breeding conditions. The initial chromosomes represent a possible
    solution and are part of the initial population . The chromosomes values are derived
    based on the phenotype and in the proposed model. the phenotype is rainfall, humidity,
    soil temperature, temperature, slots number and breeding probability. The phenotype
    is mapped to genotype using REBC encoding. The phenotype-genotype relation is
    shown in Table 7. Genomes are the binary string and with the help of REBC reverse
    mapping, these are converted to the real values. Since weather related attributes
    are further divided into five linguistic variables, and each linguistic variable
    is represented using 3 bits. Based on the bits assigned to linguistic variable,
    number of slots given and the breeding probability, the total bits required to
    represents the fuzzy rule is and for output it becomes . For encoding and decoding
    of the chromosomes Eqs. (12), (13) are used. (12) (13) The initial population
    is generated using Continuous Uniform probabilistic Distribution, based on Eq.
    (14). (14) where and are the upper and lower bounds. Table 7. Chromosome encoding

    and mutation Crossover combines two chromosomes to produce a new chromosome that
    acquires the characteristics of the original chromosome. The probability of a
    roulette wheel is used to select a parent from the initial population. The adopted
    approach to parental choice improves the adaptation of solutions based on the
    quality of the physical situation. Random crossing point selection identifies
    breakpoints in two parents, then selects half of each parent to produce new offspring.
    The mutation is done by doing a little flip operation. This approach reverses
    every bit of a chromosome with a given probability of changing a particular chromosome.
    4.2.6. Fitness value evaluation A chromosome’s fitness is identified based on
    the results produced by a particular fuzzy system implementation. The chromosome
    obtained after each generation is compared in terms of the fitness function. The
    fitness value is the average of all the test cases applied on the chromosome obtained.
    For the proposed model, the fitness is determined by fitting the chromosome obtained
    in the two defined objective functions. As the result of the proposed model is
    a prediction for a particular scenario, so the comparison result is 1 for correct
    recommendations and 0 for incorrect recommendations. This is presented as follows:
    (15) 5. Experimentation and result analysis The experiment is conducted in the
    farmlands situated in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. For the sugarcane dataset collection,
    the sensor nodes were developed in a 7.53 × 104 m area. The data collection started
    with the planting of the crop on November 10, 2019, till June 20, 2020. For rice,
    the nodes were deployed in the farm area of 8.04 × 104 m , and the data collection
    was done from July 13, 2019, till November 18, 2019. For both crops, the readings
    were collected at the interval every 30 min. The rice dataset has 1 lakh number
    of rows and is of 46.46 MB in size. The sugarcane dataset has 1.78 lakh number
    of rows and is 164.64 MB of data. Most of the data attributes are numeric in type.
    For the model preparation, 80% of the entire dataset was used for training and
    20% was used for testing. The condition for the crop growth and the pest occurrence
    is evaluated based on linguistic variables. Fig. 4, Fig. 5 represents the growth
    rates at different time period. The growth of rice can be observed between 26/07/2020
    and 21/08/2020. Similarly, for sugarcane, time after 28/12/2019 and before 13/04/2020
    is suitable. Figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9 describes the growth pattern of the pest in the
    crops selected for study. From Fig. 6, the pest occurrence with high probability
    in the rice crop is observed during the period between 15/07/2020 to 25/07/2020,
    which further decreases. Again, the suitable humidity for high pest growth is
    observed between 21/08/2020 to 11/09/2020, which again becomes moderate. A certain
    low growth rate is observed during 27/08/2020, which gradually increases till
    18/10/2020. After this time gradual decrease in pest occurrence can be noticed.
    Fig. 7 demonstrates the lower pest probability that occurred during the time period
    between 25/07/2020 to 05/08/2020, which remains moderate till 23/09/2020 with
    certain deep observed after this date till 10/10/2020. Another slot with low pest
    occurrence is from 03/11/2020 to 15/11/2020. For the sugarcane crop, the high
    pest occurrence can be observed after 18/01/2020 and before 29/04/2020 from Fig.

    supporting the high growth can be observed after 24/03/2020 and becomes moderate
    after 03/04/2020, and certain low breeding is observed after 16/05/2020. The cross-validation
    process is complex than that of a simple classification system because the set
    of cross-validation solutions is larger. The result of the optimization is a set
    of non-dominated solutions, each with a different number of rules. The -fold cross-validation
    ( 10) method is presented in this section for multi-objective classification problems.
    This process requires data partitions as input. The data is split into smaller
    sections for cross-validation. Any data other than the data used for training
    is passed in each iteration. The non-dominated solutions are the output of the
    MOEA algorithm in each set. Using various functions, the classification rate of
    the algorithm, as well as its sensitivity and specificity, are calculated for
    each non-dominated solution obtained using the data for validation. The obtained
    output is represented for each rule number in the range by calculating the average
    of the classification rate of the solution obtained. The average specificity and
    sensitivity are then calculated using the same method. A comprehensive performance
    comparison of the proposed model, FNSGA, with traditional methods is done. The
    proposed method is first of the kind as per the best knowledge of the authors
    hence traditional algorithms were implemented for the comparison. The models like
    ANN, Bayes Net, SVM, Random Forest, and MRM were used for model comparison and
    evaluation. For the implementation of the algorithms Spark analytic Engine is
    used. A spark 2.0 version was used to make a cluster of 3 PC with specification
    Intel(R) Xeon scalable processor E-2124G with CPU@3.40 GHz. The reason for comparing
    the proposed model with all the above mentioned models is because these models
    are popular machine learning algorithms and perform well on the real time collected
    datasets. All the algorithms taken for study were implemented using Pyspark. The
    training and runtime of each algorithm is presented in Table 8. For Bayes net
    the train time was and run time was , where c is the number for the class. The
    time complexity and run time complexity for ANN with four layers with a, b, c,
    and d number of nodes, and n epochs was . The time complexity of the proposed
    model is O(f(n)), where n is size of dataset and f(n) is the fuzzy logic function.
    Fig. 10 compares the True Positives Rate, and it can be seen that the proposed
    models have the highest True Positives Rate when compared to other models. The
    FP rate of the proposed model is minimum compared to the other models as shown
    in Fig. 11. As shown in Fig. 12, the F-Measure is also close to 1. The Matthews
    correlation coefficient (MCC) is generally used for comparing the prediction quality
    in any classification problem, as shown in Fig. 13. Although other models achieved
    near-96 percent accuracy, the overall performance of the FNSGA model is more effective
    than other algorithms; also, the Area under the ROC curve shows better results
    for the complex and unbalanced dataset. When the AUC values of different machine
    learning models are compared, the proposed model has the most optimized AUC value,
    as shown in Fig. 14. In Fig. 15, the accuracy of models is compared, and it can
    be seen that SVM and ANN achieved similar accuracy while MRM performed better
    than these two models. The proposed model, on the other hand, achieved an accuracy
    of 98.21 percent. Download : Download high-res image (214KB) Download : Download

    Fuzzy inference system that finds out a suitable time for crop plantation such
    that the pest occurrence is also low. Hence, it helps increase crop yield and
    lowers the use of pesticides. The farmland selected for data acquisition is situated
    in the Gwalior district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The region has hot and dry summers
    and very cold and dry winters. The irrigation is mainly monsoon-dependent. The
    weather condition in the region supports the growth of pests in sugarcane and
    rice crops. The model predicts the slots suitable for maximizing crop production
    and shows the probability of pest occurrence during the selected slots. The model
    uses the correlation between the weather conditions and the crop physiological
    and analogical traits to find the cropping time. Likewise, it also finds the correlation
    between the pest growth rate in terms of weather conditions to find out the most
    favorable breeding condition. Finally, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm
    evaluates the optimum slot with a high growth rate of plant and low pest growth.
    The current work is done for the medium grass vegetation for humid subtropical
    region. The proposed mechanism will work on any vegetation under this category.
    Further, in our future works we intend to conduct study for small and large grass
    vegetation. Also, focus will be on developing a recommendation system that will
    help farmers find suitable pesticides and suggest the correct amount of pesticides
    be applied on the field. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

  description: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being utilized widely in many different
    industries, including agriculture, medicine, and the military. They contain many
    distributed sensors to monitor physical or environmental factors, such as temperature,
    humidity, pressure, etc. and use various communication technologies, including
    WiFi, radio frequency (RF), Bluetooth, and ZigBee. ZigBee is always a preferred
    choice for applications in WSNs. ZigBee has remarkable capabilities, such as saving
    energy and transmitting data over long distances. ZigBee end devices, as well
    as a ZigBee coordinator (ZC) and a ZigBee router (ZR), are crucial components
    of the WSNs. This article discusses the fundamentals of the ZigBee network, one
    of the most popular data transmission technologies in wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs). Additionally, we want to discuss the ZigBee communication technologies
    and their applications, particularly in the networks. Different scenarios for
    mobile agents including their routing protocols in WSNs are considered. Simulation
    results of different scenarios demonstrate how easily scalability can be achieved
    and provide a foundation for further ZigBee application development. At last,
    some conclusions and ideas are presented for considerations.

    Hoang Thuan Tran, Cuong V. Nguyen, Nghia Trung Phung, Minh T. Nguyen  Abstract  Wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) are being utilized widely in many different industries,
    including agriculture, medicine, and the military. They contain many distributed
    sensors to monitor physical or environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity,
    pressure, etc. and use various communication technologies, including WiFi, radio
    frequency (RF), Bluetooth, and ZigBee. ZigBee is always a preferred choice for
    applications in WSNs. ZigBee has remarkable capabilities, such as saving energy
    and transmitting data over long distances. ZigBee end devices, as well as a ZigBee
    coordinator (ZC) and a ZigBee router (ZR), are crucial components of the WSNs.
    This article discusses the fundamentals of the ZigBee network, one of the most
    popular data transmission technologies in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Additionally,
    we want to discuss the ZigBee communication technologies and their applications,
    particularly in the networks. Different scenarios for mobile agents including
    their routing protocols in WSNs are considered. Simulation results of different
    scenarios demonstrate how easily scalability can be achieved and provide a foundation
    for further ZigBee application development. At last, some conclusions and ideas
    are presented for considerations.  Keywords  Data collection; Mobile agents; Wireless

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Belagavi, Karnataka, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Advanced farming techniques [1] have witnessed a transformative shift with the
    integration of the IoT into agriculture. IoT-enabled agriculture [2], often referred
    to as smart farming [3], leverages cutting-edge technologies to optimize crop
    production, resource management, and decision-making processes. By embedding sensors,
    actuators, and communication devices across agricultural landscapes, farmers gain
    real-time access to crucial data on environmental conditions, soil quality, crop
    health, and machinery performance. This data-driven approach empowers farmers
    to make more informed decisions, enhance resource efficiency, and ultimately increase
    agricultural productivity. In advanced farming, IoT applications are multifaceted
    and encompass various aspects of crop management [4]–[5]. IoT sensors can monitor
    climatic characteristics including warmth, moisture, precipitation, and sun radiation
    in order to provide reliable weather predictions suited to specific places. Soil
    sensors measure moisture levels, nutrient content, and pH , enabling farmers to
    optimize irrigation and fertilization processes. Crop health is monitored through
    remote sensing techniques and specialized IoT devices, detecting early signs of
    pests, diseases, or stress factors. Furthermore, IoTcompatible machinery and autonomous
    vehicles streamline tasks like planting, harvesting, and pest control, improving
    operational efficiency. The integration of IoT technology in managing cropsowing
    windows [6] offers several advantages. Farmers can enhance their ability to make
    precise and timely choices regarding planting, thus minimizing the likelihood
    of crop failure resulting from unfavorable weather conditions or subpar soil conditions.
    By aligning planting with optimal conditions, crop yield and quality are enhanced,
    resulting in increased agricultural productivity. Additionally, IoT-driven monitoring
    allows for precise resource allocation, such as water and fertilizer, leading
    to improved resource efficiency and sustainability. Overall, IoT-enabled crop-sowing
    windows exemplify the transformative potential of advanced farming practices,
    enabling farmers to harness data-driven insights for more successful and sustainable
    crop production. An Optimized Fuzzy Inference System [7] was developed within
    an IoT environment to identify optimal planting periods for rice and sugarcane
    crops while also assessing unfavorable breeding conditions for pests that pose
    threats to these crops. The attributes that were gathered were divided and linked
    to five linguistic variables, and these were then optimized using a Multi-Objective
    Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to identify the optimal periods for sowing crops.
    Nevertheless, MOEA demand significant computational resources and involve a greater
    degree of manual parameter tuning when optimizing linguistic variables within
    a FIS. In this article, DRL-FIS is introduced for identification of crop-sowing
    window. In DRL-FIS, a network for monitoring crops through IoT will be established
    to gather frequent climate data samples and create datasets for crop growth cycles.
    Additionally, the meteorological data collected will serve as training data for
    DRL to enhance the rule base of fuzzy logic-based prediction systems. DRL excels
    in adapting and mastering intricate linguistic variable optimizations with minimal
    manual parameter adjustments, offering greater versatility and potential efficiency
    in optimizing FIS. SECTION II. Literature Survey A novel approach [8] was introduced,
    which integrated Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Network (NN) techniques
    with weather data to enhance crop yield predictions in southern Brazil. Combining
    Convolutional NN (CNN) or LSTM with Gaussian processes facilitated data feature
    extraction and effectively reduced error maps. Gaussian processes played a crucial
    role in automatically selecting appropriate wavebands from the entire spectrum
    to predict various characteristics of plant leaves. Fuzzy CMeans (FCM) was utilized
    to model and encapsulate expert knowledge for yield prediction and crop management.
    The approach involved a dynamic blend of stationary and mobile equipment to enable
    active and optimal data collection, information integration, and model refinement,
    particularly in high-value agricultural areas. A model [9] was introduced for
    the probabilistic forecasting of crop yields, employing the Epanechnikov kernel
    function and random forest. In the density estimation process, the Epanechnikov
    kernel function was utilized along with the solve-the-equation plug-in method
    proposed by Sheather and Jones. To determine the significance of each weather
    parameter in constructing the quantile random forest model, significance of characteristics
    were computed. These scores helped stakeholders and farmers identify the specific
    weather parameters that had a noteworthy impact on the yield of a chosen crop.
    Nevertheless, it''s important to highlight that it demands significant computational
    resources, leading to a substantial level of computational complexity. A machine
    learning framework [10] was proposed for predicting corn yield across three states
    in the US Corn Belt. The models were formed through a blocked sequential process
    to produce out-of-bag predictions. These predictions were initially generated
    at the country level and subsequently combined at the agricultural district and
    state levels. Nonetheless, it''s crucial to emphasize that while the blocked sequential
    procedure replaced random k -fold crossvalidation, it was observed that stacked
    ensembles exhibited suboptimal performance when applied to time series datasets.
    This is primarily because stacked ensembles tend to underperform when the data
    does not conform to the assumption of independence and identically distributed
    (nonIID) conditions. An innovative mobile application was introduced [11] to aid
    agricultural experts and farmers in managing plantdamaging insects. This application
    incorporated a Deep Learning (DL) approach, specifically the Improved MaskFaster
    Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (IMFR-CNN) method, to efficiently identify
    and address insect infestations affecting crops. The system leveraged Cloud Computing
    (CC) resources for seamless insect recognition and analysis. Moreover, to support
    farmers, a comprehensive database of pesticides was maintained within the application,
    offering recommendations and detailed information about specific crop plants affected
    by pests. This holistic approach aimed to provide valuable assistance to both
    experts and farmers in addressing insect-related challenges in agriculture. However,
    IMFR-CNN less practical for applications with limited processing resources or
    on handheld gadgets with less computing power. An intelligent approach [12] was
    proposed for jute pest identification. The process began with the preparation
    of a jute pest dataset, which underwent evaluation following both manual and automated
    preprocessing and cleansing steps. Following this, five notable pre-trained models,
    specifically DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, VGG19, and ResNet50, were
    chosen based on findings from a prior study to construct the JutePestDetect model.
    Each of these models was modified by substituting the classification layer with
    a global average pooling layer and the inclusion of a dropout layer to facilitate
    regularization. Due to a deficiency in both permission and suitable facilities,
    the utilization of this model prevented the execution of a professional pilot
    test. A decision support system [13] was proposed for pest management. A novel
    technique was developed to consider both biological knowledge and uncertainties
    in field observations, rather than solely depending on statistical correlations,
    for predicting wireworm infestation levels. However, the Bayesian model required
    substantial data for accurate parameter estimation. A crop yield forecasting model
    [14] was proposed on the basis o remote sensing time series data. In this model,
    NDVI seasonal profiles underwent Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical
    Clustering to identify distinct agrophenotypes. These agrophenotypes were then
    utilized to derive crop growth and leaf area index dynamics. These data served
    as a reference for optimizing the most critical parameters of the WOFOST_GT model.
    This refining procedure was executed using gridded weather data as input, with
    a resolution of 0.25 degrees (Copernicus ERA5). The parameter distributions resulting
    from multiple automatic calibrations were sampled to capture the agricultural
    variations within 22 NUTS-3 administrative units. A machine learning-based method
    [15] was proposed for maize yield prediction. In this method, the capacity for
    generalization and transfer of ordinary Deep Neural Network (DNN) models were
    explored and Domain Adaptive NN models constructed using three distinct domain
    adaptation techniques: Discriminative Adversarial Neural Network (DANN), Kullback-Leibler
    Importance Estimation Procedure (KLIEP), and Regular Transfer Neural Network (RTNN).
    However, this method is not much efficient for unbalanced dataset. SECTION III.
    Proposed Methodology In this section, the proposed Deep reinforcement learning
    with Fuzzy Inference System (DRL-FIS) is thoroughly discussed for identification
    of crop-sowing windows. To begin, a wireless IoT sensor network is established
    for the collection of agricultural field data. Subsequently, the system identifies
    the most suitable planting window, optimizing for both yield and pest control.
    The next step involves the deployment of an IoT crop monitoring network, which
    regularly samples climate characteristics, generating datasets that encompass
    the crop cycle. Furthermore, the gathered meteorological data serve as training
    data for DRL, enhancing the rule base of fuzzy logic-based prediction systems.
    The collected data encompasses key meteorological parameters, including barometric
    pressure, daily temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation. Sensor nodes
    collect this information, transmitting it via multi-hop communication to a base
    station, where it is ultimately stored in the cloud. Notably, data in the cloud
    undergoes predefined adjustments to accommodate potential fluctuations resulting
    from factors like low battery voltage or sensor calibration issues. Analyzing
    this conditioned data enables the identification of vital correlations between
    temperature, humidity, and precipitation necessary for specific insect breeding.
    Within the FIS, a Cauchy membership function is utilized. The characteristics
    are classified as “Very Low” (VLOW), “Low” (LOW), “Moderate” (MODRT), “High” (HIGH),
    and “Very High” (VHIGH), each with assigned variance, width, and center values,
    all optimized through DRL. A. Network Setup A low-power IEEE 802.15.4 CC2538-2592
    SoC microcontroller is deployed for the establishment of a sensor node network.
    This proposed work focus areas include outdoor experiments conducted in rice paddy
    and sugarcane fields. Images depict sensor nodes strategically positioned in bare
    land, rice fields, and sugarcane fields. The IoT gateway, which also functions
    as a weather station, is configured with an edge computing platform running on
    a Raspberry Pi 4 and a CC2650 MCU. Data transmission to a remote server is facilitated
    through the creation of a Virtual Network Connection (VNC) utilizing 5G-LTE connectivity.
    In low-gain mode, the CC2650 demonstrates a reception sensitivity of −97dBm for
    Bluetooth low energy and -100 dBm for IEEE 802.15.4. The transceiver is connected
    to an omnidirectional antenna boasting a 5dB gain (ANT-24G905-SMA) and is configured
    to deliver 7dB of power. A multi-probe capacitive soil moisture sensor, based
    on a fringing field, is integrated with a Node MCU. Each sensor node processing
    unit is powered by a 2.4GHz Arm CortexM3 32-bit multi-protocol wireless MCU and
    is supplied with three LG CS318650 lithium-ion cells (3.6V,2200mAh) connected
    in parallel. The sensor node is equipped with a capacitive soil moisture sensor,
    photo-resistor, and a TMP36 multi-probe temperature sensor. For protection against
    environmental hazards, each node is encased in a PLA enclosure and positioned
    on a PVC conduit at a height (h) of 70cm above the ground. The physical layer
    implementation of the Contiki 3.0 real-time operating system employs DSSS-OQPSK
    (Direct Sequence Spectrum Shift Ortho phasic Phase Shift Keying) modulation. A
    constant data rate of 250kbps is maintained, with a 2% bit error rate applied
    to all measurements. Data transmission involves dividing each byte into two 4-bit
    symbols, each assigned to one of 16 pseudo-random sequences, each consisting of
    32 elements. The chip sequence is transmitted at a rate of 2 Mchips /s , with
    the least significant chip (C0) of each symbol being sent first. B. Fuzzy Inference
    System The starting step of FIS is to normalize the dataset from 0 to 1 using
    following (1), F ′ x =( f x − f min x f max x − f min x )× 100 (1) View Source
    In (1), f x denotes the x th attribute of data, f min x denotes the minimum value
    attribute of data and f max x denotes the maximum value attribute of data. Following
    normalization, the linguistic variables assignment is execute for each attribute.
    Each parameter undergoes sub-categorization into five linguistic variables utilizing
    Cauchy membership function. The Cauchy membership function is calculated as, f(
    f x ;W,M,C)= 1 1+ ∣ ∣ f x −C W ∣ ∣ 2M (2) View Source In (2), C,W and M denote
    the center, half-width and slope at the crossover point of the membership function.
    During the model training phase, all potential feature combinations serve as input,
    generating crisp outputs. Subsequently, the training data is transmitted to the
    FIS. The membership distribution, knowledge base, and rule base are initialized
    using data collected through the deployed IoT infrastructure. Each linguistic
    variable is associated with a fuzzy set F , calculated based on the membership
    function distribution μF( f x ) with the constraint that each linguistic term
    must have one maximum value equal to 1. C. Deep Reinforcement Learning The goal
    in formulating the proposed DRL model is to precisely determine an expansive fuzzy
    system capable of identifying the optimal timing for crop planting and concurrently
    identifying periods of reduced pest breeding activity. DRL is a machine learning
    discipline that blends DNN and reinforcement learning. An agent in DRL communicates
    with its surroundings, makes actions, is rewarded, and learns to optimize its
    behaviours over time. Here, DRL is adapted for optimizing the Cauchy membership
    function parameters. 1) Problem Formulation The objective is to optimize C,W and
    M parameters of the Cauchy membership function for every linguistic components
    within the FIS. We can formulate this as a reinforcement learning problem where
    an agent learns to choose optimal regard for these parameters in order to maximize
    a certain objective function, typically associated with the FIS''s performance.
    2) Components of DRL Agent: According to the present situation, the agent is liable
    for decision-making (selecting parameter values). Environment: The environment
    represents the fuzzy inference system with Cauchy membership functions. It provides
    feedback to the agent in the type of rewards based on how well the system performs.
    State Space: The state space defines the possible states of the environment. In
    this case, it includes the current parameters values for each linguistic variable.environment
    represents the FIS with Cauchy membership functions. It provides feedback to the
    agent in the type of rewards based on how well the system performs. Action Space:
    The action space defines the possible actions that the agent can take. In this
    context, it corresponds to selecting new values for the parameters. Reward Function:
    The reward function quantifies how well the FIS with the current parameter values
    performs. It should be crafted to incentivize the agent in discovering parameter
    values that result in improved FIS performance. Policy: The policy is the strategy
    the agent uses to select actions according to the current state. In DRL, this
    is often represented by a DNN. Value Function: The value function estimates the
    expected cumulative reward an agent can obtain from a given state following a
    certain policy. It helps the agent evaluate the desirability of states. Deep Reinforcement
    Learning Algorithm The DRL algorithm involves the following steps: 1) Intiallization
    Initialize the neural network for the policy and, optionally, the value function.
    2) State Transition continuecontinuemissing The agent selects actions based on
    the current policy, and the environment transitions to a new state. In this case,
    the agent selects new parameter values (C,W,M) for the Cauchy membership functions.
    3) Reward Calculation The environment calculates a reward based on the efficiency
    of the FIS with the new parameter values. 4) Experience Replay Experience replay
    is a technique that stores past experiences (state, action, reward, next state)
    in a replay buffer and samples from it during training to improve stability. 5)
    Policy Update The agent updates its policy (neural network) based on the observed
    rewards and experiences. SECTION IV. Result and Discussion The experimental findings
    are shown in this part to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed DRL-FIS against
    OFIS for identifying crop-sowing windows. The experiment was conducted in farmlands
    located in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. For the collection of the sugarcane dataset,
    sensor nodes were developed within an area of 7.53 × 10 4 square meters. Data
    collection commenced on November 10, 2019, and continued until June 20, 2020.
    In the case of rice, sensor nodes were deployed in a farming area covering 8.04
    × 10 4 square meters, and data collection took place from July 13, 2019, to November
    18, 2019. For both crops, data readings were recorded every 30 minutes. The rice
    dataset comprises 100,000 rows and has a file size of 46.46 megabytes, while the
    sugarcane dataset consists of 178,000 rows and is 164.64 megabytes in size. The
    majority of data attributes are of a numeric nature. For model development, 80%
    of the entire dataset was allocated for training purposes, with the remaining
    20% designated for testing. The assessment of crop growth conditions and the occurrence
    of pests are conducted based on linguistic variables. A. Accuracy Accuracy measures
    the overall correctness of identification crop-sowing window by calculating the
    fraction of correct identification to the overall count of identification made.
    It is calculated as, Accuracy  = True Positive(TP)+True Negative(TN) TP+TN+ False
    Positive(FP)+False Negative(FN) View Source Table 1 displays the accuracy of OFIS
    and DRL-FIS for identification of crop-sowing windows. Table. I Comparison of
    accuracy Fig. 1 shows the testing performance between OFIS and DRL-FIS for identification
    of crop-sowing windows with respect to accuracy. On the graph, the X-axis represents
    techniques used to discover crop-sowing windows, while the Y -axis represents
    the corresponding accuracy levels. The accurateness of DRL-FIS is 1.2% greater
    than OFIS for identification crop-sowing window. This result demonstrates that
    the proposed DRL-FIS achieves a higher level of accuracy for crop-sowing window
    identification compared to OFIS. Fig. 1. Comparison of OFIS and DRL-FIS in terms
    of accuracy Show All B. True Positive Rate True Positive Rate (TPR), also known
    as sensitivity or recall, is a metric utilized to estimate the accuracy of a binary
    classification model, such as identifying the presence of a specific event, in
    this case, the discovery of crop-sowing windows. The TPR is described as the proportion
    of correctly identified positive cases (in this context, correctly identified
    sowing windows) to all actual positive cases. It quantifies the proportion of
    websites classified as phishing that are actually phishing websites. TPR can be
    calculated as, TPR= TP TP+FN View Source Table 2 displays the TPR of OFIS and
    DRL-FIS for identification of crop-sowing windows. Table. II Comparison of TPR
    Fig. 2 depicts the testing performance between OFIS and DRL-FIS for identification
    of crop-sowing windows with regard to TPR. On the graph, the X-axis represents
    methods utilized to discover crop-sowing windows, while the Y -axis represents
    the corresponding TPR levels. The TPR of DRLFIS is 1.1% greater than OFIS for
    identification crop-sowing window. This result demonstrates that the proposed
    DRLFIS achieves a higher level of TPR for crop-sowing window identification compared
    to OFIS. Fig. 2. Comparison of OFIS and DRL-FIS in terms of TPR Show All C. False
    Positive Rate False Positive Rate (FPR) in the context of identifying crop-sowing
    windows is a metric of the proportion of incorrect or false alarms, indicating
    the instances when a sowing window is incorrectly identified as suitable when
    it is not. FPR can be premeditated as, FPR= FP FP+TN View Source Table 3 displays
    the FPR of OFIS and DRL-FIS for identification of crop-sowing windows. Table.
    III Comparison of FPR Fig. 3 shows the testing performance between OFIS and DRL-FIS
    for identification of crop-sowing windows with regard to FPR. On the graph, the
    X-axis represents methods utilized to discover crop-sowing windows, while the
    Y-axis represents the corresponding FPR levels. The FPR of DRLFIS is 5.3% less
    than OFIS for identification crop-sowing window. This result demonstrates that
    the proposed DRLFIS achieves a lower level of FPR for crop-sowing window identification
    compared to OFIS. Fig. 3. Comparison of OFIS and DRL-FIS in terms of FPR Show
    All D. F-Measure F-measure is a measure of a test''s accuracy and is defined as
    the harmonious average of precision and recall. In the context of identifying
    crop-sowing windows, it can be utilized to assess the model''s ability to correctly
    identify the optimal planting times while minimizing false alarms. Table 4 displays
    the F-measure of OFIS and DRL-FIS for identification of crop-sowing windows. Table.
    IV Comparison of F-measure Fig. 4 depicts the testing performance between OFIS
    and DRL-FIS for identification of crop-sowing windows with regard to F -measure.
    On the graph, the X -axis represents methods utilized to discover crop-sowing
    windows, while the Y -axis represents the corresponding F-measure levels. The
    F-measure of DRL-FIS is 1.3% greater than OFIS for identification crop-sowing
    window. This result demonstrates that the proposed DRL-FIS achieves a higher level
    of Fmeasure for crop-sowing window identification compared to OFIS. Fig. 4. Comparison
    of OFIS and DRL-FIS in terms of F-measure Show All SECTION V. Conclusion This
    paper introduces a novel approach, the Deep Reinforcement Learning-Fuzzy Inference
    System (DRLFIS), for identifying optimal crop-sowing windows. Within the framework
    of DRL-FIS, an IoT-based crop monitoring network will be established to continuously
    collect detailed climate data, generating datasets for understanding crop growth
    cycles. Additionally, the meteorological data gathered will serve as valuable
    training data for DRL, thereby enhancing the rule base of fuzzy logic-based prediction
    systems. DRL stands out for its ability to adeptly adapt and master complex linguistic
    variable optimizations, requiring minimal manual parameter adjustments. This characteristic
    not only provides greater versatility but also the potential for increased efficiency
    in optimizing the FIS. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This

    IEEE Conference Location: Sapporo, Japan SECTION I. Introduction Due to the climate
    change and rapid population growth, food production is known to become a serious
    issue. In response to the future food shortest crisis, the World Government Summit
    has released a report entitled \"Agriculture 4.0 - The Future of Agricultural
    Technology\" in 2018 for analyzing the food shortage and promoting some novel
    technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and smart
    sensors [1]. For agriculture, the environmental factors known to affect plant
    growth include light, temperature, water, humidity and nutrition [2]. Hence, it''s
    important to understand how those factors affect plant growth. It is known that
    IoT and smart sensors are important technologies for monitoring and controlling
    environmental factors and hence beneficial to increase food production or reduce
    resource consumption. Such a design has been applied to plant growth in green
    house [3] and hydroponic plant water circulation and control [4]. Instead of those
    applications in a closed or indoor environment, in this study we consider to study
    the application in an open or outdoor environment. Based on this goal, we will
    propose an IoT-based platform for monitoring environmental factors. The organization
    of this paper is as follows. First, a design of the IoT-based monitoring platform
    is proposed in Section II. It is followed by the experimental results to demonstrate
    the application of the proposed platform. Finally, concluding remarks are given
    in Section IV to highlight the main findings of the study. SECTION II. Iot-Based
    Monitoring Platform As discussed in [2], the major environmental factors to affect
    plant growth include light, temperature, water, humidity and nutrition. Since
    nutrition is not easy to be monitored due to the complexity of variety, in this
    study we will focus on the development of an IoT platform to collect the information
    of the remaining four factors. Details are presented as follows. A. Structure
    of Proposed Platform In order to collect environmental information for plant growth,
    in this study we proposed a monitoring platform as depicted in Fig. 1. The designed
    platform is consisted of three blocks such as sensing module, heterogeneous network
    gateway and cloud database. Among them, sensing module is developed for collecting
    environmental information such as sun-light, temperature, water and humidity.
    The proposed heterogeneous network gateway plays as a local center to collect
    all the environmental data from sensing modules and then transmit to a cloud database,
    while the code MySQL is employed to build the cloud database. The description
    of each block will be given in the next three subsections. B. Sensing Module In
    the following, we will focus on the development of sensing modules to collect
    the information for the four major environmental factors such as light, temperature,
    water and humidity. Those factors are known to be important in affecting plant
    growth (e.g., [5] -[7]). The hardware structure for proposed sensing module contains
    four major blocks as depicted in Fig. 2. Here, the chip GY302 is used for detecting
    the intensity of sunlight. The data from the chip GY302 will be collected via
    the protocol I2C. Moreover, the chip DHT22 is for sensing temperature and humidity.
    A designated protocol provided by the manufacture is employed for data collection
    via an one wired digital bus connection. Finally, a circuit is designed in this
    study to make the sensor Watermark 200SS as a transducer to collect the information
    of soil water tension. In addition, a chip CC2530-based WSN module is developed
    for collecting data from those four types of environmental sensor. A photo of
    those components discussed above is shown in Fig. 3 and the specifications of
    above sensors are shown in Table I. Fig. 1. The structure of proposed IoT-based
    monintoring platform. Show All Fig. 2. The hardware structure of the proposed
    sensing module. Show All Fig. 3. Photo of sensing module. Show All TABLE I. Specifications
    of environmental sensors C. Heterogeneous Network Gateway In the proposed design,
    the heterogeneous network gateway is consisted of a CC2530 WSN module, an industrial
    personal computer (IPC) and a 2G/3G/4G LTE router as depicted in Fig. 4. The main
    idea is to link two different networks WSN and 4G for constructing a heterogeneous
    network. Such a heterogeneous network gateway will act as a local center to collect
    all the environmental data from sensing modules and then transmit to a cloud database.
    The chip TI CC2530 is an 8051 MCU- based system-on-chip (SoC) structure developed
    for wireless communication with the protocol of IEEE 802.15.4. It can be designed
    to fit different IoT applications (e.g., [8] , [9]) due to the lower power consumption
    in data communication. A chip CC2530-based WSN module with modified function is
    developed to communicate with another chip CC2530-based WSN module developed in
    sensing module for transmitting environmental data to IPC. Then the LTE Router
    will help IPC to upload data to cloud. In addition, the IPC will play the role
    as a heterogeneous network transformer and provide the functions of data loss
    checking and time tag of data. The corresponding hardware of the proposed heterogeneous
    network gateway will be shown in the next section for the set-up of the experimental
    platform. Fig. 4. The hardware structure of a heterogeneous network gateway. Show
    All D. Cloud Database In order to build a cloud database, code MySQL is employed
    to achieve this task. An example page of the developed MySQL-based database is
    shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. An example of stored data in cloud database. Show All
    SECTION III. Experimental Results In this study, an IoT-based monitoring platform
    is constructed in an outdoor environment as shown in Fig. 6 to verify the feasibility
    of the proposed design. A photo of the developed sensing modules is shown on the
    left side of Fig. 6 and that for the developed heterogeneous network gateway is
    given in the right side of the figure. As depicted in the figure, the water tension
    sensor is buried in the soil of the target flowerpot and is connected with the
    signal conversion circuit through a wire. All of the environmental sensors including
    temperature, humidity sensor, illuminance sensor and the conversion circuit for
    water tension sensor are connected to the WSN module via the different designed
    interfaces. The chip CC2530-based WSN module builds the bridge between the sensing
    module and the heterogeneous network gateway as depicted in Fig. 6. As described
    above, the proposed gateway contains a WSN module, an IPC and a router. In the
    proposed design, the WSN module receives the collected data from the sensing module.
    The IPC sorts and identifies the data, while the router then uploads it to the
    cloud database through 4G network. Experimental testing had been carried out for
    several days to validate the performance of the proposed design. In the testing
    of experiment, the environmental data were collected for every ten seconds and
    the sensing module transmitted the collected data to the gateway for every five
    minutes. The measurement results of air temperature, relative humidity and net
    solar radiation from a three-day experiment were obtained as those marked by red
    curves and shown in Figs. 7-9. Note that, the broken parts of the red curves were
    caused by data loss due to the power outage of sensor module. Fig. 6. The outdoor
    environment for experimental study. Show All The blue curves shown in Figs. 7-9
    were obtained from the Hsinchu Weather Station, Central Weather Bureau (CWB),
    Taiwan, R.O.C. [10] for the verification of measured data from the proposed platform.
    It is observed from Figs. 7 and 8 that the values of red-curve and blue-curve
    are very close in the same time instant. However, the magnitudes for two curves
    in Fig. 9 are very different. Such a big change of scale might be caused by the
    difference in the averaged value of large area of the Hsinchu City and small local
    area of our tested environment. Despite of the differences in the value as depicted
    in Figs. 7-9, it is found that the trend of variation for the three environmental
    factors are very similar. The measured data for the soil water tension from the
    sensor Watermark 200SS are shown in Fig. 10. It is observed from the figure that
    the value of soil water tension increases due to the vaporization of water. Besides,
    there are two big and sudden drops of the soil water tension observed in Fig.
    10. Such a phenomenon was found to be caused by watering the plants. Fig. 7. The
    comparison of air temperature. Show All Fig. 8. The comparison of relative humidity.
    Show All Fig. 9. The comparison of net solar radiation. Show All Fig. 10. The
    measured soil water tension. Show All SECTION IV. Conclusions In this study, we
    have proposed an IoT-based platform to collect environmental data for agriculture.
    The experimental results from those sensors have demonstrated the feasibility
    of the proposed design. A comparison of the information from official website
    [10] and the sensing data has demonstrated the success of the proposed design.

    IEEE Conference Location: Delhi, India SECTION I. Introduction The utilization
    of sensors in the soil''s subsurface is the focus of Wireless Underground Sensor
    Networks (WUSNs), a specialized kind of wireless sensor network. In a variety
    of industries, including agricultural, environmental monitoring, and civil infrastructure,
    this technology has interesting applications. WUSNs can offer real-time monitoring
    of the soil''s temperature, moisture content, and other vital variables that are
    crucial for maximizing crop yield, spotting environmental dangers, and keeping
    an eye on a building''s structural integrity. Recent developments in wireless
    communication and sensor technologies have fueled the development of WUSNs. Due
    to the special properties of the underground medium, the deployment of wireless
    sensors in the subsurface region of the soil has long been difficult. Yet, recent
    advances in wireless communication technology have made it possible to reliably
    communicate across an unreliable channel, opening the door for the creation of
    WUSNs. While deploying WUSNs, several variables, including soil characteristics,
    signal propagation, power usage, and sensor design, must be carefully taken into
    account. High humidity, poor sight, and restricted access are just a few of the
    difficulties posed by the subsurface environment, which makes it challenging to
    develop and use sensors that can resist challenging underground circumstances.
    Moreover, the underground medium presents difficulties for wireless communication,
    including multipath propagation, signal attenuation, and interference. Researchers
    have created customized communication protocols and sensor types that are best
    suited for underground settings to overcome these issues. To enable dependable
    communication and sensing, these protocols and designs consider the special properties
    of the underground medium, such as the attenuation of electromagnetic waves and
    the occurrence of multiple reflections. The use of WUSNs has the potential to
    transform many industries, including civil infrastructure, environmental monitoring,
    and precision agriculture. WUSNs, for instance, can help farmers in precision
    agriculture maximize crop output by giving them real-time data on important characteristics
    like soil moisture. WUSNs can aid in the detection and response to natural disasters
    like earthquakes and landslides when it comes to environmental monitoring. WUSNs
    can offer real-time monitoring of the structural health of structures and other
    infrastructure in the civil sector. In summary, the creation of WUSNs signifies
    a major advance in wireless sensing and communication technologies. By supplying
    real-time data on crucial parameters necessary for maximizing crop yield, spotting
    environmental dangers, and monitoring structural integrity, the deployment of
    sensors in the subsurface region of the soil has the potential to revolutionize
    several fields. The effectiveness of WUSNs depends on overcoming the difficulties
    of underground communication and creating sensors that can perform consistently
    in challenging underground conditions. SECTION II. Related Work There A thorough
    analysis of the state-of-the-art for employing wireless underground sensor networks
    (WUSNs) for precision agriculture is provided by Aslam et al. [1] The authors
    go over a number of difficulties with designing WUSNs, including energy efficiency,
    routing, and deployment techniques. They also draw attention to the advantages
    of WUSNs, including better soil monitoring, decreased water use, and higher crop
    yields. Precision agriculture WUSN design and evaluation are proposed by Li et
    al. [2] The authors describe a brand-new architecture for WUSNs that consists
    of a hidden node in addition to a surface node. Additionally, they assess the
    effectiveness of their proposed WUSN system in terms of communication range, data
    transmission dependability, and network lifetime. An ant colony optimisation (ACO)-based
    routing strategy for WUSNs is proposed by Salim et al. [3] The authors employ
    ACO to determine the WUSN''s best route between the source and destination nodes
    while consuming the least amount of energy possible. The suggested protocol is
    compared to the current routing protocols, and simulation results demonstrate
    that it performs better in terms of energy efficiency than the other protocols.
    A survey of WUSN energy-efficient routing protocols is given by Javaid et al [4].
    The authors talk about the difficulties in designing WUSNs, including the scarcity
    of energy resources, the reliability of the communication lines, and the hostile
    underground environment. Additionally, they examine the many routing algorithms
    for WUSNs that have been proposed, including greedy routing, spatial routing,
    and cluster-based routing. The difficulties of WUSN research are discussed by
    Toh et al. [5] The deployment of sensor nodes, communication range, energy efficiency,
    and security are only a few of the technical and non-technical difficulties the
    authors list. Additionally, they go over the potential uses of WUSNs, including
    geohazard identification, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture.
    A survey on WUSNs is provided by Ananthapadmanabha et al. [6] covering a range
    of topics including network architecture, communication protocols, energy efficiency,
    and implementation tactics. The authors also go over a number of WUSN applications,
    including those in geohazard identification, environmental monitoring, and agriculture.
    The application of WUSNs for precision agriculture is reviewed by Matin et al.
    [8] The authors talk about how deploying WUSNs for precision agriculture can boost
    crop yields, use less water, and improve soil monitoring. Additionally, they discuss
    how to construct WUSNs for precision agriculture while taking factors like sensor
    node placement, communication range, and energy usage into account.pictures. SECTION
    III. Proposed Work The success of the network is dependent on the site selection
    process while deploying WUSNs. While choosing a location, several elements must
    be taken into account, including topography, soil characteristics, and the intended
    use. Temperature, electrical conductivity, and other soil characteristics all
    have an impact on how electromagnetic waves travel through the soil. The positioning
    of the sensors and the communication range are governed by the local topography.
    The kind and quantity of sensors needed for deployment depend on the intended
    application. Since the sensors must resist the challenging underground environment,
    sensor design is a crucial component of WUSN implementation. The sensors must
    be tough, resilient, and able to tolerate extremes in temperature, humidity, and
    soil erosion. The sensors should be made to use as little power as possible and
    to function effectively. The intended application of the sensor should be taken
    into account when designing it, and the type of sensor should be chosen based
    on the parameter being monitored. For instance, a capacitive or resistive sensor
    is needed to assess soil moisture. The placement of sensors in the soil''s subsurface
    is determined by the deployment method. While placing sensors, it''s important
    to take into account things like sensor spacing, deployment depth, and the number
    of sensors needed to provide sufficient coverage. To minimize signal interference
    and provide proper coverage, the distance between sensors should be carefully
    calculated. The communication range and the impact of the soil''s characteristics
    on signal attenuation are both influenced by the depth of deployment, which is
    crucial. The planned use and the size of the deployment area will determine how
    many sensors are needed. Wireless communication between sensors in the underground
    network and the outside world requires the use of communication protocols. Signal
    attenuation, interference, and multipath propagation are only a few of the particular
    difficulties that the underground media presents that must be handled by the communication
    protocols. To save energy, decrease interference, and assure dependable communication,
    the communication protocol needs to be adjusted. For WUSNs, several communication
    protocols have been suggested, including acoustic waves, inductive coupling, magnetic
    induction, and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). When deploying WUSN,
    power management is crucial since the sensors must perform effectively to have
    the longest possible lifespan. By maximizing the sensor''s sleep and active hours,
    lowering the sampling rate, and only transmitting data when necessary, power management
    involves reducing power usage. Various methods, including duty cycling, adaptive
    sleep scheduling, and data aggregation, have been suggested for power management.
    The stages of calibration and validation are crucial for ensuring the precision
    of the sensor readings. Via comparison to a reference standard, calibration entails
    determining the accuracy of the sensor''s measurement. During validation, the
    measurement accuracy of the sensor is examined in a practical setting. To guarantee
    the dependability and accuracy of the WUSN deployment, calibration and validation
    are essential. In conclusion, careful planning, designing, and implementation
    of sensors and communication protocols that can work in the subsurface region
    of the soil are required for the deployment of WUSNs. Site selection, sensor design,
    deployment strategy, communication protocols, power management, calibration, and
    validation are some of the major steps in the approach to implementing WUSNs.
    The difficulties of communicating through the underground medium must be overcome,
    and sensors that can function dependably in challenging underground conditions
    must be developed. Fig. 1. Block Diagram of the Transmitter. Show All Fig. 2.

    the PIC16F788A has an integrated 10-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with
    up to 12 channels that can measure analogue signals like pressure, light, and
    temperature. It also has a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) module that may produce
    analogue output signals for adjusting LED brightness or motor speeds. Operating
    in low power modes is one of the PIC16F788A''s distinguishing characteristics.
    The microcontroller can save power while it is not in use thanks to three different
    sleep modes. These sleep modes include Idle mode, in which the CPU is turned off
    but peripherals continue to function, Sleep mode, in which the CPU and peripherals
    are both turned off, and Deep Sleep mode, in which the microcontroller is completely
    turned off save for the Watchdog Timer, which can be used to wake it up after
    a predetermined amount of time. A few cutting-edge peripherals are also included
    in the PIC16F788A, including as a Capture/Compare/PWM (CCP) module that may be
    used to capture external signals or generate PWM signals and a Timer/Counter module
    that can be used to measure time or produce periodic interrupts. The Voltage Reference
    (VREF) module, which offers a consistent voltage reference for the ADC and other
    peripherals, is also included. B. UART The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
    (UART) is a well-liked serial communication interface that is frequently used
    in embedded systems, particularly in applications that use microcontrollers. It
    permits data to be sent and received between two devices via a single data connection.
    Since UART is a straightforward and dependable communication protocol, it can
    be used for a variety of tasks, such as wireless communication, sensor communication,
    and device interface. Asynchronous serial communication, such as UART, involves
    the transmission of data in a stream of bits without the use of a set timing or
    clock signal. Instead, a start bit, one or more data bits, a parity bit that is
    optional, and one or more stop bits frame each data byte. A start bit indicates
    the start of a data byte, while a stop bit or bits indicate the end of the byte.
    The optional parity bit can be used to identify transmission faults in data. The
    transmit line (TX) and receive line (RX) are the two data lines that are generally
    used in UART communication. While the RX line receives data from the sending device,
    the TX line delivers data from the transmitting device to the receiving device.
    To correctly communicate, both devices must have the same baud rate, which controls
    how quickly data is transmitted. The UART module is typically built into the microcontroller
    chip itself in systems using microcontrollers. The UART module of the microcontroller
    offers an easy and effective method of interacting with external devices, including
    sensors, displays, and other microcontrollers. The UART pins on the microcontroller
    must be connected to the equivalent TX and RX pins on the external device in order
    to use the UART module. The UART protocol is then used by the microcontroller
    to deliver or receive data. The micro controller''s firmware must first setup
    the UART module by setting the necessary registers before the UART module can
    be used in a microelectronic-based system. Once configured, the micro controller
    may send and receive data using the UART module. Normally, data is sent one byte
    at a time, with the micro controller first putting the byte to be communicated
    to the data register and then holding off on sending the next byte until the previous
    one has finished. Similar to this, data reception involves the micro-controller
    reading data from the data register when it becomes available. UART has a set
    of control lines in addition to the transmission protocol, which makes communication
    more effective. The Request To Send (RTS) and Clear To Send (CTS) signals are
    part of these control lines. The transmitting device uses the RTS signal to indicate
    that it is ready to send data, and the receiving device uses the CTS signal to
    indicate that it is prepared to receive data. These control lines make sure that
    the transmitting and receiving devices are synchronized before data transfer starts,
    which helps to prevent data loss. microcontrollers and other devices support UART
    since it is a straightforward and frequently communication mechanism. In conclusion,
    UART is a commonly used serial communication protocol that transmits data between
    two devices in a straightforward manner. UART incorporates control lines like
    RTS and CTS to increase communication efficiency and sends data over a single
    cable using a straightforward timing-based technique. When building UART communication,
    baud rate is a crucial factor to consider because it establishes the maximum quantity
    of data that can be communicated in a specific amount of time. Common uses for
    UART include serial communication between microcontrollers, communication with
    sensors and other peripheral devices, and connection between computers and other
    devices. C. WUSN Due to its potential for a broad range of applications in industries
    like agriculture, geology, and military surveillance, Wireless Underground Sensor
    Networks (WUSNs) are developing into a significant area of research. The way in
    which sensor nodes communicate with one another is an important component of a
    WUSN. The WUSN transmitter and receiver are crucial parts of this system that
    enable dependable and effective network connection. The WUSN transmitter is in
    charge of transforming the sensor node''s data into a format that can be wirelessly
    sent to other nodes in the network through the soil. This involves multiple phases,
    such as channel coding, modulation, and signal processing. Signal processing is
    the initial phase, and it entails transforming the analogue data gathered by the
    sensor into a digital signal that the transmitter can process. This procedure
    often entails high-speed sampling of the analogue signal, quantization of the
    samples, and the use of signal-conditioning methods including filtering and amplification.
    Modulation, which comes after that, entails placing the digital data on a carrier
    signal that can be sent through the ground. Amplitude-shift keying (ASK), frequency-shift
    keying (FSK), and phase-shift keying (PSK) are just a few of the modulation techniques
    that can be utilized in WUSNs. Depending on elements like the gearbox range, power
    consumption, and noise resistance, each design offers benefits and drawbacks.
    In order to guarantee reliable transmission in the face of noise and interference,
    the data is modulated and then encoded using channel coding methods. In WUSNs,
    a variety of channel coding techniques, including error-correcting codes like
    Reed-Solomon and convolution codes as well as error-detecting codes like cyclic
    redundancy check (CRC) codes, can be used. These methods can deliver different
    levels of benefit. These techniques can provide varying degrees of error protection,
    depending on the design parameters chosen. A mechanism called as inductive coupling
    is used to transport the data to other nodes in the network after it has been
    processed, modulated, and encoded. Since soil is a good conductor of electricity,
    inductive coupling involves using a magnetic field to transmit the signal through
    it. The transmitter creates a magnetic field that causes a current to flow through
    the soil, and the network''s other nodes can detect this magnetic field. In wireless
    underground sensor networks (WUSNs), gas sensors are frequently utilised for environmental
    and soil monitoring. These sensors are capable of detecting a wide range of gases,
    including ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen dioxide, and others that
    are emitted from the soil as a result of plant respiration, microbial activity,
    and other natural processes. Gas sensors can be used to track the soil conditions
    along the communication line when it comes to the route of soil communication
    utilising WUSNs. For instance, if the communication line travels through an area
    with high levels of carbon dioxide or methane, this could be a sign of microbial
    activity or subsurface organic matter decomposition, both of which can have an
    impact on the soil''s quality and crop yields. Wireless underground sensor networks
    (WUSNs) for soil communication may not immediately relate to fire sensors. In
    the context of WUSNs for soil monitoring, fire or smoke may not be a major problem;
    yet, fire sensors are often utilised to detect their existence. However, under
    some circumstances, such as during forest fires or controlled burns, fire may
    still pose a risk to WUSN nodes and infrastructure. In these situations, fire
    sensors can be used to find the fire and notify the network to take the necessary
    action, such turning off or rerouting the communication line. The MQ-6 gas sensor
    is a type of sensor that is designed to detect the presence of gas in the surrounding
    environment. It can detect several types of gases, including LPG, butane, propane,
    methane, and alcohol. However, the MQ-6 gas sensor is not a motion sensor, and
    it cannot detect motion. It works by detecting changes in the concentration of
    gas in the surrounding air. The sensor has a sensitive layer made of tin dioxide,
    which reacts with the gas molecules and changes its resistance. The change in
    resistance is then measured and converted into an electrical signal, which can
    be used to trigger an alarm or control a system. To detect motion, you would need
    to use a different type of sensor, such as a motion sensor based on infrared or
    ultrasound technology. These sensors work by emitting a signal and measuring the
    reflections or changes in the signal caused by the movement of objects in their
    detection range SECTION IV. Performance Analysis Wireless underground sensor networks
    (WUSNs) have a wide range of applications, including environmental and agricultural
    monitoring, underground mining, oil wells, and nuclear power facilities. However,
    the success of the network depends on careful planning, designing, and implementation.
    Site selection is crucial in deploying WUSNs. The topography, soil characteristics,
    and intended use must be considered to ensure the proper functioning of the sensors.
    The positioning of the sensors and communication range is governed by the local
    topography, and the kind and quantity of sensors needed for deployment depend
    on the intended application. Sensor design is also an important component of WUSN
    implementation. The sensors must be tough, resilient, and able to tolerate extremes
    in temperature, humidity, and soil erosion. The intended application of the sensor
    should be considered when designing it, and the type of sensor should be chosen
    based on the parameter being monitored. The placement of sensors in the subsurface
    is determined by the deployment method. The distance between sensors should be
    calculated to minimize signal interference and provide proper coverage. The communication
    range and the impact of the soil''s characteristics on signal attenuation are
    both influenced by the depth of deployment. The communication protocol needs to
    be adjusted to save energy, decrease interference, and assure dependable communication.
    Power management involves reducing power usage by maximizing the sensor''s sleep
    and active hours, lowering the sampling rate, and only transmitting data when
    necessary. Calibration and validation are essential for ensuring the precision
    of the sensor readings. Calibration entails determining the accuracy of the sensor''s
    measurement through comparison to a reference standard. During validation, the
    measurement accuracy of the sensor is examined in a practical setting. Fig. 3.

    finds the shortest path for the communication. Fig. 6. Graph of Packet Delay.
    Show All The graph of the packet delay compared with the normal communication
    and soil communication which is faster and safer than the wired communication.
    In conclusion, the success of WUSNs depends on careful planning, designing, and
    implementation. Site selection, sensor design, deployment strategy, communication
    protocols, power management, calibration, and validation are crucial steps in
    the approach to implementing WUSNs. Overcoming the difficulties of communicating
    through the underground medium and developing sensors that can function dependably
    in challenging underground conditions are ongoing challenges that require continued
    research and innovation. SECTION IV. Conclusion In conclusion, wireless underground
    sensor networks (WUSNs) offer a promising solution for monitoring the subsurface
    environment, providing a wealth of benefits for various applications. However,
    deploying WUSNs presents numerous challenges, including selecting a suitable site,
    designing robust sensors, developing communication protocols, implementing effective
    power management strategies, and conducting calibration and validation processes.
    Overcoming these challenges requires careful planning, technical expertise, and
    collaboration across multiple disciplines. Site selection is a crucial step in
    deploying WUSNs, as it directly affects the performance and effectiveness of the
    network. Factors such as soil characteristics, topography, and intended use must
    be considered when selecting a site. Sensors must be designed to withstand the
    harsh underground environment and accurately measure the parameter being monitored.
    The deployment strategy must consider factors such as sensor spacing, deployment
    depth, and the number of sensors needed to provide sufficient coverage. Communication
    protocols must be developed to ensure reliable communication between the sensors
    and the outside world, taking into account the challenges of communicating through
    the underground medium. Power management strategies must be implemented to prolong
    the lifespan of the sensors and ensure their reliable operation. Calibration and
    validation processes must be conducted to ensure the accuracy and precision of
    the sensor readings. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This

    India SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture serves as the foundation of India’s
    economy, with nearly 70% of the country’s population relying on it for their livelihood
    [1]. However, several environmental factors can negatively impact crop yields,
    posing a significant concern as agriculture is one of the country’s largest occupations.
    In fact, it contributes approximately 17.5% to the GDP and employs 41.9% of the
    workforce, as per a 2021 survey [2]. Moreover, India’s agricultural commodity
    exports exceed $ 30.5 billion, making it the world’s seventh-largest exporter
    [3]. Unfortunately, Indian agriculture has been in a steady decline due to several
    factors, leading to increased demand but reduced supply. Therefore, it is crucial
    to prevent a continuous decline in crop production to avoid significant losses
    to both the food sector and the Indian economy [4]. At the start of the sowing
    season, farmers have to assess the viability of their soil for crop growth. This
    involves calculating the Soil Quality Index (SQI) of the soil, which requires
    taking a soil sample and sending it to a laboratory for analysis. However, this
    process is time-consuming and expensive, making it impractical for farmers who
    are working within a tight budget and schedule. This is especially challenging
    given the high demand for agricultural commodities as discussed in the previous
    section. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been increasingly adopted in agriculture
    for real-time monitoring and control of environmental factors. Soil quality plays
    a crucial role in agriculture as it directly impacts crop yield and quality. Therefore,
    it is essential for farmers to have precise and timely information about the soil
    quality to make decisions regarding crop management. Digi Farming Assistant is
    a proposed smart farming system that aims to utilize WSN for real-time soil quality
    analysis. The system comprises sensor nodes placed throughout the farm to collect
    data on various soil parameters such as temperature, humidity, Nitrogen-PotassiumPhosphorus
    (NPK) and several others. The system’s primary goal is to inform farmers about
    soil quality, leading to higher crop yield and quality. With real-time soil quality
    information, farmers can make informed decisions on fertilization, irrigation,
    and other crop management practices. SECTION II. Related Work Extensive research
    has been conducted in the field of agriculture, especially in soil quality analysis.
    Some of these studies are mentioned in this section. The paper [5] contributes
    to the field by providing a data-driven solution that helps protect the environment,
    optimize water resource use, and increase productivity while lowering operating
    costs. The integration of IoT and deep learning techniques has significant potential
    to improve agricultural practices, addressing challenges posed by climate change
    and soil degradation. The article details the development of this smart irrigation
    and fertilization system using soil sensors to collect data, which is then processed
    and analyzed using deep learning models, and is optimized for running on an embedded
    device. The major drawback of such a system would be the high-power consumption
    This paper [6] describes real-time soil monitoring for the agriculture farmlands
    to provide optimal and integrated data collections. Agriculture depends on many
    parameters such as inter and intra variability of plants to give better yields
    such as soil parameters, climatic parameters and so on. Here the system is designed
    to collect the data set for major parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil
    pH, soil moisture, light intensity and carbon-dioxide of the fields. The system
    consists of an ATmega328 microcontroller, DHT11 Sensor, soil hygrometer, light
    intensity sensor, soil pH sensor, MQ-135 sensor and DC motor. Data sets collected
    were used for the analysis of selection of crops and their vulnerabilities for
    regulating the irrigation parameters which will be of help in the agricultural
    practices, it will make easy way for farmers to take decision on planting a crops,
    watering and fertilizing them by avoiding the interference of hydrogeologists
    and soil scientists by giving precaution [6]. In this paper [7], a novel methodology
    for smart farming by linking a smart sensing system and smart irrigator system
    through wireless communication technology has been proposed. The system focuses
    on the measurement of physical parameters such as soil moisture content, nutrient
    content, and pH of the soil that plays a vital role in farming activities. Based
    on the essential physical and chemical parameters of the soil measured, the required
    quantity of green manure, compost, and water is splashed on the crops using a
    smart irrigator, which is mounted on a movable overhead crane system. The detailed
    modeling and control strategies of a smart irrigator and smart farming system
    are demonstrated in this paper. They are developing a user-friendly smart farming
    system which will liberate agricultural productive forces greatly, change the
    mode of production, and realize a qualitative leap in agricultural activity. The
    paper [8] proposes the agriculture sector plays a crucial role in India’s economy,
    supporting a large portion of the population. With the increasing demand for food,
    precision agriculture has gained significance. Monitoring soil properties is essential
    for enhancing crop growth and yield. To address this, a combination of deep learning,
    an AI technique, and IoT features are proposed for monitoring soil characteristics
    such as pH level, temperature, moisture content, organic matter, carbon level,
    and NPK level. This integrated approach helps evaluate soil fertility and recommends
    suitable crops along with the required nutrients for improved yields. The system
    is designed to be cost-efficient, easily accessible, and user-friendly for farmers,
    providing timely and accurate reports. With minimal delays, the proposed system
    offers an efficient solution for soil testing and crop prediction practices. The
    paper, ‘Smog Detection and Pollution Alert System Using Wireless Sensor Network’
    [9] proposes a wireless sensor network-based system using CM5000 sensor node that
    detects pollutants and alerts individuals about the level of pollution in the
    environment. It uses low-cost sensors to monitor air pollution levels and send
    alerts to authorities if pollution levels exceed certain thresholds [9]. In \"Soil
    Fertility Management for Sustainable Crop Production: A Review\" [10] Ndakidemi
    and Laing discuss the general values for NPK requirements in soils. The paper
    notes that optimal soil fertility for crops typically requires a balance of NPK,
    with nitrogen (N) being the most limiting nutrient in many soils. The general
    range for NPK requirements in soil is as follows: Nitrogen (N): 100-300 kg/ha,
    Phosphorus (P): 10-30 kg/ha, Potassium (K): 50-150 kg/ha. Fig.1 shows the block
    diagram of the proposed system. The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) system consists
    of three motes, two of which are configured to be in a local Personal Area Network
    (PAN) for data acquisition from various sensors. The sensors used in the system
    include SHT11 (Temperature and Humidity), light, mq135 (air quality), and JXBS-3001
    NPK (soil nutrient level) sensors. The data collected by the sensors is transmitted
    to the Gateway mote, which acts as an interface between the local sensor nodes
    and the cloud. This system is highly beneficial for agriculture as it allows farmers
    to remotely monitor critical parameters such as temperature, humidity, and soil
    nutrient levels, enabling them to make informed decisions for maximizing crop
    yield. SECTION III. Block Diagram Fig. 1. Block Diagram of Proposed system Show
    All SECTION IV. Details of the System The hardware components used for designing
    the prototype described in this paper are: A. CM5000 Mote The CM5000 mote is a
    wireless sensor node that complies with IEEE 802.15.4 standards, and is based
    on the \"TelosB\" platform design by UC Berkeley. The Mote is designed for wireless
    sensing and data acquisition applications, such as environmental monitoring, precision
    agriculture, and structural health monitoring. It is equipped with temperature,
    humidity, and light sensors, as well as a TI MSP430 processor, CC2420 RF, and
    USB interface [11]. B. SHT11 Sensor The CM5000 wireless sensor node utilizes the
    widely recognized Sensirion® SHT11 sensor, which is designed for efficient air
    temperature and humidity measurements with low power consumption [12]. The sensor
    is operated by the mote through a two-wire interface [13]. C. Light Sensor - Hamamatsu
    S1087/ S1087-01 The CM5000 provides two light sensors, the Hamamatsu® S1087 for
    visible range measurements and the S1087-01 for visible to infrared range [14].
    D. MQ-135 Sensor The MQ135 sensor is a gas sensor that is commonly used to measure
    the air quality and detect a wide range of gasses, including ammonia, sulfur dioxide,
    and nitrogen oxides [15]. It is often used in air quality control systems in homes,
    buildings, and factories [16]. E. JXCT NPK Sensor The JXCT NPK sensor is a type
    of smart sensor that is used in precision agriculture to determine the levels
    of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil [17]. It uses a unique three-electrode
    design to measure the concentration of ions in the soil and provides accurate
    readings within a short amount of time. The sensor is designed to work with a
    variety of crops, including corn, wheat, and rice, and can be used to optimize
    fertilizer application, increase crop yield, and reduce costs [18]. SECTION V.
    Implementation A. Software Implementation The CM5000 mote is a wireless sensor
    node used in WSNs. Various software options are available for programming and
    configuring CM5000 motes, including open-source operating systems such as TinyOS,
    Contiki, and RIOT OS, as well as proprietary software packages such as MATLAB.
    Python and Arduino are also popular choices [19]. Contiki OS is an open-source
    operating system for wireless sensor networks that supports the CM5000 mote [20].
    It is highly efficient, lightweight, and scalable, making it well-suited for resource-constrained
    environments. It has a large developer community and includes energy management
    tools to extend battery life. Contiki OS supports a range of hardware platforms
    and communication protocols, making it our choice for this project. Fig. 2. Flowchart

    setting up a wireless sensor network across an agricultural field. The network

    it to a Gateway node which is also a CM5000 mote that is connected to the internet.
    The Gateway Mote is responsible for transmitting the data to a registered web
    domain, where it can be accessed by the user on a webpage in real-time. There
    is no need for any delay or waiting period, as the data can be viewed instantly
    upon transmission. One of the nodes collects data from internal sensors- SHT11
    and S1087, while the second node gathers information from external sensors- MQ135
    and JXCT NPK Sensors. As seen in Fig. 6, the sensor data is transmitted from the
    end devices to the gateway mote. A local PAN network is created between these
    three motes to facilitate the transmission and reception of the required data.
    This PAN network relies on the UDP protocol, a communication protocol that facilitates
    the exchange of information between devices on a network. Fig.7 shows the terminal
    output displaying the sent packet from one of the motes. To gauge the effectiveness
    of the network, a range testing procedure was conducted. The distance was varied
    from 1m to 150m in outdoor LOS conditions. Fig. 6. Hardware Setup Show All Fig.

    after a range of 150m. A total of 10 packets were sent from the client side and

    and Client SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Scope In conclusion, the development
    and implementation of this Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) system for soil quality
    analysis has the potential to revolutionize the field of precision agriculture.
    Through the use of low-cost sensors and wireless communication technologies, farmers
    can now obtain real-time information on temperature, humidity, light, CO2 and
    NPK values, enabling them to make informed decisions about crop management practices.
    The system also provides a platform for remote monitoring and data analysis, allowing
    farmers to optimize crop yields and reduce resource wastage. With continued advancements
    in technology and data analytics, WSN systems have the potential to transform
    agriculture into a more sustainable and efficient industry. The WSN systems in
    today’s world are far more advanced than before but they still have huge scope
    for improvement and future development. One such future development which can
    be implemented onto the existing WSN system is the use of Machine learning and
    artificial intelligence to design a Crop and pesticide suggestion system based
    on the acquired values. Also automation systems can be implemented to reduce the
    physical efforts of farmers, making the entire process of farming easier and efficient
    for the farmer. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This The

    Agriculture is a distinct sector of a country’s economy. In recent years, new
    patterns have evolved in the agricultural industry. In conjunction with sensor
    scaling down and precision agriculture, the field of remote sensor networks, such
    as the wireless sensor network (WSN), was developed. Its major purpose is to make
    horticultural operations simpler to identify, assess, and manage. This paper uses
    the proposed DCNN to predict soil moisture and plan irrigation for precision agriculture
    farmers to reduce water consumption used for cultivation and increase production
    yield by comparing water content during various stages of plant growth and integrating
    IoT applications into agriculture. It also optimizes the water level for future
    irrigation decisions to maintain crop growth and water stability. The data must
    be served and stored in the form of a grid view, according to Apriori and GRU
    (gated recurrent unit). Using numerous sensor and parameter modelling methodologies,
    this system assists in the prediction of irrigation planning based on irrigation
    needs. The predicted parameters include soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
    This observed experimental data supports smart irrigation in crop production with
    a high yield and little water use. DCNN has a 98.5% experimental result accuracy
    rate and the MSE value is predicted in DCNN 99.25% of the time. Similar content

    Data in Smart Farming Chapter © 2020 Introduction By installing IoT devices in
    the field, the agricultural industry is focused on IoT technology to get benefits
    rapidly and with low investment, making farming innovative and high-tech. Sensors,
    which are part of the overall environmental monitoring and management system,
    are essential to WSNs. Sensors in the irrigation fields collect data and store
    it for later use in the operation. Different types of sensors are used in smart
    sensor irrigation systems such as light, temperature, rain, level, soil moisture,
    and flow. Big data analysis (BDA) is a term used to describe analytical workloads
    that include complex analyses and many data types and a mix of data volume, velocity,
    and range. Agriculture necessitates crop production prediction models, economic
    models, pest and crop disease prediction models, and other types of data analysis.
    In agriculture, big data analytics may be used to analyze large amounts of structured
    and unstructured data to create quicker and more reliable results that can assist
    farmers in making better choices as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Graphical abstract

    estimate weather averages and other climatic features from a few months to a few
    years in the future. Forecasters are increasingly turning to extensive Earth’s
    climate system models that generate such forecasts. Forecasts aid farmers in risk
    management since production choices are sometimes made before prices are known.
    Consumers profit from the availability of high-quality, low-cost food. It also
    helps to guarantee that markets work fairly by providing information on predicted
    rates. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of connected objects – “things”
    – embedded with sensors, computers, and other capabilities that connect to and
    share data with other devices and systems over the internet (Anbarasan et al.,
    2019; Hsu et al., 2018). Further, smart irrigation is a novel technique for watering
    that is enabled through networked sensors, devices, and remote controls. Farmers
    and their staff gain real-time visibility into the irrigation process and the
    ability to automate their operations. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) is a type of
    recurrent neural network that uses connections between nodes to accomplish machine
    learning tasks like memory and grouping, such as voice recognition. The main contributor
    of the paper is as follows: this study uses the suggested DCNN to forecast soil
    moisture and plan irrigation for precision agriculture producers to minimize water
    consumption utilized for cultivation and boost crop yield by analyzing water content
    throughout various phases of plant growth and integrating IoT applications into
    agriculture. According to Apriori and GRU, data must be delivered and stored in
    the form of a grid display (gated recurrent unit). This system aids in the prediction
    of irrigation planning based on irrigation demands by utilizing different sensor
    and parameter modelling approaches. The paper is discussed as follows: the “Introduction”
    section discusses the introduction; the “Literature survey” section discusses
    the literature survey; the problem statement and objective of the proposed method
    are discussed in the “Problem statements” and “Objective” sections, respectively;
    the “System model” section describes the system model; the “Result and discussion”
    section discusses the result and discussion; finally, the “Conclusion” section
    describes the conclusion of the work. Literature survey A multiple WSN data collection
    technique for edge computation was used to increase valid data volume while reducing
    data collection time (Li et al., 2020a). WSN architecture is established first
    by merging edge computing and data gathering models into a WSN for many jobs and
    sensors. WSN uses the sensor network architecture. This sort of architecture may
    be seen in a range of places, including hospitals, schools, highways, and buildings,
    and it is used for a variety of purposes, including security, disaster management,
    and crisis management. A data administration system with an edge computing differential
    data management system. It protects sensor cloud privacy and addresses sensor
    cloud storage concerns (Wang et al., 2020). In terms of time, data quality, and
    energy usage, the findings suggest that the proposal outperforms traditional data
    gathering techniques. Agriculture underwent a big data study investigation, especially
    from a technical standpoint. The 34 research papers analyzing the issue, the solution
    that may be implemented, the tools/methods employed, and the data used were discovered
    and examined (Kamilaris et al., 2017; Khan et al., 2018). In light of big data
    and the necessity to clean up multi-dimensional function data, mobile edge nodes
    are being utilized to clean data. The training data for the cleaning model is
    obtained using the ABOD algorithm (Sharma et al., 2018). Angle-based outlier detection
    (ABOD) is a relatively new approach for detecting outliers in large datasets.
    ABOD evaluates the broadness of a point’s angle spectrum as an outlier factor,
    rather than looking at neighbourhoods as proximity-based ideas. In this study,
    modified Z-SEPs for varied agricultural contexts were used. Area 0 divides the
    field into 2 areas such as heading Area 1 and direction Area 2 (Singh et al.,
    2019). Data is sent to BS using the clustering process. The proposed simulated
    data demonstrate that utilizing modified Z-SEP enhances node stability by around
    23% in agricultural usage when compared to LEACH and 27% when compared to SEP
    (Shah et al., 2016). For an Agro Advisory Program, a Big Data research framework
    is presented. For the creation of big data applications, an analytical framework
    is also being created and deployed. The Big Data Analytical Tool is a highly valuable
    systematic tool that helps to understate data and understand data from many viewpoints
    (Kumar & Nagar, 2017; White et al., 2018). This framework offers and uses an analytical
    tool to design applications for big data (Wachowiak et al., 2017). A formal way
    for analyzing massive data, improving judgments, and increasing animal precision
    is the predictive analytical approach. Predictive analytics is a type of advanced
    data analytics that involves evaluating historical data to make predictions about
    future outcomes. This method uses statistical modelling, data mining, and machine
    learning tools and techniques to evaluate previously collected data and provide
    accurate and actionable insights. The predictive analysis technique completes
    the final model evaluation by providing a predictive accuracy assessment, which
    includes an estimated chance that events and non-events described in the target
    variable would be observed (Harish Kumar et al., 2017). As a new topic in agriculture,
    the paper examines the continuous nature of a variety of difficulties, including
    data security, data quality, availability, initial investment, infrastructure,
    and associated knowledge (Sarker et al., 2019; Surendran et al., 2019). Additional
    hardware and software information is used to convey data from smartphones. The
    farmer may operate the mobile phones at any time and from any location. It is
    more relevant to agriculture-dependent nations, such as India (Saxena & Dutta,
    2020). The cloud sensor paradigm for data collecting has been studied and published
    in recent research endeavors. Then, we classified and categorized material using
    taxonomy (Li et al., 2020b; Ang & KahPhooiSeng, 2021). To get a better grasp of
    the most current applications of Big Data in smart agriculture, social and economic
    challenges must be addressed. This article covers data generating techniques,
    technology accessibility (Bhat & Huang, 2021), device accessibility, software
    tool accessibility, data analysis approaches, and appropriate big data applications
    in precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a management technique that
    collects, organizes, and evaluates temporal, geographical, and interpersonal data
    before combining it with other data to enable management decisions based on estimated
    variability for improved resource utilization economy, production, dependability,
    competitiveness, and long-term growth of agricultural production. Apart from that,
    there are a few drawbacks to using big data technology extensively in agriculture
    (White et al., 2020; Rao & Yuan, 2021). This study also uses comparison trials
    to illustrate the algorithm’s dependability in terms of accuracy and time efficiency
    (Campos-Guillén et al., 2020). The collecting and analysis of big data, the creation
    of new models, and the practical and uncomplicated deployment of these models
    are all part of a new agricultural revolution. It will provide agronomical research
    with a new viewpoint (Velmurugan et al., 2021). For each action detailed in the
    paddy rice production and post-production phases, an approach was created that
    maps the activities stated in rice smart farming, the data utilized in data modelling,
    and the machine learning techniques used per activity. The post-production step
    is necessary for the items to be delivered from the manufacturer to the customer.
    Producers, resellers, wholesale, rural retailers, and suppliers, as well as delivery,
    flow on marketing functions, are all engaged in product distribution (Alfred et
    al., 2021). According to the mapping approach, integrating these three technologies
    efficiently and effectively is crucial for changing conventional rice-growing
    techniques into a new level of intelligence in rice precision agriculture (Cravero
    & Sepúlveda, 2021). Precision agriculture makes use of data from a number of sources
    to improve agricultural yields and reduce the cost of crop management activities
    such as fertilizer inputs, irrigation, and soil improvement. Precision agriculture
    has reduced food insecurity by allowing farmers to grow more agricultural food
    crops with less input than in the past. These technologies increase transparency
    in farming by improving record-keeping, food traceability, and documentation.
    It also helps in planning. The use of Big Data and Machine Learning in agriculture,
    as well as the detection of hurdles, adjustments, and system architecture design.
    This review may be of interest to computer or data scientists, as well as electrical
    or software engineers. The results show that manipulating large volumes of data
    is no longer a problem because of cloud technology (Fathi et al., 2021; Su & Wang,
    2021). Proposed to utilize big data in agriculture, using the egg price of a city’s
    wholesale market as the study object, to investigate the influencing causes and
    price variations of egg price by mining and analyzing relevant agricultural big
    data, and then displaying the big data, in order to give a relevant scientific
    basis for creative e-commerce economic management. The whole generation chain
    is covered, including day-to-day agricultural activities (Wang et al., 2006).
    Farmers commonly deal with information overload, which necessitates the creation
    of a new data source (Sorensen et al., 2010). Temperature, soil moisture, and
    humidity are monitored by the sensors, and the data is communicated to farmers
    through third parties such as meteorological stations (Wang et al., 2007). Farmers
    were able to readily integrate information and make clear decisions about how
    to deliver certain items at the moment, so boosting their pay and meeting legislative
    requirements (Lan, 2012; Razi & Nath, 2019). Furthermore, the farmer’s internal
    arrangement and similar thinking data suggest that knowledge is developed to learn
    and establish a real intellectual framework (McCown et al., 2012). In a wireless
    sensor network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) setup employing ZigBee (Gutierrez et
    al., 2013), several sensor nodes in a given area are employed. Temporary climate
    fluctuations and the elements in issue, such as evapotranspiration, affect the
    incidence of rains (Rawal, 2017). As a consequence, assessing climatic variables
    connected to agricultural productivity is crucial in avoiding a global water calamity
    and food shortages. The most visible agricultural initiative is to increase crop
    water productivity (CWP) (Lan, 2012), which allows farmers to produce more food
    with less water. Problem statements As a result, the apparent diversity in the
    agricultural environment may be controlled by customizing inputs to the specific
    regions where they are needed. As a result, this study used and enhanced the precision
    agriculture model to track crop growth while accounting for variables such as
    air temperature, soil moisture, and soil type in the field. Precision agriculture
    increases agricultural income and resource utilization by reducing the use of
    traditional management practices. Precision farming, which is focused on production
    yield and soil types, has an impact on crop growth. Precision agriculture can
    revitalize India’s agricultural economy. The presentation of erroneous estimations
    on water-based soil conditions is one of the limiting factors that impact crop
    output. Recommendations for various irrigation methods are based on socioeconomic
    characteristics. Some of the elements that determine irrigation farmers’ ability
    to use agricultural information and knowledge include socioeconomic, social, psychological,
    and geographical aspects. Irrigation farmers’ actions are influenced not only
    just by farm-related and management-related issues, but also by external institutions
    and socioeconomic factors. Objective The goal of the proposed research is to find
    limiting variables that impact agricultural productivity. The major goal is to
    provide practical advice to farmers that use IoT in precision agriculture to increase
    crop output by predicting different soil conditions. Soil moisture is influenced
    by a variety of factors, including precipitation, plant water consumption intensity,
    and air temperature. Because appropriate soil moisture is critical for yields,
    plants will not grow and develop if the soil moisture is insufficient. For the
    crops, high doses of radiation may be necessary. Excessive temperatures may have
    an unfavorable influence on the yield as the stages develop. During these times,
    farmers employ a ventilation system to keep the temperature in check. If the humidity
    is excessive, the illness will worsen. Soil water influences productivity as well.
    These components were regarded as significant data information in this research
    as a consequence of the prior reasoning concerning the impact of temperature,
    humidity, and water level on cultivation. The main purpose is to provide accurate
    temperature, humidity, and water data. Predicts soil moisture and adjusts irrigation
    as appropriate. Improving irrigation practices in precision agriculture will help
    to ease water constraints. Deliver timely, accurate, trustworthy, and valuable
    information to farmers to increase their productivity. System model The soil,
    which is recognized as a fundamental component in farming, is the key to its success.
    Precision agriculture detects and monitors soil moisture in real-time. To monitor
    soil conditions, modern agricultural monitoring technologies such as gamma-radiometric
    soil sensors, a soil moisture sensor, and electrical conductivity sensors are
    available. Gamma radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation with a short
    wavelength and a high energy level. It can penetrate solid things more deeply
    than light and has a spectrum of several hundred meters in the air. It refers
    to the detection of natural sources of gamma radiation released from the earth.
    Gamma radiometric measurements also distinguished doleritic, lateritic, and granitic
    soil parent materials efficiently. The multiple sensors used to monitor weather
    conditions count the crop’s physiological status. A farmer should estimate the
    amount of water needed for cultivation ahead of time. Water availability is influenced
    by climate, season, soil type, crop variety, and growth stage. The crop loses
    water via transpiration and evaporation in general during cultivation. Environmental
    factors such as terrain, climate, soil properties, and soil water all have an
    impact on crop yield. Because of the interplay of these four factors, certain
    crops can only be grown in specific locations. The system model flow graph is
    shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Proposed work flowchart Full size image As demonstrated
    in the flow graph, the S-Linear Kernel Analysis Algorithm (S_LKA) is employed
    to anticipate soil moisture. The K SLinear Kernel Analysis Algorithm (K_SLR) for
    Prediction of Current Soil Moisture (CSM) with Minimum Standard Error is used
    to predict soil moisture (PSM Value). Sends an “On” status to start irrigation
    if (Tmax > GSM) is fulfilled. The recommended deep Convolutional Neural Network
    Algorithm was used to assess the parameters. Precision agriculture shown in Fig.
    3, for example, uses the Internet of Things to increase agricultural output over
    time. Precision farming makes use of the Internet of Things to collect and communicate
    massive quantities of field data, evaluate it, and make the best agricultural
    decisions possible. Table 1 shows agronomist recommendations for acceptable environmental
    variables that impact crop development. Fig. 3 Proposed system model Full size
    image Table 1 Environmental factors affecting various cultivation stages Full
    size table Data aggregation With the use of agricultural datasets, Apriori Data
    Aggregation allows for prediction and call characteristics. The data is then accurately
    translated to determine the constant value as well as the situation, while the
    user is notified by phone call. Apriori Data Aggregation represents the ultimate
    yield level of everything developed in the horticulture zone based on information
    analysis. The Apriori algorithm is a foundational approach for discovering Boolean
    association rules from frequently occurring itemsets. It investigates the level-wise
    mining Apriori condition that any nonempty subsets of a frequently occurring itemset
    must likewise be often frequent. Accumulation and anticipation techniques use
    a few factors to anticipate obscure or future estimates of the different factors,
    using the Open Grid Service Hash-Based Validation method, which allows the user
    perception and value of the dataset to the viewed as a table so that the prediction
    of the field area is easily calculated. At the field level of the region in which
    the node setup occurs, the global positioning system (GPS), computer modelling,
    ground-based/airborne/satellite remote sensing, variable rate technology, and
    sophisticated information processing are utilized to detect and maintain the field
    level implementation for timely in-season and between-season crop management.
    S-linear kernel analysis Convert the observed raw sensor data to a vector representation
    using the sparse linear regression (SLR) method. The sparse linear regression
    (SLR) problem aims to calculate a k-sparse n-dimensional vector tau that minimizes
    the error ||M tau – q|| given a d x n matrix M and a d-dimensional query q. This
    issue is the geometric equivalent of the following: find the nearest k-dimensional
    subspace to q that is covered by a subset of k points in P, given a collection
    of n points P and a query point q in d dimensions. A similarity function is used
    by the kernel to compare two data points. Sequential data, images, and vectors
    are no longer accepted by the kernel function. Kernel approaches are named from
    the fact that they operate in high-dimensional, ambiguous feature space by generating
    the linear combination of all pairings of data in the feature set rather than
    finding the coordinates of the data. When compared to manually computing the coordinates,
    this approach is generally less computationally demanding. The “kernel trick”
    is the name for this method. Equation (1) describes the weighted similarity measure
    form, the similarity function, Si training sample, and S'', the unlabeled input.
    $${S}^{\\wedge}=sgn\\sum_{i=1}^nW_iS_i{}^m\\left(S_i,S^\\prime\\right)$$ (1) K_SLinear
    Kernel Analysis Algorithm (K_SLR) The K SLR algorithm’s new way of using weather
    forecasting datasets with k means clustering. Equation (2) represents the weighted
    similarity measure fork, the similarity function, St training sample, and S*,
    the unlabeled input for k, the similarity function, St training sample, and S*,
    the unlabeled input. This was conveyed in three ways. $$Z=sgn\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{W}_{i}{S}_{i}{}^{k}\\left({S}_{t},{S}^{*}\\right)$$
    (2) K SLinear Kernel Analysis Soil Moisture Prediction Algorithm 1 shows the algorithm,
    while Algorithm 2 shows the Smart Irrigation option. The irrigation will be timed
    to coincide with the farmer’s soil moisture threshold. Soil moisture thresholds
    are precise SWC values that indicate the availability of water for plant consumption.
    These levels are used to calculate when and how often irrigation is essential.
    The irrigation work is scheduled based on the threshold T and previous precipitation
    data, as well as the expected ground soil moisture trend. It is possible to switch
    on or off the water motor control. This gadget controls the relay that turns the
    water motor on and off. Based on the collected observations, the lowest and highest
    thresholds “Tmin” and “Tmax” defined in the previous algorithm will start and
    stop irrigation. Ground soil moisture (GSM) was predicted using MSE, and the difference
    between GSM and Tmax was used to determine whether irrigation should be done manually
    or automatically. The moisture content of the soil will normally range from 10
    to 45%, although it will be higher during and after irrigation. Water is trapped
    in the pores of your soil, which are openings or gaps between sand grains and
    the interface of the sand grains. Tensiometer, moisture block, feel, and appearance
    are the most common ways to measure soil moisture. The motor receives the signal
    “1” signalling “ON.” To switch off the irrigation, it transmits the signal “0.”
    As a result, the system can forecast how much water is required for agriculture.
    Because of the lack of water, the system has a lot of potential for supporting
    farmers who rely on the terrestrial tank. Deep convolution neural network The
    approach may be used by farmers to identify irrigation-based decision-making by
    looking at the present irrigation schedule throughout the whole crop’s growth.
    Crop growth characteristics are utilized as input datasets in this module, which
    forecasts precipitation, rainfall, and evapotranspiration ranges that may sustain
    crop output while ensuring future soil water stability, allowing irrigation to
    be planned and scheduled. This system was built using a deep convolutional neural
    network (DCNN). Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are created using deep learning,
    a machine learning technology. It is based on the idea of artificial neural networks
    (ANNs), which are designed to perform complex analyses on large amounts of data
    by routing it through several layers of neurons. The most common type of image
    and video pattern recognition system is deep convolutional neural networks (CNN
    or DCNN). The hydrological cycle and weather prediction both rely on soil moisture
    (SM). Satellites are the primary realistic tool to investigate large-scale SM
    dynamics on a regular basis. The radiative transfer hypothesis and satellite observations
    are frequently used to determine SM. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)
    can improve SM retrievals even more than the NN model. The suggested deep convolutional
    neural network (DCNN), a high-performance deep learning model, has been presented.
    Effective features data may be retrieved from challenging spectrum data using
    the proposed DCNN, and the important structure of feature data can be determined.
    Convolutional neural networks offer a higher modelling power than surface learning
    approaches. The suggested DCNN was utilized to evaluate soil moisture content
    using near-infrared spectroscopy in this study. For spectral regression, an effective
    DCNN modelling technique was presented. This modelling strategy reduced the time
    it took to preprocess spectrum data and increased the accuracy of spectral prediction.
    Structure of DCNN The capacity of multilayer networks to tackle a range of real-world
    problems with levels of accuracy that typical machine learning approaches have
    yet to attain has renewed interest in them. Proposed deep convolutional neural
    networks have achieved a lot of success in image analysis. The name refers to
    a neural network with a special network design in which each so-called hidden
    layer includes two unique layers: the first one is the result of a localized convolution
    of the preceding layer, and the next is a max-pooling stage, which drastically
    decreases the number of units by retaining just the maximum response of many units
    from the first stage. Following a series of concealed layers, the last layer is
    usually fully linked. Each network-predicted class has its unit that takes input
    from the others. Figure 4 shows the proposed DCNN structure. Fig. 4 Structure
    of DCNN Full size image The MSE based accuracy expressed in Eq. (3). $$MSE=\\frac1n\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(z_i-z_i^\\wedge\\right)^2$$
    (3) The coefficient of determination R, which is used to identify the soil qualities
    exploited by rainfall and runoff, is represented by the R factor. The R factor
    changes depending on how much rain falls each day. Every month, the R factor calculation
    methodologies outlined in equations are supplied. $${R}^{2}=1-\\frac{\\sum \\left(z-{z}_{m}{}^{2}\\right)}{\\sum
    \\left(z-{z}_{0}{}^{2}\\right)}$$ (4) where Z is observed data, zm modelled value,
    and z0 mean of the observed value. $$RMSE={[\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left({S}_{fi}-{S}_{oi}{}^{2}\\right)/N]}^{{^1}/{_2}}$$

    $$VI{F}_{i}=\\frac{1}{1-{R}_{i}{}^{2}}$$ (6) where the coefficient of determination

    evaluate and implement irrigation schedules that are most advantageous to their
    agricultural conditions. By predicting precipitation and evapotranspiration range
    estimates and creating soil water stability via regulated irrigation, the system’s
    complexity is tempered and integrated, resulting in increased output yield. As
    a consequence, the system’s uniqueness comes from the hybridized mix of the artificial
    neural network (ANN) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). ANN is a commonly used machine
    learning approach that analyzes previous data to forecast patterns, whereas GA
    is an algorithm that can locate better subsets of input parameters for integrating
    into ANN, increasing the accuracy of prediction through optimized feature selection.
    The proposed DCNN makes advantage of the irrigation water that is pushed. The
    precipitation event had been well projected, notwithstanding the necessity to
    alter rainfall depths. The crop increase version of the soil water content tiers
    tracked the trend of soil humidity measurements while effectively predicting canopy
    cover patterns and seed cotton output, particularly on drip-irrigated plots. The
    proposed DCNN-based feature determines the best parameter, in this case, resulting
    in a classification system. The decision unit function of a neural network evaluates
    incoming input and initializes the population function. The population measures
    the yield at the senescence (Maturity) stage when the crop reaches its greatest
    height. The plant’s fruits and vegetables are now ready to be picked. After utilizing
    the proposed DCNN Algorithm to initialize the population, the mutation starts
    measuring irrigation levels in the field, which are dependent on plant development
    stages. Emergence, fast growth, lag growth, and senescence are the four phases
    of plant development. Finally, the fitness function was evaluated by determining
    the system’s MSE error rate, as well as identifying variations and evaluating
    performance using R2, RMSE, and other prediction measures. The water level in
    the field is checked. As a consequence, the system’s crop suggestions assist farmers
    in making the greatest precision agriculture selections possible. Result and discussion
    Data collection and experimental setup The environmental factors that are monitored
    include soil temperature, soil humidity, and water level. The data were collected
    utilizing several irrigation treatment sub-plots on a cotton-growing field in
    Southern Tamilnadu. Irrigation Area Guaranteed Historically, the satta system
    was used in several parts of Eastern India. Farmers had to apply for water each
    season under this arrangement, but they did not have to indicate which crops they
    wanted; paddy was assumed. Water had to be given to each farmer in sufficient
    quantities to allow the crop to mature. For a month, sensor observations were
    made at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 12 p.m., 2 p.m., and 4 p.m. The humidity sensors were
    utilized to gather data on moisture every 60 min regularly. In addition, statistical
    downscaling of precipitation was investigated to forecast accurate readings and
    provide decision-making support for irrigation resource management. The sensor-based
    system on the agricultural field, as well as the many soil parameters it monitors
    Matlab 2019 was used to run the simulations on the Windows 10 operating system
    (a). Irrigation water takes around 55% of the water utilized for crop growth in
    an average farmed area, therefore this is a significant component. When water
    is transported to the field, it loses 12% of its volume. The major purpose was
    to keep track of soil moisture content and irrigation levels as the crop progressed.
    The VH-400 sensor measures soil moisture, whereas the DHT22 sensor measures soil
    temperature and humidity. Moisture determination enables the quantification of
    irrigation requirements before a crop begins to exhibit indications of distress.
    Knowing the soil moisture condition enables extremely effective irrigation, supplying
    water just when it is needed and reducing excessive water consumption when irrigation
    is not necessary. The amount of moisture in a product impacts its processibility,
    shelf life, usefulness, and quality. Accurate moisture content assessment is so
    critical in maintaining quality in a variety of sectors, including food, pharmaceuticals,
    and chemicals. To begin the main function, the datasets are collected and given
    for processing. GPS view of the field The field area view is shown in Fig. 5,
    where the vision indicates the data to be begun with the use of the sensing area,
    the road describes the environmental region, and the camera view is the agricultural
    field area sensing level. Fig. 5 Simulation view of field Full size image Aggregation,
    on the other hand, seems to be a time-saving strategy in the agricultural sense,
    including data from many parameter measurements such as air, humidity, temperature,
    and land change from a field region, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The sensor levels
    in the environmental sensing regions in the agricultural field are established
    based on the acquired data, and the overall seems level within each item set in
    the agricultural area is established. Fig. 6 Aggregation of sensing field Full
    size image The GRU unit, restrictions, framework perception, and behavior patterns
    will all be followed throughout the Apriori Grid Round (Open Grid Service Architecture-Hash
    Based Validation). OGSA specifies a core set of standard service interfaces and
    their associated semantics for applications such as state management, fault management,
    and service creation and management. To construct interoperable and reusable services,
    interfaces and semantics are both necessary. Grid service refers to a service’s
    common and standard semantics and interface. A grid service is an OGSA-compliant
    Web service. In the GRU system, the role of examining data objects is emphasized
    in the form of grid services. The blue line represents the field area along this
    grid, while the diagonal box within the field specifies the yield area''s table
    value. Aggregation at the grid level is seen in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Grid level histogram
    Full size image Figure 8 shows a cross-correlation based on land modification
    in the sensor field region, where the wind direction deviation detects irrigation
    data in the field. Fig. 8 Specification of water level Full size image The precision
    and call occur to forecast environmental changes in the field; the time/sec changes
    are shown in Fig. 8. The deviations of user perception are shown in Fig. 9 where
    the grid service senses and sends data, and the field area represents the sensing
    of area changes. The dry soil’s weight is subtracted from the wet soil’s weight,
    which is then divided by the dry soil’s weight to get the soil moisture in the
    field area. Despite its simplicity, assessing soil moisture content is crucial
    for better understanding soil characteristics. The validation of the field when
    the area is to be sensed is specified in Fig. 10, as well as the accuracy that
    allows the field’s data to be processed. Fig. 9 Train, test validation, and precision

    which will forecast the real and residual levels of the land area of the field.
    Fig. 11 a Sensor values from water, b air, and temperature Full size image Sensors
    are used in the SLR and K_SLR algorithms to conduct the agricultural land environmental
    parameters. For 3 weeks, the algorithm’s effectiveness was shown by measuring
    irrigation elements including humidity, soil moisture, and temperature on an hourly
    basis. This observation is carried out for 12 days and group growth is monitored
    for 170 days from 14 July 2021 to 31 December 2021. The approach for measuring
    the predicted soil moisture (PSM) value is provided by Algorithm SLR. This method
    aids in forecasting soil moisture, for the future days. With the correlation coefficient
    and least mean square error, the K_SLR method promotes excellent accuracy. The
    SLR Algorithm is trained independently with observed sensor data and recorded
    data for the future day’s soil moisture differential prediction. The training
    was during December 2021 (from 05–12-2021 to 20–12-2021). In addition, as shown
    in Tables 2 and 3, the SLR method’s statistical assessment of projected soil moisture
    is compared. Figures 12 and 13 illustrate a graphical depiction. The SLR approach
    offers greater accuracy and lower MSE when using the variables in Table 2. Table

    is then compared to the web-based interface for real-time monitoring to acquire
    the ground soil moisture value (GSM). Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the final projected
    soil moisture difference used in smart irrigation, which is depicted in Figs.
    14 and 15. The quantity of water used for automatic irrigation (1250 ml) is less
    than that utilized for manual watering (1550 ml). The manual irrigation system
    has a hole in it. Automated irrigation is typically the best option. Table 4 Final

    are oblivious to the advantages of proper irrigation. In addition, the ideal water
    level is sufficient for good crop growth. Farmers will be able to determine the
    ideal water level point and increase crop yields with this irrigation planning
    strategy. During the seasons, the system will aid farmers with irrigation planning,
    enabling more efficient water usage in large agricultural fields. The proposed
    algorithm should be able to schedule smart irrigation based on anticipated soil
    moisture predicted by current approaches and provide optimum irrigation. Table
    4 shows the experimental investigation that resulted in a reliable estimation
    of soil moisture based on field data and forecast information. This information
    might be used to predict how much water is required for effective irrigation and
    the most efficient use of natural rain. The suggested technique’s estimation error
    rate is calculated using statistical metrics like R squared and mean squared error.
    The farmer set the soil moisture threshold level in auto mode. Depending on the
    threshold level, the system will automatically design the irrigation chart based
    on weather forecast (precipitation) information and predicted soil moisture. The
    user is in control of scheduling choices in manual mode, which are based on precipitation
    data and projected soil moisture. Based on sensor data, a comparison of correlation
    coefficient (R) and mean squared error (MSE). Soil moisture prediction. The difference
    is compared to the recommended creative approach to measure their prediction accuracy,
    as shown in Table 6 and Fig. 16. Table 6 Comparison between SLR and K_SLR algorithms
    Full size table Fig. 16 Comparison between SLR and K_SLR algorithms Full size
    image Figure 16 shows the graphical result of the moisture level measured throughout
    a few days during the month in question. The results of the prediction made using
    SMD and the K_SLR show that the K_SLR has a higher accuracy of 99.75%. The suggested
    innovative K_SLR method outperforms the SLR algorithm, demonstrating the irrigation
    planning module’s effectiveness. The method simulates crop development in the
    context of a given crop’s soil profile, improving water stability. The procedure
    started at 6:00 a.m. and lasted all day, preparing the server to check the harvest.
    The hourly examination of the technology, which captures soil water content levels
    and projected precipitation variations, focuses on the crop development stages.
    The data acquired in the field is used to define the irrigation schedule and uniformity
    of the crop marinating water stability, so increasing the overall performance
    of the proposed DCNN version of the existing system. The R2, RMSE, and VIF of
    the suggested system were utilized to assess irrigation optimization. The emergence,
    fast growth, lag, and senescence phases of crop development take around 170 days
    and are separated into four stages: emergence, rapid growth, lag, and senescence.
    The performance of the recommended strategy was assessed based on its R2 of (0.974),
    low RMSE of (0.051), and VIF (98.789). As a consequence, in the performance metrics
    that were evaluated, our system beats the present artificial neural network (ANN)
    system. The proposed DCNN model replicates the amount of water in crop-growing
    areas. Equation (7) expresses the daily transpiration Ts. $${T}_{s}={S}_{k}*M{A}_{x}{K}_{m}{T}_{s,x}*E{T}_{0}$$
    (7) where ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration, KmTs the midseason crop coefficient,
    Sk the crop coefficient, and MA micro-advective adjustments. The MA is expressed
    in Eq. (8). $$MA=1.72MA-M{A}^{2}+0.30C{C}^{3}$$ (8) Everyday utilized Ts and ET0
    the water productivity (WP), the biomass calculation expressed in Eq. (9). $$B={W}_{p}*\\sum
    \\frac{{T}_{r}}{E{T}_{o}}$$ (9) Finally, the crop yield is calculated using Eq.
    (10). $$Y=B*{H}_{1}$$ (10) where H 1 is the percentage ratio of crop yield to
    the above-ground dry biomass. Based on Eq. 10 the crop yield was measured. Table
    7 shows the evapotranspiration measurements, rainfall, and soil moisture forecast
    for different phases of a plant. When compared to the existing ANN, the proposed
    DCNN has a higher score of 96.32%. Table 7 Comparison of ANN predictions with
    proposed DCNN Full size table When ET0 and R data were compared, the ET0 surpassed
    the R at all stages of plant development, as seen in Fig. 17. Evaporation from
    the open surface is frequently greater than evaporation from the soil surface.
    Instead of plant roots drawing up water, decreased rainfall caused more water
    to evaporate, as illustrated in the graph. Then, throughout the third and fourth
    phases of plant development, you will need to use a precise watering strategy.
    Fig. 17 ET0 and R comparisons of ANN predictions with proposed DCNN Full size
    image The findings demonstrated that the proposed DCNN approach outperformed the
    current ANN model in all phases of plant development, indicating it to be superior
    to the other, as shown in Fig. 18. The soil moisture projection values for days
    (1–14) − 0.9741, (15–70) − 0.8965, (71–113) − 0.9026, (114–170) − 0.9632 are shown
    below. Fig. 18 Predicted moisture comparisons of ANN predictions with proposed
    DCNN Full size image The performance indexes of the whole dataset are looked at.
    For both training and testing datasets, R2, RMSE, and VIF are utilized to score
    the performance metrics. The discriminating coefficient, abbreviated R2, is a
    popular regression performance indicator. It is a measure of how well a regression
    model explains the fluctuation of a dependent variable. A typical statistic for
    comparing predicted and actual outcomes is root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) or
    root-mean-square error (RMSE). The variance inflation factor (VIF) is a statistic
    that assesses how multicollinear a set of multivariate regression variables is.
    The VIF for a regression model variable is the ratio of overall model variance
    to the variance of a model with only that single independent variable. To evaluate
    the associations between the proposed DCNN and the ANN, the testing and training
    datasets were employed. Table 8 compares the proposed DCNN’s performance to that
    of the current ANN model for the measurement metrics R2, RMSE, and VIF at various
    stages of plant development. Despite having a huge number of data, the proposed
    DCNN system performs better in anticipating daily irrigation water requirements.
    In terms of representability and accuracy, the proposed DCNN surpasses the existing
    ANN model, and it has a low MSE. Table 8 Comparison of existing ANN with the proposed
    DCNN for the various performance metrics Full size table When the results were
    compared to the present ANN model, it was observed that the proposed DCNN technique
    has a high R2 throughout all stages of plant development, suggesting that it is
    superior to the other, as shown in Fig. 19. Below are the R2 values for the days
    (1–14) − 0.961, (15–70) − 0.969, (71–113) − 0.962, and (114–170) − 0.974. As a
    consequence, the technology successfully optimizes the water level for future
    precision agricultural irrigation decision-making to guarantee optimum crop development
    and water stability. Fig. 19 R2 comparisons of ANN predictions with proposed DCNN
    Full size image The proposed DCNN technique has a low RMSE error rate in the first
    three stages of plant development, as shown in Fig. 20, when compared to the present
    DCNN model, demonstrating that it is superior to the other. Below are the RMSEs
    for days (1–14) − 0.042, (15–70) − 0.038, and (71–113) − 0.035. As a consequence,
    irrigation may be scheduled ahead of time during the early stages of plant development.
    Fig. 20 RMSE comparisons of ANN with proposed DCNN Full size image The findings
    were compared to the current ANN model, and it was discovered that the proposed
    DCNN approach has a high VIF at all phases of plant growth, demonstrating that
    it is superior to the other, as shown in Figs. 21 and 22. A confusion matrix is
    a table that shows how well a classification model performs on a set of test data
    when the true values are known. Although the confusion matrix is simple to understand,
    the terminology used to explain it can be difficult to understand. Count values
    are used to sum the number of correct and incorrect predictions and divide them
    by class. This is the key to comprehending the confusion matrix, which causes
    forecasters to get confused. The VIF readings for days (1–14) − 95.21, (15–70) − 96.84,
    (71–113) − 97.364, and (114–170) − 98.789 are shown below. As a result, the suggested
    DCNN has a strong correlation in terms of forecasting and planning irrigation
    for the parameters in consideration. Fig. 21 VIF comparisons of ANN with proposed
    DCNN Full size image Fig. 22 Confusion matrix Full size image Conclusion Precision
    agriculture is a relatively new technology that demands the purchase of costly
    and complicated equipment like yield monitoring sensors and GPS receivers. Such
    facilities are out of reach for precision agricultural producers. As a consequence,
    many individuals opt to shun precision farming practices, especially if their
    goods are low in value. This work uses an IoT-based intelligent irrigation infrastructure
    and a hybrid machine learning-based approach to predict soil moisture. Based on
    prior observations made using weather forecast data, the recommended algorithms
    provide forecasts for future demand and soil moisture level studies. As a consequence,
    the research focuses on providing an automated and effective way of water usage,
    as well as assisting in the creation of water-saving devices based on the proposed
    algorithm and cost-effective analysis. The strength and quality of performance
    of the models have been improved, allowing for further advancement in the agriculture
    sector for lifelong use. The improved version of the created system has an R2
    value of 97.4% as a consequence of the suggested modules. The total outcome of
    the suggested study effort provides favorable suggestions for farmers that employ
    IoT in precision agriculture to boost crop yield in future implementation. Farmers
    will be able to communicate information with the recommender system in the future
    using computer software or a mobile phone. Furthermore, intelligent agricultural
    planting, fertilizing, and harvesting decisions may be considered future research
    routes to effectively employ data to boost yields and profits. Furthermore, to
    precise agricultural requirements, the system was designed with soil conditions
    in mind. Data availability All data generated or analyzed during this study are

  description: Environmental monitoring plays a significant role in the agriculture
    field as it manages the critical factors required for sustainable growth of plants,
    and thus enhancing the quality and productivity of the crops. In this paper, the
    development of a wireless sensor network (WSN) monitoring system for young sago

    respect to the environmental factors monitored is also discussed. The system was
    set up to monitor three environmental factors i.e., temperature, relative humidity,
    and light intensity. Instantaneous readings of the monitored parameters were made
    possible through a wireless network and a web portal connection. The system recorded
    the environmental reading at every 15-min interval and transmitted the data from
    node to base using the Zigbee network. The data was then stored in an online cloud
    platform through the general radio packet service (GPRS) gateway. Linear actuators
    were also installed to control the mist chamber doors opening for natural ventilation
    and they were automatically triggered by the threshold temperature. Besides, a
    smart alert system was added to the system prompting for actions via short messaging
    services (SMS) when triggered. The developed system achieved a reliable data transmission
    with a low packet loss rate (PLR) of 2.3%. The use of the GPRS gateway also enabled
    the system to operate at a lower cost as the mobile data consumption was low (10
    MB per month). In conclusion, a WSN system for mist chambers in a sago palm greenhouse
    was successfully developed to real-time monitor the plant growing environment
    through data acquisition, data transmission and data visualisation. The developed

    1. Introduction Sago palm (Metroxylon sagu) is one of the commodities that is
    largely cultivated in South East Asia particularly the state of Sarawak, Malaysia
    due to its high starch content (Flores, 2008, Ishizaki, 1997). Studies have revealed
    that sago has diversified usage in food industries like encapsulating flavour,
    thickening sauces and soups, offering better gelling characteristics, and giving
    prolonged crispiness. In non-food industries, sago starch is used as a coating
    agent in the biodegradable film, thickener in adhesive preparation and printing,
    sizing agents in papermaking, dusting powder in cosmetic, hypoallergenic powder
    and bioethanol production (Bujang, 2014, Mohamad Naim et al., 2016, Singhal et
    al., 2008). Due to its versatility and economic value, Sarawak exports about 25,000–40,000
    tons of sago products to Peninsular Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and other
    countries each year (Bujang, 2008, Singhal et al., 2008). To ensure high starch
    productivity in sago palms, advanced technology like tissue culture is usually
    applied for breeding and propagation of sago palms with better control of the
    plant’s quality (Riyadi et al., 2018). Every month, sago palms bred through tissue
    culture are provided by CRAUN Research Sdn. Bhd., Sarawak to the local sago farms
    and plantations. These young clonal plants (Fig. 1) require a phase-to-phase adaptation
    and assimilation to accommodate the change from the lab environments to the field
    environments. Before moving onto the actual fields, these plants are grown under
    a controlled environment. Under sub-optimal environmental conditions, it may lead
    to a high mortality rate in these young plants. Many studies have affirmed that
    environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, light intensity
    have played a vital role in the growth and development of sago palm (Bintoro et
    al., 2010, Chua et al., 2021, Irawan, 2011, Prathumyot et al., 2018, Schuiling,
    2009). Despite the importance of the environmental factors, there is a lack of
    research on environmental monitoring systems to monitor the young sago palms.

    1. Photos of young sago palms (A) In vitro young sago palms directly from the
    lab (B) Young sago palms transplanted in pots before planting out in the mist
    chamber. Environmental parameters are constantly varying depending on the weather,
    thus causing continuous monitoring to be labour intensive and technically challenging.
    Therefore, wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has gained wide attention in recent years
    for real-time monitoring in the agricultural field. WSN is a network comprised
    of a centralized station and a collection of sensor nodes that communicate with
    each other using digital encryption (Sohraby et al., 2013). The sensor nodes are
    usually made up of a processor, memory, sensors, radio and a battery while the
    centralized base station functions to receive information from the nodes and process
    the data (Matin and Islam, 2012, Santoshkumar and Udaykumar, 2015). The most popular
    protocols used in WSN applications are Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
    and Bluetooth Low Energy (IEEE 802.15.3) (Sorokin, 2021). WSN has various advantages
    such as (i) does not require the laying of wires and cables, (ii) offers high
    accuracy with densely located sensor nodes, (iii) ideal for unattended remote
    monitoring (Zhu et al., 2011) (iv) all information could be accessed at the centralized
    monitoring system and (v) scalable by manipulating the number of nodes and devices.
    The implementation of WSN has often represented a segment of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) solution to smart farming. Smart farming mainly comprises of three sub-processes,
    i.e. (i) data collection (ii) decision-making and (iii) intervention. WSN typically
    contributed to the data collection process, and with IoT, it allowed the flow
    of data from the sensors to other devices for further processing and analysis
    to perform subsequent actions. There are many WSN and IoT applications in agriculture
    such as precision agriculture (Dasgupta et al., 2020, Jawad et al., 2017, Karimi
    et al., 2018, Wohwe Sambo et al., 2020), irrigation control and scheduling (Bodunde
    et al., 2019, García et al., 2021, Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020, Khan et al.,
    2021, Roy et al., 2021), environmental monitoring (Polo et al., 2015, Tahir et
    al., 2020, Vuli and Stojanovi, 2021), crop health monitoring (Amin et al., 2021,
    Sridhar and Sridhar, 2020, Catini et al., 2019), plant phenotyping (Al-Turjman,
    2019, Kameoka et al., 2017, Zhen et al., 2017) and crops security (Shrihari, 2020).
    Smart farming solutions usually need to be customized and adapted accordingly
    as there are differences in yield gap and farm size as well as the necessity of
    integration of new technologies with the existing practices (Elijah et al., 2018).
    To date, research on the development of monitoring systems for starch-producing
    crops like wheat, potato, corn and cassava are common amongst academicians and
    industrial players (Caicedo-Ortiz et al., 2018, Castellanos et al., 2020, Kumar
    et al., 2018, Miao et al., 2021, Pal et al., 2021, Pan et al., 2017, Rivero et
    al., 2020). However, the development of the monitoring system for sago palm is
    rarely found in the literature. Sago palm, differ from other crops, prefer a high
    humidity environment and therefore they are usually planted in mist chambers during
    their early life. Deployment of an environmental monitoring system for mist chambers
    is uncommon and limited in the literature. Therefore, this paper aimed to develop
    a real-time environmental monitoring system of young sago palms in mist chambers
    through data acquisition, data transmission and data visualisation. 2. System
    architecture The WSN system designated for this project consisted of three sensor
    nodes and a base station. Among the three sensor nodes, two sensor nodes were
    equipped with control mechanisms. Their block diagrams were presented in Fig.
    2. The following components were used in the sensor nodes: DHT22 temperature-humidity
    sensor, LDR sensor module, DFRobot Gravity sensor shield, Arduino Mega, XBee Series
    2C, MicroSD card, DS3231 RTC module, DPDT relays (with or without), linear actuators
    (with or without), and power supply. The following components were used in the
    base station: DHT22 temperature-humidity sensor, LDR sensor module, DFRobot Gravity
    sensor shield, Arduino Mega, XBee Series 2C, MicroSD card, DS3231 RTC module,
    GPRS/GSM module, SIM card, and power supply. Fig. 3 displayed the wiring and assemblies
    of the system. The WSN system in this paper was categorized into three subsystems
    based on the functionality, which were (i) the data acquisition and control system,
    (ii) the data transmission system and (iii) the data visualisation and storage
    system. Download : Download high-res image (515KB) Download : Download full-size

    Data acquisition and control All sensor nodes and the base station acted as data
    collection points. The three sensor nodes were placed in the mist chambers A,
    B and C in CRAUN Research Sdn. Bhd. while the base station was located on top
    of mist chamber B. The mist chamber dimension is given by 3.45 m (length) 1.14
    m (height) 1.40 m (depth) as shown in Fig. 4. The sensor nodes recorded the environmental
    data inside the mist chambers while the base station recorded the ambient environmental
    data on top of the mist chamber. The ambient environmental data above the mist
    chamber was measured because it was exposed to the sun most of the time and could
    serve as an indicator of the weather on that day. The sensor nodes and the base
    station were programmed to collect the environmental data at every 15-minute interval,
    which were at the 00, 15, 30 and 45 min in an hour. The timing was fixed using
    the DS3231 RTC Module. The collected data included temperature, relative humidity,
    and light intensity. The temperature and relative humidity data were collected
    using the DHT22 sensors with an accuracy of 0.2 °C for temperature and accuracy
    of 5% for relative humidity. The light intensity was measured using an LDR sensor
    module by converting the resistance values into lux values. All the LDR sensors
    were precisely calibrated with good fitting curves of R2 values from to 0.90 to
    0.96. Download : Download high-res image (118KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Dimension of the mist chamber. Linear actuators were utilized in
    this system to control the opening and closing of the mist chambers door for natural
    ventilation. It was expected to lower down the mist chamber interior temperature
    by creating side openings to avoid heat buildup and exert heat stress to the young
    sago palms. The linear actuators would extend and open the mist chamber doors
    whenever the temperature was 30 °C and above and retract and close the mist chamber
    doors when the temperature fell back to below 30 °C. Each extension lasted for
    11 s, resulting in a total extension of 110 mm with a velocity of 10 mm/s. The
    programming logic was depicted as in the flowchart shown in Fig. 5. The linear
    actuators were provided with an external power supply of 12 V and 1A while DPDT
    relays acted as the electronic switch between the microcontroller and the power
    supply. As the mist chamber would need two linear actuators to open or close the
    side openings, the sensor node would require two linear actuators, two DPDT relays
    and two external power supplies for the control mechanism. Download : Download

    of linear actuator activation and deactivation mechanism. 2.2. Data transmission
    2.2.1. Sensor node to base station transmission Zigbee network was deployed for
    the wireless communication between sensor nodes and base station due to the various
    advantages Zigbee modules offered. Zigbee is an IEEE802.15.4 based specification
    that is low cost, low power consumption rate and easy to install. ZigBee was used
    because it could trace the required signal eliminating the errors although in
    the presence of high noise strength almost equal to the signal strength (Santoshkumar
    and Udaykumar, 2015). It could be set up into different configurations such as
    coordinator, transmitter, router, or end device, depending on the purpose of usage.
    It could operate within 10–100 m and support a large number of nodes in proximity.
    XBee RF ZB modules (Xbee S2C) from Digi International were selected for this project.
    Before application, the XBee S2C modules were configured using the XCTU software
    by connecting them to the laptop using an SKXBee module. Fig. 6 exhibited a section
    of the configuration settings in XCTU software. Download : Download high-res image

    configuration. As the environmental information was measured by the three sensor
    nodes at every 15-minute interval, these data were required to be sent over to
    the base station through the Zigbee network at every 15-minute interval as well
    before uploading them to the Internet. To avoid signal interference with each
    other, a slight time delay of three minutes was exploited among the sensor nodes
    before sending their signals to the base station. For instance, sensor node 1
    would transmit its signal first, and three minutes later sensor node 2 would transmit
    its signal, and finally, sensor node 3 would transmit its signal. The timing delay
    was achieved by using the RTC function which was programmed using Arduino IDE.
    To differentiate the data coming from the three routers, the routers were set
    in API mode in which they could display their respective address on the Serial
    Monitor when the data arrived at the base station. Fig. 7 showed the block diagram
    for data transmission. Download : Download high-res image (129KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Block diagram of data transmission. 2.2.2. Internet gateway
    After the data from the sensor nodes had been transmitted to the XBee coordinator
    at the base station, these datasets were uploaded online. The internet gateway
    was established using a GPRS/GSM module attached to the Arduino Mega microcontroller.
    The General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) service allowed internet connectivity
    and enabled the system to upload the data online. It is a preferred option, especially
    in areas where there is limited access to Wi-Fi or Ethernet (Morais et al., 2019).
    The GPRS/GSM Module from EFCom Pro was selected in this project. This GPRS/GSM
    module is specifically designed based on the SIM900 4 Frequency GPRS module which
    operates at four frequency bands which include 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and
    1900 MHz. It could be programmed using AT commands (GSM 07.07, 07.05 and EFCOM
    enhanced AT Commands). The AT commands were utilized in this project to trigger
    actions like setting up the modem, establishing the network, sending data, and
    terminating the network. After execution of each AT command, there would be a
    program function to check the response from the GPRS/GSM module. It would display
    either “OK” or “Error” on the Serial Monitor, depending on the response from the
    module, as displayed in Fig. 8. This function would be useful for troubleshooting
    in case of any unresponsiveness of the module. While setting up the GPRS/GSM module
    for the application, a SIM card and a monthly data plan were prerequisites. Download

    AT Response from GSM. 2.2.3. Alert messages This system was designed in such a
    way that alert messages were sent out under certain circumstances through the
    short messaging service (SMS). Alert messages would be sent out in the following
    conditions: (i) the sensor failed to read data (ii) the XBee router failed to
    send data to the XBee coordinator (iii) the sensor node failed to record data
    in the MicroSD card. These alert messages were sent to the mobile number of the
    person in charge. 2.3. Data visualisation and storage After collecting data and
    receiving data from the sensor nodes, the data from the base station was transferred
    to an online cloud platform named ThingSpeak as shown in Fig. 9. The benefits
    of using the ThingSpeak platform include enable real-time monitoring, offer graphical
    visualisation of data, and provide various analysis tools with Matlab functionality
    available. A third-party ThingSpeak app named Thingview was used to view online
    information through mobile. In this project, the datasets from all sensor nodes
    and the base station were recorded on four channels. One of the channels represented
    the ambient environmental data while the remaining channels represented the environmental
    data in mist chambers A, B and C respectively. The online datasets on ThingSpeak
    were downloaded in excel format for offline data storage. In addition to the offline
    data storage, each sensor node and the base station were equipped with MicroSD
    cards to store the datasets as well. The MicroSD storage could serve as a cross-check
    with the online data on ThingSpeak, especially during circumstances of data loss
    in any case of poor internet connection or missing transmitted signal to the coordinator.

    The WSN monitoring system was implemented at CRAUN Research Sdn. Bhd. for nearly
    four months. Fig. 10 revealed the actual implementation of the system at the site.
    To mount the linear actuators, a few customised brackets were fabricated through
    3D printing using PLA material after being illustrated in Autodesk software. The
    system was properly packed and sealed before it was put in use to avoid any potential
    of getting wet. The system was connected to a power supply after installation.

    performance evaluation 3.1.1. Packet loss rate The system had performed well in
    collecting environmental data and storing them in an online and offline database.
    To determine the efficiency of the system in data transmission, the packet loss
    rate was computed by multiplying the ratio of the number of packets received at
    the base station to the actual number of packets sent by the sensor nodes with
    the ratio of the number of packets uploaded online to the total number of packets
    at the base station. The data loss could be triggered by these two scenarios:(i)
    one of the XBee routers may fail to send its signal to the XBee coordinator, (ii)
    the XBee coordinator may fail to upload the data online. At the occurrence of
    these issues, alert messages would be sent out to the mobile number of their person-in-charge
    when the conditions mentioned earlier were met. Table 1 showed the packet loss
    rate for each chamber and base station in every batch and their respective averages.
    It was computed that the system had an average packet loss rate of 2.3%. The system’s
    packet loss rate is acceptable because it is lower in comparison to other Zigbee
    based wireless sensor network systems (Sun et al., 2010, Zeng et al., 2021). From
    the results, it has shown that mist chamber B had the highest packet loss rate,
    followed by mist chamber C, mist chamber A and finally the base station. Nevertheless,
    the packet loss rate was not affected by the node-to-base distance since mist
    chamber B was the nearest to the base station. Table 1. Packet loss rate analysis

    data consumption The mobile data consumption was relatively low at a rate of approximately
    10 MB per month because the collected environmental data was transferred to the
    ThingSpeak platform in text format. 3.2. Raw data analysis The obtained environmental
    data by the sensor nodes and base station could provide several insights regarding
    the microclimate inside the mist chambers. Fig. 11 manifested the variation of
    environmental parameters in a day across different mist chambers and the ambient
    condition. Based on the results, it could be noted that both the temperature and
    light intensity values in the ambient environment during the day were the highest
    while the relative humidity was the lowest among all. This phenomenon adhered
    to the expectation because the measured ambient condition above the mist chamber
    was exposed to the solar radiation directly. Moreover, air moisture was lost quickly
    to the surroundings as there was no way to retain the humidity. Download : Download

    of environmental parameters in a day across different mist chambers and the ambient.
    To investigate the effect of the partial opening and closing of mist chamber doors
    on the temperature and relative humidity, the system recorded the environmental
    data for two different configurations, i.e. (i) with linear actuator application
    (ii) without linear actuator application. Mist chambers B and C were equipped
    with the linear actuator applications while mist chamber A was used as a control
    set. Comparing the differences in environmental parameters between the mist chambers
    shown in Fig. 11, it was observed that the temperatures in mist chambers B and
    C were generally lower than the temperatures in mist chamber A during the day.
    Nevertheless, their respective relative humidity were at a greater loss compared
    to the relative humidity in mist chamber A. Although the drop in relative humidity
    in Mist chambers B and C were greater, the values were still considered acceptable.
    At scheduled times of mist spray applications, the relative humidity would return
    to values above 90%. The light intensities in the three mist chambers followed
    a similar trend with the ambient light intensity, as depicted in Fig. 11. The
    light intensity in a mist chamber may be higher than the other two mist chambers
    in a specific time range while may be lower than the other two mist chambers in
    a different time range. The fluctuations in the magnitude of light intensity were
    due to the locations of the mist chambers in the greenhouse. The mist chambers
    could have a greater exposure or hindrance from the solar radiation depending
    on a few factors like the location of the sun, the location of the mist chamber,
    and the presence of any obstruction at that time. Taking the average values of
    the environmental parameters recorded over the whole period of the system implementation,
    it was realized that the average air temperatures inside the mist chambers varied
    between 31 °C and 33 °C during daytime and fluctuated between 27 °C and 29 °C
    during the night. The average ambient temperature above the mist chamber was approximately
    34 °C during the day and dropped to around 26 °C to 27 °C at night. Unlike the
    ambient temperature that could be easily heated up or cooled down depending on
    the solar radiation intensity, the mist chambers resembled a closed environment
    and could trap heat if remained always shut. The highest air temperatures recorded
    inside the fully enclosed mist chambers A, B and C were 37.6 °C, 38.2 °C and 38.8
    °C respectively. By the comparison of the whole datasets, the average mist chamber
    interior temperatures with linear actuator applications were found to be approximately
    0.9 °C lower than the temperature in the mist chamber without linear actuator
    application. The temperature in mist chambers with linear actuator application
    also dropped at a steeper slope when compared with the fully enclosed mist chambers.
    The temperature reduction was due to natural convection that allowed the exchanging
    of the hotter trapped air and the cooler ambient air. However, with the openings
    of the mist chamber doors, the air moisture could be lost to the ambient environment
    and hence lower down the relative humidity. The overall datasets denoted that
    the average relative humidity was further decreased by approximately 5% when partially
    opened the mist chamber doors. The relative humidity generally remained at 98%
    to 99% at night and reduced to a range between 71% and 99% during daytime. The
    mist sprays inside the chambers were activated four times during the day and the
    relative humidity would increase back to above 90% after each application. The
    data also conveyed that the average light intensity in the mist chambers lied
    in a range from a few hundreds of lux to thousands of lux. These collected environmental
    data could aid in future research and development, for instance, to correlate
    with the sago palms’ growth and health through design of experiments (DOE) for
    precision agriculture. 4. Conclusion A WSN system for mist chambers in a sago
    palm greenhouse was developed to real-time monitor the plant growing environment
    through data acquisition, data transmission and data visualisation. The autonomous
    data collection process at every 15-minute interval had overcome the limitation
    of manpower in collecting data in which the process was time-consuming and labour-intensive.
    The WSN system had also significantly cut down the number of wires and cables,
    which could be a great shortcoming in a relatively humid environment. The scalability
    of the WSN system could be modified according to the number of mist chambers in
    the greenhouse by increasing the number of sensor nodes. The employment of the
    Zigbee network in data transmission had emerged to be reliable since the packet
    loss rate was as low as 2.3%, and it was not affected by distance from the base
    station. The WSN system was also equipped with linear actuator applications to
    control the opening and closing of the mist chamber doors. The effect of the mist
    chamber door opening in temperature regulation was analysed and computed. GPRS
    service in mobile communications was exploited to attain Internet connectivity.
    The benefit of using mobile data was economical and suitable for locations with
    limited access to Wi-Fi and Ethernet. The mobile data consumption was low, being
    at a rate of 10 MB per month. Along with mobile communications, the functionality
    of alert messages was included for triggered events. The collected data was visualised
    on the ThingSpeak website platform and on the ThingView mobile app, which was
    user friendly and easily accessed. Besides, a secondary offline database was also
    achieved through microSD storage to prevent data loss due to network instability.
    The developed WSN system had laid a foundation towards smart farming, and with
    further modifications and development, more complicated functions like adding
    control could be implemented to the system as well as increasing its efficiency
    and accuracy. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ee Ping Kho: Software,

    Conference Location: Amman, Jordan SECTION I. Introduction In the midst of the
    climate change that the world has been encountering for a long time resulting
    in impediments that put a colossal weight on the agrarian industry, driving cultivators
    to look for more progressed and smarter arrangements to realize efficient crop
    production methods to keep up with the ever-growing human populace [1]. Serious
    problems related to the food sector in terms of the prices and the crop rate are
    arising. Several factors are responsible for this such as climate change, water
    loss, and soil fertility. So that, the intervention of the advance and smart technologies
    is inevitable for better resource utilization and crop production rate optimization
    [1]. Nowadays, the rapid growth and advancement in wireless sensor networks technologies,
    wired and wireless communications protocols, and the internet of things (IoT)
    form key drivers to track various environmental parameters and conditions . The
    progression of advances over time has made the Internet of Things (IoT) increasingly
    prevalent due to its capacity to move forward the control of operation forms,
    upgrade information collection, and most imperatively is that it can minimize
    human endeavors, which is significant to the application utilized to this extent
    [2]. IoT made its way into a wide range of applications such as smart/intelligent
    agriculture and agribusiness. Smart farms were the go-to solution with respect
    to the issues that farmers were experiencing: water management, crop monitoring,
    pesticide and fertilizing deficiency. Prepared with innovative environmental sensors
    and communication technology (ICT) innovations, these farms frequently screen
    and always capture data about the surroundings and crops [3]. Collected information
    is passed into an IoT stage where expository analysis turns it into noteworthy
    insights to reveal bottlenecks and variations from the norm. In like manner, variations
    in conditions such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, rainfall and light intensity
    in these climatic conditions trigger mechanized activities to return these parameters
    to normal values. Rather than the old age of agricultural practices, by opening
    colossal edit bits of knowledge, a smart farm permits producers to cut down labor
    work, supervision, human error, and maintenance, and improve chemical utilization
    whereas optimizing yield rates. Low power wide area networks (LPWAN) have genuinely
    revolutionized the IoT, focusing on applications that require exchanges of little
    information bundles and energy efficiency over long ranges [4]. As we know, the
    most wireless communication technologies have large power consumption and short
    transmission distances and therefore do not meet the requirements of IoTs applications
    for connections. However, LPWANs can utilize licensed (NB-IoT) or unlicensed frequencies
    (LoRa, Sigfox) [5]. LoRa, short for Long Range, is the highlight of our work due
    to its advantages over other technologies e.g. ZigBee, Bluetooth, WIFI, GPRS [6]
    -[10]. LoRa is a physical-layer low power wireless technology, transmitting signal
    within the sub-GHz ISM band (868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 433MHz) [4], [10]. This paper
    aims to develop a system design that can track and monitor environmental parameters.
    This goal is accomplished by collecting sensor data and storing it on a database
    accessible through a cloud server. The end result includes remote real-time monitoring
    of environmental parameters as well as the application of machine learning algorithms
    to data sets to predict the state of the agricultural test space. Later, section
    2 will elaborate on the overall system architecture. Followed by section 3 and
    4 which will explain the system’s hardware and software design respectively. Section
    5 will discuss the added value of Machine Learning. Results and conclusion are
    summarized in section 6 and 7. SECTION II. System architecture The proposed framework
    is actualized and realized based on the thought that three transmitting LoRa units,
    which are located in different areas, take measurements of the same parameters
    throughout the day. Four parameters are tracked, from which two are measured using
    the DHT-22. This sensor measures both temperature and humidity with acceptable
    accuracy. The other two sensors are the MQ-135 (for measuring the CO2 ppm), and
    the LDR light intensity sensor (for measuring the luminance in lux). All the mentioned
    sensors are externally connected to an Arduino UNO, where the collected data is
    transmitted to a receiving LoRa unit. Afterwards, the data is sent using a SIM7000E
    module to a database server via an HTTP protocol by utilizing a GSM connection,
    this GSM connection is established by inserting a data sim card bought from Orange
    Telecom Company. Later the data is linked to a visualization open-source web application
    tool called Grafana where the data is visualized in a graphical form [11]. The
    collected data will be stored in a database, where it can be accessed for future
    usage. To make sense of our collected data, a machine-learning/predictive analytics
    platform called RapidMiner will be used [12]. Fig. 1 shows the system design architecture.
    Fig. 1. System Design Architecture. Show All SECTION III. System Hardware and
    electrical Design A. Electronic components Arduino UNO: The Arduino UNO is an
    open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip Atmeg 328P microcontroller
    and developed by Arduino.cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog
    input/output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other
    circuits Fig. 2. The board will be used for primary interfacing of the devices.
    Temperature and Humidity Sensor Modules : The DHT-22, temperature and humidity
    sensor, was chosen because its operating range for temperature is -40ºC to 80ºC
    and for humidity is 0-100%, with corresponding accuracies for both temperature
    and humidity of ±0.5º C and ±5% respectively. Fig. 3.a shows the DHT-22 sensor.
    CO-2 Level Sensor: any vegetation needs an optimal level of CO-2 to grow in a
    healthy manner, this CO-2 gas is measured in parts per million. Multiple CO-2
    sensors were researched and found in local stores with high prices, but in order
    to satisfy the realistic constrains the MQ-135 gas sensor was chosen. This air
    quality sensor measures multiple gases which include NH3, alcohol, benzene and
    CO-2; for the sake of our design scope, we are interested in the measurement of
    the CO-2 parameter. The measurement given by the sensor is later translated to
    parts per million. Fig. 3.b shows the MQ-135 sensor. Light Intensity Sensor: a
    LDR sensor module was deployed in a sense that the resistivity of the sensor varies
    inversely with the illumination captured. the reading of the sensor was translated
    to the SI unit of illumination, which is lux. Fig. 3.c illustrates the LDR sensor
    module. LoRa Ra-02 SX1278 Module. LoRa is short for Long Range; this technology
    utilizes the chirp spread spectrum modulation, wherein a transmitted sinusoidal
    signal is varied linearly across a certain bandwidth, , the resulting signal is
    called a chirp. Chirp spread spectrum modulation technique facilitates the following
    advantages: longer battery life and long-range transmission at the expense of
    low data rate [7], [10]. The LoRa module used in our design is the LoRa Ra-02
    SX1278 found in Fig. 4 which has a long transmission distance and its highly resistive
    to interference. Table I. dictates the features of the LoRa Ra-02 SX1278. SIM7000E
    expansion shield: the SIM7000E expansion shield developed by SemCom, which contains
    a BME-280 environmental bundle that consists of temperature and humidity sensors.
    Unfortunately, it was discovered that no supporting infrastructure or physical
    layer for NB-IoT was found in Jordan; however, due to economic reasons the SIM7000E
    was utilized later in the design as a gateway on the account of that one of its
    lower-level features is the ability to operate on both 2G and 3G networks. Fig.
    5 shows the SIM7000E hardware setup and the corresponding BME-280 sensor bundle.

    the SIM7000E, its TXD and RXD pin are connected to D7 and D8 pins in the Arduino
    Uno respectively, the SIM_VDD is connected to D9 pin in the Arduino Uno for turning
    on the SIM7000E programmatically. As shown in Fig. 7 below. Fig. 7. Circuit Diagram
    for Receiver Show All D. Prototype setup The achieved hardware design consists
    of three independent transmitters and a collecting receiver. The first transmitter
    has a LoRa module for transmission, an Arduino Uno as a microcontroller, and multiple
    deployed sensors: (one DHT-22 sensor, one MQ-135 sensor and a LDR sensor). The
    second and third transmitter have an identical set of components as the first
    transmitter. While the receiver has a SIM7000E module for sending the collected
    data to a previously mentioned database server and a LoRa module for transmission.
    Containers for both the transmitters and receiver were custom-made professionally
    for easy installation in the chosen environmental areas as will be shown in later
    figures of this chapter. Each of the three transmitters were deployed on three
    different environmental areas, while the receiver was deployed roughly in the
    middle among all three as shown in Fig. 8 which illustrates a geo-map of the locations
    of the previously mentioned hardware. The next figures show the placement and
    hardware circuits of all transmitters, and the receiver. Fig. 8 System Design

    environmental sensors that collect data with the help of the Arduino Uno and sent
    it in packet format using LoRa module for transmission to the portrayed receiver
    in Fig. 10. The Arduino Uno found in the reviver stores the collected data in
    variables that are sent by the SIM7000E via a HTTP protocol to the SQL database.

    Receiver Placement and Hardware Circuit Show All SECTION IV. System Software design
    System software design is substantial in the architecture of this work, it elucidates
    the differences between the collected data and other tools inside and outside
    the system. The transmitter units contain all the chosen environmental sensors
    that collect data with the help of the Arduino Uno and sent it in packet format
    using LoRa module for transmission to the above portrayed receiver. A collected
    data in variables tare sent by the SIM7000E via a HTTP protocol to the SQL database.
    Later the gathered data is stored in our administrative tool, PhpMyAdmin, with
    the help of the previously mentioned software XAMPP. Finally, Grafana and RapidMiner
    are linked to the database to monitor the environmental parameters in real time
    and preform supervised machine-learning algorithms on our data sets, respectively
    A virtual machine on Google Cloud platform is created, which offers $300 in free
    credits to be used for multiple services. These steps were followed: after logging
    in, a new VM instance was created named Gradintro, next a Linux Ubuntu 20.04 was
    chosen as an operating system and a machine type was specified to have 2vCPUs
    with 7.5 GB of memory. Finally, basic settings were set that includes allowing
    HTTP and HTTPs for our VM. Since our virtual machine can only be communicated
    with using command lines, a virtual machine window was needed to form a GUI to
    help accessing the files in an easier manner. Our virtual machine window choice
    was NoMachine, a window named GradTerm was created and it was connected to the
    VM through its public IP, \"35.202..40.97\". After setting up the VM, XAMPP, which
    is an open-source web server solution, developed by Apache was downloaded onto
    the VM to enable it to become a local web server. As mentioned before, our data
    is best hosted and saved on a SQL database thus our choice of XAMPP was crucial
    since it offers both a SQL database access and simplicity creating those databases
    through phpMyAdmin. Fig. 11 illustrates the XAMPP software start-up. Fig. 11.
    XAMPP Software Start-up. Show All SECTION V. Machine Learning Analysis A supplementary
    supervised machine-learning prediction model was implemented with the intention
    of providing insight and conducting additional research for the data gathered
    from each agricultural testing space. Machine learning supervised algorithms consists
    of two types, classification and regression. Classification supervised algorithm
    was implemented in RapidMiner. It predicts, identifies and classifies the categorical
    data set, based on experiences or predictions of the algorithm. k-NN, SVM and
    Random Forest are examples used in this project design. Firstly, k-NN is a machine
    learning algorithm which surmises the comparison between the new input data set
    and the current one, hence the output will be predicted into the most comparable
    sets according to the nearest specified k-value. Secondly, SVM is an algorithm
    that practices two cluster classification sets, SVM follows the same procedure
    of classification algorithms, after labeling an input training data set for SVM,
    it will be capable of giving a categorical class. Finally, Random Forest algorithm
    is another learning algorithm utilized in this work, it works by building multiple
    independent decision trees allowing the user to follow the output precisely. It
    is important to point that the predicted outputs in Random Forest algorithms are
    based on labeled data set inputs. Data sets are extracted and imported to a machine-learning
    software where they are analyzed using a predictive model that relies on supervised
    learning algorithms. Fig. 12 shows the designed process built for transmitter
    one data using RapidMiner. The collected data sets were exported directly from
    the database in .csv file format and imported into RapidMiner using the Retrieve
    operator, a Multiply operator was used to input the same data into different Cross
    Validation building blocks. Cross Validation is used to build a model that trains
    and tests the performance of the previously mentioned algorithms. The same process
    design was repeated for transmitter two and three because all transmitters are
    collecting environmental parameters in different agricultural spaces. Fig. 12.
    RapidMiner Design Process. Show All SECTION VI. Results After running the XAMPP
    server on our VM, PhpMyAdmin is accessed to utilize its administrative service
    to create three databases; each database corresponds to a single transmitter previously
    mentioned. Fig. 13 shows the created databases for each transmitter, named testgrad,
    testgrad2, and testgrad3 respectively. In each database, a table is created, the
    tables are named accordingly: testT1, testT2 and testT3. Fig. 13. Transmitter
    (T1) Database Structure. Show All The monitored parameters are collected on the
    receiver end and sent through the SIM7000E via HTTP protocol, to enable the storage
    of these collected parameters a php file needs to be created using php language
    that points to the desired database. Hence, three php files were written named
    temp1, temp2, and temp3 that constitutes the insertion of the parameter variables
    to the above-mentioned databases. As an example, Fig. 14 shows the collected data
    stored in the database, the number of reading is about 1060. Fig. 14. Collected
    Data of Transmitter (T1). Show All Three dashboards in Grafana were created for
    each transmitter to monitor the collected environmental data named T1, T2 and
    T3 as shown in Figure (4) -(18). To connect the previously discussed databases,
    the following configurations settings need to be set. The final resultant Grafana
    dashboards that show the visual monitoring of all the environmental parameters
    for each transmitter is illustrated in Fig. 15. Fig. 15. Grafana Dashboard of
    Transmitter 1,2 &3, respectively Show All Regarding machine learning deployment,
    inside each cross validation building block in Fig. 12, an algorithm model operator
    was applied to the collected data for training purposes, while both Apply Model
    and Performance operator were applied for testing purposes. The Apply Model operator
    employs the connected algorithm model onto the data set; the pperformance operator
    details a list of criteria values for the built model, for instance; accuracy
    and precision with the aim of delivering a plausible interpretation indicator.
    After preforming Random Forest algorithm on our collected data, the best-fit tree
    was chosen according to simplicity. It classifies the data set into \"Optimal\"
    and \"Not Optimal\" based on the most influential environmental parameters that
    affect an agricultural space. It is evident that a humidity value less than 32,
    a temperature value less than 23, and a CO2 level less than 1000 ppm results in
    a \"Not Optimal\" prediction. Any value outside these environmental parameters’
    ranges is considered an \"Optimal\" prediction. Fig. 18. shows the Confusion Matrices
    of all used algorithms in this work, which illustrates the instances between the
    input and the predicted data in terms of accuracy; it is evident that the Random
    Forest algorithm has the highest accuracy due to its straightforward implementation
    and mechanism. Fig. 18. a. Random Forest. b. K-NN. c. SVM Show All SECTION VII.
    Conclusion and Future Work A complete developed design of an environmental tracking
    system using wireless sensor network was successfully implemented. The specified
    environmental parameters are monitored remotely in real time through the means
    of cloud services. An additional machine-learning predictive model was deployed
    that aims to give meaning and further analysis for the collected data of each
    agricultural testing space, the results of the model show high accuracy for each
    algorithm used. A various tools and technologies were discovered throughout the
    implementation of this project. We dealt with LoRa transmission, server set-up
    configuration, SQL databases, different coding languages, Linux operating system,
    and supervised machine-learning algorithms. Finally, in this work, a smart technological
    solution in monitoring various agricultural sites in real time remotely can be
    adopted, thus saving time, economizing costs and allowing fast response to any
    unexpected fluctuation that might occur in the measured environmental parameters.

    IEEE Conference Location: Tamilnadu, India SECTION I. Introduction The term \"Internet
    of Things\" (IoT) simply refers to the set of connections of substantial devices
    that are connected to the cloud. Since every physical object, including sensors,
    is connected to the internet, they can all speak with one another. The straightforward
    concept of creating a network by connecting physical objects to the internet has
    the potential to revolutionize numerous industries. One industry that needs technical
    advancements is agriculture, particularly in nations like India where crop yield
    is substantially lower than what is needed to meet the rising food demand. To
    boost crop yield over the same area of the field, traditional agricultural techniques
    must be upgraded. Using IoT technologies, smart farming is required to help farmers
    increase crop yield because it is a more precise and controlled procedure for
    crops. It can be used in a variety of ways in the agricultural sector, assisting
    farmers in producing more. Precision farming prevents unintended raw material
    waste. According to research, precision farming boosts yields by 40–60%, which
    raises premium prices by 30% and gives farmers the opportunity to live better.
    The size of agriculture as it is now can meet the demand, but there is a lot more
    waste than there should be. For instance, if a farm has the capacity to cultivate
    100 kg of grains per month, it will often only yield 50 or 60 kg of those grains
    [1]. Lacks of information or inappropriate crop growth are the causes of a lower
    yield. Many farmers apply pesticides liberally, irrigate their crops, and harvest
    their crops based on their experience and judgment, which reduces productivity
    SECTION II. Connected Work A. A. IOT-Based Soil Testing Equipment for Use in Agriculture
    The Indian economy is based on agriculture. Farmers will be able to improve their
    farming operations with the introduction of new technologies. Farmers would struggle
    to carry out the cultivation process in an efficient manner without knowledge
    about the characteristics of the soil. Since human labour is used to gather data
    and transport it to labs for testing, the traditional farming approach takes a
    long time to complete. A significant difficulty in farming is managing irrigation
    systems, environmental monitoring, and soil health. IoT is used in to discuss
    a strategy for taking control of these problems. It links irrigation control systems
    and physical sensing equipment to the cloud [2].This aids in architecture analysis.
    Its final findings show that low latency can attenuate real-time data. Agriculture
    has experienced significant setbacks due to migration. The architecture that may
    be applied to diverse precision agriculture applications [3].Their implementation
    has left an impact on three tiers. This design, which is effective, can be utilized
    to create many precision farming systems.. Automatic irrigation is more effective
    than planned irrigation, as demonstrated in the research employing a greenhouse
    environment equipped with a wireless sensor network [4].Water and fertilizer utilization
    are effectively optimized via automatic irrigation. Additionally, it maintains
    the crop''s level of wetness at the same amount as recommended by an agronomist.
    To track temperature and humidity in an agricultural field, the authors of the
    research employ a CC3200 single chip. It takes photographs with a camera and sends
    them wirelessly through a multimedia messaging service to farmers'' mobile devices
    [5]. The advancement of crop harvesting and global production is made possible
    by its application. To analyse and display all of the data that has been gathered
    by the various sensors [6]–[8]. Farmers can make decisions based on the values,
    such as whether to irrigate crops if the percentage of soil moisture is low. The
    system is fairly inexpensive overall, and the sensors it uses are widely accessible.
    Therefore, any farmer can utilize this approach to boost agricultural production
    [9]. The suggested system can yet be enhanced significantly for the model''s future
    evolution [10].This system can be integrated with an alarm or LED to provide warnings
    about changes in temperature, etc. For enhanced functionality, such as PIR sensors
    and wetness sensors for leaves, can be added [11]–[12]. A small drone with a camera
    can be combined with the crop maturity level system to cover a big agricultural
    area and determine. For farmers to be aware of the weather conditions in advance,
    predictive analysis using machine learning algorithms can be used [13]. In order
    to clarify the idea of cloud instrumentation in the horticulture system, the output
    of these sensors is also archived for further study. SECTION III. Agriculture
    Utilizing Utilizing infrared imaging, quality analysis of farm seeds and variation
    of many parameters For agriculture, horticulture, and the generation of seedlings,
    access to very high-quality seeds is crucial [14]–[15]. The performance of the
    plant, pace of seedling emergence, and resistance to biotic and abiotic challenges
    is all influenced by the quality of the seeds.IR cameras with temperature sensors
    have traditionally been utilized in military settings. However, in recent years,
    the door has been opened to a variety of utility due to falling prices, improving
    image quality, and the smaller size of the camera. Research on agriculture is
    very significant. To measure the temperature differential, the Thermal camera
    is being used as much as feasible. They can offer several benefits over picture
    cameras that operate in the visual spectrum, including the capacity to see in
    the dark, robust operation in a variety of lighting conditions, and less invasion
    of privacy, among other things. Tracking Short-Term Single Objects in the temperature
    image is one of the primary issues. The suggested paper explains how to determine
    a seed''s quality. The outcomes of the STSO examination using simulation have
    also been provided. In the proposed study, many edge detection approaches are
    discussed, and the background information needed to comprehend edge detection''s
    fundamentals is given. The methodologies based on Kernel were kept in mind when
    doing the literature review. Finally, Sobel edge detection, which is typically
    employed to identify destination objects, is introduced SECTION IV. For Mixed-Cropping
    Hybrid Smart Irrigation Countries with an agricultural economy struggle with water
    shortages. Water could be overused, which would have an impact on agricultural
    productivity, as a result of poor management of the water distribution system
    and the choice of ineffective irrigation techniques [16]. As a result, these nations''
    economies might suffer significantly. Additionally, there are issues related to
    water scarcity, and farmers suffer financial losses as a result. SECTION V. IoT-Based
    Smart Farming System for Effective Crop Growth An IoT-based farming system is
    referred to as smart agriculture [17].A greater variety and higher quality of
    agricultural goods are produced under this new approach. IoT devices offer details
    about the characteristics of farming fields and then act in response to input
    from the farmer. An sophisticated IoT-based method for tracking the atmosphere
    and soil conditions for productive crop growth is given in this study. SECTION
    VI. IoT-Based Classification Techniques for Crop Yield Prediction and Soil Content
    Analysis Precision farming is made possible by smart agriculture, which is supported
    by IoT.By measuring precise soil properties including soil monitoring, temperature
    and Internet of Things (IoT) technology help improve agriculture by improving
    production. After being collected in cloud storage and using the proper data processes,
    this data allowed us to optimize farming tactics and aid in the development of
    a trend analysis. Thus, we are able to optimize yield by carefully allocating
    resources and directing farming practices. SECTION VII. IOT-Based Soil Testing
    Equipment for Use in Agriculture The Indian economy is based on agriculture. Farmers
    will be able to improve their farming operations with the introduction of new
    technologies. Farmers would struggle to carry out the cultivation process in an
    efficient manner without knowledge about the characteristics of the soil. Since
    human labour is used to gather data and transport it to labs for testing, the
    traditional farming approach takes a long time to complete. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) covers the issues that must be addressed in order to build intelligent agricultural
    methods. SECTION VIII. An Indoor Hydroponic System With Secure Cloud Access Using
    The Things Central Iot Platform Fig 1 IoT-based monitoring system for precision
    agriculture Show All A nation''s growing population and rapid industrial development,
    particularly in urban areas, are factors in a number of urbanization-related problems,
    including housing, food demand, educational and health needs, and poverty, among
    others. Fig 1 A different approach to farming that makes use of small farmsteads
    and abundant crop production is much desired. SECTION IX. Result This farming
    technique Fig 2 and 3 is anticipated to operate more affordably and make it simple
    to keep track of vital Fig 2 IoT-based monitoring based soil temperature monitoring
    system Show All Plantation requirements like water level .The plan and implementation
    of an frequent monitoring system for an internal standing hydroponic organization
    are covered in this essay. To create the system, three key components will be
    planned and created. A. Temperature Sensor: The system''s temperature is sensed
    using the temperature sensor LM35 IC from National Semiconductor. It is an integrated
    circuit sensor having a temperature-proportional electrical reading that can be
    used to gauge temperature. Compared to a thermistor, this sensor aids in temperature
    measurement that is more accurate. B.Nanobiosensors, A modified type of biosensor,
    nanobiosensors have enormous potential in the agriculture industry. This sensor
    is capable of precisely detecting numerous fertilizers, insecticides, and soil
    qualities.Nanobiosensors can be utilized to identify soil illnesses, plant stress,
    and nutrient content C.Pi Raspberry In order to transport data from the user to
    the module, the Raspberry Pi is a chip module that is used to create hardware
    projects. It primarily connects with monitoring sensors and controls an internet
    server directly. Python is the language used in this system and works well with
    the Raspberry Pi for data processing and web creation. However, this module is
    more expensive than the others. However, it can function similarly to other systems
    in terms of monitoring and managing greenhouses. Fig 3 Crop Yield Prediction IoT
    Monitoring System Show All D. Application Agriculture is where the proposed system
    is primarily used. The technology can be used to keep an eye on the water level
    and soil moisture. If the moisture level rises above manually-set limits, extra
    water can be managed into a reservoir for later use. Additionally, it advises
    us to feed fertilizers in accordance with the pH level of the soil. SECTION X.
    Conclusion The features in the agricultural process are improved with the development
    of an efficient crop prediction. The limitations with the traditional soil testing
    process are taken into account when developing the proposed model. Sensors that
    gather data on moisture, pH, temperature, and humidity are utilised in IoT-based
    applications to anticipate the best crop to grow at any given time of year. This
    straightforward experimental setup quickly and accurately gives farmers the information
    they require. Future work should focus on making the kit more portable by adding
    cloud storage capabilities for analysing the already-existing data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    IPSO Sensor Network Coverage Optimization problem Access provided by University
    of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download conference paper PDF 1 Introduction The deployment
    of wireless sensor network nodes is directly related to the performance and life
    of the entire network. The coverage of the network has always been the focus of
    research [1]. The blind zone of node deployment will cause information to be ineffective,
    and too many nodes will cause resources A lot of waste. WSN node coverage algorithms
    are mainly divided into three categories: 1)Coverage optimization based on virtual
    force algorithms. The main idea is to treat nodes as virtual charged particles,
    and then establish corresponding mathematical models to maximize coverage in a
    given area. 2)Geometry-based coverage optimization. The main idea is to complete
    the WSN coverage optimization in a specific scene by establishing a geometrical
    model such as Voronoi or Tyson polygons. 3)Research on node coverage based on
    intelligent optimization algorithms, which mainly optimize network nodes through
    intelligent algorithms, increase the coverage of network nodes, extend the life
    of the network or improve the performance of the network [2]. Aiming at the research
    of intelligent algorithm in WSN node coverage. Hanh et al. proposed the use of
    genetic algorithm to optimize the deployment of sensor network nodes. Compared
    with traditional algorithms, this algorithm can ensure that under a certain coverage
    rate, reduce a certain number of nodes and improve network performance, but its
    convergence speed slower [3]. Ding et al. proposed using an improved particle
    swarm algorithm to optimize WSN nodes, and improve the weight factor of the particle
    swarm algorithm to avoid premature algorithm [4]. Binh et al. proposed the use
    of improved cuckoo algorithm and chaotic pollination algorithm to achieve the
    maximum deployment of network nodes [5]. Beside, a lot of other algorithms were
    proposed to solve numerical optimization [6]. It is necessary to study the network
    node coverage optimization of WSN under different environments and conditions,
    and has important application value. Due to its simple structure and strong robustness,
    particle swarm optimization has been widely used in numerical optimization. However,
    the particle swarm algorithm has problems such as slow convergence speed and easy
    to fall into local optimal solution. Based on various improved particle swarm
    optimization algorithms. In order to improve the performance of the algorithm,
    the shrinkage factor is introduced and the inertia weight factor is improved.
    Experimental results show that its optimization efficiency in wireless sensor
    coverage is due to several other classic intelligent optimization algorithms.
    2 The Problem of Wireless Sensor Network Coverage Optimization In order to facilitate
    the study of coverage issues, based on the node-based perception model, an idealized
    Boolean perception model is adopted. The Boolean perception model is also called
    the 0–1 model, which is a commonly used model in wireless sensor networks, assuming
    that x is a two-dimensional plane A sensor node in, its signal perception radius
    is r, and a circle is drawn with x node as the center of the circle and the radius
    length is r. If the target point y is inside the circle, it will be sensed by
    node x. The specific model diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The mathematical formula
    is: $$ p\\left( {x,y} \\right) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} 1 \\hfill &
    {if\\,\\,d\\left( {x,y} \\right) \\le r} \\hfill \\\\ 0 \\hfill & {otherwise}
    \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (1) where, p(x, y) represents the perception
    probability of node x to node y, and d(x,y) represents the Euclidean distance
    between nodes. Fig. 1. Boolean perception model Full size image In WSN, assuming
    that it is composed of n nodes, the set of all nodes is S = {s1, s2, …, si, …,
    sn}, all sensors have the same structure, and their signal sensing radius is Rs
    And the communication radius is Rc, which satisfies Rc = 2Rs. Assuming that the
    monitoring target is a rectangular area with an area of L·Wm2, in order to facilitate
    calculation, the rectangular area is discretized into L⋅W grids with the same
    area, and all monitoring target points are located at the center of the diagonal
    intersection of the grid. If the distance between the monitoring target point
    and any node is less than or equal to the sensing radius, the monitoring target
    point is considered to be covered by the node. The monitoring node can be expressed
    as M = {m1, m2, …, mj,…, mL⋅W}, and the Euclidean distance between it and the
    signal sensing node is: $$ d\\left( {s_i ,m_j } \\right) = \\sqrt {\\left( {x_i
    - x_j } \\right)^2 + \\left( {y_i - y_j } \\right)^2 } $$ (2) where (xi, yi),
    (xj, yj) represent the coordinates of the nodes si and mj in the plane, respectively.
    The probability that the monitoring target point mj is perceived by the node si
    is defined as: $$ p_{\\text{cov}} \\left( {s_i ,m_j } \\right) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l}
    1 \\hfill & {if\\,\\,d(s_i ,m_j ) \\le R_s } \\hfill \\\\ 0 \\hfill & {otherwise}
    \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (3) Let Sall represent all nodes in the
    monitoring area, and Sall joint perception probability of the target point mj
    is defined as: $$ C_p \\left( {S_{all} ,m_j } \\right) = 1 - \\prod_{i = 1}^n
    {\\left( {1 - p_{\\text{cov}} \\left( {s_i ,m_j } \\right)} \\right)} $$ (4) Calculating
    the joint perception probability of all monitoring target points through the above
    formula, the coverage area is the sum of the joint perception probability of all
    monitoring points, and the coverage rate is: $$ C_r = \\sum_{j = 1}^{L \\cdot
    W} {C_p } \\left( {s_{all} ,m_j } \\right)/L \\cdot W $$ (5) 3 The Improved PSO
    3.1 The Standard PSO Assuming that the particle swarm consists of n particles,
    the i-th particle represents a D-dimensional vector xi= (xi1, xi2…, xiD)T,{i = 1,
    2…, n}, the i-th particle The velocity of the particle vi = (vi1, vi2,…, viD)T.
    The global optimal position experienced by all particles in the population is:
    the individual optimal position is pi = (pi1, pi2,…, piD)T, and the global optimal
    position is pg=(pg1, pg2,…, pgD)T. The particle velocity and position update formula
    in the population is given by [7]: $$ v_{ij} \\left( {t + 1} \\right) = v_{ij}
    \\left( t \\right) + c_1 r_1 \\left( {p_{ij} - x_{ij} \\left( t \\right)} \\right)
    + c_2 r_2 \\left( {p_{gj} - x_{ij} \\left( t \\right)} \\right) $$ (6) $$ x_{ij}
    \\left( {t + 1} \\right) = x_{ij} \\left( t \\right) + v_{ij} \\left( {t + 1}
    \\right) $$ (7) where in formula (6) c1, c2 is the learning factor; r1, r2 are
    the random number between 0 and 1. The flow chart of the standard PSO is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. The flow chart of the standard PSO Full size image 3.2 The
    Improved PSO In order to improve the convergence of the algorithm, the weight
    factor ω is introduced to adjust the speed of the population particles, which
    is beneficial to improve the convergence of the algorithm. The specific formula
    is defined as: $$ v_{ij} \\left( {t + 1} \\right) = v_{ij} \\left( t \\right)
    + \\omega c_1 r_1 \\left( {p_{ij} - x_{ij} \\left( t \\right)} \\right) + c_2
    r_2 \\left( {p_{gj} - x_{ij} \\left( t \\right)} \\right) $$ (8) The inertia weight
    factor ω has an impact on both the local optimization ability and the global optimization
    ability of the particle. Here, the linearly decreasing weight of the inertia weight
    is used: $$ \\omega = \\omega_{\\max } - \\frac{{t\\left( {\\omega_{\\max } -
    \\omega_{\\min } } \\right)}}{{t_{\\max } }} $$ (9) where ωmax, ωmin indicate
    the maximum and minimum values of the inertia weight, ω respectively. t represents
    the current number of iterations; tmax represents the maximum number of iterations.
    To enhance the search ability of the algorithm and reduce the time required to
    complete the iteration, a shrinkage factor is introduced on the basis of formula
    (8), namely: $$ v_{ij} \\left( {t + 1} \\right) = \\delta \\left( {v_{ij} \\left(
    t \\right) + \\omega c_1 r_1 \\left( {p_{ij} - x_{ij} \\left( t \\right)} \\right)
    + c_2 r_2 \\left( {p_{gj} - x_{ij} \\left( t \\right)} \\right)} \\right) $$ (10)
    where δ represents the shrinkage factor and can be explained by: (11) The shrinkage
    factor δ controls the search ability of the particle swarm algorithm. By selecting
    the appropriate value of the shrinkage factor δ, the particle swarm algorithm
    can quickly search and converge, thereby improving the convergence speed of the
    particle swarm algorithm and enhancing the search ability of the algorithm. In
    summary, on the basis of the basic particle swarm optimization algorithm, the
    introduction of linearly decreasing inertia weight and shrinkage factor is beneficial
    to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm, enhance the search ability
    of the algorithm, and improve efficiency. 4 The Experimental Results 4.1 Condition
    Settings The simulation experiment was completed in Matlab2018a environment. Using
    the basic particle swarm algorithm, the firefly algorithm is compared with the
    improved particle swarm algorithm proposed in this paper. The performance of various
    algorithms is evaluated based on the network signal coverage and the convergence
    speed of the algorithm. Due to the randomness of evolutionary algorithms, in the
    experiment, each algorithm was run separately 30 times, and the average value
    was calculated. The algorithm parameters are set as: The parameter values in the
    particle swarm and improved particle swarm algorithm are set as: the number of
    particles, that is, the number of sensor nodes is 100; the acceleration coefficient
    c1 = c2 = 1.2; the firefly algorithm parameters come from the corresponding references.
    4.2 Results and Analysis Setting the sensor node area area A = 100·100 m2, the
    sensor node''s sensing radius R = 6 m, the communication radius is 12 m, and the
    algorithm iterations are 100 times. The experimental results are as follows: After
    initial deployment, the PSO, FA and IPSO are used to optimize the deployment of
    WSN nodes. The deployment of the three algorithms is shown in Fig. 3. It can be
    found that the coverage rate after random initialization is 79.8%, the coverage
    rate obtained by FA, PSO and IPSO is 85.8%, 87.3%, and 88.1%, respectively. The
    signal coverage rate after algorithm optimization has been significantly improved,
    and the optimization effect of IPSO algorithm is the best. Fig. 3. The deployment
    of WSN Full size image Figure 4 shows the curves of the three algorithms with
    the number of iterations when WSN is deployed in a barrier-free environment. The
    curve of standard PSO and Firefly algorithm is relatively flat, while the coverage
    rate of improved PSO algorithm changes quickly with iteration. Since both PSO
    and Firefly algorithms are evolutionary algorithms, there is a lot of room for
    improvement to IPSO. Fig. 4. The convergence curve of each algorithm Full size
    image 5 Conclusion To solve the problem of optimal deployment of wireless sensor
    network nodes, in this paper, an improved PSO algorithm is proposed. The contraction
    factor is introduced to make the PSO algorithm search quickly and converge quickly.
    These strategies effectively enhance the optimization ability of PSO algorithm,
    and further enhance the convergence performance of the improved PSO algorithm.
    In the experiments, three algorithms are used to optimize the node deployment
    of wireless sensor network under barrier free conditions. The experimental results
    show that the evolutionary effect of the improved PSO algorithm is the most ideal
    among all the algorithms. References Singh, B., Lobiyal, D.K.: Energy-aware cluster

    Agriculture still remains on the main sources of income for developing countries
    like Sri Lanka. Over 25% of the work force in Sri Lanka is engaged in the agricultural
    sector [1]-[3]. Developing technologies in the fields of wireless connectivity
    and machine learning have given rise to new ways of managing agriculture and optimizing
    the processors, with maximizing the yields and reducing production costs. Precision
    agriculture delivers the means of observing the environmental features of the
    area, assessing and predicting the inputs needed for the short-term and long term
    in the future. In order to improve the crop yields and by extension agricultural
    production of the country, the gathered information and the prediction reached
    by the computer simulations can be delivered to the farmer to adjust the input
    to the plantations and take better care of the crops. In the long term this could
    save a large amount of money, since the inputs to the plants are precisely controlled
    and the wastage and over use can be drastically reduced. Another aspect of this
    implementation is for horticultural nurseries. Horticulture uses the knowledge
    of growing plants to intensively produce plants. The process is done not only
    to generate food, but mostly to propagate ornamental and flowering plants. In
    a market like Sri Lanka, the horticultural industry accounts for 20% of the total
    agricultural output of the country [4], [5]. It can be seen as very lucrative
    emerging market mainly for exportation. One important aspect of this paper is
    introducing a suitable forecasting model for forecasting soil moisture content
    by several steps based on the captured data of the moisture sensor itself. The
    experiment data includes moisture content captured within 18 days in October 2019
    with 1351 samples (sample rate of about 10 minutes) at Boralanda town in Sri Lanka.
    The data set is then shown to be non-stationary, where trend and seasonality components
    exist. A stationary series is a series where its mean and variance don’t change
    over time and covariance function is not a function of time. A trend makes a series
    become non-stationary by adding an increasing or decreasing trend component, which
    changes the mean overtime. Also, seasonality is present when there is a repeated
    pattern in a same time period while the other time periods don’t include the pattern,
    which changes the mean and variance overtime [6]. We will overcome these problems
    by introducing and comparing two different forecasting model – Seasonal Autoregressive
    Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
    [7]. SARIMA is a well-known and simple forecasting model that takes cares of both
    non-seasonal and seasonal components in a series. LTSM is a prevailing neural
    network structure that can be used to fit sequential data and a high degree of
    complexity [8]. The paper presents the observation and modelling of the environmental
    conditions in a controlled green house. The main focus has been analysis of soil
    moisture in the plant pots. Section II-precision agricultural systems; is an in-depth
    explanation on the different stages in a general precision agricultural system.
    Section III-data gathering electronics; will give a briefing on the electronics
    behind the data gathering process. Section IV-forecasting models; introduces the
    machine learning algorithms and software used to create the predictive model.
    Section IV will be an explanation of the model generated. Section V presents the
    results of this experiment and the advantages of using such a system. Finally,
    Section V would be the conclusions and future work. SECTION II. Precision agricultural
    systems This application of wireless networks that measure environmental conditions
    for automated control of resources or predicting and/or estimating the approximate
    depletion time of resources is known as precision agriculture [9]. Furthermore,
    this concept expands as, to create an maintain a complex system, typically controlled
    through electronic computation for adjusting resources and nutrients in the soil
    to attune to a specific composure suited for a plant variety [10]. The stages
    of precision agricultural system can be described as follows [11]. The initial
    and most important step of setting up a precision agricultural infrastructure
    is locating the wireless sensor network. The sensor nodes will act as the feelers
    in the system to gauge in sudden changes in environmental conditions. These sensors
    are used to measure vital information such as [12], [13]; soil moisture, pH level
    of soil, air temperature (if within a greenhouse), humidity, sunlight levels,
    etc. the next stage of the infrastructure is the data gather and accumulation.
    The data gathering includes the gauged parameter as well as the location of the
    sensing instrument. This data is transferred to a local route to then be recorded
    on a server. Finally, control decisions are made by humans or artificial intelligence
    based on the sensor data [14]. SECTION III. Data gathreing electronics One of
    the major issues in this application of IoT (Internet of Things) is the maintenance
    of the sensor network and electronics. Two challenges in managing the electronics
    are; exposure of physical components to harsh environmental conditions, and the
    battery life of nodes. Since the sensors need to be in physical contact with the
    elements to obtain readings, their internal components should be shelled for damage.
    Ultimately, this is a role that is passed on to the manufacturer. Secondly, the
    nodes/sensor modules are required to operate with minimum interaction or maintenance
    by the humans. Typically, the deployment of such networks is vast and covers a
    large area. Therefore, the number of planted nodes could easily reach up to hundreds.
    In such an installation, retrieval of nodes for periodic maintenance such as battery
    recharging would be cumbersome. Therefore, optimization for energy efficiency
    is of the utmost importance. [15], has conducted their own research as well as
    presented past research on the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks
    designed for agricultural purposes. Accordingly, the devices transmit data to
    the routed periodically. In the meantime, in between transmissions, the electronics
    are forced into a sleeping mode so the current draw off the battery is low (in
    microampere range) [16], [17]. For reference, the data gathering instruments used
    in this research record and transmit data every 10 minutes. During test the electronics
    system only drew 56 microamperes during forced sleep mode. One single node in
    this implementation has enough energy to run for approximately one year without
    recharging. This is not to say that unexpected maintenance issues will not arise.
    A. Embedded Hardware design In this specific application we have adopted a simple
    embedded system with a microcontroller attached to wireless communication module
    for data transmission and a capacitive soil moisture sensor for gather information
    on the moisture level on the soil as shown in the Fig. 1. The data measured by
    the soil sensor is converted internally in the MCU to a percentage moisture value.
    The moisture within any sample will not drop significantly, instead it will gradually
    decease under natural conditions. Therefore, multiple reading for one sample is
    not required. The NRF24 wireless communications module was selected to transmit
    the data from the node to the router placed within each green house. The module
    and their communication protocol were selected for its capability to transmit
    the data packages securely while also consuming a very low amount of power. The
    gathered data within each green house is transmitted by the router to the cloud
    over Wifi/ethernet, where it was subjected to the following analysis as described
    on this paper. Fig. 1 Embedded hardware system Show All SECTION IV. Forecasting
    Models A. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Seasonal Autoregressive
    Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), an extended version of ARIMA, is one of the
    most popular forecasting methods for univariate time series data. ARIMA, while
    having the capability to deal with trend components of data, lacks the consideration
    of seasonal components in its own algorithm. SARIMA expands its capability by
    adding autoregression (AR), differencing (I) and moving average (MA) for seasonal
    components as part of its equation. Here, the autoregression (AR) model is the
    regression of time-series values to itself. In particular, the concurrent values
    of the series is considered to depend on its previous values, called lags. The
    maximum lag is denoted as p. The initial value of p is determined by using a partial
    auto-correlation function (PACF) plot. The Moving Average (MA) model presents
    the error of time series, with the argument that the current value of error also
    depends on some of its own lag, referred to as q. The initial value of q can be
    determined using an auto-correlation function (ACF) plot. Finally, I is the order
    of integration, which is the number of non-seasonal differences needed to make
    the time series become stationary [7]. The general model is denoted as SARIMA
    (p, d, q) • (P, D, Q)S, where: p, d, q are AR, I and MA orders of trend elements,
    respectively; P, D, Q are AR, I and MA orders of seasonal elements, respectively.
    In 1970, Box and Jenkins introduced a multiplicative model of SARIMA, provided
    in [18]. ϕ p (B) Φ P ( B s ) ∇ d ∇ D s X t = θ q (B) Θ Q ( B s ) ∈ t (1) View

    are presented as the polynomials ϕp(B) and θq(B) of the order p and q, respectively.

    = 1,2,3 …, n) and ∈t is residual at time t The approach of Box and Jenkins requires
    four phases [19]: Model identification. This phase involves analyzing and verifying
    the stationarity of the time series using various methods. There methods can be
    using ACF and PACF plots; Mann-Kendall trend test; unit root test. In addition,
    the type of the model (non-seasonal or seasonal) and its orders (p, q, P, Q) are
    determined using ACF and PACF plots, as discussed. Model Estimation. This phase
    involves reviewing the model (as well as its orders) defined in previous phase
    and using a common error metric to determine the best one. Some popular error
    metrics are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) MAE= ∑∣error∣
    n RMSE= ∑ (error) 2 n − − − − − − − − − √ (8) (9) View Source Model Diagnostic.
    This phase uses the ACF and PACF plots of residuals to check if the residuals
    follow white noise or not. If it doesn’t, we need to choose another model. Model
    Forecasting and evaluation. This last phase involves using the model to forecast
    the future outcome. Moreover, testing data can be used to verify the performance
    of the model using suitable error criteria (MAD or MSE). Four phases are iterated
    until a satisfactory model is achieved. B. Long-short Term Memory Neural Network
    Recurrent neural network (RNN) is an artificial neural network architecture specialized
    for sequential data such as handwriting, speech etc. Therefore, it is capable
    of handling time-series data as well. Here is the general structure of RNN We
    can observe that the network feedback to itself at each time step. Hence, it can
    be unfolded as multi layers feed forward neural network. The formula for hidden
    state st of network and its output yt are given in [20] s t =f(U x t +W s t−1
    ) y t =g(V s t ) (10) (11) View Source Fig. 2 shows xt as the input to the system
    at time t, st is the hidden state of the cell at time t, which is stands for memory
    of the network; f is an activation function for the hidden state (tanh or ReLU);
    U,V,W are parameters of network, which is shared across all time steps; yt is
    the output of the network at time t and g is its activation function (SoftMax
    function). Fig. 2 - Recurrent Neural Network Show All It can be observed that
    with such an enormous number of layers as the number of input increases, the gradients
    propagate all the way back to initial values will either suffer from vanishing
    gradients or exploding gradient. In particular, the deeper of the layers, the
    more matrix multiplications have to be applied because of the chain rule. Therefore,
    if they are small, the The gradient will shrink exponentially to an extremely
    small value, such that the model cannot learn more. This phenomenon is called
    vanishing gradient. On other hand, if they are large, the gradients get exponentially
    larger and eventually crash the model. This phenomenon is called zn exploding
    gradient. Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network solves these problems by
    introducing the concept of using different activation function layers called “gates”
    [8]. The proposed structure of one cell of LSTM is given as [21] (Fig. 3). In
    Fig. 3 showing one cell of LTSM, xt is current input at time t; ht−1 and ct−1
    are the previous cell output and state, respectively; ht and ct are previous cell
    output and state, respectively. ft is the forget gate. This sigmoid layer determines
    which data is irrelevant and should be forgotten. It takes xt and ht−1 as input
    and give Boolean value as output for each piece of information (0 is giving up
    the information while 1 is keeping the information) f t =σ( x t ∗ U f + h t−1
    ∗ W f ) (12) View Source it is the input gate. This sigmoid layer determines which
    new data is to be written to cell state. Similar to the forget gate, its outputs
    are Boolean values that decide which piece of new information should be written
    i t =σ( x t ∗ U i + h t−1 ∗ W i ) (13) View Source C ¯ t is the candidate gate.

    Results A. Development of SARIMA model The data set consists of 1351 data points
    of moisture content (percentage) of the soil within the greenhouses located in
    Boralanda town in Sri Lanka with a sample rate of 10 minutes. As we have 6 observations
    per hour and one day (24 hours) is a full cycle, the frequency that we choose
    to decompose the data into addictive components is 144 (6 multiplied with 24)
    and shown on Fig. 4. Here, we can observe the presence of trending and seasonality
    in the data. Hence the data shows strong correlation to each other as in Fig.
    5 and is non-stationary. This implies that the current data set is inappropriate
    since a linear model like SARIMA requires the observations to be independent [19].
    We also deduced the ACF and PACF plots of the original data in Fig. 5 and Fig.
    6. Fig. 4 Decomposed addictive components Show All In order to make the data stationary,
    the first seasonal difference was taken, as shown on Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Fig. 5
    - ACF of original data Show All Fig. 6 PACF of original data Show All Fig. 7 -
    ACF of D=1 Show All Fig. 8 PACF of D=1 Show All We can observe that after the
    first seasonal difference, there is a very little correlation between the data.
    Thus, the series is considered to be stationary. In the ACF plot, the positive
    significant spikes at lag 1 and 3 suggest a non-seasonal MA(2) component, and
    two negative significant spikes at lag 25 and 26 might suggest a seasonal MA(2)
    component. Also, in PACF plot, the positive significant spikes at lag 1 and 3
    suggest a non-seasonal AR(2) and the negative significant spikes at lag 25 suggest
    a seasonal AR(1) component. Consequently, our final model for SARIMA is: (2, 0,
    2) • (1, 1,2)2. After this, the SARIMA model will be trained with the original
    data. B. Development of LSTM model The training of the LSTM model involves the
    following steps: Difference the series. As discussed, a stationary series is very
    easy to predict and fit well in training model. The difference series is performed
    with one lag, similar to SARIMA. Also, this implementation is used to facilitate
    overfitting due to the correlation between the data. Scale the data. The data
    will be scaled down to the range from −1 to 1 in order to achieve fast convergence.
    Train the model with training data. Here, 4 neurons are used for LTSM network
    with a batch size of 1. The training iteration is chosen as 30. Predict the next
    steps with inversed scaling and inversed difference. After training the model,
    we use it to predict the next steps where the predicted value will be used to
    predict the next step. Also, we need to scale back the predicted data to its intended
    value and apply back the non-stationarity. C. Forecasting results and discussion
    The results of two model with 48-step prediction for a duration of 8 hours are
    given in Fig. 9. The output prediction of the models compared to the raw test
    data is discussed with the corresponding inputs to the system. Table 1 gives the
    RMSE and the MAE values of the two compared networks to the original raw data.
    Table 1 RMSE and MAE of forecasting model Fig. 9 Comparison of SARIMA and LSTM
    network in forecasting moisture data Show All Although, two models exhibit a fairly
    small amount of error, compared with SARIMA, LTSM network performs significantly
    better for our data set of humidity with a much smaller RMSE and MAE. Therefore,
    we choose to use LTSM in forecasting the content of moisture. The graph proves
    how close the LSTM Network follows the raw data compared to the SRIMA Network.
    Even at sudden changes, for example around 15-time index (which corresponds to
    the period of excessive evaporation in the morning), the LSTM Network prediction
    is acceptably accurate. Whereas, the SARIME Network shows a significant deviation
    from the real case. SECTION VI. Conclusion and Furture Work In conclusion, we
    have tested two different networks for forecasting the required data for a selected
    amount of time. We have successfully defined and compared two forecasting models:
    SARIMA and LTSM. By observing the results, it is evident that the LTSM network
    is much more versatile and performs outstandingly better than the controlled network.
    Due to lower error in predicting many time steps ahead, LTSM is considered to
    be more suitable for our model. For future work, the models can and will be expanded
    for multiple parameter analysis. The correlations of humidity, sunlight, air temperature
    and weather forecasts with soil moisture can be taken into account in the future.
    The collection of larger sets of data and different combinations of SAMRIMA would
    potentially lead to the discovery of better models to predict resource availability
    and requirements for the plant ahead of time. By precise control of the inputs
    needed for the plant growth, the cost due to wastage can be significantly reduced,
    and by extension, lift the financial burden on the farmers and planters of Sri
    Lanka. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Development

    NV, USA SECTION I. Introduction Analysts have recognized the fish and seafood
    sector as a key component of Bangladesh''s economic development because the country
    is predominantl y rural. The agriculture and aquaculture industries are vital
    to Bangladesh''s econ-omy which generate millions of jobs as well as consistent
    international export profits. Bangladesh was the world''s fifth-largest aquaculture
    producer in 2018 and this industry is likely to expand in the next few years.
    Bangladesh is expected to go from low-income to lower-middle-income status within
    the next seven years, according to economists; aquaculture exports will playa
    key part in this transformation. Aquaculture production has increased threefold
    since 2000, owing in part to technological developments and producer-friendly
    legislation [1]. Furthermore, agriculture is an important industry in increasing
    Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is critical in defining a country''s economic
    performance whether developed or developing. Because of important raw materials
    are derived from the farm, it is the backbone of agro-based industrial products.
    As a result of our country''s unequal rainfall distribution, several difficulties
    to farming situations is appeared. Crop development and efficient fish growth
    are limited by a lack of rainfall and inconsistent feeding applications during
    specific months of the year, resulting in a drop in the contribution of foreign
    exchange to the economy. Severe unseasonal rainfall, fast temperature swings,
    insufficient water quality control, and growing an unstable atmosphere for the
    development of numerous insects can be sabotage for rice and fish farms. To address
    these problems, various old technologies have been adopted, but they require a
    lot of people, so the investment is negligible every time. For this reason, the
    most cost-effective and efficient solution to the problems will be an automated
    method. Due to the uneven distribution of rainfall, it is physically hard for
    a farmer to maintain effective water quality and an optimum temperature level
    for efficient rice and fish production. As a result, a sophisticated integrated
    rice and fish production infrastructure is necessary to deliver water efficiently
    across the entire farm land for increased output [2]. IoT is a notion that first
    originated roughly 20 years ago and is currently generating headlines all over
    the world. We are able to continue with IoT because everyone talks about connectivity,
    smart gadgets, and real-time data extraction. About 35 billion IoT devices is
    installed globally by 2021. In 2021, 46 billion gadgets is already linked with
    IoT [3]. Fig. 1 depicts the different internet-connected devices that support
    IoT. Fig. 1. Different internet-connected devices that support iot Show All Fig.
    2. Iot skeleton which connects people, places, and things to the internet Show
    All IoT is a network that support devices for computing, digital as well as mechanical
    gear these are used by humans or animals and objects that can be perceived, collected,
    and transmitted data over the internet without human interaction. It has changed
    the society in which we now live. Smart cities, automobiles, and houses might
    all are connected to the IoT. Agriculture, business, healthcare, transportation,
    and logistics are all possible applications. The use of cloud computing in the
    IoT platform allows data collection from devices to be preserved on dependable
    storage servers. Fig. 2 depicts the IoT skeleton which connects people, places,
    and things to the internet. On a daily basis, the global temperature and population
    are rising. As the world''s population is expanded, the more amount of food is
    needed. Weather, climatic change, and vari-ous environmental factors, such as
    temperature, water level, water quality, efficient water quality maintenance,
    fertilizer applied quantity, and so on, are all affected to farming techniques.
    Agriculture and aquaculture are the backbone of most developing countries'' economies.
    Farmers in several parts of the world are facing substantial farming issues as
    a result of seasonal climate change. Excessive water due to extraordinary rainfall
    or a scarcity of water and incerased temperatures due to extreme sunlight has
    a significant impact on integrated rice and fish production. Furthermore, due
    to an excess or lack of efficient water level and quantity, farming has experienced
    unusual growth. Smart water management, the administration of the appropriate
    amount of fertilizer, and integrated rice-fish farming field shedding, temperature,
    and water level variations are all that is required to remedy the above mentioned
    issue. To address the issues, it is critical to improve an intelligent integrated
    rice-fish farming process that can effectively notify the user or farmer of water
    management events, such as water supply or drainage, water quality maintenance
    in different seasons, water level in the farming fields, appropriate fish food
    supply, and fertilizer quantity applied in terms of pH level, water quality, and
    farming field shedding based on weather conditions. To overcome these issues,
    we employed wireless sensor networks and environmental data to develop an intelligent
    system. Wireless sensor networks also known as a wireless sensor and actuator
    networks where different sensors are distributed to monitor environmental and
    physical factors including sound, pressure, and temperature. This sys- tem consists
    of a gateway that connects throughout the world and scattered nodes that can send
    data via the network to a central location. The sensor activity is enabled by
    current networks, which are bidirectional in nature. Our research provides a significant
    contribution by developing an intelligent integrated rice-fish farming framework
    based onl IoT and cloud computing technology that sends automated signals concerning
    effective water management, proper water quality maintenance, and shedding of
    farming fields. Mobile SMS, email, website notification, and LED status will be
    used to notify the user. We also developed a website named DWIFS that can provide
    sensor data to users. Users can access those sensor''s data from anywhere and
    take proper decisions to maintain integrated rice-fish farms. We also monitor
    5 rice-fish farm at the same time by using our website. To our knowledge, no research
    has looked into an intelligent integrated rice-fish farming system that is proposed
    based on efficient water man-agement, appropriate water quality maintenance, and
    farming field shedding with sufficient time, where an IoT-based cloud solution
    is combined with dynamic website notification. The following association is how
    the rest of the paper is organized: Similar work in a variety of related disciplines
    is discussed in Section II Section III depicts an IoT cloud-based rice- fish farming
    with integrated techniques. The skeleton of our developed rice-fish farming with
    integrated techniques is discussed in Section IV. The schematic circuit diagram
    for the environmental parameter monitoring device that we built, as well as the
    seven-day notification result, are both included in Section V. The paper comes
    to a close with Section VI. SECTION II. Related Work The water controller''s major
    responsibility is to detect and depict the amount of water in the field. Water
    is distributed through a network system using pumps, pipes, sprinklers, and valves.
    Sprinklers are used in a range of environments, including industrial, commercial,
    residential, and agricultural [4]. Chen and his colleagues advocated that IoT
    deployment be done in the fish farming industry as well as in the city. Water
    temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and water level were used to construct an IoT
    intelligent system for fish farming in this paper [5]. Channe et al. suggested
    an IoT-based transdisci-plinary precision agricultural model. As examples of potential
    applications for their approaches, they listed online agriculture data analysis,
    agricultural cloud, agribusiness, soil and weather analysis and forecasting, as
    well as a mobile app for farmers, merchants, and government officials [6]. The
    study presents a real-time monitoring and controlling system for aquaculture based
    on the concept of cloud integration. The system may create the IFTTT (if this,
    then that) rules for the optimal water state for the pond in [7] using the web
    and Android applications. Kiani et al. demonstrated an IoT-based small farm mon-itoring
    system that measures temperature and humidity in order to plan farming and horticulture
    more efficiently [8]. For efficient water distribution and management, Karpagam
    et al. presented an IoT-enabled intelligent irrigation system. Fig. 3. The basic
    skeleton of wireless sensor network Show All With minimal human intervention,
    their method checks the water level in the field and supplies water as needed
    [9]. Meethongjan and colleagues proposed a project to develop a mobile application
    for controlling the aquarium''s water system using IoT technologies and an Android
    browser. As a result, their aquarium fish and fish farmer group profited, which
    helps their community financially. In addition, their smartphone application can
    be used by other agricultural farms as a model [10]. Lee et al. proposed the IoT
    and cloud computing can be leveraged. To demonstrate agriculture and environmental
    monitoring as a service on the cloud using augmented reality. According to this
    article, the Cloud Computing paradigm is a perfect fit for IoT applications [11].
    Finally, Maswood et al. represents an intelligent IoT based weather monitoring
    system using smart umbrella [12]. SECTION III. Iot Cloud-Based Intelligent Integrated
    Rice-Fish Farming System A. Wireless Sensor Networks for Environmental Data Collection
    The greatest issue in the twenty-first century is feeding the world, especially
    for clever farm enterprises. The farm used an agriculture automation system instead
    of traditional agriculture. Our research''s major goal is to come up with a long-term,
    sustainable solution for integrated rice-fish farming and agricultural automation.
    As a result, we created a website controlled portable measurement device for effective
    water management, water quality management, temperature, water level, and pH level
    sensors for gathering environmental data and managing integrated rice-fish farming
    systems. The purpose of this experiment is to find better ways to use an autonomous
    system to govern an intelligent agricultural system. In order to regulate a farming
    system, we also developed a wireless sensor network communication technology for
    collecting environmental data and delivering control signals to turn on or off
    devices [13]. By persuading agriculture monitoring is a new WSN''s application
    feature, it can be utilized for monitoring, sensing, and controlling the amount
    of pesticides used in large agricultural fields, monitoring crop, soil, and climate
    factors [14]. B. Data Monitoring with Wireless Sensor With the use of wireless
    sensor networks and sensed data, the IoT can accurately control the humidity and
    temperature of plants. Because of the variable air circumstances, atmospheric
    conditions may differ from one location to the next, making consistency difficult
    to maintain throughout the fish farm. A suggested IoT and cloud-based integrated
    rice-fish farming system could be allowed for regular environmental conditions
    to be maintained. Our research''s main purpose is to develop an intelligent monitoring
    system for the agricultural environment that includes temperature, humidity, pH,
    water level, and other potentially essential characteristics. The goal of this
    study is to investigate a remote monitoring system for effective water management
    and water quality control. This node wirelessly transmits data to a central server,
    which collects, stores, and analyzes the information before presenting it and
    delivering it to the client mobile [12]. Fig. 3 depicts the structure of wireless
    sensor networks. Temperature, humidity, and other sensor readings are automatically
    monitored by the environmental monitoring sensors. The monitored data from the
    sensors can be accessed remotely by the user. A block diagram of our intelligent
    integrated farm surveillance system that connects with different sensors is shown
    in Fig. 4 [15]. Fig. 4. Iot connected sensors are represented through block diagrams
    [15] Show All 1) Humidity Sensor A humidity sensor detects, measures, and reports
    both moisture and air temperature (or hygrometer). The purpose of a humidity sensor
    is to detect changes in electrical currents and air temperature. Humidity sensors
    are used to determine the moisture content; 2) Temperature Sensor Electrical impulses
    from a temper- ature sensor are used to calculate temperature values. When they
    detect a temperature change, the sensor is made up of two metals that produce
    electrical voltage or resistance; 3) Water Level Sensor The amount of chemicals
    that can flow is detected using water level sensors. Liquids, slurries, granular
    materials, and powders are examples of such items. Water levels can be measured
    in containers or at the surface of a river or lake; 4) Turbidity Sensor As the
    amount of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water grows, a turbidity sensor
    is used to measure the turbidity level (and cloudiness or haziness) of the water.
    Turbidity sensors measure how much light is scattered by suspended objects in
    water: 5) Ph Sensor A pH sensor is one of the most impor- tant tools for water
    analysis. This sort of sensor can detect alkalinity and acidity levels in water
    and other liquids. pH sensors, when utilized correctly, can ensure a product''s
    safety and quality; Fig. 5. A proposed model for intelligent integrated farming
    systems [16] Show All 6) Do Sensor This dissolved oxygen meter is used to determine
    the amount of dissolved oxygen in water and thus the water quality. It is commonly
    used to determine water quality in a variety of situations. SECTION IV. The Skeleton
    of Our Developed Intelligent Integrated Rice-Fish Farming System A. Proposed Model
    for Integrated Intelligent Farming System Figure 5 depicts an intelligent, integrated
    rice-fish farm monitoring system based on the IoT concept. The parameters for
    efficient water management and water quality control in the form of supply and
    drainage water are shown in Tier 1 of Fig. 5. Tier 1 also applies to sensor equipment,
    with each sensing and sensitivity range is being regulated and operated separately.
    Tier 2 stores data on an IoT cloud server and makes decisions based on a threshold
    value. Between Tier 1 and Tier 2, the necessary threshold value and duration for
    taking suitable action is analyzed based on sensing data. Tier 2 is in charge
    of data processing, acquisition, and decision-making from sensor devices. The
    third tier is the application level. The sensed data is analyzed and saved on
    the DWIFS and IoT cloud servers. The data can be viewed on mobile phones, laptops,
    and other devices [16]. DWIFS is the designed website''s appearance. For designing
    a readable website, it requires efficient coding. Our website provides sensors
    data such as humidity, temperature, water level, pH level, dissolved oxygen level,
    and water quality. These websites can also send weather notifications to users
    via the IoT. It has a storage section where you may keep photos, paragraphs, and
    the table of contents. Initially, a website called DWIFS [13] was constructed
    using Javascript and CSS. The pages, themes, and posts are then edited using the
    Dashboard. After that, various sensors sensed weather-related data are placed
    automatically into the form of Table I by utilizing Table Press. Fig. 6 displays
    the home page of our developed website for monitoring an integrated farming system.
    Figure 7 depicts the proposed IoT-based cloud solution for the intelligent integrated
    rice-fish farming system design. We used a range of sensors to capture meteorological
    data from the aquaculture and agricultural fields, including temperature, humidity,
    water level, pH level, dissolved oxygen level, and turbidity. A WSN was built,
    and the data sensed by the sensors is collected by a WSN gateway node. The sensed
    data is sent from the WSN access point to the DWIFS server and the IoT cloud server.
    End users of our intelligent farming system will be able to make intelligent farming
    decisions using data from the DWIFS server and the IoT cloud server from anywhere
    on the earth. Fig. 6. The home page of our developed website for monitoring an
    integrated farming system Show All Fig. 7. The architecture of the proposed iot

    Proposed water quality and water level management flowchart Show All B. Proposed
    Algorithm for Intelligent Integrated Process Figure 8 depicts the flow chart that
    we use for intelligent water level management by analyzing water level sensor
    sensed data. If the water level is medium, then the white LED is ON and there
    is no need to supply or drain water to the fish- farm field. Moreover, if the
    water level is low, the green LED is ON and immediately needs to supply water
    to the fish-farm field. Again, if the water level is high, it is necessary to
    drain water from the fish-farm field. On the other hand, if the turbidity level
    is below 45.75%, then the white LED is ON. It indicates that water quality is
    satisfactory and there is no need to filter water or supply new water. Furthermore,
    if the turbidity level is higher than 45.75 %, then the blue LED is ON. It is
    needed to filter the field water. Fig. 9. Flowchart for monitoring rice-fish growth
    in an integrated farming Show All Fig. 10. Proposed flow chart for shedding application
    Show All Figure 9 represents the flow chart that we use for intelligent rice and
    fish growth monitoring by analyzing dissolved oxygen level and pH level. From
    the pH sensor and dissolved oxygen sensor''s data, we determine that if the pH
    level is between 6.8 to 7.2, the white LED will illuminate, indicating that fish
    growth is satisfactory and no additional food or fertilizer is required. Again,
    if the pH level is lower than the above mentioned value then orange LED is ON
    and fish growth level is not satisfactory as well as we need to apply the necessary
    food or fertilizer. The same manner will be applied to rice-farming. On the other
    hand, if the dissolved oxygen level is somewhere between 2.5 to 3.5, there is
    satisfactory growth and there is no need to monitor growth. Again, if the dissolved
    oxygen level is lower than the above mentioned value then yellow LED is ON. That''s
    why, it is necessary to take steps for growth monitoring. Figure 10 depicts the
    flow chart that we apply shadding based on temperature and humidity sensor''s
    data. Based on the sensor''s data, users will be notified about the importance
    of applying shedding in terms of time frame. The red LED will turn ON later if
    the temperature is higher than 45°C and the humidity is lower than 33%, and the
    user will be notified to provide shade for fish-farm fields promptly. If the temperature
    is below 45°C and the humidity is lower than 33%, the white LED will turn ON,
    and there will be no need to offer shade for fish-farm fields. Fig. 11 depicts
    the overall work procedure using block diagrams. SECTION V. Results and Discussion
    The Schematic circuit diagram of our planned intelligent Integrated rice-fish
    farm system''s hardware connections is shown in Fig. 12. Our implemented sensor''s
    sensed data from farm-1 which is collected from DWIFS server and IoT cloud server
    are stored in Table I. From the first row of the table, the temperature, humidity,
    pH, Dissolve Oxygen, water level, and turbidity read from the website and IoT
    cloud server for farm-1 are 28°C, 50%, 6.9, 3.1, Mid, and 45.1 %. That is depicted
    in Table I. As there are no values lower than threshold, so the turning condition
    of red, orange, yellow, green, and blue LEDs is not satisfied and they remain
    OFF, where all white LEDs associated with red, orange, yellow, green, and blue
    LEDs satisfy the condition and remain ON. This indicates that it is a good day.
    On the next day, the temperature, humidity, pH, Dissolve Oxygen, water level,
    and turbidity were observed. In this case, the temperature, humidity, pH, Dissolve
    Oxygen, and turbidity are lower than threshold value, so the condition of turning
    ON red, orange, yellow, and blue LEDs are not satisfied where the water level
    is higher than the threshold value, so the condition of turning on green LED is
    satisfied. Therefore, the red, orange, yellow, and blue LEDs are turned OFF while
    the green LED remains ON. The person would be notified that, it needs to be water
    drained. Similarly, on the third day, the temperature, humidity, Dissolve Oxygen,
    and water level are lower than the threshold value, so the turning condition of
    red, yellow, and green is not satisfied and they remain OFF, where all white LEDs
    associated with red, yellow, and green LEDs satisfy the condition and remain ON.
    On the same day, the pH is below and turbidity is higher than the predefined value.
    Therefore, the orange and blue LEDs remain ON and both white LEDs associated with
    the blue and yellow LEDs remain OFF. This assembled LED status can clearly disclose
    to the user that it is needed to Adjust pH & Water Filter. Other information for
    7 days monitoring of intelligent irrigation processes for farm-l are tabulated
    in Table I. Similarly, all sensor''s sensed information from other fish- farms
    are associated in DWIFS and notify the user via LED, SMS, and Email. Fig. 11.

    our IoT-based intelligent inte-grated system measures water turbidity, water level,
    pH level, dissolved oxygen level, and climatic variables using field-deployed
    sensors. The wireless sensor network is the first module of our proposed intelligent
    integrated rice-fish farming solution, and it collects sensors'' perceived information
    through a WSN gateway. The detected data is sent to the DWIFS and IoT cloud servers
    for efficient decision-making based on specified values. The user can obtain farming
    field information via DWIFS and the IoT cloud server in the form of SMS and email
    from anywhere on the globe for intelligent fish farm monitoring. The system''s
    design will benefit users. It brings down the cost of integrated farming while
    speeding up production. We intend to use a machine learning (ML) approach to analyze
    vast amounts of farmed field monitoring data in the future. Furthermore, we want
    to release an Android app that will allow customers to remotely view output data
    from their mobile phones. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Today’s agriculture-based technology has been very successfully in meeting the
    growing demand for food by the world’s population especially in hydroponic plant.
    This mainly due to the advanced implementation of technologies in the agriculture
    especially the construction of the monitoring systems that use sensors to keep
    track on the growth of the hydroponic plants [1]. Smart agriculture monitoring
    based in wireless sensor network and IoT can reduce the costs of agriculture monitoring,
    maximize efficiency, help farmers make the data driven decisions and ultimately
    propel crops farming practices of higher levels of ethics and professionalism.
    Besides, this monitoring system also can increase the interest in the younger
    generation to become farmers and thus, increasing the productivity of the agriculture
    [2]. Today, the traditional monitoring and controlling of hydroponic plants is
    difficult to adapt in for higher production volume of plantation [3]. It has been
    a challenge for the farmers to monitor and control the hydroponics plants manually
    especially for the large scale of hydroponic farm. Additionally, if the farmers
    were to be outstation, to monitor their farms is even highly difficult [4]. Wireless
    sensor network hydroponic monitoring system using TDMA based wireless communication
    proposes a system that is able to help the farmers monitoring the significance
    environmental factors including the light intensity, pH value, water level, temperature
    and humidity. The intended monitoring system integrates the IoT-based technique
    that helps the farmers to gather, store and share the real-time data via smart
    phone to make sure that the plants are in a healthy environment [1, 5]. In 2018,
    Rahmat et al. [1] conducted a study on red onion growth monitoring system in hydroponics
    environment to cultivate onions using water, nutrients, and oxygen with no soil
    is required. The monitoring system is very important for hydroponics plants as
    the changes in surrounding temperature, light intensity, plant temperature and
    humidity will greatly affect the plant growth. The work in [6] proposed an IoT-based
    wireless sensors for agriculture monitoring. The purpose of this paper is to solve
    the major challenges in agriculture in term of monitoring the moisture conditions
    and temperature, and distance coverage by using IoT-based WSN. An agriculture
    land monitoring module is proposed to solve the challenges. The paper in [5] aims
    to deliver the application of wireless network IoT in agriculture field monitor
    and auto control to computerise and develop IoT in agriculture. With the help
    of IoT in processing the information gathered, this work is able to limit the
    manual work for agriculture and use less water in irrigation with the goal that
    the time and cost can be saved. A study in [7] is about the WSN for monitoring
    the water quality with efficient energy resource utilization. The purpose of this
    study is to address the problem of limited energy budget of batteries for powering
    sensors in the wireless sensor network as the depletion of batteries will make
    the sensor node becomes inactive and this will decrease the performance of the
    system in the context of the harvested energy by the sensor nodes, sensors information
    transmission rates, and the overall system throughput rate. The work in [8] offered
    a solution for optimally monitoring farming condition using IoT. This work aimed
    to develop a new smart farming system based in IoT to replace the conventional
    agriculture methods. This system not only can optimal the farm’s monitoring conditions
    but also reduce crop waste and it is cost-efficient. Another research conducted
    [9] shows the smart aquaponics system based IoT. This aquaponics system is capable
    to increase the agriculture production by using the combination of water and land
    saving technologies which are the aquaculture and hydroponics. This research designed
    a smart aquaponics system that can control and monitor the acidity of water, water
    level, water temperature, and fish feed. The research in [10] has investigated
    the smart farming using IoT platform based on edge and cloud computing to implement
    it in a real greenhouse in the south-east of Spain. Sensors are used to build
    the nutrient solution unit, irrigation unit, disinfection unit, purification unit,
    and climate unit to act as the facilities of the greenhouse. Yeong in [11] proposed
    a work on Arowana fishponds monitoring system using CDMA-based wireless communication.
    The proposed work is used to maintain the water quality of the fishpond at an
    optimum level efficiently. The CDMA channel access method used in this work is
    allows multiple sensor nodes to transmit data over a same frequency channel simultaneously.
    After reviewing the related works, the works are basically implemented WSN in
    the agriculture monitoring system with IoT-based technique. Only one related work
    used the CDMA channel access method in implementing the monitoring system as in
    [11] and this system can only receive data from one base station at the same time.
    Thus, this work will be developed by using the combination of simplified TDMA
    channel access method and IoT-based in wireless sensor network with parallel transmission
    mode. 2 Methodology Basically, the focus of this study is to implement WSN hydroponic
    monitoring system using TDMA based wireless communication. There are four hydroponic
    tubes are implemented for demonstration. However, this system can be extended
    by implementing more sensor nodes. Every two hydroponic tubes have an ESP32 as
    microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi module to collect sensor data from sensors
    (water level sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, light intensity sensor and
    pH sensor). Another ESP32 connects to PC and acts as the gateway node. The respective
    ESP32 at hydroponic tubes and gateway node will act as the servers and client
    respectively in this network. Therefore, the wireless communication between client
    and servers can be achieved using HTTP communication. The only client will communicate
    with the two servers respectively and repeatedly for data transmission using HTTP
    communication and TDMA channel access method. Once the client received the latest
    four sensor nodes data, it will upload all the sensor data to cloud for data analysis
    and visualisation in graph on the cloud platform. Figure 1 shows the system overview
    of hydroponic monitoring system using TDMA. Fig. 1. System overview of hydroponic
    monitoring system using simplified TDMA Full size image In this client-servers
    network, each server creates its wireless network with its own name and password
    so that the client can connect to it. The communication between this client-servers
    network is in half-duplex mode with handshaking protocol. The client will send
    the HTTP GET request to servers respectively by allocating the respective time
    slots to respective servers to obtain the latest sensor data for data analysing
    by uploading the sensor data to cloud. Fig. 2. Overall flow diagram of server
    Full size image Fig. 3. Overall flow diagram of client Full size image 2.1 Overall
    Flow of Server Only two ESP32 servers are built for Wi-Fi client-servers communication.
    The ESP32 server is Access Point (AP) that have its own name and password for
    the client to connect to it. Once the client has connected to it, it will listen
    to the request from the client on latest sensor data (temperature, humidity, water
    level, pH value and light intensity) URLs using HTTP GET request. When there is
    the request on those URLs, the server will send the latest sensor data to the
    client via HTTP response. Figure 2 shows the overall flow diagram of the server
    (Fig. 3). After that, the client will continue to connect to server 2 to allocate
    the second time slot of the channel to it. Then, it will send a request to the
    server to obtain another two sensor nodes data from the server. The client will
    disconnect from server 2 and connect to the Wi-Fi network to upload the sensor
    data to the cloud. If the sensor data do not upload to the cloud successfully,
    it will upload to the cloud again until it is successful. Then, the client will
    repeat the steps mentioned above and allocate the following time slots to the
    server that it will connect. Figure 4 below shows the flow diagram of uploading
    data to cloud by client. Fig. 4. Flow diagram of uploading data to cloud by client
    Full size image Fig. 5. Flow diagram of the half-duplex communication in this
    monitoring system Full size image 2.2 Data Communication In this work, the ESP32
    provides 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band for data transmission between sensor nodes
    and gateway node. This Wi-Fi frequency band is the frequency range that within
    the wireless spectrum and it is designated to carry Wi-Fi of 2.4 GHz. Besides,
    the half-duplex communication mode and handshaking protocol are used in this wireless
    communication. In half-duplex communication mode, each ESP32 can both transmit
    and receive but not at the same time. For example, in this work, when the ESP32
    client is sending request to ESP32 server for sensor data collection, the ESP32
    server can only receive. After that, ESP32 server will respond to the ESP32 client
    with the sensor data and in this case, the ESP32 client will only receive the
    incoming response with sensor data. Thus, it is no need for the communication
    to communicate in both direction at the same time and the entire capacity of the
    bandwidth is utilised for each direction. This can prevent the data loss during
    the transmission. Figure 5 above shows the flow diagram of the half-duplex communication
    in this monitoring system. Handshaking protocol used in this work is a process
    of initiating the communication by two devices. In this case, handshaking begins
    when the client sends a message to the server for communication channel establishment
    by connecting to the server. Then, the client and server will send and receive
    the message among themselves to follow the rules of the protocol. Figure 6 below
    shows the handshaking protocol used in this work. Fig. 6. Handshaking protocol
    Full size image Besides, the asynchronous HTTP web request and response are used
    in the HTTP communication between the client and the servers. Thus, the client
    can send multiple requests to the server to obtain different sensor data and the
    server will send multiple responses with sensor data to the client. Therefore,
    the multiple requests and responses are processed in parallel. Since the communication
    between the gateway node and the sensor nodes are in HTTP client-servers communication,
    the data communication is in parallel. In this case, the client will send multiple
    requests to the server. Then, the server will respond with multiple sensor data
    to the client at the same time. This means that every HTTP response body contains
    sensor data in data byte sent by the server to the client (Table 1). Table 1.

  description: 【Background and objective】Facility agriculture growing crops in greenhouses
    has developed rapidly in China over the past decades. As crop growth and its ultimate
    yield depend on a multitude of factors, how to control the local environment in
    greenhouses is important but challenging. The purpose of this paper is to present
    a smart control system for greenhouses designed based on grey entropy correlation
    analysis.【Method】A mathematical model for evaluating environmental factors responsible
    for plant growth in greenhouse was established first, and it was then integrated
    with the grey entropy weight theory. We took the factors affecting crop growth
    as multiple attributes to the uncertain decision-making system to calculate the
    optimal environment, from which we designed a monitoring system including wireless
    sensor network on chip CC2530, to allocate temperature, humidity, light and other
    factors into internet to adjust the optimal greenhouse environment for crops to
    grow.【Result】Test of the system in a greenhouse showed that the packet loss rate
    of the wireless network communication was less than 1%, meeting the requirements
    for real-time environmental information collection and stable transmission. It
    also increased the survival rate of seedlings by 3.1% and saved water use by 14%,
    compared with traditional method.【Conclusion】The control system we designed based
    on the grey entropy correlation analysis for greenhouse is stable, reliable and
    effective, compared with traditional methods that manually adjust environmental
    parameters in the greenhouse. It hence has a wide application for facility agricultural
    production by increasing the survival of crop seedlings and saving water usage
    simultaneously.

    Published by Cambridge University Press Impact Statement Digital twins are increasingly
    discussed to optimize urban energy use and agriculture, and we suggest they are
    particularly suited to bespoke environments, for which conventional “one size
    fits all” models cannot cater to their changing operational conditions. We present
    the development of a digital twin for an urban-integrated hydroponic farm, situated
    in repurposed WW2 air raid shelters in London. We show how a digital twin can
    faithfully represent the reality of the environment through real-time streams
    of data, making it a useful representation for an operator of the farm. Digital
    twins are not easy to develop in unique environments, and we present the challenges
    and opportunities through the three crucial elements of a digital twin. (a) Data
    Creation: an extensive monitoring system that combines wireless sensors with manual
    data records to create a virtual representation of the farm through data. (b)
    Data Analysis: key influencing variables on energy use and crop yield can be identified
    by analyzing the relationships between the broad data collected. (c) Data Modeling:
    the digital twin is an opportunity to apply site-specific modeling to forecast
    potential future operational scenarios, and provide feedback on the influence
    of recent events on farm environment. 1. Introduction As wireless sensor technology,
    large cloud databases, and computer processing power become more available (Qi
    et al., Reference Qi, Tao, Hu, Anwer, Liu, Wei, Wang and Nee 2019), data-centric
    solutions in the form of digital twins are attractive to improve performance and
    efficiencies of built environments both of innovative and traditional enterprises
    alike (Kaewunruen et al., Reference Kaewunruen, Rungskunroch and Welsh 2018; Ruohomaki
    et al., Reference Ruohomaki, Airaksinen, Huuska, Kesaniemi, Martikka and Suomisto
    2018). As we will demonstrate in this paper, the benefits of a digital twin are
    especially pronounced in built environments that are bespoke and where standard
    asset management and control systems provide limited utility. Although digital
    twins are still in the process of being defined by scholars (Jones et al., Reference
    Jones, Snider, Nassehi, Yon and Hicks 2020), they are broadly understood to be
    virtual representations of an existing object or process, including continuously
    monitored data that provides feedback for optimal management of the twinned object
    or process. This paper presents the development of a digital twin of a unique
    hydroponic underground farm in London. Growing 12 times more per unit area than
    traditional greenhouse farming in the UK, the farm also consumes four times more
    energy per unit area (Milà Canals et al., Reference Milà Canals, Muñoz, Hospido,
    Plassmann, McLaren, Hounsome, Milà, Ivan, Almudena, Katharina and Sarah McLaren
    2008; The Carbon Trust, 2012). Key to the ongoing operational success of this
    farm and similar enterprises is finding ways to minimize the energy use while
    maximizing crop growth by maintaining optimal growing conditions. As such, the
    farm belongs to the broad class of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), where
    indoor environments are carefully controlled to maximize crop growth by using
    artificial lighting and smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
    systems (van Straten and Henten, Reference van Straten and Henten 2010). There
    is a vast literature on monitoring and optimizing CEA environments and recently
    digital twins have started to be implemented in smart farming to identify pests
    and diseases, animal feed availability, or track machinery in fields through telemetry
    (Verdouw and Kruize, Reference Verdouw and Kruize 2017). In Japan, the use of
    the “SAIBAIX” dashboard is starting to be used in smart plant factories, where
    real-time sensor information can keep farmers informed about the current farm
    productivity and resource use efficiency (Sakaguchi, Reference Sakaguchi 2018).
    However, using the data for analysis and modeling is error prone owing to quality
    of data, and the authors conceded further work was needed to make robust data-learning
    models. The few examples of digital twins that exist in CEA environments “mostly
    focus on basic monitoring capabilities or they virtualize objects at a high granularity
    level” (Verdouw and Kruize, Reference Verdouw and Kruize 2017). For example, Alves
    et al. ( Reference Alves, Souza, Maia, Tran, Kamienski, Soininen, Aquino and Lima
    2019) presented their initial development of a digital twin for smart farming,
    where they could visualize data of a soil probe on a dashboard but were not at
    the stage of a fully operating digital twin with feedback and analytics. Hemming
    et al. ( Reference Hemming, De Zwart, Elings, Righini and Petropoulou 2019) presented
    the results of a competition on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize
    the controls of a greenhouse by linking sensor data to operable controls. They
    showed that artificial neural networks have great potential to optimize crop growth,
    but the trials were conducted on an ideal testbed greenhouse. The farm which is
    the subject of this paper is unique because unlike traditional CEA, it is 33 m
    underground in tunnels where the environment cannot be precisely controlled. Whilst
    the ground surrounding the tunnels does provide constant boundary conditions (unlike
    standard CEA, which are subjected to fluctuations of outdoor weather), the limited
    access to ventilation and constrained access for farm operations poses challenges.
    Furthermore, the farm is entirely reliant on LED (Light Emitting Diode) lights
    to activate the photosynthesis process for plant growth. Finally, the practical
    challenges of setting up a monitoring network in the continuously changing environment
    of urban integrated or innovative farms are poorly reported, but a crucial element
    to the success of such endeavors, especially as cities are demonstrating an increased
    interest in urban agriculture. The overarching objective of this paper is a digital
    twin of the underground farm that faithfully represents the reality of the environment
    through real-time streams of data, making it a useful representation for an operator
    of the farm. This includes three crucial elements: (a) Data Creation: An extensive
    and robust monitoring system that tracks the observable environmental conditions
    in the underground farm. This is supported by data curation that ensures quality
    and tractability of data. (b) Data Analysis: Using observable data in conjunction
    with information reported by farm operators to identify key influencing variables
    of the farm environment and thereby on crop yield. (c) Data Modeling: We investigate
    techniques most suitable for identifying critical trends and changes, forecast
    potential future operational scenarios, and provide feedback on the influence
    of recent events on farm environment. Despite the upcoming body of literature
    on digital twins, examples of digital twins that successfully and seamlessly integrate
    these elements in a fully operational and complex environment are rare, and thus
    this paper fills this important gap in academic literature. As we will show in
    Section 6, a second novel feature of this paper is the forecasting model that
    is easily implementable with as little as temperature and energy meter readings,
    and flexible to the addition of more data as it becomes available. The structure
    of the paper follows the representation of the digital twin in Figure 1. We first
    present the monitoring process and the key data challenges of monitoring in a
    continuously operated environment. In Sections 4 and 5, we present the data analysis
    that includes: (a) the influence of the farm environment on crop growth, (b) the
    influence of operable controls on the environment, and (c) the influence of manual
    changes on the operational controls. Within the limitations of the data, this
    exercise identifies the variables which are crucial to track and forecast. We
    then present the data model, which is essentially a forecasting model that predicts
    extreme temperatures and provides feedback on operational changes that can reduce
    energy use and control the farm environment more effectively. We conclude with
    a discussion on further development of this digital twin. Figure 1. The three
    integrated stages of a digital twin applied to GU. 2. Brief Overview of the Underground
    Farm Growing Underground Footnote 1 (GU) is an unheated hydroponic farm producing
    microgreens. It is situated in derelict tunnels designed as a WW2 air raid shelter
    in the 1940s, 33 m below ground. The tunnels had not been used since they last
    housed the Windrush generation of migrants in the 60s, until the farm opened in
    December 2015. The farm initially catered to hotels and restaurants and has expanded
    to become a supplier of large UK food retailers such as M&S and Ocado. The main
    crops are peashoots, basil, coriander, parsley, salad rocket, pink radish, and
    mustard plants. The site consists of two parallel tunnels, running on two levels
    and spanning approximately 400 m (Figure 2). Currently, only half the upper tunnel
    is used for growing crops, in an area of 528 m2 and is projected for major extensions
    from August to December 2020. Figure 2. Map of the tunnels onto London. In red,
    the currently occupied tunnels 1–3. In blue, the tunnels 5–8 are planned for the
    extension. The current farm is in tunnel 3, as shown in the picture “Farm.” The
    two entrances to the farm, CP and Clapham Common (CC), are also shown with pictures
    and linked to the location on the map. The current farm is located in the upper
    tunnel of Tunnel 1 (circled tunnel in Figure 2), near the Carpenter’s Place (CP)
    entrance. The lower tunnel contains 20 irrigation tanks of 1 m3 each, 10 with
    fresh water, and 10 with recycled water. The fresh water tanks irrigate the farm
    in the upper tunnel twice a day using an ebb and flow mechanism which floods the
    trays for 15 min. The water that is not absorbed by the mats on the benches gets
    recirculated to the recycled water tanks. The water that circulated through the
    zones containing allergens is removed due to the risk of contamination. The farm
    itself consists of two areas hereafter called the “original farm” installed in
    January 2016 and the “extended farm,” installed during January 2018, and is organized
    in terms of aisles, columns, stacks, and benches (see Figure 3). This brings the
    total farm area to 528 m2, with 460 m2 in the original farm, and 68 m2 in the
    extended farm. The tunnel footprint itself is 519 m2, making an area efficiency
    ratio of 1.03, which is very high for an indoor farm including passage space.
    Despite the tunnel only having a ceiling height of 2.08 m, each stack is 1.87
    m high and houses four benches, spanning 2 m in width, with a surface area of
    2 m2. The stacks are aligned in two parallel aisles, known as aisle A and aisle
    B. There are 24 columns surrounding 23 stacks in each aisle in the original farm,
    and 10 columns with nine stacks per aisle in the extended farm. The relative locations
    in the farm will henceforth be denominated as such: C3A-2 will refer to Column
    3, aisle A, bench 2, as marked in the diagram in Figure 3. Figure 3. Photograph
    and 3D drawing of the front of the farm. The entrance to the tunnel is in CP,
    depicted in Figure 2. A spiral staircase surrounds the lift that brings the staff
    down to the farm, but which is also the main ventilation axis. Indeed, the air
    is drawn in through the staircase and circulated through the tunnels with vents
    in the ceiling of the upper tunnels, and in the floor of the lower tunnels. This
    air is drawn by a 30 kW extraction fan located in the lower tunnel. The extraction
    fan unit consists of two fans which alternate to prevent overheating. The air
    is drawn out through a parallel vertical shaft to the staircase, and the vents
    are visible opposite the CP entrance in Figure 2. An identical fan is located
    below CC (also illustrated in Figure 2), which draws the air down the CC staircase,
    and is designed to circulate the air through tunnels 5–8, and extracts back up
    a ventilation shaft. Each fan has its designated tunnels (CP is for tunnels 1–4
    and CC is for tunnels 5–8), but the effect of the fan at CC is felt in the farm
    as well because the tunnels 4–8 are currently completely empty. The farm tends
    to be occupied in the mornings (6–8 am) to harvest the fresh produce, and in the
    evenings (3–4 pm), to exchange the crops. GU also regularly organizes tours of
    the farm where groups of 4–15 visit for approximately 1 hr at varying times of
    the day. The farm is less busy at weekends. By virtue of being underground, the
    farm is artificially lit, giving the operators more control over when to start
    the photoperiod than in conventional greenhouses. Each bench in the farm is lit
    by four LED growing lights, of length 1.5 m, named AP673L from the manufacturer
    Valoya, with a photosynthetically active radiation intensity of 1.9 μmol W−1 s−1
    (Valoya, Reference Valoya 2016). In the original farm, the lights are AP673L 30
    W and AP673L 40 W in the extended farm. While the lighting schedule has varied
    across the monitoring period between 14 and 18 hr, the target duration of the
    photoperiod is 18 hr with a night period of 6 hr when the lights are turned off.
    As energy is cheaper at night, the target farm daytime is between 5 pm and 11
    am. If on for 18 hr, this corresponds to a daily light integral of 9.8 and 13
    mol m−2 day, which is within the target range of environmental PAR integral defined
    for lettuce by Ferentinos et al. ( Reference Ferentinos, Albright and Ramani 2000)
    of 11–17 mol m−2 day. 3. The Monitoring Network A prerequisite of digital twinning
    is an appropriate monitoring network that provides relevant information exchange
    between the system and its virtual counterpart. Indeed, a robust and efficient
    monitoring network is a key element that drives a digital twin and sustaining
    it through the life cycle of a system is often challenging. Sensors that constitute
    the monitoring network are known for their limitations with respect to low battery
    power, limited computational capability, and small memory (Aqeel-ur-Rehman et
    al., Reference Aqeel-ur-Rehman, Abbasi, Islam and Shaikh 2014). In addition, underground
    tunnels present issues of communication across a fragile wireless network. Finally,
    human factors and operational constraints can pose limitations with respect to
    appropriately locating sensors and communication lines. Consequently, a range
    of sensors were trialed to ensure that the information from the monitoring network
    is accurate, relevant, and continuous. This in principle constitutes the design
    of a wireless sensor network (WSN) which sends data in real time to a server.
    The WSN consists of 25 sensors, monitoring a total of 89 variables, which transmit
    data to eight Raspberry Pi (Raspi) loggers. These loggers in turn transfer the
    data to servers in the Cambridge University Engineering Department (server) over
    WiFi. The loggers also store the data on SD cards when the wireless service goes
    down. Each data logger (Raspi 1–8) is connected to sensors with a unique identifier,
    categorized as “Sensor Name” in Figure 4. The five environmental variables that
    are continuously monitored are temperature, relative humidity (RH), CO2 concentration,
    air velocity, and light levels. Some of these, such as temperature are monitored
    by several sensors, linked to different data loggers (e.g., Raspi 1, 6, 7, and
    TinyTag). The reader is referred to Jans-Singh et al. ( Reference Jans-Singh,
    Fidler, Ward and Choudhary 2019) for detailed information about each type of monitored
    variable. Figure 4. Diagram of the data collection and storage network, showing
    the automatic wireless (dotted lines), automatic wired (dashed) data transfers,
    and data which need manual data collection (full line). See text for details.
    At the same time, information that can be feasibly obtained from the wireless
    network is only partial. Therefore a system was created for manually logging operational
    conditions such as ventilation settings or lighting schedules (Jans-Singh et al.,
    Reference Jans-Singh, Fidler, Ward and Choudhary 2019). The observations of the
    farm thus fall into two categories: the structured data, consisting of the WSN,
    and continuous data from energy meter readings from Stark and weather from the
    MetOffice; and “unstructured data,” which are manually recorded observations.
    Data from these different sources are stored in a Microsoft Azure database, as
    summarized in Figure 4. To the left of the diagram are the servers storing the
    data, and to the right are the monitored variables recorded by each data logger–sensor
    combinations. The line type of arrows indicates the type of data transmission
    (wireless or wired, manual, or automatic). A web platform is under development
    to visualize in real-time the data acquisition and historical data. Both the raw
    real-time data and curated historical data are used for data analytics and data
    modeling. The five sets of data presented in this paper are marked in Figure 4
    by greyed boxes. The data were chosen because they had the longest data range
    available and because they represented a wide range of data collection methods
    and variables. The period over which records now exist is shown in Figure 5 up
    to summer 2016, with hourly weather conditions data accessed for St James’ Park
    from the UK Met Office. Figure 5. Data availability for monitored variables used
    in this study. The sensors linked to the Raspi 1 and 2 data loggers are wireless
    Advanticsys IAQM-THCO2 motes (Advanticsys, 2017), which log temperature, humidity,
    and CO2. Five of the seven sensors were installed in the farm, and their locations
    are marked in Figure 6 with pink hexagons. For this paper, we focus on temperature
    and humidity readings as the CO2 data are unreliable due to sensor drift (Jans-Singh
    et al., Reference Jans-Singh, Fidler, Ward and Choudhary 2019). The data are almost
    complete since September 2016 (Figure 7). Figure 6. Location of sensors in GU.
    The side view of a typical bench is indicated for the centre of the farm, showing
    how four LED lights span the length of each bench. The blue arrows indicate the
    air circulation throughout the farm caused by EF1 at CP. Figure 7. Missing sensor
    data by location by hour over monitoring period used in this study. Left: black
    lines signify a missing data point for the hour on the x-axis. Right: percentage
    summary of missing points for the given sensor. Energy use is recorded at half-hourly
    intervals using 2 meters located at the two ends of the tunnel, named CP and CC
    (Figure 2), and is accessed from the Stark server (Stark ID, Reference Stark 2020).
    CP powers one extraction fan (called extraction fan 1) of 30 kW, and the 1024
    LED lights in the farm of 30 W each. The energy signal thus primarily represents
    these two objects (fan 1 and lights), but also includes energy used for the office,
    package and processing, propagation, refrigeration, and lift. The reading at CC
    only measures the energy use of extraction fan 2 (fan 2, which is identical in
    specification to fan 1). The data for meter 1 became available from July 28, 2017,
    and meter 2 from January 26, 2018 (Figure 5). Since it was not possible to automatically
    log crop data and individual actions in the farm, we assembled, together with
    GU, a set of manually recorded variables. Although the lights have an automated
    control board with two settings (on/off), the extraction fan has a manual control
    dial. The setting on the manual dial represents the ventilation rate of the extraction
    fan. The operators do not know to what extent they are modifying their energy
    use when changing the dial setting. The farm operators were instructed to record
    the ventilation setting whenever it is changed on a Google Spreadsheet (DAT 08
    in Figure 4). This was done daily since January 26, 2017. Further manually recorded
    data include comments from the farm operators, such as records of whether doors
    were open or shut, addition of new fans, or moving any sensor from its original
    location. Crop growth is recorded since March 2016, by crop type, mass, and area
    harvested. The location of each crop is tracked since March 2017 for each bench
    and column, according to the layout illustrated in Figure 3. These data are manually
    recorded by farmers processing the crop (DAT 09 in Figure 4), so in the midst
    of operations, it is prone to human error. Nonetheless, such data can give an
    indication of how environmental conditions influence crop growth. In order to
    have a complete dataset which can be used for the development of the digital twin,
    any missing data must be regularly imputed. While linear interpolation suffices
    for the relatively small data gaps in some observations (e.g., the energy meter
    readings and Met Office weather data), the sensor data measuring temperature and
    humidity in the farm needed a more detailed imputation procedure. The prevalence
    of missing points for the five sensors of interest is illustrated in Figure 7.
    The data are missing at random and in blocks, indicating that missing data were
    more likely linked to general sensor failure due to unplugging, loss of internet
    connection, connectivity with the data logger, and not due to individual sensors
    on the monitors. The sensor locations with least missing values are connected
    to the same data logger, at the “Top bench” and “Front of the farm” (Figure 6)
    with around 8% missing data over the 907 days considered in this study, while
    the sensor with most missing values was located at the “Back of the farm.” Sensor
    data were analyzed from September 2016 to February 2019, when there is almost
    always data from at least one sensor. The missing temperature measurements are
    imputed using a random forest algorithm with neighboring sensor data, outside
    weather conditions, and the hour of day, with 100 trees. More normally distributed,
    the humidity missing data are imputed using normal multivariate regression using
    neighboring humidity sensor values and external humidity, without including the
    hour of day. Both were performed with the mice package. 4. Data Analysis of Environmental
    Conditions When given enough nutrients in a hydroponic system, crop growth is
    limited by three environmental factors: temperature, visible radiation, and CO2
    levels (Blackman, Reference Blackman 1905). As the farm is artificially lit for
    18 hr a day, and the CO2 levels are roughly constant around 400 ppm due to ventilation,
    temperature is likely the most significant limiting factor for crop growth. Humidity
    is also a concern as levels over 70% can affect yields due to lower leaf resistance
    to pathogens (Stine et al., Reference Stine, Song, Choi and Gerba 2005), but higher
    humidity can speed up the production of crops with a higher water content in shorter
    period of time (Tibbitts and Bottenberg, Reference Tibbitts and Bottenberg 1976).
    This is expected to be a secondary factor as humidity in the farm is managed well
    with dehumidifiers. Crop performance is assessed for nine of the most grown crops
    in the farm. Crop growth refers to the yield divided by the number of days the
    crop was in the farm. Crop performance is calculated as crop growth divided by
    its average crop growth. Thus a crop performance of 1.05 suggests that the crop
    grew 5% better than its average performance. The correlation table (Table 1) shows
    the relationship between each crop’s performance and the minimum, maximum, and
    mean temperature during the crop’s time in the farm, and the median RH value.
    The correlation () and p-values () indicate the strength of the relationship between
    temperature and RH with crop growth. A high p-value (, denoted by * in Table 1)
    signifies that there is not enough data to establish a strong relationship. High
    correlations with low p-values () indicate that there is significant evidence
    that crops grow better if temperature or humidity are increased/decreased. According
    to Table 1, most crops have a significant relationship with the mean and minimum
    temperature observed, and the median RH while they were in the farm. However,
    this relationship is stronger for some crops than others. For example, peashoots
    have high correlation and significant p-value ( with mean temperature and with
    RH), showing that environments with higher temperatures and lower humidity are
    much more suited for growing a lot of peashoots rapidly. Inversely, some crops
    have lower correlations suggesting that the range of temperatures and RH experienced
    by the crop while in the farm did not significantly influence their growth (e.g.,
    garlic chive has a correlation of 0.1 with temperature and 0.04 with RH, with
    high p-values). Wasabi mustard, broccoli, and fennel have low correlations with
    temperature. In particular, fennel varied more with median RH (−0.23) than with
    mean temperature (0.11). Purple radish, peashoots, and salad rocket have high
    correlation with minimum temperature (0.23, 0.34, 0.46) suggesting that when temperatures
    were colder in the farm, crop yield was slower and less big. Table 1. Pearson
    correlation coefficients of crop performance with the minimum, maximum and mean
    temperature, and median humidity of the top bench data during the crop’s growing
    period in the tunnels. * . *** Indicates p-value . Figure 8 illustrates the results
    from the correlation table: that there is not always a significant relationship
    between crop performance and temperature, and different crops showed more individual
    behavior with respect to temperature. Broadly, all crops performed well within
    18 and 24°C which are in line with values reported in the literature (Thompson
    and Langhans, Reference Thompson and Langhans 1998). In Figure 8a, mean crop performance
    is plotted against the minimum, mean, and maximum temperature experienced while
    the crop was in the farm over three panels (A, B, and C). In general, it shows
    the similar correlation between improved performance and warmer environments (Table
    1), but that for some crops there is no clear relationship (reflecting the p-values
    ). For instance, peashoots (blue triangles) show that the crop performance consistently
    increases with higher minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures, while for garlic
    chives and coriander, the crop performance seemed to vary randomly between temperature
    bands, suggesting that factors other than temperature impacted the crop growth.
    Not all crops performed better at warmer temperatures: from panel C, it seems
    that wasabi mustard performance declines if the temperature reached over 25°C
    during its growing period. Figure 8. Mean crop performance plotted against temperature
    indicators in the farm. However, looking at minimum and maximum limits the analysis
    to the 1 hr when temperature peaked and fell most during the crop growth period.
    Mean temperature is also not so suited because it could be the mean from a small
    or large range of temperatures. An alternative analysis comes from plotting crop
    performance against the number of hours temperature was under 18°C and over 24°C
    during the growing period (Figure 8b). This figure again shows the trend that
    peashoots grow better in warmer conditions. Some crops’ performance does not seem
    to depend on the number of hours temperatures were under 18°C (such as red mustard,
    coriander, or garlic chive), while others (purple radish, peashoots) do. Knowing
    which crops’ performance will vary as a result of farm temperature can be used
    to inform where to grow crops based on the likelihood a certain zone will be colder
    or warmer. The digital twin can provide a virtual representation of the spatial
    variations of crop performance. In Figure 9b, the annual cultivated area for each
    crop at each column along the farm is shown as a percentage of the total cultivated
    area for the given year, 2017 (top) and 2018 (bottom). In general, each column
    (summing across all benches and aisles), represents 4% of the annual crop yield
    of the farm in 2017, but 3% in 2018. In 2018 compared to 2017, the extra cultivated
    area between columns 24 and 33 represents the extended farm. While in 2017, the
    distribution of crops throughout the year was even, in 2018, more crops were grown
    at the front of the farm. In Figure 9a, the mean crop performance for groups of
    columns is shown for each year for these same crops. Figure 9. Spatial variation
    of crop growth for 2017 (top) and 2018 (bottom). By analyzing the crop yield performance
    with crop location at the end of 2017, the crop performance could be judged in
    comparison with the crop location, and adjusted accordingly to place them in their
    most suited environment. For instance, salad rocket (pink), was mostly grown between
    columns 1 and 6 in 2017, but its crop performance was 0.93, while performance
    between columns 11 and 16 was 1. Consequently the following year, more salad rocket
    was grown between columns 11 and 16, yielding a crop performance for that zone
    of 1.4. Similarly, red mustard (red) had a performance of 1 at columns 21–24 in
    2017, but 0.89 at columns 1–6. They were therefore likely to be suited to the
    back of the farm, which is warmer, so they were located at columns 25–33 in the
    extended farm, where they achieved a performance of 1.2 in 2018. Combining this
    information with an understanding of the optimal conditions, and real-time forecasts
    of temperatures in the farm can help GU farm operators optimize the location of
    each crop, and maximize the use of cultivated area. 5. Influence of Lights and
    Fan on Farm Environment 5.1. Heat gains from the LED lights The LED lights have
    the greatest influence on daily temperature fluctuations in the farm. The temperature
    and RH variation between the sensors shown in Figure 10 is representative of a
    typical day in the farm. At the front of the farm, temperature readings are most
    similar to the external weather conditions as they are the closest to the incoming
    air. The data captured by the other four sensors located more centrally within
    the farm are much more similar to each other, and the temperatures follow a clear
    increasing pattern when the lights are switched on (5 pm), and decrease when they
    are switched off (11 am). The mean difference between temperature readings when
    the lights were on is 2.4°C as opposed to 1.1°C when the lights were off, suggesting
    the lights affect the temperatures in a more localized manner, but that during
    the day (farm night-time), there are no local heat sources and the air is sufficiently
    mixed. There was no such clear difference between night and day for humidity,
    where the difference between the sensors was on average 4.5%. There is not enough
    information to ascertain whether this difference in the humidity readings from
    different sensors is due to uneven drift of the RH sensor, or local differences
    in RH (Both et al., Reference Both, Benjamin, Franklin, Holroyd, Incoll, Lefsrud
    and Pitkin 2015). Figure 10. Temperatures and relative humidity measured by the
    five sensors and outside on 1 day (November 15, 2018). The shaded zone represents
    the period when the LED lights were on. The right side of Figure 10 shows that
    the RH peaks to 82% when the temperatures drop during the farm nighttime. As crop
    transpiration rate is normally proportional to its received photosynthetically
    active radiation from the LED lights (Stanghellini, Reference Stanghellini 1987),
    the lack of peak observed during the crop photoperiod suggests that transpiration
    levels in the farm are low. Humidity levels in the tunnel could thus be dominated
    by the evaporation from the irrigation process that occurs in the morning (8–10
    am) and in the evening (5–7 pm) rather than transpiration. Low transpiration rates
    are likely because the crops grown are microgreens, with lower Leaf Area Index
    than mature crops (Boulard and Wang, Reference Boulard and Wang 2000). Furthermore,
    the high correlation of temperature with humidity (= −0.38 for top bench sensor)
    suggests that the air moisture content is relatively constant throughout the day
    (as warm air can contain more air moisture). Consequently, it seems that temperature
    is more important variable to control in this farm than RH. The influence of the
    LED lights on temperature varies with average external temperature. Figure 11
    shows the daily change in top bench temperature compared to its daily minimum
    as a function of the day’s average external temperature (separated in half-degree
    bands), estimated using kernel regression on the detrended temperature records.
    When the temperatures outside are colder the lights “warm” up the farm to a greater
    extent, and over a longer period, which can be up to 13 hr after the lights came
    on. For example, when external temperatures are <7°C (blue in Figure 11), the
    temperature inside the farm increases by over 5°C. When external temperature was
    over 20, temperatures in the farm would not increase by more than 5°C, and temperature
    increase plateaus after 4 hr. This daily shape was very similar for each sensor,
    but the magnitude of heating varied for each location. Figure 11. Daily change
    of temperature from the daily minimum, for every half-degree of average daily
    external temperature from −5 to 30°C. Owing to their significant influence on
    indoor temperatures, a useful component of the digital twin would therefore be
    a warning system when any additional hours of lighting would result in increasing
    the indoor temperatures beyond the optimal range. As aforementioned, the LED lights
    within the tunnel are expected to be on for 18 hr a day, and switched off for
    6 hr during the day. Although this is what happens most days, there can be some
    variations as the farm operators will occasionally turn on the lights for additional
    hours to show visitors the farm, to check the lights are all working, or to clean
    the farm. Sometimes they will be left on by mistake. There are no light sensors
    currently in the farm. Thus the actual period when the LED lights are switched
    on needs to be inferred from the daily energy use. A light proxy is created by
    assuming the lights are on if the energy use is over 0.9 times the days’ mean
    energy use (where a day is defined as 5 pm–11 am to correspond with the lighting
    period), and the energy demand is over 30 kW. The hour before the first hour the
    lights are on is also indicative: if energy use in any hour increases by more
    than 0.4 times its preceding hour, that hour is defined as the first hour of the
    photo-period. Based on these criteria, we estimate that the lights were turned
    on for the expected 18 hr photoperiod for 94% of all days monitored, and were
    off for 6 hr during the daytime for 13% of all days monitored (Figure 12). The
    duration of the photoperiod was on average 18 hr, with a standard deviation of
    2.19 hr, which shows that the schedule was followed, if not exactly. Figure 12.
    Proportion of 560 today days that the light is on according to our measure derived
    from energy readings, and the expected schedule. 5.2. The extraction fan The extraction
    fan is controlled by an analog control dial, as shown in Figure 13a. The settings
    on the control dial range between 7 (off) and 5 (full power), which corresponds
    to air changes per hour (ACH) between 0 and 4.5. The fan settings are recorded
    by the farm operators daily for the last 2 years. Since the meter reading at Clapham
    Common only measured the energy use of fan 2, the power use () for each ventilation
    setting () could be derived using a power curve by analyzing the energy use at
    each known ventilation setting, reported in Equation (1), which has a close fit
    of . (1) Figure 13b shows the relationship between the energy use from the fan
    and the setting read from the dial. On the top x-axis, the ventilation rate in
    ACH is estimated using the specific fan power of 2.39, and total volume of tunnels
    the fan is connected to, and given in Equation (2). The red line in Figure 13b
    shows the mode of ACH for each reported ventilation setting, and how close it
    is to the best fit line. The advantage of a digital twin combining historic manually
    recorded data of the farm settings and the energy readings is apparent here: the
    dashboard can output ventilation rates rather than energy consumption, and advice
    on ventilation change can be translated into settings on the dial. (2) Figure
    13. The extraction fan. Although the recorded fan settings enable us to infer
    the effect of changing the control setting on the energy use of the fan, the influence
    of the fan on the internal environment is not so clear because the fan power has
    been consistently changed with external temperature. This is shown in Figure 14
    for temperature and RH, where the “Top bench” sensor represents conditions in
    the farm against Met Office weather data for St James’ Park. The x-axis shows
    the different ranges of energy use of the extraction fan 2 at Clapham Common between
    11 am and 5 pm when the lights are off, which can be related to the speed of the
    fan with Equation (2). The extraction fans in the farm are generally set at lower
    speed (3–6 kWh) only when the external temperature is under 5°C and the RH is
    over 75%. The fans are on high power (24 kWh) when the daytime external temperatures
    exceed 20°C. Despite this confounding effect, the results show that the fans influence
    internal conditions: the fan on full power (30 kWh) controls overheating during
    periods of high external temperatures, as mean temperatures in the farm were on
    average 2 cooler than outside, with corresponding humidity levels. Figure 14.

    and 4 pm for different ranges of energy use of extraction fan 2°C at Clapham Common.
    6. Data Models: Forecasting and Feedback of Farm Temperature The added value of
    a digital twin over a simple monitoring and enriched data visualization system
    is the ability to integrate forecasting models onto the data platform. Rather
    than giving a simple reactive warning based on threshold temperature or energy
    readings, the tool can suggest targeted operational changes for the next 12 and
    24 hr, and feedback on causes and effects of the farm performance and operations
    (Figure 1). Specifically, forecasting internal temperatures could enable the farm
    operators to dynamically reduce the ventilation if the farm is likely to be too
    cold, temporarily add a heater in a specific location, or trial different light
    settings. In turn, the digital twin can provide feedback on the effectiveness
    of the measures taken. This differentiates from typical CEA predictive control
    models where the modifications to the control processes (heating, ventilation),
    are automatically regulated as a response to short-term temperature forecasts
    (Coelho et al., Reference Coelho, De Moura Oliveira and Cunha 2005). Whereas this
    digital twin will not actuate any equipment, it can transparently provide longer
    term forecast and decision-making assistance with control processes that are not
    available in the control system (such as in this case the ventilation system and
    mobile heaters), and that are robust to human error (i.e., control panel being
    inadvertently switched off). Advice can be specific to the needs of the farm,
    which as we have seen in Section 4, for GU this is when temperatures are likely
    to exceed the temperatures of 18, 24°C. 6.1. Brief review of temperature forecasting
    Until the late 90s, temperatures in greenhouses were kept at fixed setpoints,
    in order to keep the mean temperature within range. Chalabi et al. ( Reference
    Chalabi, Bailey and Wilkinson 1996) proposed the first real-time control algorithm
    to minimize energy use by combining weather forecasts with a heat and mass balance
    model. For typical greenhouses, Litago et al. ( Reference Litago, Baptista, Meneses,
    Navas, Bailey and Sánchez-Girón 2005) found temperatures correlated most with
    solar radiation, external air temperature, and ventilation rate, while humidity
    was most related to evapotranspiration, ventilation rate, and external relative
    humidity. Litago et al. ( Reference Litago, Baptista, Meneses, Navas, Bailey and
    Sánchez-Girón 2005) used these correlations to inform a statistical model of the
    heat and mass balance equations. Indoor “online” short-term temperature forecasts
    (2–3 hr) have been developed successfully for buildings using time series data,
    particularly with auto-regressive integrated moving average models with exogenous
    inputs (ARX with Moving Average [ARIMAX]) (Kramer et al., Reference Kramer, van
    Schijndel and Schellen 2012). For greenhouses, AutoRegressive with exogenous inputs
    (ARX), ARMAX have been demonstrated to have good accuracy over 2–3 hr windows
    (3°C) (Uchida Frausto et al., Reference Uchida Frausto, Pieters and Deltour 2003;
    Patil et al., Reference Patil, Tantau and Salokhe 2008), with an external temperature
    being more influential than solar radiation. More recently, neural network-based
    nonlinear autoregressive models were found to be more accurate than ARX in Uchida
    Frausto and Pieters ( Reference Uchida Frausto and Pieters 2004) (root mean squared
    error [RMSE] of 1.7°C for 1 hr horizon) and Mustafaraj et al. ( Reference Mustafaraj,
    Lowry and Chen 2011) for short-term forecasting of greenhouses and office buildings,
    respectively. In a more recent application to a greenhouse, Francik and Kurpaska
    ( Reference Francik and Kurpaska 2020) used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to
    forecast temperatures to reduce energy use, and achieved average RMSE values of
    2.9°C over a 1 hr forecasting horizon. Zamora-Martínez et al. ( Reference Zamora-Martínez,
    Romeu, Botella-Rocamora and Pardo 2014) found that online-learning of temperature
    forecasts using complex ANN models had worse behaviors than with simpler models
    with less parameters. The most important temperatures to predict in GU are when
    temperatures cross optimal bounds. Gustin et al. ( Reference Gustin, McLeod and
    Lomas 2018) showed that ARIMAX models could give reasonably accurate forecasts
    for extreme temperatures (RMSE = 0.82°C for a 72 hr forecast horizon) when forecasting
    temperatures inside a house for heat waves, to warn occupants to open windows.
    On the other hand, Ashtiani et al. ( Reference Ashtiani, Mirzaei and Haghighat
    2014) compared ANN and ARX models for extreme temperatures in dwellings in Montreal
    and had an RMSE of 1.76 and 2.1°C, respectively, as neither model could fully
    capture all the parameters explaining why temperature would peak. Although the
    forecasting accuracy of the models developed in the studies was good (Uchida Frausto
    et al., Reference Uchida Frausto, Pieters and Deltour 2003; Ríos-Moreno et al.,
    Reference Ríos-Moreno, Trejo-Perea, Castañeda-Miranda, Hernández-Guzmán and Herrera-Ruiz
    2007; Mustafaraj et al., Reference Mustafaraj, Chen and Lowry 2010), they have
    been primarily developed to improve HVAC system control in air-conditioned spaces
    where there is detailed information available regarding their operation, and they
    have access to expensive variables such as transpiration rate and solar radiation
    to complete heat and mass balance based forecasts. As such their use cannot be
    directly transposed to urban-integrated farms such as GU, where space conditioning
    is used but operation schedules are far more unpredictable than in conventional
    greenhouses. 6.2. Forecasting methodology As the farm managers tend to check the
    dashboard and sensor data at the beginning and end of the work-day, these are
    the two best times to provide a forecast. Thus, the forecasts are generated at
    4 am for the first workers who arrive at 6 am to aid in decision-making of the
    farm operations of the day; and at 4 pm to warn and inform about the possible
    conditions that would happen overnight just before the workers leave while maintaining
    a 12 hr difference between the two forecasts. Although there are sensors in many
    different locations in the farm, in this demonstration stage we limit the selection
    of the forecasting methodology on the temperatures of the sensor at Column 18,
    top bench. Hereafter referred as the “farm temperature” , this is the location
    with the least missing data for the entire monitoring period. The forecasting
    models are fitted with 1 year of the available data, as this captures the yearly
    and daily seasonal effects. For each new forecast, the model coefficients are
    thus newly fitted to the latest data available, with up to 1 year. In this section,
    two forecasting models are compared: static seasonal autoregressive moving average
    models (SARIMA), and dynamic linear models (DLM). SARIMA models are parsimonious
    and have been shown to be effective in similar settings, that is, for forecasting
    extreme temperatures (Gustin et al., Reference Gustin, McLeod and Lomas 2018).
    In comparison, DLM utilizes far more parameters which adds flexibility in the
    modeling, but may result in less stable forecasts. The SARIMA model is only trained
    on farm temperature data, while the DLM model also uses energy use data from the
    CP meter to derive the lights proxy. We compare these models to identify their
    suitability and fitness for the underground farm temperature prediction and feedback
    system on a test dataset of 24 days, evenly spread across 2018. The forecasts
    are only evaluated for the test datasets. 6.2.1. Static seasonal model The SARIMA
    models are a family of time series models which fit linear coefficients to a time
    series using the Maximum Likelihood method. A SARIMA model is of the form (p,d,q)
    × (P,D,Q), where p is the number of auto-regressive terms, d is the order of differencing,
    and q is the number of moving average terms. The seasonal component captures the
    seasonal dynamics of the model, here set to a 24 hr period, where (P,D,Q) are
    the seasonal equivalents to (p,d,q). SARIMA models use differencing (terms d and
    D) to give a series that is stationary in mean and autocovariance. Removing the
    daily seasonal pattern in by taking one 24-hr seasonal difference, the data passed
    the Augmented Dickey–Fuller Test. The optimal model order for each day was identified
    using the auto.arima function from the forecast package (Hyndman and Khandakar,
    Reference Hyndman and Khandakar 2008), where the model order was chosen for each
    version to minimize the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The most common order
    identified over 400 daily forecasts was SARIMA(3,0,2)[24](2,1,0), but this varied
    depending on the AIC for different model orders. We note that as this model uses
    only the temperature information, it could be used when data are not captured
    from other sensors and monitors. 6.2.2. Dynamic linear models SARIMA models work
    well in instances where the data follow a strict seasonal pattern. In this case,
    although the lighting schedule is designed to repeat daily, there are changes
    to this pattern as discussed in Section 5.1. As the data do not follow the strict
    seasonal pattern expected in SARIMA modeling, we also develop a bespoke modeling
    solution that incorporates additional data recorded in the farm. Thus, we consider
    a DLM that uses a state-space approach and can explicitly allow for data-driven
    seasonal components. We employ a DLM with time-varying mean and changing seasonal
    component of the form: (3) where is the farm temperature at time . The mean varies
    according to a random walk with , as do each of the seasonal state variables,
    with . For a comprehensive introduction to dynamic modeling of time series see
    West and Harrison ( Reference West and Harrison 1997). The time-varying mean,
    , represents a base temperature within the farm which we expect to be related
    to external temperature and ventilation. Generally, a DLM features a seasonal
    component with a fixed frequency contribution, such as a 24-hr cycle similar to
    the SARIMA model. Rather than using a traditional fixed frequency seasonal component,
    we apply a data-driven component, , that contains the information about the lighting
    schedule inferred from the energy meter readings, without referring to the time
    of day or expected photo-period cycle. has entries indicating the hour in the
    photo-period to which corresponds to (i.e., the th hour that the lights are on
    or off). This allows for changes to the scheduled lighting such as the lights
    being switched on earlier, or for longer, to be explicitly modeled in this DLM.
    The inferred lighting schedule is generated using the energy meter readings, as
    described in Section 5.1. This Lights proxy can also be used to forecast future
    temperatures under different conditions, either with the typical lighting schedule
    or the actual lighting settings that occurred in that time period, inferred from
    the energy readings. Although in reality, the future energy readings are not available,
    changes to the lighting schedule may be known in advance so that this type of
    forecast can be generated. Bayesian inference was used for fitting this model
    and generating predictions. Conjugate inverse-Gamma prior distributions are used
    for the variance components and and MCMC inference is performed using the bsts
    package (Scott, Reference Scott 2020). Inference on the state components is performed
    using 1,000 iterations of the chain, and the first 200 iterations are discarded
    as burn-in. By allowing the state components in to evolve over time we can capture
    the behavior shown in Figure 11, as the lights cause different rates of increase
    and decrease in according to the external temperature. If were constant then features
    such as a plateau in temperatures being reached quicker in summer would not be
    captured, as in that case the daily component would not change through the year.
    Using output of the DLM we can thus investigate the posterior distribution of
    these lighting components at different times of year. In Figure 15 the change
    of temperature from the previous hour is plotted for the following cases: after
    the lights have been turned on for one, and for 5 hr (left and middle panels),
    and in the first hour of being turned off (right panel). They are separated for
    the months of February, June, and October 2018, where the corresponding average
    outdoor are 6.7, 18.6, and 11.1°C. From this plot, the different effects over
    the year of the lights on temperature can be seen, which is in agreement with
    Figure 11. The model fits a greater increase in temperature for the first hour
    the lights are on in June compared to the other months. The change of temperature
    for the fifth hour the lights are on is less on the warmer days compared to February,
    as when it is colder the farm temperature takes a greater number of hours after
    the lights are turned on to reach a plateau. In contrast, the decrease in temperature
    on the first hour the lights are switched off is greater in February than in the
    warmer months. Using a model with changing lighting component parameters thus
    allows for these changes to be modeled. Figure 15. Temperature changes from the
    previous hour when the lights have been on for 1 hr (left), 5 hr (middle), and
    for the first hour without lighting (right), for February, June, and October.
    This model is flexible and able to accommodate changes in the operating conditions,
    such as external temperature and ventilation settings, without explicitly modeling
    them. 6.3. Evaluation criteria The model is evaluated on a test dataset of 24
    days, the 1st and 15th of every month in 2018. The test dataset is chosen to be
    evenly spread out over the year to check if the performance changes despite the
    different conditions in the farm over the year (i.e., different ventilation, lighting
    schedules, and weather). Only 24 forecasts are generated because the average running
    time of the DLM model is 25 min, even though the SARIMA model is much faster (2.8
    min on average). The focus of the statistics is on the forecasting horizon to
    assess the performance of the models had they been implemented in real-time. The
    different forecasts from the DLM models are thus compared with forecasts from
    the SARIMA model for each of these days. We also compare the forecasts from the
    two models against a naive forecast repeating the previous day’s observations.
    The summary statistics are reported in Table 2, over a 48 hr forecasting horizon,
    for the morning and afternoon forecasts. The prediction performance of the models
    is evaluated in terms of general fit using the RMSE, mean absolute error (MAE),
    mean bias error (MBE), and coverage rate (CR) when estimating whether the temperatures
    on the following day will escape the desired 18–24°C interval. Table 2. Mean statistic
    of 24 daily forecasts of the four following models (1st and 15th of every month
    in 2018): (a) the previous 24 hr as forecast, (b) Seasonal Arima model, (c) DLM
    model using observed light pattern, (d) DLM model using the typical light pattern
    expected for the given day. Bold values highlight the statistic suggesting the
    most accurate model type. Standard deviation from the mean of the statistic across

    b Standard deviation from the mean of statistic over forecasted days. The metrics
    are defined in Equations (4)–(6), where denotes the predicted temperature and
    the observed temperature, and is the number of hours over which the statistic
    is computed. RMSE is the most commonly reported metric for assessing model performance.
    It gives more weight to the largest errors by taking the square of the residuals,
    which is desirable in this case as the focus is on capturing extreme temperatures
    as accurately as possible. (4) Some analysts judge the MAE, which represents the
    average magnitude of the residuals, to be a more precise performance indicator
    (Willmott and Matsuura, Reference Willmott and Matsuura 2005; Chai and Draxler,
    Reference Chai and Draxler 2014). (5) The MBE indicates the systematic error of
    the model to over or under forecast. (6) The CR corresponded to the percentage
    of estimated points which fell within the 95% confidence or credible interval
    (CI). For the naive forecast using the previous day, the CI is estimated using
    the standard deviation of the temperatures from the previous day as from the forecast
    temperature. For GU it is also important to know whether the temperatures will
    escape the desired temperature interval, when, and for how long. To predict these
    probabilities, for the SARIMA model, we forecast using bootstrapped values of
    the error distribution, and averaged the number of these bootstrapped forecasts
    that were over 24°C and under 18°C. We could thus compare the forecasts with the
    mean number of hours that were predicted wrongly to be under 18°C , or over 24°C
    . These could be also estimated from the probability distribution output from
    the DLM forecasts. To compare the calibration of this probability, we report the
    proportion of forecasts where a probability greater than 0.7 correctly predicted
    that the temperature crossed 24°C , or 18°C , and that a probability less than
    0.7 gave a true negative. For the naive forecast, the probability is taken as
    1 if the temperatures on the previous day crossed either threshold within the
    same 12 hr window as the forecast. 6.4. Model comparison The accuracy of temperature
    predictions based on the DLM with inferred photo-period is compared with the predictions
    of the DLM using the fixed lighting schedule. We also compare the predictions
    against the SARIMA model presented in the previous section (Figure 16). The statistics
    taken on the prediction errors for each of these forecasts are presented in Table
    2. Figure 16. Plot of 24-hr forecast from 4 pm (hour 0), with 24 hr preceding,
    for lowest and highest RMSE values. Top: Hourly external temperature (orange),
    overlayed with 24 hr average (black). Middle: Predictions against observed data,
    with annotated message output for farmers, indicating if temperature was higher
    or lower than expected in 12 hr forecast horizon. Bottom: Values of fan 1 and
    2 are estimated ACH (Equation (2)). Lights proxy and energy from lights are dimensionless.
    The performance of the SARIMA model and the DLM with typical lights (models b
    and c respectively in Table 2) is quite similar, and the model fit for 24 hr performed
    well compared with previous forecasting models for greenhouse temperatures, with
    an average RMSE under 1.3°C for all predicted days. For the 12-hr morning forecasts,
    SARIMA (RMSE = 0.81°C) outperformed the DLM model with observed lighting (RMSE
    = 0.94°C). On the other hand, this DLM improved upon the SARIMA model for the
    afternoon forecast (RMSE = 0.72 compared with 0.97°C). As the DLM explicitly uses
    the lighting schedule, it is fitting that the DLM should be better than SARIMA
    in the afternoon forecast, just before the lights are expected to turn on at 5
    pm. Both SARIMA and DLM models had significantly better fits than the naive forecast,
    which has comparatively high RMSE values. Only 36% of observed temperature fell
    within the CI with the naive method, compared to 94% on average for all the other
    models. This demonstrates both the SARIMA and DLM models add valuable accuracy
    to the temperature forecasts. Comparisons between the SARIMA and DLM forecasts
    for days with the five lowest RMSE values (<0.56°C) in Figure 16a, and for the
    5 days with the highest RMSE values (RMSE > 1.94°C) in Figure 16b. Each figure
    is divided into three panels, A, B, and C. The x-axis denotes the hour count from
    4 pm, where 0 is the first hour of the forecast. Panel A shows the hourly external
    temperature in orange, with its average daily mean in black. Panel B presents
    the farm temperature (black dashed line), and the forecasts from the three different
    models: SARIMA, DLM typical lights (with the typical light schedule), and DLM
    observed lights (with the inferred light schedule from the lights proxy). The
    interpretations of lights and fan power from the energy meter readings are plotted
    in panel C. The black and orange lines are the estimated ACH of fan 1 and fan
    2, respectively, calculated from Equation (2). Their extent is marked on the y-axis,
    from 0 ACH (no ventilation) to 4.5 ACH (max ventilation). The lights pattern is
    also indicated on panel C, where 4 on the y-axis indicates the lights are on (lights
    proxy in pink). The estimated energy use of the lights is also plotted, where
    30 kWh is normalized to 4 to show how the lights proxy captures the lighting condition
    from the meter readings (see Section 5 for details). The similarity between the
    SARIMA and DLM models in Figure 16a shows that when the lighting schedule is close
    to what is expected, the simpler SARIMA model would suffice for prediction. However,
    on January 15, 2018, plotted in Figure 16b, the benefit of the added complexity
    of DLM can be seen, as there is the ability to closely forecast the effect of
    turning the lights on later than expected. Indeed, the lights proxy in panel C
    shows the lights were off for 18 hr rather than the typical 6 hr. The difference
    between predictions based on inferred lighting from observed data and the typical
    lighting schedule shows that the data-centric lighting component is utilized in
    the dynamic model. The inferred lighting schedule improves the accuracy of the
    prediction compared to the observed values in almost all statistics of Table 2
    (model d). While the forecast is close to the observed temperatures for typical
    days across all models, the predictions from the dynamic model are better at capturing
    the extreme temperatures reached in the farm, exemplified by the and statistics
    giving more accurate temperature warnings than the SARIMA model. In general, the
    forecasting performance of the SARIMA and DLM modeling are similar. However on
    days with atypical lighting (or in the days following atypical lighting) the DLM
    approach gives more accurate prediction. In addition, this model could be used
    to simulate the effect of different lighting schedules without carrying out the
    experiment in practice. 6.5. Application of forecasting model to aid decision-making
    Whilst the temperature forecasting alone is useful, more insight can be gained
    when combined with a feedback system in this digital twin framework. The forecasts
    and live temperature readings can be compared, and discrepancies identified in
    real-time. For instance, when running the SARIMA forecasts for 400 consecutive
    days, we found that all days where temperatures were uncharacteristically badly
    predicted were linked to an uncharacteristic change of external temperature, energy
    use, or door setting. This is shown in Figure 16b in the subplots for January
    15, 2018, when the bias (−5.46°C) was significantly larger than the next largest
    bias (−0.83°C), and is linked to an extended nighttime period in the farm. Feedback
    would include a warning that temperatures are lower than the forecast and therefore
    changes to heating and ventilation should be made so crop growth is not impacted,
    such as the bias messages in panel B of Figure 16. For illustration, in the subfigure
    of Figure 16a for 1st November October 2018, the forecast issued at 4 am would
    include a warning message that temperatures were 0.31°C lower than forecast in
    the previous 12 hr, despite a 2.5°C increase in external temperature, and no apparent
    change in controls (fan 1 and fan 2 have constant ACH and the lighting pattern
    was as scheduled). While this shows the models captured the increasing trend in
    external temperature, the forecast error shows that some farm controls were not
    predicted. In this case, the lower temperatures could be due to inadvertently
    open doors somewhere in the farm, and thus trigger a warning. Over time, additional
    variables can be incorporated into the forecast model according to the feedback
    generated by comparing the forecasts and observed temperatures. Various operational
    processes in the farm changed throughout the model testing period (see Section
    5) which have excited the training data, but the data-centric modeling has shown
    to be resilient to such change, as the forecast error did not vary significantly
    over the testing period. As such, the dynamic model is particularly valuable in
    this start-up environment, as it is flexible to the changing operations due to
    its time-varying mean , which can account for the varying external temperature
    and ventilation. By separating the trend with the effect from the lights, the
    DLM methodology can also be used to test the effect of different lighting schedules,
    enabling farm operators to make better-informed decisions. This overcame one of
    the limitations of the dataset, where the effect of weather and ventilation appeared
    to be correlated. Although the growing lights were on for 18 hr the majority of
    days, there was variation of the time at which the lights came on and off. For
    instance, our lights proxy estimates the lights came on an hour later than planned
    26% of the time, and came off with an hour earlier 46% of the time (Figure 12).
    As such, the training data were excited to a reasonable extent to assume the robustness
    of this methodology to predict typical conditions. The conditions in the farm
    are not subject to an automatic control system, but managed manually by farm operatives.
    Therefore information such as the power increase of using the extraction fan and
    the probability of high temperatures can be used in combination to make informed
    decisions about what changes should be made in the farm. As these changes can
    only be applied during the working day in the farm, the model can also aid decision-making
    about whether automating certain equipment would be worth the additional cost,
    as then changes could occur when operatives are not present. Furthermore, as in
    the case of January 15, 2015 when the lighting system was left on “manual” by
    mistake, the model can warn the user about the failure of the control system,
    as well as its effect on environmental conditions, and relate these to the potential
    crop growth outcome. Although automation helps, having this extra level allows
    to catch and understand the implications of inevitable manual errors and unprecedented
    change. 7. Discussion The digital twin presented here proposes a framework for
    urban-integrated farms to collect data and use it meaningfully. Unlike current
    visualization dashboards or CEA systems, we presented an integrated system linking
    a broad data collection system, with tailored data analytics and modeling. A key
    challenge for a successful digital twin is continuous data collection. However,
    not all information can be tracked with sensors, and we presented a method for
    combining data from different sources into a database, and inferring operational
    changes in GU. We then showed how historic data could create a virtual representation
    of the farm operations and environment. Previous models forecasting environmental
    conditions in greenhouses tend to show much more yearly seasonal variation with
    external weather conditions, but in GU, the artificial lighting has the strongest
    influence on temperature, causing an indoor diurnal pattern opposite to the external
    daily temperature pattern, which complicates the use of traditional seasonal decomposition
    techniques as many explanatory variables are confounded. The buffer effect of
    depth further meant that the influence of external temperature was less than conventionally
    found. We found that forecasting temperatures in the farm were best achieved with
    a DLM featuring a time-varying mean with a data-centric lighting component. Although
    there is a vast literature in temperature forecasting, the variety in performance
    of different models for similar environments highlights the need to create bespoke
    models that are suited to the specific environment, user needs, and data available.
    Digital twins rely on a constant stream of input data, and thus robust network
    connectivity, a long-term sensor maintenance plan, and a diverse data collection
    system. Innovative projects, such as this urban-integrated hydroponic farm, are
    unlikely to have fully controlled systems as farm operators learn how to use their
    unique environments. This leads to changes which can be tracked through observed
    data. For example, the base energy usage increased in 2018 as the farm was extended,
    and more lights became “online.” Monitoring a few variables from the beginning
    allows to identify other key variables that would be useful at a later stage:
    here, further sub-meters could improve forecasting accuracy. Digital twins thus
    need to be built with resilience and flexibility in mind, to add new sensors as
    funding and technology become available. For instance, future work will include
    incorporating light sensors that were added at a later date in the farm, to replace
    the light proxy used in the DLM forecasts. The main limitation of data-centric
    models in commercial environments is that they can only forecast and feedback
    on eventualities that have happened. Were the farm to test different lighting
    regimes at different times of day, and different ventilation rates over prolonged
    periods of time in different weather conditions, more could be learned about the
    response of the farm environment to controls. However, the realities of a commercial
    CEA imply that operators will always try to keep conditions within their optimal
    ranges, whether this is done automatically through control systems, or partially
    manually as in this case. The benefit of digital twins is to provide an “extra
    level,” where unexpected changes can be tracked, as well as their effect on other
    variables (e.g., ventilation on too high). By being a virtual extension of the
    reality in the farm, it also allows to compare current conditions with historical
    data to provide meaningful information to assist in decision-making. In this paper,
    we showed the challenges and opportunities of creating a digital twin, which lie
    in data collection, data interpretation, and tailored modeling. As opposed to
    simple data visualization, digital twins provide an opportunity to enhance the
    data by outputting inferred data fields. Bespoke models can be implemented on
    a platform that can harness the breadth of data collection, be it structured or
    unstructured. While this prototype is addressed to urban-integrated farming, it
    serves as an example for digital twins of non-standard physical environments and
    processes. We argue that more standard environments, such as traffic systems or
    construction processes, may benefit more from off-the-shelf software which represents
    the process well. Digital twins are particularly useful in environments where
    the specifics of the process are not so well understood (e.g., in buildings, for
    representations of a street). In such cases, data-centric methods are pertinent
    because they can represent the unobservable states through data streams, and thus
    provide additional insight. The framework described here is suited to mid to large
    scale processes, often seen in civil engineering, where sensor maintenance will
    also be an issue and several processes will be of concurrent interest. As every
    environment is different, digital twins are an opportunity to move away from “one
    size fits all” approaches and tailor the information display to match needs and
    available data. Funding Statement This work was supported by the Engineering and

    1 INTRODUCTION The economy of many nations and the quality of life of their people
    generally depend on agriculture. Cereal grains are edible seeds from plants of
    the grass family. Globally, around 2.4 billion tons of grains, oilseeds, and legumes
    are produced annually. The grains need to be stored safely until processing, marketing,
    replanting, consumption, or other secondary purposes. Good monitoring and control
    of storage facilities is important to farmers and governments all over the world
    as they ensure household and community food security and provides opportunity
    for value addition. Though considerable losses occur in the field, the greatest
    losses are noticed during storage. During the storage period, the losses recorded
    are usually due to the response of the stored grains to environmental factors.
    To ensure good economic and trade-off market return for grains, safe storage must
    be provided to avoid spoilage. Proper storage management and good quality grains
    are required to ensure high marketability and economic returns on grains (Jayas,
    Paliwal, & Visen, 2000); (Onibonoje, Kehinde, & Owolarafe, 2015). While in storage,
    temperature, humidity, and light predominantly affect grains quality except when
    attacked by pests (Jayas & Ghosh, 2006); (Kubisch, Karl, Wolisz, Zhong, & Rabaey,
    2003); (Onibonoje, Jubril, & Owolarafe, 2012). Insects and molds are the two prominent
    spoilers of stored grains and are influenced by these environmental factors. According
    to Onibonoje et al. (2012), Kumar, Hiremath, and Rakhee (2012), and Hariprabha
    and Vasantharathna (2014): moisture content (MC) is a crucial physical factor
    to be considered in ensuring quality storage of grains. MC parameterizes humidity
    and temperature, and determines the extent and speed of fungi development and
    subsequent damage of the grains. Grain MC affects the quality storability and
    shelf life of grains, which subsequently affects market prices and premiums (Deshpande,
    Guestrin, Madden, Hellerstein, & Hong, 2004; Dhillon & Chakrabarty, 2003; Digi
    XBee, 2018; Dludla, Abu-Mahfouz, Kruger, & Isaac, 2013; Galande, Agrawal, & Anap,
    2015). In agricultural storage and management of grains, various systems had been
    designed and deployed. Maier and Woloshuk (2010) had earlier reported about Sanitation,
    Bin Loading, Aeration and Monitoring System and Wired-probe monitoring system.
    Dong, Li, Liu, Guo, and Tang (2014) developed a Wireless CC2430 and SHT11-based
    ZigBee system. Suryawanshi and Kumbhar (2014) developed a SY-HS-220/Ethernet-based
    model system, while Deshpande et al. (2004) presented a report on the use of an
    embedded platform for the monitoring the storage conditions of food grain. Wang,
    Xu, Takahara, and Hassanein (2006) and Wang, Zhang, and Wang (2014) also discussed
    a multisensor integrated system for the monitoring and controlling of stored-grain
    conditions, while Onibonoje et al. (2012) developed a wireless measuring system
    for MC in bulk grains stored in a silo. Kumar et al. (2012) and Surendra and Kishore
    (2014) developed an ARM-9-based system for granary environmental monitoring and
    control. Galande et al. (2015) reported the use of an embedded monitoring system
    based an ARM-11. The various systems were observed to have inherent limitations
    and challenges which included uneven coverage, cost ineffectiveness, cumbersome
    operability, high installation cost, prone to damage, hazardousness, nonrecyclability
    and limited coverage, high maintenance cost, high node failure rate, energy constraint,
    and offline data collection (nonreal time). Many corrective measures were introduced
    to mitigate the inherent weaknesses of the discussed systems. Hempstead, Tripathi,
    Mauro, Wei, and Brooks (2005), Sinha and Chandrakasan (2001), Onibonoje (2019),
    and Ottman, Hofmann, and Lesieutre (2003) had reported the use of power management
    techniques, while Ye, Heidemann, and Estrin (2004) and Ali, Al Bulushi, Nadir,
    and Hussain (2018) reported the use of medium access control protocols. Heinzelman,
    Kulik, and Balakrishnan (1999), Zhang and Arora (2003), Di Pietro, Mancini, and
    Jajodia (2003), Cheng, Gao, Zhang, and Yang (2019), and Di Pietro, Ma, Soriente,
    and Tsudik (2008) also discussed the use of routing (self-healing) protocols to
    mitigate the problems. Hempstead et al. (2005), Darroudi, Caldera-Sanchez, and
    Gomez (2019), and Yoo, Ta, Jang, and Oh (2019) proposed an ultralow power system
    architecture for sensor network applications, while Seah, Eu, and Tan (2009) developed
    a wireless sensor networks (WSNs) powered by ambient energy harvesting. Gomez,
    Veras, Vidal, Casals, and Paradells (2019) proposed a sigfox energy consumption
    Model. Zhang et al. (2016a), (2016b) and Huiling, Yu, and Jingyun (2011) discussed
    the possibility of using ubiquitous WSNs system, while Di Pietro et al. (2008)
    and Du, Gong, Wang, and Xu (2019) proposed a cooperative and noncooperative routing
    protocol-based system, respectively, to solve route repair problems. However,
    these corrective measures are limited by factors which include additional data
    acquisition delay incurred in a dynamic environment, imposition of high algorithm
    overhead in the network, and nonprovision for explicit route repair. Therefore,
    a WSN with finest considerations in a distributed scheme is a complete platform
    to ensure quality granary systems. As indicated by Bokare and Ralegaonkar (2012),
    Dong et al. (2014), Hariprabha and Vasantharathna (2014), and Kumar et al. (2009),
    a WSN is a network of wireless devices being referred to as end nodes or sensor
    which incorporate sensing, processing, and communication capabilities. This network
    of nodes is useful in executing various tasks in different application fields,
    including storage condition monitoring. It has been explained that small-scale
    farmers and marketers of grains in rural areas do not have access to effective
    storage facilities. Existing systems and measures applied in the monitoring of
    stored grains do not adequately solve the problems of data acquisition delay,
    inefficient coverage of the grain storage bins, high cost of installation and
    maintenance, high-energy consumption, and high rate of node failure. Achieving
    optimal trade-offs among these competing issues is an important need (Onibonoje,
    Ojo, & Ejidokun, 2019). Also, record information on the selection of best comparative
    components for wireless granary monitoring systems are not readily available.
    This study proposes to address these limitations. In this work, a distributed
    system that incorporated a network consisting of wireless sensor nodes (SNs),
    designed with well-selected modules and inventive capacities is developed to achieve
    optimal trade-offs in solving some of the inherent limitations of the previous
    systems. A mini storage facility for grains is also designed and constructed according
    to standard considerations for a pilot test. Moreover, the study deployed the
    developed system with efficient coverage in the constructed mini bin and monitored
    the environmental factors affecting the quality of the stored grains over a time
    frame. The study contributes to quality bulk grains storability by providing information
    on selection of best components for wireless monitoring systems. The optimal trade-offs
    among coverage efficiency, reduced power consumption, reduced cost, real-time
    monitoring, and longer node life are evaluated. The remaining part of this article
    is structured in the order: 3 surveys related work. 4 reports the methods and
    designs in the entire study. In 5, the implementation, results, discussion, and
    evaluation are presented while 17 concludes this article. 2 RELATED GRANARY WORKS
    THAT EMPLOY WSN A review of related works that deploy WSNs to granary systems
    is briefly discussed. Dong et al. (2014) developed wireless CC2430 and SHT11-based
    ZigBee system. Suryawanshi and Kumbhar (2014) developed a system for monitoring
    and controlling food grain storage in which both wired and wireless options were
    implemented in order to take advantages of both. If wired network crashes then
    there would be implementation of wireless connectivity to access the status of
    granary. Hariprabha and Vasantharathna (2014), Parvin, Gawanmeh, and Venkatraman
    (2018), and Shelar and Shaligram (2017) proposed an integrated system to monitor
    and control the environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and light illumination
    of food depots using WSNs. Huiling et al. (2011) developed a smart and automated
    system capable of measuring and controlling the grains conditions in real time.
    The system employed ZigBee technology in a validation process of a mathematical
    model. Most of these applications of WSN in granaries suffer from limitations
    and challenges as earlier highlighted. Hence, there is the need to ensure optimal
    trade-offs in the mitigation of these limitations for efficient system implementations.
    3 SYSTEM DESIGN AND MATERIALS At the heart of the system are optimal trade-offs
    in design and implementation as well as efficiency in deployment of WSN to ensure
    quality stored agricultural grains. The block diagram of the developed system
    is as presented in Figure 1. The distributed WSN system consists of six SNs and
    one sink node. The SNs are localized at predetermined points in the designed storage
    bin for the bulk grains. The sink node initializes and coordinates the network
    as well as acts as the data gateway for the entire system. There was also a general
    packet radio services (GPRS) module attached to the coordinator for data communication
    to a mobile phone. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Block diagram of
    the wireless sensor network 3.1 Selection of component units The hardware unit
    of the system was designed for best performance by selecting appropriate components
    for the SN, coordinator, and the alert module. For the various categories of the
    hardware unit, different components were compared, and the best among them were
    selected within varying considered characteristics as reported by Onibonoje, Alli,
    Olowu, Ogunlade, and Akinwumi (2016). 3.2 Software design and implementation The
    software unit of the system is designed with the configuration of the transceiver
    modules, and the setting up of the network for optimal performance of the system.
    Also, the performance of the Arduino Pro mini in the SNs and the Seeeduino in
    the coordinator are being optimized through programming. 3.2.1 Nodes configuration
    The radio module of each node is configured in order to assign identification
    and operational interaction with other nodes within the network. XBee modules
    are configured locally through serial attention (AT) commands via XCTU (Configuration
    and Test Utility Software by Digi International). The AT commands are used to
    configure the XBee radios for the destination address, personal area network identification,
    sleep mode, and sleep period. The radio module in the coordinator was configured
    to work in application programming interface (API) mode while the other modules
    in the SNs were configured in AT mode. The XBee module in each SN was configured
    as an XBee end device plus router; enabling the nodes to be able to route their
    neighbor nodes information and slept when no action was required thereby saving
    energy. The flowchart of the configuration of each SN is as shown in Figure 2.
    The configuration started by initializing the sensors, the RF chip, and the network.
    Data were being read from the sensors and RF data packet being created for sensor
    identification and sensors data. The data packet was therefore sent through RF
    to the coordinator. While the SN was sending sensors data to the coordinator,
    it waited for a set time and returned to read the next values of sensors data;
    else, it waited for the next initializing frame from the network coordinator and
    ended. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flowchart of sensor node configuration
    3.2.2 Network configuration The network configuration was a modified mesh topology
    tagged Tree Mesh. The Tree Mesh was an adaptation of the DigiMesh protocol (over
    802.15.4) which set a peer-2-peer datagram of a distributed network in which all
    the nodes can communicate one to the other. The flowchart of the configuration
    of the network coordinator is as shown in Figure 3. The configuration started
    by initializing the RF chip, the network, and the serial port. The RF network
    was set up by the coordinator and waited for the SNs to join one after the other.
    If the coordinator received RF packet from any SN, it processed it and read the
    sensor ID and the sensors reading; else, it initiated the route repair and discovery
    scheme which is called ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV). The coordinator
    then sent the data to the serial port of the personal computer (PC). The system
    identified the communication (COM) port, and then log, display, and analyze the
    data through the developed user interface. Whenever the data exceeded the set
    limits, it connected to the GPRS module and sent an alert as a hub. The system
    then waited for a delay time and returned to receive the next RF packet from the
    nodes. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flowchart of configuration of
    coordinator network 3.2.3 Data collection Interface design The coordinator serially
    communicates with the PC; and an user interface is designed for collecting the
    received data. Serial interface protocols The XBee modules selected for this proposed
    system used serial communication which supported both transparent and API serial
    interfaces. Every transfer of information requires a protocol. The serial interface
    protocol implemented in this study was the API. The API provides alternative means
    to configure modules and route data at the host application layer. The module
    sent data frames to the application which contains status packets, source, and
    payload information from the data packets received. API operation required data
    being communicated in frames, and in a defined order. The coordinator module provided
    a serial interface to the RF link. It converted serial data to radio frequency
    (RF) data that was sent to other nodes in the network. The module interfaced with
    the host PC through a logic-level asynchronous serial port. The module could then
    communicate through its serial port, with logic and voltage compatible universal
    asynchronous receiver/transmitter, or through a level translator to any serial
    device or USB interface board. User interface design The user interface was the
    platform designed for human interaction, logging, analysis, and interpretation
    of the data collected. The graphical user interface (GUI) in this study was designed
    using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Environment Workbench (LabVIEW). LabVIEW is
    a graphical programming environment that was originally developed by National
    Instruments to implement virtual instruments. 3.3 Optimizing the system There
    were various techniques adopted to ensure robustness of the monitoring system.
    The measures included optimizing the power consumption in the SNs, error detection,
    and correction in the network, and communication route discovery and repair. Power
    consumption optimization: In order to ensure that the power consumption by the
    SNs was reduced, three different measures were taken. The XBee transceivers were
    configured for synchronous cyclic sleep; the Arduino boards were modified for
    power down mode and the power LEDs on the Arduino boards was disabled. Sleep configuration
    of XBee module: The transceiver module in each SN was configured to integrate
    into a cyclic sleep mode in the network. With reference to Digi XBee (2018), the
    synchronous sleep feature of modified DigiMesh protocol allows all the constituent
    nodes in the network to have their sleep and wake times synchronized. All synchronized
    cyclic sleep nodes entered and exited a low power state at the same time. This
    formed a cyclic sleeping network. The nodes are synchronized by receiving a special
    RF packet known as sync message. This message is sent by the network coordinator.
    At the launch of every wake period, the sleep coordinator would send one sync
    message as a broadcast. This broadcast is then repeated by every other network
    node. Each node sent its sensed data during wake period and reverted to sleep.
    The power consumption during sleep mode was negligible, thereby saving energy.
    The justification showing consumption of power during data receiving and sleep
    mode is as highlighted in subsection 3.6 (4). Power down mode of the Arduino board:
    The Arduino Pro mini in each SN was put in power down mode by installing a low-power
    library into the Arduino main library, and then included the argument low power.
    Power down (SLEEP 14395s, ADC OFF, BOD OFF). This disabled all unused peripheral
    on the board, thereby reducing power consumption. All chip functions were disabled
    until the next interrupt. The necessary interrupt and watchdog pins performed
    the level-change and wake-up functions on the microcontrollers. Power LEDs on
    the Arduino boards disabled: The two power LEDs on the Arduino boards consume
    a considerable power. These LEDs were disabled by breaking the connection lines
    to the two power LEDs. Error detection and correction: Error occurs in WSN due
    to data packet loss and delivery of spurious data. Reliable delivery of data in
    this study existed by a method called selective acknowledgment. The error detection
    and correction approach was an adaptation from combination of automatic repeat
    request approach and forward error correction approach. The acknowledgement in
    the approach was selective because only the coordinator can respond to a route
    request from a node. Route discovery and repair: To rebuild a possible broken
    link between any SN and the coordinator, AODV algorithm was used. The algorithm
    is as highlighted. The source node (SN which has lost a link with the coordinator),
    Node 1 initiates a process of rebuilding the lost path by sending a broadcast
    message to its neighboring nodes. The message is known as a route request packet.
    Whenever the route request is received by a neighboring node, it creates its discovery
    entries and resends the message as a broadcast. The process continues across the
    nodes within the network until the request message finally gets to the target
    destination, the coordinator Node 7. Each other node (2–6) creates its discovery
    entries whenever the request is received. Node 7 then generates a message as a
    route reply, and sends (not as a broadcast, but unicast). The immediate neighbor
    Node 6 is indicated in the discovery or rebuilding entry by the address of the
    sender. A table entry is generated for the routing process by Node 6 when the
    reply is received by it. Then, Node 6 unicast the reply to the sender address
    in its generated table entry. So, it continues until the reply reaches Node 1,
    the originator of the route request. A route entry is generated too. This ends
    the discovery process. The route from Node 1 to Node 7 is now reestablished and
    defined. The message can now be sent. 3.4 Distribution and localization of nodes
    It was noted that a successful network requires optimal determination of the location
    of each constituent SN, with the aim of creating reliable links within the network.
    The method in this research work was carried out according to the Zigzag Pattern
    Scheme Deployment Algorithm methods of Hawbani, Wang, Husaini, and Karmoshi (2014)
    and Hawbani and Wang (2013). The method indicated a very high coverage efficiency
    and least minimum node redundancy. As shown in Figure 4, it expanded and covered
    the whole interest area using least nodes number, and generated minimal redundancy
    in coverage. The algorithm reached the maximal and optimal coverage efficiency
    at the point of equality between the sensing range circumference for each node
    and the sum of its horizontal and vertical arc length. The main leverage factor
    for this localization method was that all nodes were homogenous with the same
    sensing range, communication range, and transmission power. The interest area
    was divided into W z number of Zigzag patterns: (1) (2) where c is the percentage
    of vertical overlapping between centers of two sensors deployed on the same zigzag
    pattern. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Zigzag pattern for localization
    of nodes The number of line segments in the pattern: (3) (4) where w is the width
    of interest area, r is the sensing radius of each node, and v is the percentage
    of horizontal overlapping between the centers of two adjacent sensors deployed
    horizontally in the same zigzag pattern. Each node was located either in the first
    level or in the second level. The SN k located on the line segment m at the zigzag
    pattern I is denoted by: . Its location is determined by: (5) The conclusions
    drawn with this approach were: optimal length of each line segment ; optimal angle
    of each corner = 60°; optimal percentage vertical overlapping c = 0.15; optimal
    percentage horizontal overlapping v = 0.15; Using the method in this work and
    Equations (1)–(5), the proposed design patterns for the distribution and localization
    of nodes within the storage facilities are as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Localization of nodes in the silo. (b, c) Single
    plane pattern of some nodes 3.5 Deployment of the silo and SNs The entire research
    work comprising of the silo, the grains, and the distributed WSN system was deployed
    in an unobstructed yard along Ede road, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The SNs were deployed
    at their locations in the silo as shown in Figure 5. SN was represented by SN,
    while the subscripts represented the node numbers. The selected grain: The type
    of grains selected and monitored was white Shelled Corn (species in Southwestern,
    Nigeria). The silo was filled with about 0.6 t of grains after the nodes had been
    fully installed. Duration of monitoring: The grains were monitored between 00:00
    January 23, 2017 and 12:00 April 2, 2017 (70 days across dry and rainy periods).
    Data were collected at the coordinator every 4 hr (12 a.m., 4 a.m., 8 a.m., 12 p.m.,
    4 p.m., and 8 p.m.) through the designed GUI on the PC. Data collection: Data
    were collected from four SNs, while the two remaining nodes only routed data.
    SNs (1 and 2) collected the grains parameters toward the base of the grains volume,
    SN 3 collected the grains parameters slightly beneath the surface of the grains
    volume, and SN 4 collected the temperature, humidity, and illumination parameters
    of the unfilled volume above the stored grains within the silo. SNs (5 and 6)
    were basically routers and their sensors were not connected. 3.6 Testing and evaluation
    of the designed system The various units of the system were tested and evaluated
    for functionality and accuracy with reference to the required criteria. In this
    work, the testing and evaluation were performed based on the following criteria:
    nodes data, node failure rate, real-time alertness, and network route repair.
    Characterizing the SNs: The SNs were characterized using five saturated salt solutions.
    The concentration of any saturated salt solution was constant at constant temperature.
    The five salts selected for the evaluation process were NaCl, KCl, NaNO3, K2CO3,
    and K2SO4. This work replicated and improved on the method in Onibonoje and Olowu
    (2017). The RH data collected from the SN at the different temperatures as showed
    then recorded and compared with empirical data in Greenspan (1977). Real-time
    data collection: The delivery time of data on the PC and receipt of alert on cell
    phone were evaluated. The approach also followed the method in Onibonoje and Olowu
    (2017). Data from SN 4 were acquired at the sink node and cell phone; and also
    simultaneously through the serial port of a PC. The delay time in the collection
    of the data was documented with the aid of stop clock. Coverage efficiency: The
    storage bin was evaluated for coverage efficiency based on the evaluation of the
    zigzag pattern coverage scheme deployed for the localization of the SNs in the
    silo. The interest area of the silo bin W n covered by SNs were points in two-dimensional
    space pattern. The set of sensors S k being deployed in the working area had a
    well-known location for each sensor. The singular objective in the coverage was
    to guarantee that every point P i was in the sensing range of a set of sensors
    S k. (6) (7) The actual coverage area for the nodes within the network was calculated
    as the union of each node''s coverage. Coverage efficiency was determined as the
    ratio of the union of individual node''s coverage and their sum. Node life estimation:
    The average time of the battery drain in each SN was estimated in order to determine
    node lifetime within the network. The power consumption of all the active peripherals
    in the SN was estimated. The approach facilitated the implementation of efficient
    sleep and wake time in the node''s configuration, and the modification of the
    microcontroller board for low power consumption. The node battery lifetime estimation
    aided in determining whether the monitoring network-based protocol would give
    an application level solution. The parameters of the active peripherals with respect
    to power consumption were as listed below. One SN was powered with 9 V alkaline
    battery with capacity 1,200 mAh; Arduino Pro Mini (low power and modified) consumed
    0.045 mA; DHT22 work current was 0.3 mA, and LDR work current was 0.25 mA; XBee
    transmit current was 45 mA; Work time duration of the sensors were less than 1
    s, and then transferred to sleep state; The node drawn current per second during
    transmit is lower than 45.6 mA; Total node drawn current would have been 50.29 mA
    with an unmodified active board. With the already modified microcontroller board,
    the total runs needed for the SN sending data (every second) were at least: (8)
    In this research work, the result of the node lifetime estimation (with sleeping
    configured transceivers), and data transmitted five times every 4 hr showed: (9)
    Grain data evaluation: The accuracy of the data collected was evaluated using
    the oven-drying method. This is a standard method to determine the moisture level
    chemically bound in grains. It has been established that when a sample of grains
    is kept in an oven at a recommended temperature and time, the grain has lost all
    but chemically bound water. Three grains samples were taken at different locations
    within the silo. The first sample was taken on January 30, 2017 at location 1.
    The second sample was taken on February 27, 2017 at Location 2. The third sample
    was taken on March 25, 2017 at Location 3. For each grain sample, it was weighed
    initially as w. The oven was warmed to 109°C before placing the grain sample in
    it, and it was operated within 72 hr before the removal of the sample. After removing
    the sample, dry anhydrous calcium sulfate was used to cover it and was put in
    a desiccator until its cooling prior to weighing. With the aid of a Mettler PC
    2000 electronic balance, there was a daily weighing of the sample, with an accuracy
    of 0.01 g in the device. Equilibrium was considered to have been attained at each
    instance whenever three identical consecutive measurements were obtained. These
    procedures were repeated for the two more samples taken at other two locations
    in the silo. All weighing were achieved in the nearest 0.1 g. At equilibrium,
    the weight value was detailed as d. The MC of the grains was determined on dry
    basis by using Equation (10). The result was then compared with the MC value of
    the grains as acquired from the system (10) where M(d) is the dry basis MC, w
    is the weight of wet grain sample, and d is the weight of dried grain sample.
    4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The system comprised of six SNs and one coordinator.
    The resulting hardware and software units and their justifications are thus presented.
    The resulting nodes: The composite nodes are presented in Figure 6a–c. The components
    of the SN included Grove - DHT22 Temperature/Humidity Sensor, Grove-LDR GL5528
    light sensor, XBee DigiMesh RF module with PCB antenna, Arduino Pro mini microcontroller,
    Grove - XBee carrier, and 9 V alkaline battery. The coordinator has its components
    which included Seeeduino microcontroller, XBee DigiMesh RF module with PCB antenna,
    XBee Shield, and GPRS shield. The resulting modified mesh network formed by the
    coordinator and the six SNs is as shown in Figure 7. The network was formed and
    managed by the coordinator and initially, it was the only network member, while
    each SN searched for and later joined the network sequentially. All the nodes
    in the network communicated with one another directly in a peer-2-peer datagram.
    There was no hierarchy and no parent-to-child link constraint. All SNs had the
    same role of end devices + routers. The self-healing capability of the network
    allowed any SN to join or exit the network with no failure in the entire network.
    The route discovery and repair, and algorithm overhead reduction were achieved
    with AODV. Only the coordinator could respond to a route request. The low power
    sleep mode of the SNs was cyclic and synchronized. GUI: The resulting GUI developed
    in the study using LabVIEW is as shown in Figure 8. The initialization of the
    GUI started with the setting of the communication (COM) port the coordinator was
    connected to on the PC. The GUI started operation when the start button was pressed.
    The GUI then opened a file and named it into a directory. It connected to the
    COM port and collected the available data at the serial port. It displayed the
    data and the node sending them at the indicators and the graphical charts. The
    three charts displayed temperature, humidity, and light intensity data, respectively.
    The GUI then processed the data and logged them into the already opened file.
    The GUI indicated alert when threshold has been exceeded by blinking the GRAINS
    CONDITION button as red alert. The GUI then closed the file when the STOP button
    was pressed. The mini silo: It was a cylindrical-shaped galvanized-steel storage
    bin. The silo had a capacity for half a ton of shelled corn with dimensions 1,000 mm
    height and 1,000 mm diameter. The mini silo also had a 400 mm diameter inlet opening,
    rubber stopper, and cover for grains loading, and 100 mm diameter outlet opening,
    rubber stopper, and cover for grains offloading. The silo was constructed with
    internal hangers for the SNs deployed. Moreover, a wooden platform made from stretches
    of white woods formed the support base for the mini silo. Nodes deployment result:
    The result of the localization algorithm is as shown in Table 1. Resulting data:
    The pattern of temperature variations within the silo are as shown in Figure 9.
    The temperature values of Node 3 were greater than that of Nodes (1 and 2). This
    showed that the ambient temperature was greater, and the grains at the surface
    stayed warmer in the period. Within the wet period (Days 38–70), there was a noticeable
    drop in the temperature values. The temperature values of the unfilled volume
    (Node 4) were mostly lower than that within the grains volume (Nodes 1, 2, and
    3) at 8 p.m., 12 a.m., 4 a.m., and 8 a.m. The values were relatively greater at
    12 p.m. and 4 p.m. Also, the temperature values of Node 3 were mostly lower than
    that of Nodes (1 and 2) at 8 p.m., 12 a.m., 4 a.m., and 8 a.m., but relatively
    greater at 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. The results for this period showed that the ambient
    temperature was lower and the grains beneath the surface stayed warmer mostly
    during the night and vice versa at noonday and afternoon. The pattern of variations
    of relative humidity (RH) within the silo is as shown in Figure 10. The RH values
    were generally higher during the wet period. The RH values were highest at the
    unfilled volume (Node 4). Also, the values were mostly higher at Node 3 than Node
    (1 and 2). The results showed that the grains beneath the surface stayed drier
    for most of the periods. Also, the variation pattern of the illumination level
    at the nodes is as shown in Figure 11. The values were highest at Node 4 (the
    unfilled volume), followed by Node 3 (surface of the grains volume), and then
    Nodes (1 and 2). The results from within the grains volume indicated the following.
    The highest temperature value 40.86°C with corresponding RH value 46.17% and illumination
    level 1.55 lx were recorded at Node 3 on Day 5 by 12 p.m. The lowest temperature
    value 20.9°C with corresponding RH value 51.45% and illumination level 1.27 lx
    were recorded at Node 3 on Day 69 by 4 p.m. Also, the highest RH 53.96% with corresponding
    temperature value 22.52°C and illumination level 1.53 lx were recorded at Node
    3 on Day 46 by 8 a.m. The lowest RH 34.48% with corresponding temperature value
    33.17°C and illumination level 1.34 lx were recorded at Node 2 on Day 6 by 8 p.m.
    The parameters were within the threshold of good stored grains conditions. It
    should be noted that data from sensor Node 4 did not actually represent the ambient
    condition, but related the conditions inside the silo to the variation in ambient
    conditions. Result evaluation: SNs characterization: The results of the characterization
    of the SNs against the reference studies are as shown in Figure 12. The SNs temperature/humidity
    data are very close to the reference study for three salt aerosols (NaCl, NaNO3,
    K2CO3) and in moderate agreement for two salts (KCl and K2SO4). For RH above 89%,
    the accuracy of the SNs was slightly lesser by 2.2%. The SNs light illumination
    data showed relative agreement with the reference study between 0 and 600 lx.
    This indicated the suitability of the SNs for measuring the temperature, humidity,
    and lighting parameters of bulked grains in the range of acceptable limits for
    storing most grains. Node battery life: The power consumption was reduced by 10%.
    The node lifetime was extended from 26 hr to 132 days approximately through the
    low power implementation and explicit route repair. Real-time monitoring: The
    delay in data collection at the coordinator was less than 1 s and about 4 s at
    the cellphone, thereby indicating an accuracy of about 95% in the real-time monitoring.
    Coverage efficiency: The zigzag Pattern coverage scheme showed an excellent performance.
    The result of the coverage of the silo bin showed efficiency of 91% of the total
    area. Grains data: The result of oven-drying evaluation of the grain samples is
    as shown in Table 2 with an average of 11.1% MC while the data collected at the
    corresponding SNs and time is as shown in Table 3 with an average of 10.6% MC.
    The comparison of the data from the SNs with the oven-drying method showed an
    accuracy of 95.2%. The comparison of the data from the SNs with the oven-drying
    method showed an accuracy of 95.2%. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    granary monitoring system for the monitoring of environmental factors affecting
    the quality of stored agricultural grains has been developed. The system is comprised
    of a coordinator node and six SNs with self-sustaining and self-healing capabilities.
    The SNs were deployed at optimally distributed fixed locations in a cylindrically
    shaped galvanized-steel mini silo for pilot testing. The silo had a half-ton capacity
    and contained maize grains. The grains were monitored in real time for 7 weeks
    during both rainy and dry seasons, and obtained data were obtained and transmitted
    via a developed GUI to a PC and mobile phone. The battery life of the nodes was
    extended by reducing the power consumption and explicitly repairing the broken
    routes in the network. The study has contributed to the provision of information
    on the selection of comparatively resourceful components for wireless monitoring
    systems. It analyzed various components, topologies, and technologies based on
    selected criteria in order to select the ones with comparative advantages. The
    study implemented a mini modular storage system suitable for marketers and small-scale
    farmers. Future work will consider a system that can monitor a network of silos
    embedded with internet of things functionality. REFERENCES Citing Literature Volume42,

    IEEE Conference Location: Hua Hin, Thailand SECTION I. Introduction As Agriculture
    sector plays leading role in the economy of many developing countries, therefore,
    it is highly important to focus on the improvement of cultivation techniques.
    These countries not only fulfill the requirement of their own but also contribute
    to provide quality food items to the rest of the world. Irrigation and unequal
    water distribution for crops not only effects the crop production but also results
    in possible water wastage which is a precious resource. Important parameters in
    cultivation that need to be addressed are soil moisture, Humidity, Air Pressure,
    Temperature and weather forecast etc. Additional sensors can be installed to monitor
    crop health and any kind of infestation. Based on the information collected, measures
    can be taken to avoid any damage or improve crop production. The data gathered
    can be interpreted by scientists for forecasting crop production or for policy
    making. A. Precision Agriculture (PA) In Precision Agriculture information technology
    is used to improve the yield by precisely monitoring the various crop parameters.
    In result, better crop irrigation, suitable herbicides, pesticides and sowing
    techniques are achieved [1]. B. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Wireless Sensor
    Network is a wireless network of separately placed sensor nodes which gather and
    share data with each other forming a network. A sensor node consists of transceiver,
    sensor, processor, power source (battery), analog to digital converter (ADC),
    antenna and memory unit. WSN are preferred due to low cost, low power, easy to
    maintain that share their contribution in home automation, agriculture, health
    sector and in military applications. C. Internet of Things (IoT) The internet
    of things (IoT) is a network of globally connected devices and machines which
    communicate with each other. IoT is one of the latest technology trends that are
    gaining popularity among vast majority of industries. It has been forecasted that
    till the year 2020 IoT based units will reach up to 26 billion. IoT applications
    include human to device and device to device interactions in reliable way. Main
    application areas are categorized as data and business analysis, monitoring and
    control, and collaboration and information sharing [2]. 1) Cloud Computing IoT
    applications need space for data storage and huge data manipulations for real
    time decision making [2]. Cloud computing is a platform that provides solution
    for high data transfer and data storage in real time. In this paper, a smart and
    low cost IOT based Precision Agriculture (PA) system is presented. Data related
    to the parameters responsible for crop growth are collected by placing sensor
    nodes as shown in Fig.1 in random locations. Solar panel with rechargeable battery
    is used to fulfill the power needs. These nodes (XBee) are interconnected according
    the cluster tree topology. Each node consists of several sensors capable of measuring
    parameters such as soil moisture and humidity, Temperature, Air quality and atmospheric
    pressure. The data from these sensors is transmitted through a network of interconnected
    nodes to the server, which then uploads the data to a cloud. The server consists
    of a separate processing unit responsible for controlling the drip irrigation
    system. This data is made accessible in visual form to the end user. A MATLAB
    GUI is designed for visualization. The rest of the Paper is organized as; Section
    II presents related work using WSN technology for precision agriculture. Section
    III provides methodology adapted to design and achieve smart irrigation system.
    Section IV consists of hardware and software Implementation of the system. Section
    V contains conclusion. Fig. 1. A single Sensor Node being setup for data acquisition
    Show All SECTION II. Related Work In [1] an intelligent Greenhouse monitoring
    system (IGMS) based on WSN is presented. Environmental parameters such as humidity,
    soil moisture and temperature are measured using IGMS. Sensors data is monitored
    using software which activates the control system to irrigate and fertile the
    crops according to a preset threshold. It is an internet based application which
    uses open source technologies. A real time feedback control system is designed
    and presented in [4] that uses drip irrigation to control the wastage of water.
    Different types of sensors are used for precise monitoring and control of agriculture
    fields. The control circuit consists of ARM based LPC2148 microcontroller as main
    part of circuitry. End user is informed about field conditions using available
    mobile network structure. User can investigate about field conditions by sending
    a message through GSM. Sensors can be activated according to the user’s request
    and required information will be sent to the user by same medium. A wireless monitoring
    system is used in [3] to enhance the mango production. Eko nodes are deployed
    in fields to monitor different environmental parameters. Nodes are connected according
    the mesh topology to transmit sensor values. In [5] a Wireless sensor networks
    (WSN) based irrigation system is designed for site specific irrigation management.
    Six sensors are developed, deployed and used to gather soil properties and sensor
    data is transmitted to a base station. Programmable logic controller (PLC) based
    irrigation machine is developed to irrigate the field and locate the position
    of sprinklers using Global Positioning System (GPS). This information is wirelessly
    communicated to the base station. A stable and real time remote access to field
    conditions was made possible by the Graphical user interface based software. SECTION
    III. Methodology and Materials The proposed and implemented methodology is presented
    in Fig.2, where different wireless sensor nodes are deployed in field for data
    collection. These nodes are connected with each other according the cluster tree
    topology. Different sensors gathering information related to soil moisture, humidity,
    temperature, ultraviolet index and air quality are directly connected to Arduino
    UNO by analog pins. A program has been written in C/C++ to read the analog pins
    where these sensors are connected. Fig. 2. Implemented System Setup Show All The
    measurements from each sensor are transmitted wirelessly in the form of frames
    to the server. The sensor measurements are also displayed on an LCD mounted on
    each node. Automatic irrigation control mechanism is developed at server side.
    Server directly controls the irrigation process by sending control signals to
    open and close the electric valve for water supply. Water supply is monitored
    using water flow sensor. Data from sensor nodes are received serially at server.
    At the server an Esp8266 device is configured to upload data to cloud for access
    at base station. At base station sensors data is made accessible using cloud and
    a MATLAB GUI is used to filter and visually present the data. The end user can
    also access this data using internet and take rapid measures related to crops
    safety and health. To create an effective filed deployable wireless sensor network,
    optimization of power consumption by the hardware components is necessary [6].
    Communication protocol also plays an important role in reduction of power consumption.
    Efficient power management is required for wireless communication by wireless
    sensor nodes [7]. Each sensor node is powered using a 12V, 2.5AH Battery which
    is continuously charged using a 10-Watt solar panel. The total power consumption
    of the system is 0.64WH. This gives each continuously transmitting and receiving
    sensor node approximately a battery life of 2 days when operating on battery alone.
    However, the sensor node, when charged by the solar plate can operate indefinitely.
    When operating in power saving mode, where each sensor node is programmed to transmit
    every 60 minutes and stay active for 2 minutes, the system can operate for 62
    days without charging. The power saving mode can be activated when installing
    each node, it can also be activated from the base station by the end user. Two
    power supply circuits are designed to supply power to the system. The main power
    supply circuit is designed to supply 5V DC to the controller, whereas a buck converter
    is used to supply 3.3V to the transceiver and the UV index sensor. Irrigation
    system is a feedback system which is controlled by the on-field server. Server
    receives sensor data wirelessly from sensor nodes and takes decisions to open
    or close the solenoid valve for water supply. The irrigation system can be set
    to a time-based mode, a water flow-based mode or a manual mode in where the end
    user controls it. The irrigation depends on soil humidity and because sensors
    are prone to measurement noise so, decision is made on running average of the
    soil humidity measurements from the sensor. Wireless sensor node is developed
    as main module of the project. This sensor node is consisted of Arduino UNO, infield
    sensors and XBee radio module. This research uses the Arduino UNO- a microcontroller
    board based on ATmega328P microcontroller. This board has 14 digital input/output
    pins.6 pins out of 14 can be used as PWM outputs, 6 analog inputs, 16 MHz quartz
    crystal oscillator, a power jack, a USB port, reset button and ICSP header. It
    can be easily powered by an AC-DC adapter or battery. UNO board is the first version
    in series of USB Arduino boards. This controller is already programed with bootloader.
    There is no need of external hardware to program the device. To start working
    with UNO a software platform known as Arduino IDE is also required [8]. XBEE is
    a low cost, easy to deploy radio frequency module which provides end point connectivity
    with devices and sensors. It follows 802.15.4 standard for communication. This
    module is ideal for low latency applications, point to point and multipoint configurations.
    It has 15 digital I/O pins. Suitable supply voltage is 2.1 to 3.6V. Current consumption
    on transmission is 33mA and 28mA [9]. Environmental data is obtained by placing
    wireless sensor nodes in field. All the sensors are connected to form a sensor
    node except the Anemometer which is installed on the in-field server only. Separate
    code is developed for each sensor measurement. Each sensor’s functionality is
    verified before final implementation. XBee is configured using XCTU programming
    environment before connecting with the Arduino UNO shield. The key components
    of an individual node are represented by Fig. 3. The characteristics of physical
    and MAC layers for Low-rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN) are defined
    by the IEEE standard 802.15.4. The benefits of such standard are reliable data
    transfer, extremely low cost and reliable battery life. Simple and flexible protocol
    stack is also maintained in 802.15.4 standard [10]. Fig. 3. Block diagram of the
    developed node with sensors Show All Few of the free spectrum bands spectrum devices
    use are: 2.4-2.48 GHz, 5.8-5.9 GHz and 902-928 MHz [11]. A device which utilizes
    the frequency channel of 2.4GHz is used for communication between the nodes. XBee
    is serially connected with Arduino UNO using UART communication interface. In
    this node setup sensors are connected to the Arduino UNO which reads data directly
    from sensors and then transmits the data to the XBee device serially. XBee communication
    is made in the form of frames in API mode. An array of length 14 is used in code
    to gather all sensors data. Each sensor’s measurement data follows a few bits
    representing the sensor id, a total of 5 sensors were installed on each node.
    along with a predefined data end stream. The data frame consists of 10 node id
    bits, 3 battery power level indicator bits, 4 sensor id bits followed by the corresponding
    sensor’s 10bit measurement and 18 node time bits. Single frame length of each
    serially transmitted data packet to the XBEE is 8 bytes. On the in-field server-side
    data received from all the nodes is transmitted after placing a predefined 8 bit
    start-of-sensor and end-of-sensor indicator. The in-field server then uploads
    the received data on the cloud for end user access, analysis and action. In a
    cluster tree topology, a special node which identifies the entire network is called
    root, the nodes that associate with other nodes are routers, and end devices having
    no ability to associate other nodes are known as child nodes [12]. Cluster tree
    topology is implemented by connecting different XBee devices having unique mac
    addresses. XBee is a full duplex data communication device which uses mac address
    of other devices to form a network and share data using unique channel. Esp8266
    is extremely cost effective board with self-contained system on chip (SOC) and
    integrated TCP/IP stack. Esp8266 is simple to start working with as it comes preprogrammed
    with AT commands set firmware. It supports external application specific devices
    or sensors to be connected with its GPIO pins due to its powerful on board processing
    and storage capability. It follows 802.11 b/g/n wireless communication standard,
    has s 1MB flash memory and supports GPIO, I2C, ADCC, SPI and PWM. SECTION IV.
    Results To visualize the parameter values, Matlab GUI is designed at user side.
    The raw data received is passed through a moving average filter with a lag of
    80 samples. The tested node transmits data after every minute with an active session
    of 27 hours. The air quality measurements are displayed in Fig. 4. Air quality
    trends are in line with the expected results. Fig. 4. Air quality measurement
    Show All In Fig. 5 below soil moisture measurements are displayed. Figure 6 shows
    the temperature measurements Temperature rises in the day from morning to afternoon
    and gradually falls in evening. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper presents an application
    of Wireless sensor network (WSN) and Internet of Things (IoT) in precision agriculture
    (PA). The self-powered precision agriculture based experimental setup’s functionality
    is completely tested and real time sensor measurements are successfully transmitted
    using cluster topology to the server. This information is stored on cloud and
    then accessed by the end user where it is visualized using a GUI. Automatic control
    of irrigation is made possible by setting a threshold value at server. Fig. 5.
    Soil moisture measurement Show All Data reception at base station is verified
    in real time. This data will be helpful for analysis of crops by analyzing the
    environmental factors affecting crop production thus providing the end user with
    decisions on improving crop yield. The designed hardware may as well serve as
    mini weather station. When deployed on mass scale the system will play a critical
    role in policy making. Fig. 6. Temperature measurement Show All Authors Figures

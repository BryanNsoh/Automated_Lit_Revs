    posed by a growing global population and climate uncertainties have created an
    urgent demand for a 70% increase in food production by 2050 (Aslan et al., 2022).
    In response, Industry 4.0, an integration of transformative technologies such
    as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs), cloud computing, blockchain, and others, emerges as a
    potential solution to address these pressing agricultural challenges (Bongomin,
    Gilibrays Ocen, et al., 2020; Bongomin, Mwasiagi, et al., 2020). The ongoing fusion
    of Industry 4.0 with agriculture is known as Agriculture 4.0 (Alam & Habib, 2021;
    Aslan et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021), presenting an opportunity to propel industrial
    agriculture into the next generation through enhancement of agricultural research
    and breeding programs to achieve sustainable agriculture (Radoglou-Grammatikis
    et al., 2020). Within the broader framework of sustainable agriculture, various
    concepts like Agriculture 5.0 (Ragazou et al., 2022; Saiz-Rubio & Rovira-Más,
    2020), Agriculture 4.0 (Bongomin, Yemane, et al., 2020; Mammarella et al., 2022),
    precision agriculture (PA) (Daponte et al., 2019; Michels et al., 2020), smart
    farming (Virk et al., 2020), circular agriculture (Helgason et al., 2021), conservation
    agriculture (FAO, 2022), and climate-smart agriculture (FAO, 2019; Kalele, 2021)
    have been developed to optimize productivity, reduce labor time, and manage agricultural
    inputs effectively. PA, in particular, has gained global adoption and is instrumental
    in breeding programs, offering a powerful toolset for developing high-yielding,
    resilient, and resource-efficient crop varieties tailored to diverse field environments
    (Daponte et al., 2019; Duan et al., 2021). The integration of PA with Agriculture
    4.0 technologies holds promise for more efficient data collection and analysis
    (Javaid et al., 2022; Trivelli et al., 2019), while principles of smart farming
    can be harmoniously applied within a circular agriculture framework to optimize
    resource use and minimize waste (Bach & Mauser, 2018). The convergence of these
    concepts creates a comprehensive and effective agricultural system, illustrating
    the interconnected nature of modern agricultural practices. Core Ideas Unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) classification and their phenotyping applications are investigated
    for a comprehensive understanding. The key parameters of UAV image acquisition,
    and their effect on the UAV performance and phenotypic data quality, are examined.
    The strengths and weaknesses of diverse UAV imaging sensors for varied applications
    are evaluated. A general approach for UAV image processing and analytics in phenotypic
    studies is defined. Traditional and high-throughput phenotyping are contrasted,
    paving the way for future UAV applications. As the agricultural landscape advances,
    the adoption of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) and precision phenotyping emerges
    as critical concepts in plant breeding and biotechnology research (Chapu et al.,
    2022; Nyonje et al., 2021; Sagan et al., 2019; Wang, Qiu, et al., 2020). These
    approaches differ in their focus, with precision phenotyping emphasizing detailed
    and accurate measurement of specific traits, while HTP emphasizes quick and efficient
    data collection from a large number of samples (Nyonje et al., 2021; Sagan et
    al., 2019). HTP, driven by advancements in remote sensing technologies, provides
    researchers with accurate and nondestructive ways to analyze large-scale phenotypic
    data, overcoming bottlenecks in genomics and phenomics studies (Hall et al., 2022;
    James et al., 2022; Jangra et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2022).
    The adoption of UAVs, known by various names such as drones, unmanned aerial systems
    (Quamar et al., 2023), uncrewed aerial vehicles (Irujo et al., 2023), small unoccupied
    aerial systems (Pugh et al., 2021), remotely piloted aerial systems, unoccupied
    aerial vehicles (Shi et al., 2016; Sweet et al., 2022), miniature pilotless aircraft,
    and flying mini robots (Hafeez et al., 2023), in agriculture has marked a transformative
    shift, offering cost-effective and flexible solutions with diverse applications
    (Feng et al., 2021; Guo, Carroll, et al., 2021; Ludwig et al., 2020; Yue & Feng,
    2021). Equipped with various imaging systems, including red–green–blue (RGB) sensors,
    multispectral sensors, or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs play a pivotal role in HTP
    tasks, aiding in activities such as biomass and yield estimation (Agapiou, 2020;
    Barbedo, 2019; Cheng & Matsuoka, 2021; Lee, Lin, et al., 2022; Librán-Embid et
    al., 2020; Manfreda et al., 2018; Ogawa et al., 2021; Otto et al., 2018; Paulus
    & Mahlein, 2020; Xie et al., 2021; Yue & Feng, 2021). However, alongside their
    advantages, UAVs also present challenges to widespread adoption. Factors such
    as limited flight time and varying regulatory frameworks across countries have
    been identified as obstacles impacting the broader integration of UAV technology
    (Frankelius et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2020). Additionally,
    the processing and analysis of the substantial amount of plant or field images
    generated by these UAV-based sensors present their own set of challenges, necessitating
    a skill set in data analytics (Sagan et al., 2022; Wang, Duan, et al., 2021).
    Various preprocessing tasks, including radiometric calibration of hyperspectral
    or multispectral images, are deemed essential for ensuring accurate analysis due
    to the inherent variations in imaging conditions (Guo et al., 2019; Xu et al.,
    2019). As the field advances, machine learning (ML) and deep learning algorithms,
    particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have emerged as powerful tools
    for image processing, classification, and prediction based on these vast datasets
    (Bouguettaya et al., 2022; Lin & Guo, 2020; Prat, 2019; Quiñones et al., 2021;
    Rahaman et al., 2019; Selvaraj et al., 2020). The intersection of advancements
    in image processing, big data analytics, ML, and deep learning allows for HTP
    at unprecedented levels, revolutionizing the monitoring of crop growth, seedling
    condition evaluation, yield prediction, and cultivation management (Chang et al.,
    2021; Li et al., 2021). However, despite these advantages, the widespread adoption
    of HTP is hindered by barriers such as the need for technical expertise, high
    implementation costs, and government regulations (Kim, 2020). Effective collaboration
    across interdisciplinary fields is deemed crucial for the development and widespread
    adoption of HTP technology. This interdisciplinary nature requires expertise ranging
    from engineering and manufacturing of sensors to computer science, data analysis,
    and plant biology (Campbell et al., 2018). Creating platforms for collaboration
    is essential to foster the development, implementation, and diffusion of HTP technology
    on a global scale. In the realm of agricultural technology, the integration of
    high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping with genome-wide markers accelerates
    the discovery of novel alleles for breeding crops that are more efficient in nitrogen
    use and more resilient to climate uncertainties and diseases (Banerjee et al.,
    2020; Lamo et al., 2021; Rodene et al., 2022; Sweet et al., 2022). This holistic
    approach in agricultural research, blending advanced molecular breeding technologies
    with cutting-edge phenotyping methods, is pivotal for enhancing crop and livestock
    outcomes while contributing to sustainable food systems. HTP has gained momentum,
    especially with the advent of UAVs and image analytics in agriculture. This review
    paper distinguishes itself by offering a comprehensive overview that goes beyond
    existing reviews. It encompasses overview of phenotyping concepts, UAV platforms,
    imaging sensors, image acquisition parameters, image processing, UAV use cases
    in phenotyping, and challenges and future research direction (Table 1). The objective
    of this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the use of UAV platforms
    and image analytics for HTP in agricultural research. It aims to identify key
    challenges and future research in this area. The paper presents several important
    contributions, including a detailed classification of UAVs, a discussion of key
    parameters for UAV image acquisition, an overview of UAV applications in phenotyping,
    and insights into sensors and image processing techniques for phenotyping. TABLE

    growing demand for food production, adapting to climate uncertainties, and fostering
    sustainable agricultural practices on a global scale. The synthesis of cutting-edge
    technologies, interdisciplinary collaboration, and innovative research methodologies
    forms the foundation for a transformative future in agriculture. 2 FIELD PHENOTYPING
    Phenotyping is the process of measuring and analyzing observable traits or phenotypes
    of plants or organisms to understand their characteristics, performance, and genetic
    makeup (genotype) (Bian et al., 2022). It serves the crucial purpose of identifying
    and selecting crop genotypes that exhibit productivity and adaptability across
    diverse environments (Prasanna et al., 2013). Essentially, it involves assessing
    how plants respond to various environmental factors, generating valuable data
    that inform strategic breeding decisions in selecting and advancing breeding lines,
    especially concerning traits like yield, stress tolerance, disease resistance,
    and agronomic features (Morisse et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2018). Phenotyping
    is the critical step in breeding programs where the goal is to develop new and
    improved varieties with desirable traits. To optimize the breeding pipeline, where
    selecting the most suitable varieties is paramount, achieving robust phenotyping
    is essential. The challenge lies in striking a balance between accuracy, speed,
    and cost-effectiveness in the phenotyping process. Leveraging remote sensing technologies,
    such as engineered phenotyping, becomes instrumental in enhancing data collection
    for making informed choices based on phenotypic characteristics (Kim, 2020). In
    practice, field phenotyping not only reveals how crops respond to their environment
    but also allows breeders to discern the most promising varieties. The integration
    of remote sensing technologies, constituting engineered phenotyping approaches,
    contributes to the collection of comprehensive and high-quality data, enabling
    breeders to make well-informed decisions throughout the breeding pipeline. This
    streamlined approach ensures that the selected varieties meet the criteria of
    productivity, adaptability, and resilience, addressing the complexities of modern
    agricultural challenges (Cudjoe et al., 2023). 2.1 Traditional field phenotyping
    Traditional field phenotyping refers to the manual or semiautomated observation
    and measurement of plant traits in the natural field environment. This approach
    has been a standard practice in plant breeding for many years and is still a common
    practice in many developing countries. Although it may be time consuming and labor
    intensive, it remains a valuable method for assessing a wide range of traits.
    However, this method is low throughput, and it may be impractical for selecting
    complex traits like improved yield potential or adaptation to abiotic stresses
    (Feldmann & Tabb, 2022). Additionally, trait and tool choices add complexity,
    varying with the target environment (Volpato et al., 2021). Contrastingly, there
    is a global shift to modern HTP, offering enhanced accuracy and speed for crop
    genotype selection (Kim, 2020; Prasanna et al., 2013). Despite breeding advancements,
    progress in phenotyping lags in many developing countries due to reliance on traditional
    and manual methods (Chapu et al., 2022; Prasanna et al., 2013; Walter et al.,
    2019; Xiao et al., 2022). In this low-throughput approach (Figure 1), researchers
    manually scout fields, assessing traits like plant height, leaf color, leaf area
    index (LAI), chlorophyll content, and biomass (Johansen, Morton, et al., 2020;
    Kim, 2020; Krishna, 2018; Yang et al., 2017). To overcome these limitations, UAV-based
    remote sensing becomes a transformative solution, offering quick and high-quality
    results, thanks to cost-effective, lightweight sensors and UAVs (Krishna, 2018).

    (a) Plant height measurement. (b) Tiller number counting. (c) Panicle length measurement.
    (d) Sample collection for grain weight measurement. 2.2 High-throughput phenotyping
    HTP is an advanced approach to phenotyping that involves the rapid and automated
    collection of large-scale phenotypic data at various levels, from the molecular
    to the field level and over extended periods (Lane & Murray, 2021). Remote sensing
    technologies such as UAVs, satellites, and manned aircraft enhance throughput
    by rapidly capturing phenotypic data, enabling efficient measurement of numerous
    plants at different levels and reasonable costs (Rejeb et al., 2022; Tao et al.,
    2022). This concept gained popularity in plant science and breeding, serving to
    monitor plant growth and assess the interplay of genotypes and the environment
    (Krishna, 2018). Integrated with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or quantitative
    trait loci (QTL) (Xiao et al., 2022), HTP aids in bridging the gap between the
    genome and phenome in plant breeding, as illustrated in Figure 2 (Adak et al.,
    2023; Jung et al., 2021; Karunathilake et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2023). UAV-based
    remote sensing, particularly useful for large-scale HTP, offers near-ground capabilities,
    facilitating fast, precise, and cost-effective phenotyping in breeding programs
    (Chen et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2021; Rallo et al., 2020). Equipped with various
    sensors (such as RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral), these UAVs capture multisource
    phenotypic data, enabling the generation of three-dimensional (3D) crop images
    and extraction of parameters such as plant height, width, leaf dimensions, area,
    and inclination angle for comprehensive plant biology and genomics analysis (Guo
    et al., 2018). FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer High-throughput phenotyping (HTP)
    in conjunction with genetic mapping; bridging the genome–phenome gap in plant
    breeding. HTP is a pivotal tool in modern agriculture, synergizing with various
    concepts such as Agriculture 5.0, Agriculture 4.0, PA, smart farming, climate-smart
    agriculture, circular agriculture, and conservation agriculture (Figure 3). HTP
    offers individual plant trait data for precision agricultural decisions, such
    as variable-rate fertilizer application and targeted pest control (de Alcântara
    et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2022; Sheikh et al., 2023). It identifies crops with
    stress tolerance, vital for climate-smart agriculture (Danzi et al., 2019; Roitsch
    et al., 2022). In smart farming, HTP optimizes resource use and enhances crop
    health (Kamat et al., 2023; Panwar et al., 2022), playing a critical role in Agriculture
    4.0 and additionally in Agriculture 5.0, where the focus is AI analysis of large
    datasets (Fan et al., 2021, 2023; Sarkar et al., 2023). In circular agriculture,
    HTP characterizes diverse plant traits at scale, supporting practices like breeding
    resilient crops and optimizing resource management (Kim et al., 2022; Zhang, Wang,
    et al., 2023). Moreover, HTP contributes to conservation agriculture by assessing
    cover crop impact, optimizing nitrogen application, identifying drought-tolerant
    genotypes, and managing weeds and pests (Deery et al., 2014; Gracia-Romero et
    al., 2020). The comparison in Table 2 illustrates the distinct focuses, key technologies,
    and roles of various agricultural concepts, emphasizing their contributions to
    sustainable agriculture amid climate change. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer Interconnected

    phenotyping platform (HTPP) denotes platforms designed for the rapid development,
    implementation, and diffusion of HTP, with variations depending on the country
    or institution. HTPPs, utilizing nondestructive and noninvasive tools such as
    UAVs, robotics, and automated data processing, contribute to precise trait measurements
    and reliable phenotype estimates (Prasanna et al., 2013). These platforms are
    instrumental in modeling to forecast genotypic performance across diverse environmental
    conditions. The outcomes of such modeling may include predictions related to factors
    such as crop yield, stress tolerance, disease resistance, and other essential
    agronomic traits. This information is valuable for making informed decisions in
    crop breeding, selection, and cultivation strategies (Yassue et al., 2022). Several
    global research institutions, including the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility
    (APPF), PhenoArch platform at INRAE Montpellier, and the FIP (Field Phenotyping)
    platform at ETH Zürich, have established HTPPs (Pérez-Valencia et al., 2022).
    3 UAV PLATFORMS AND SYSTEMS UAVs are reshaping remote sensing by addressing limitations
    of traditional platforms like satellites, aircraft, and ground-based platforms.
    They provide high-resolution, flexible, cost-effective, real-time data collection,
    transforming fields such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, disaster management,
    infrastructure inspection, and archaeological research. Valued by researchers
    and professionals for their versatility, UAVs offer breakthroughs in remote sensing,
    with ongoing technological advancements promising innovative applications (Mohsan
    et al., 2023; Quamar et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023). 3.1 UAV classification
    UAVs exhibit diverse types and designs, broadly classified based on altitude (Saad
    et al., 2020), operation type (UCAA, 2020), application (Tal & Altschuld, 2021),
    wing type (Krishna, 2020), GPS correction method (Kim et al., 2023), and size
    (Suab & Avtar, 2020). This classification complexity, as depicted in Figure 4,
    challenges buyers and users in making informed decisions. The broad spectrum of
    agricultural UAV further complicates this process, requiring a careful assessment
    of specific agricultural needs, considering factors like farm size, terrain, crop
    type, and desired functionalities and applications (Figure 5). FIGURE 4 Open in
    figure viewer Detailed classification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). HAP,
    high-altitude platform; LAP, low-altitude platform; VLOS, visual line of sight;
    EVLOS, extended visual line of sight; BVLOS, beyond visual line of sight; RC,
    remote control; LM, loitering munitions (suicide drone or kamikaze drone); UCAV,
    unmanned combat aerial vehicle; GCPs, ground control points; RTK, real-time kinematics;
    PPK, postprocessing kinematics. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer Examples of commercial
    agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles and their applications. (a) Quadcopter UAVLance
    for mapping and surveying in agriculture. (b) Quadcopter Parrot Blueglass, for
    crop scouting. (c) Hybrid-wing Delair UX11 Ag drone, for large-scale surveying
    in agriculture and forestry. (d) Multirotor UAV, for crop yield assessment. (e)
    Hybrid-wing QuanticMapper Aerovironment, for mapping. (f) Quadcopter DJI Phantom
    4-multispectral, for crop inspection and monitoring. Wing type classification
    commonly encompasses fixed wing, rotary wing, and hybrid wing (Krishna, 2020).
    Fixed-wing UAVs use static wings for lift through forward airspeed, while rotary-wing
    UAVs employ multiple rotors for lift without forward airspeed. The fixed-wing
    UAVs are commonly used for high-resolution aerial mapping, surveying, and surveillance.
    On the other hand, rotary-wing UAVs are commonly used in photography, cinematography,
    and close-range inspections. Hybrid-wing UAVs combine both features, utilizing
    rotors for takeoff and landing and fixed wings for efficient forward flight. It
    is suitable for tasks requiring both long-endurance flights and the ability to
    operate in confined spaces. The advantages and limitations of each UAV type are
    summarized in Table 3. The wing-based classification plays a pivotal role in selecting
    the most suitable UAV for specific applications, considering factors like endurance,
    maneuverability, and the nature of the mission at hand. TABLE 3. Advantages and
    limitations of wing-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) classification platforms.

    UAVs are also categorized by operating altitudes into low and high classifications.
    Low-altitude UAVs, operating below 500 feet, excel in precision tasks like agriculture
    and inspections, offering close-range data collection. Conversely, high-altitude
    UAVs, flying above 500 feet, are designed for wide-area surveillance, playing
    crucial roles in military and environmental applications (Saad et al., 2020).
    This altitude-based classification aids in mission selection, considering regulatory
    compliance and the scale of observation needed. The size classification influences
    UAV applications and capabilities. Nano UAVs (up to 250 g) are small and used
    for close-range tasks. Micro UAVs (250 g to 2 kg) are for basic photography. Mini
    UAVs (2–25 kg) include consumer drones with advanced features. Small UAVs (25–150
    kg) are used professionally. Medium UAVs (150–600 kg) are for surveillance. Large
    UAVs (600–1500 kg) are robust and used in military or cargo transport. Very large
    UAVs (1,500 kg and above) are massive and employed for heavy-cargo transport and
    military operations (Suab & Avtar, 2020). Size classifications often impact regulatory
    requirements. Application-based classification differentiates civilian/industry
    UAVs from military counterparts. Military UAVs, engineered for surveillance and
    combat (Boyle, 2020; Kreps, 2018), contrast with civilian UAVs designed for specific
    functions in different industry sectors including agriculture, transportations,
    security, media, infrastructure, and many others (Krishna, 2020; Suab & Avtar,
    2020; Tal & Altschuld, 2021). Agricultural UAVs focus on precision farming, security
    UAVs monitor critical areas, media UAVs capture aerial visuals, transportation
    UAVs transport and deliver goods, and infrastructure inspection UAVs examine critical
    structures. This classification highlights the versatile contributions of UAVs
    across diverse industries and applications. Operation type-based classification
    includes visual line of sight (VLOS), extended visual line of sight (EVLOS), and
    beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) (Davies et al., 2018; Stöcker et al., 2017).
    VLOS pertains to UAV operations where the pilot maintains continuous, unaided
    visual contact with the UAV throughout the flight. EVLOS involves UAVs being flown
    beyond the visual range of the pilot but within the extended visual range of one
    or more trained observers. BVLOS represents a more advanced operational mode where
    the UAV is flown out of the visual range of both the pilot and observers (Davies
    et al., 2018). BVLOS operations can potentially offer advantages over VLOS or
    EVLOS operations, including the ability to collect more data, cost-effectiveness,
    and increased safety, depending on the specific use case (van der Sluijs et al.,
    2023). Lastly, UAVs can also be classified based on the global positioning system
    (GPS) correction methods. These include ground control points (GCPs) or traditional
    method, real-time kinematic (RTK), postprocessed kinematic (PPK) or postmission
    precise point positioning (PPP) (Kim et al., 2023), and non-RTK (Pugh et al.,
    2021). GCPs represent a traditional and widely employed method for correcting
    GPS data in UAV surveys (Oliveira et al., 2023). RTK systems provide real-time
    corrections, enhancing safety and accuracy (Gilliot et al., 2022; Kim et al.,
    2023). Non-RTK UAVs may fall under either GCPs or PPK methods. Unlike RTK, PPK
    does not rely on real-time radio connections during the flight, offering flexibility
    in operation (Eker et al., 2021; Tomaštík et al., 2019). Combining correction
    methods, such as GCPs and PPK, has the potential to enhance overall accuracy in
    UAV surveys (Cho & Lee, 2023). However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the
    number and distribution of GCPs continue to significantly influence the overall
    accuracy, even when utilizing PPK methods (Martínez-Carricondo et al., 2023).
    3.2 UAV guidance and control systems UAV guidance and control systems are the
    technological backbone that empowers UAVs to navigate, stabilize, and execute
    mission objectives with precision. Central to these systems are autopilot functionalities,
    managing flight dynamics and enabling both manual and autonomous modes. Inertial
    measurement units (IMUs) play a pivotal role in stabilizing UAVs by measuring
    accelerations and angular rates. GPS receivers provide accurate location data,
    facilitating autonomous navigation and waypoint following. Barometric altimeters
    ensure precise altitude control, while magnetometers contribute to orientation
    accuracy. Control surfaces and actuators govern the UAV''s maneuvers, allowing
    for controlled pitch, roll, and yaw movements. Communication systems enable real-time
    data exchange between the UAV and ground control, ensuring seamless command input
    and telemetry systems (Feng et al., 2021; Oluwaseun & Ehiagwina, 2022). The GPS,
    telemetry radio, and flight controller are normally located on the top part of
    UAV, as depicted in Figure 6 (Lee, Shin, et al., 2022). The ground control station
    (GCS) serves as a central hub, collecting flight-related data and facilitating
    communication with the UAV control system. Sensors, both ground based and onboard,
    contribute to data collection (Saad et al., 2020). Some UAVs incorporate collision
    avoidance systems, utilizing sensors to detect obstacles and enhance operational
    safety. These integrated systems collectively contribute to the UAV''s ability
    to operate autonomously or under human supervision across a diverse array of applications,
    from PA to surveillance and beyond. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer Components

    3.3 UAV imaging sensors UAV imaging sensors are crucial components that enable
    UAVs to capture valuable data for diverse applications. These sensors come in
    various types, including light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, thermal
    sensors, visible light (RGB) sensors, multispectral sensors, and hyperspectral
    sensors, as shown in Figure 7, each designed to gather specific information. RGB
    sensors are commonly used to capture visible light images, suitable for general
    imaging purposes. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors extend the spectrum,
    aiding applications like agriculture by providing data beyond human vision. Thermal
    infrared detects infrared radiation, facilitating tasks such as search and rescue
    or inspections. LiDAR sensors use laser beams to measure distances, creating precise
    3D maps of terrain. These sensors, often accompanied by GPS receivers and IMUs
    for accurate positioning and stabilization, contribute to the versatility of UAVs
    across industries such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure
    inspection. As technology advances, integration with various imaging sensors continues
    to enhance the capabilities of UAV systems. Table 4 outlines the strengths and
    weaknesses of commonly used UAV imaging sensors. Understanding these trade-offs
    is essential for selecting the most suitable UAV imaging sensor based on the specific
    requirements of the application. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer Unmanned aerial

    sensors; demands significant data storage and processing resources Abbreviations:
    3D, three-dimensional; LiDAR, light detection and ranging; NDVI, normalized difference
    vegetation index; RGB, red, green, and blue. 3.3.1 LiDAR image sensor LiDAR technology
    employs lasers to calculate the time taken for emitted light to reflect back from
    an object to the sensor, generating precise LiDAR images or data. Integrated with
    RGB images, LiDAR provides topography data without image overlap (IOL), enhancing
    topographical mapping efficiency (van der Merwe et al., 2020). Therefore, it proves
    valuable for measuring canopy height (Suab & Avtar, 2020). While LiDAR sensors
    demonstrate high accuracy in estimating forest growing stock volume, the presence
    of inconsistencies in acquisition dates during field surveys introduces a potential
    source of inaccuracies. Variations in survey timing may impact the reliability
    of the estimates, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of temporal factors
    in order to ensure accurate and consistent results (Lin et al., 2022). 3.3.2 RGB
    image sensor RGB images, produced by visible light sensors like charge-coupled
    device (CCD) and complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS), are widely employed
    in phenotyping due to their cost-effectiveness, higher spatial resolution (SR),
    and ease of use compared to multispectral and hyperspectral sensors (Gonzalez
    et al., 2018; Sanches et al., 2018). Lightweight and adaptable to various weather
    conditions, they are suitable for calculating vegetation indices (VIs), generating
    digital elevation models, orthomosaics, and vegetation height maps (Barbosa, Ferraz,
    Dos Santos, et al., 2021; Esposito et al., 2021; Maes & Steppe, 2018). However,
    limitations arise when analyzing vegetation parameters requiring spectral information
    beyond the visible spectrum. To address this, RGB sensors are often combined with
    other sensors (Tsouros et al., 2019). Alternatively, modified RGB sensors, like
    near-infrared (NIR)-RGB, replace the NIR filter, providing NIR sensitivity without
    the high cost of multispectral sensors (Maes & Steppe, 2018). RGB images may require
    periodic calibration for accurate color metrics, introducing complexity and an
    additional step in their utilization. This need for calibration, while essential,
    can impact the consistency and reliability of color data if not performed regularly.
    3.3.3 Thermal image sensor Thermal images, captured by infrared sensors and optical
    lenses, visualize object temperatures without relying on visible properties (Syeda
    & Alam, 2021). Beneficial for monitoring surface temperature and detecting drought
    stress, these images display warmer objects as yellow and cooler ones as blue
    (Tsouros et al., 2019). Despite their utility in applications like irrigation
    management and canopy temperature extraction (Guilherme et al., 2020; Hunt & Daughtry,
    2018; Maes & Steppe, 2018; Tsouros et al., 2019), thermal sensors have limited
    applications that focused on monitoring or inspecting other crop characteristics
    (Raeva et al., 2019; Tsouros et al., 2019). 3.3.4 Multispectral image sensor Multispectral
    images, captured by sensors with four to six bands, offer richer data than traditional
    RGB images (Gonzalez et al., 2018; Raeva et al., 2019; Suab & Avtar, 2020; Syeda
    & Alam, 2021). Combining spectral and spatial data, these images are valuable
    for classification, mapping, prediction, and detection in crop phenotyping and
    remote sensing (Maes & Steppe, 2018). Commonly used for calculating normalized
    difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) to estimate biomass and identify stressed
    areas in crops, they require preprocessing, increasing computational time and
    cost (Nhamo et al., 2020). Additionally, multispectral sensors are more expensive
    than RGB sensors. To enhance multispectral imagery resolution, pan-sharpening
    merges high SR from panchromatic images with multispectral richness for detailed
    analysis (Zhang, Zhang, et al., 2023). Various fusion strategies, including component
    substitution and spatial–spectral decomposition, are employed, with multiscale
    and multi-depth CNN presenting an innovative approach integrating deep neural
    networks (Yuan et al., 2018). Other fusion methods, such as method-based and deep
    CNN strategies, contribute unique perspectives (Aburaed et al., 2023; Deng et
    al., 2019; Yuhendra et al., 2012). Balancing spatial quality and spectral fidelity
    is challenging, with innovations like the alternating reverse filtering network
    and neighbor embedding-inspired methods effectively enhancing SR (Yan et al.,
    2022; Zhang et al., 2019), while addressing disparities in the fusion process
    (Gao et al., 2022). 3.3.5 Hyperspectral image sensor Hyperspectral images, captured
    by sensors with higher spectral but lower SR than multispectral images, enable
    more accurate estimation of phenotyping parameters like vegetation properties,
    leaf water content, and nutrient content (Gonzalez et al., 2018). Unlike multispectral
    images, hyperspectral images capture a broad light spectrum using hundreds or
    thousands of narrow bandwidths (Maes & Steppe, 2018; Syeda & Alam, 2021). However,
    their complex preprocessing requirements result in higher computation time and
    costs. Notably, hyperspectral sensors are the most expensive option among all
    imaging sensors (Gonzalez et al., 2018). Additionally, hyperspectral images, with
    their extensive spectral bands capturing detailed information, require larger
    storage capacities compared to traditional RGB images. Efficient data management
    becomes crucial due to the increased volume of data in hyperspectral imagery.
    4 UAV IMAGE ACQUISITION PARAMETERS Agricultural UAVs are specifically designed
    for farming applications, presenting a significant stride in field phenotyping
    through remote sensing (Seifert et al., 2019). Despite its promise, this technique
    poses challenges, necessitating thorough investigation of parameters for optimal
    UAV performance. The diverse applications of UAVs in phenotyping are vast and
    continue to expand, indicating a burgeoning field of research. As demand for efficient
    breeding, precise cultivation, and sustainable agriculture rises, UAVs are poised
    for rapid growth, marking the early stages of a transformative era in agriculture.
    UAV image acquisition for phenotyping involves parameters grouped into four crucial
    categories: quality, flight, image, and efficiency (Frey et al., 2018; Mugnai
    et al., 2022; Seifert et al., 2019). Quality parameters focus on attaining precision
    and detail in the acquired images, encompassing sensor attributes such as resolution,
    exposure time (shutter speed), acquisition rate, focal length, and camera angle.
    Flight parameters consider the movement and positioning of the UAV during image
    acquisition, including altitude, IOL, and speed. Image parameters specifically
    relate to the characteristics of individual images, encompassing ground sample
    distance (GSD) and image per area. Efficiency parameters address time-related
    aspects in both the flight and image processing stages, namely, flight time, time
    of day (TOD), and processing time. Understanding and optimizing these parameters
    are essential for effective UAV-based phenotyping, ensuring the acquisition of
    high-quality data for subsequent analysis and interpretation. Table 5 provides
    a concise overview of key UAV image acquisition parameters crucial for precise
    phenotyping data, including GSD, TOD, IOL, flight altitude (FA), flight speed
    (FS), and SR. TABLE 5. Overview of the critical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)

    FA, flight altitude; FL, forward overlap; FS, flight speed; GSD, ground sample
    distance; IOL, image overlap; n.d., no data; SL, side overlap; SR, spatial resolution;
    TOD, time of day. 4.1 Ground sample distance GSD is a vital parameter in UAV imagery,
    denoting the physical size of one pixel in an image relative to the ground, indicating
    the level of detail and sharpness in the captured data on the field. It depends
    on factors like FA, sensor pixel size, camera focal length, resolution, and subject
    distance. Lower GSD offers increased accuracy, detail, and data, achievable through
    lower altitudes or higher camera focal length and resolution (Mugnai et al., 2022).
    Conversely, higher GSD yields less accurate and less detailed images, stemming
    from greater altitude (Gonzalez et al., 2018). For instance, Zhou, Zhou, et al.
    (2020) classified soybean leaf wilting with UAV imagery at different GSDs (7.7,
    4.7, and 20.4 mm/pixel for RGB, multispectral, and thermal images, respectively).
    However, the impact of varying GSD on UAV performance remains understudied, highlighting
    the need for further research in this critical area to determine optimal values
    for diverse UAV applications, including phenotyping. 4.2 Time of day TOD refers
    to a designated timeframe for conducting aerial imaging, considering factors such
    as lighting conditions, sun angle, and shadows that influence the quality of acquired
    images (Rodrigues et al., 2022). While limited research focuses on TOD effects,
    commonly cited hours range from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.,
    or 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., coinciding with optimal sunlight conditions (Gonc
    et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2021). TOD impacts data quality under
    different weather or lighting conditions, with studies like Allred et al. (2021)
    noting the effectiveness of late morning to late afternoon for mapping subsurface
    drainage systems. Rodrigues et al. (2022) analyzed TOD''s effect on spectral bands
    and VIs, establishing 12:00 p.m. as the most reliable TOD for field flights and
    cultivar modeling. The choice of TOD for UAV-based image acquisition depends on
    sensors types, with thermal, multispectral, and hyperspectral sensors recommended
    within ±2 h from 12:00 p.m. (Kefauver et al., 2019). Investigating optimal TOD
    for specific sensor types remains a valuable avenue for future research. 4.3 Image
    overlap IOL is a degree of redundancy between consecutive images captured during
    a flight mission, categorized into forward and side overlap (Lopes Bento et al.,
    2022). Forward overlap is managed by adjusting image capture rates, while side
    overlap is linked to the drone''s flight path. Configured as a percentage before
    processing, various studies explored scenarios like 80% forward and 60% side overlap,
    revealing effects on processing time and spatial accuracy (Barbosa, Ferraz, Dos
    Santos, et al., 2021; Elhadary et al., 2022; Gonzalez et al., 2018; Torres-Sánchez
    et al., 2018). High overlaps increase processing time due to redundancy, while
    increased overlap improves spatial and geometric accuracy (Elhadary et al., 2022;
    Torres-Sánchez et al., 2018). Goodbody et al. (2021) found that decreasing IOL
    reduces canopy height accuracy, emphasizing the critical role of overlap in drone-based
    phenotyping. 4.4 Flight speed FS is the velocity at which the UAV moves while
    acquiring images, and it is intricately connected to the shutter speed or exposure
    time during the operation (Shi et al., 2021; Wang, Xu, et al., 2021). Shutter
    speed, a fundamental camera setting, dictates how long the camera''s shutter stays
    open during the image capture process. Researchers explored FSs ranging from 1
    to 8 m/s, assessing their impact on both UAV performance and the effectiveness
    of plant monitoring (Ahmad et al., 2020; Lee, Shin, et al., 2022; Shi et al.,
    2021). It is worth noting that some studies found the maximum speed to be 5 or
    3 m/s for efficient UAV image acquisition. FS, managed by the UAV''s control system
    or calculated from flight time, is a dual-edged factor influenced by proximity
    to plants and wind effects at lower altitudes (Ahmad et al., 2020; Ito et al.,
    2021; Shi et al., 2021). It significantly interacts with image quality, especially
    with mechanical shutters, minimizing rolling shutter artifacts for clear images
    (Simon et al., 2022). Optimal FS and shutter selection are critical, with considerations
    for mechanical and electronic shutters, each presenting unique advantages and
    challenges (Nex et al., 2022). The rolling shutter effect, capturing images line
    by line, requires correction methods for precise mapping results, showcasing the
    complexity in optimizing UAV performance (Bruno & Forlani, 2023; Tekavec et al.,
    2019; Vautherin et al., 2016; Zhou, Daakir, et al., 2020). The nuanced exploration
    of the intricate relationship between FS, shutter speed, and their respective
    types influencing UAV performance during image acquisition is highlighted by Irujo
    et al. (2023). 4.5 Flight altitude FA, the vertical distance between the UAV and
    the ground, plays a pivotal role in UAV image acquisition, influencing SR, coverage,
    and image quality. Opting for higher altitudes provides broader coverage but lowers
    SR, while lower altitudes offer higher resolution at the expense of coverage.
    The choice depends on mission goals and study area characteristics (Anders et
    al., 2020). This balance is crucial for successful UAV image acquisition (Borra-Serrano
    et al., 2015). Altitudes vary based on vegetation and sensor types, impacting
    different crop groups (Bazrafkan et al., 2023). Examining the estimation of wheat
    aboveground biomass, Zhu et al. (2023) showed that increasing flight height from
    30 to 120 m reduced estimation accuracy by 48% and 41% for the canopy spectral
    model (CSM) and textures, respectively. Studies emphasize the significance of
    FA ranging from 1 to 120 m (Lou et al., 2018; Seifert et al., 2019; Shi et al.,
    2021). It directly affects GSD and details in UAV imagery (Seifert et al., 2019).
    Increased altitude enhances object detection accuracy even at lower IOL (Torres-Sánchez
    et al., 2018), but elevated altitudes may compromise the geometric accuracy of
    point clouds (Elhadary et al., 2022). Overall, finding the right balance is key
    for successful UAV image acquisition for various applications such as crop monitoring
    and field mapping. 4.6 Spatial resolution SR, also known as sensor resolution,
    refers to the level of detail or clarity in the individual pixels of an image
    and is a critical aspect of image quality and processing efficiency in UAV-based
    imaging. Despite its impact on accuracy, studies on this parameter are limited,
    often treating it as a constant factor. One study, investigating the effect of
    resolution on image classification accuracy using three resolutions (5, 10, and
    15 cm), found similar overall classification accuracy in grassland, attributing
    this to minor variations in object features at the tested resolutions (Lu & He,
    2018). Another study exploring the impact of resolution on LAI using the PROSAIL
    model and six resolutions (1, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 cm) found consistent LAI inversion
    performance from 0.26 to 10 cm/pixel, with declining performance at 15 cm/pixel
    and beyond (Sun, Wang, Yang, et al., 2021). Despite these findings, there is a
    notable gap in research optimizing UAV performance, necessitating further investigation.
    5 UAV IMAGE PROCESSING AND ANALYTICS UAV image processing and analytics constitute
    a crucial phase in harnessing the vast data captured by UAVs for insightful applications.
    This multifaceted process involves a series of sophisticated techniques and algorithms,
    which are explored in this section, considering methodologies introduced in prior
    studies (Kim, 2020; Lu & He, 2018; Wang, Silva, et al., 2020). The current study
    enhances Omari et al.’s (2020) methodology for a more comprehensive approach.
    The general image processing and analytics steps include preprocessing, segmentation,
    feature extraction, data analysis, and evaluation (optional step) in a five-step
    process illustrated in Figure 8. This comprehensive approach empowers UAVs to
    contribute significantly to fields like PA and HTP by transforming raw imagery
    into actionable knowledge, fostering informed and efficient decision-making processes.

    matrix; ML, machine learning; DL, deep learning; PCA, principal component analysis;
    ICA, independent component analysis; SfM, structure from motion. 5.1 Preprocessing
    The main goal of image preprocessing is to improve the separation between plant
    and nonplant structures in the color space by enhancing their topological representation
    (Henke et al., 2021). This study covers multiple preprocessing techniques, such
    as image quality assessment, photogrammetric processing (mosaicking and orthorectification),
    geometrical correction, radiometric calibration, and pixel resampling. 5.1.1 Image
    quality evaluation The initial step in the image preprocessing approach is often
    overlooked in previous studies: image quality evaluation. This evaluation, typically
    conducted through visual inspection, includes checking for oblique scenes, identifying
    blurry images, and assessing radiometric distortion such as vignetting and signal-to-noise
    ratio. The removal of poor-quality images at this stage is crucial for ensuring
    more precise data analysis with the chosen method. Issues like oblique scenes
    and blurry images, often caused by wind gusts leading to drone image vibration,
    need elimination to enhance the accuracy of subsequent image processing steps.
    The impact of radiometric distortions induced by atmospheric effects is negligible
    at low drone altitudes (Lu & He, 2017). 5.1.2 Photogrammetry (mosaicking and orthorectification)
    The photogrammetric technique, employing the structure from motion (SfM) algorithm,
    creates high-resolution 3D models using overlapping two-dimensional images from
    different digital cameras and georeferencing information (Eltner & Sofia, 2020).
    This process yields Digital Surface Models (DSM), Digital Terrain Models (DTM),
    Digital Vegetation Models (DVM), Digital Elevation Models (DEM), and orthophotos
    (Tompalski et al., 2021). These models provide insights into 3D crop characteristics,
    including height, canopy, and biomass density, benefiting applications using only
    RGB images (Tsouros et al., 2019). In phenotyping, the typical output is orthomosaics,
    formed through mosaicking or stitching techniques (Barbosa, Ferraz, Dos Santos,
    et al., 2021). Various commercial software utilizing the SfM algorithm, such as
    Agisoft Metashape, VisualSFM, and Regard3D, have been widely used in phenotyping
    research, reducing computation time for image processing (Barbosa, Ferraz, Dos
    Santos, et al., 2021; Elkhrachy, 2022; Goodbody et al., 2021; Ludwig et al., 2020;
    Tian et al., 2021). Cloud-based options like DroneDeploy and MapsMadeEasy generate
    orthomosaic images, DTM, 3D point cloud models, and NDVI data but lack support
    for aligning one-band cameras, limiting composite image layering. Other software
    packages like Pix4Dmapper are also employed in phenotyping research (Chang et
    al., 2021; Kim, 2020; Raeva et al., 2019). 5.1.3 Geometrical correction Geometrical
    correction aims to rectify distortions in orthomosaics, enhancing accuracy in
    subsequent processing steps. This correction establishes a relationship between
    image coordinates and geographic coordinate systems using sensor calibration data,
    GPS data, attitude data, and GCPs. SfM software or ArcGIS, with known GCPs, can
    be utilized for this purpose (Lu & He, 2017). 5.1.4 Radiometric calibration Radiometric
    calibration enhances the accuracy of VIs, like NDVI, in multispectral or hyperspectral
    orthomosaics. The commonly employed empirical line method, as recommended by Lu
    and He (2017, 2018), uses radiometric calibration panels to convert digital numbers
    to reflectance values. By comparing average digital numbers of reflectance panels
    in the orthomosaic with laboratory-measured reflectance values, empirical lines
    are established. These lines facilitate the conversion of pixel values in multispectral
    or hyperspectral orthomosaic images to reflectance values (Chang et al., 2021).
    5.1.5 Pixel resampling Pixel resampling, the final step in image preprocessing,
    involves changing the size of digital images, typically done to prepare orthomosaics
    for subsequent processing like segmentation and feature extraction. ENVI by Visual
    Information Solutions Inc. is commonly known for pixel resampling, as reported
    in previous studies (Lu & He, 2018; Tian et al., 2021). 5.2 Segmentation Segmentation
    is a vital step in image processing, especially for geographic object-based analysis,
    directly influencing feature extraction and classification quality (Hossain &
    Chen, 2019). It entails dividing an image into homogeneous regions based on properties
    like color, texture, and size, employing techniques such as edge-based, region-based,
    pixel-based, and hybrid-based segmentation (Hossain & Chen, 2019). Deep learning-based
    segmentation, utilizing algorithms like CNN and PlantU-net (Li et al., 2021),
    is increasingly popular in UAV-based image processing (Osco, Marcato Jr., et al.,
    2021). Commercial software like Definiens Developer 7.0 (Lu & He, 2018), ArcGIS
    Pro v2.7, and eCognition (Abd-Elrahman et al., 2021) offer built-in segmentation
    algorithms, streamlining the process. 5.3 Feature extraction Following segmentation,
    the extraction of phenotypical features, such as plant height, width, and size,
    involves calculating values using pixel size in millimeters and specific functions
    (Wang, Qiu, et al., 2020). In this final image processing step, features are quantified
    and VIs are calculated. VIs combine operations or reflections of bands from RGB
    and/or spectral sensors to indicate vegetation vigor within a pixel. Effective
    with multispectral or hyperspectral data, VIs gained attention in plant phenotyping
    for monitoring various parameters by combining different spectral bands (Rodas
    et al., 2021; Tsouros et al., 2019). VIs can be categorized based on multispectral/hyperspectral
    data or visible spectrum/RGB images. Examples include ratio vegetation index (RVI),
    NDVI, normalized difference red edge index (NDRE), and green normalized difference
    vegetation index (GNDVI) derived from multispectral/hyperspectral data (Holman
    et al., 2019). RGB-based VIs, like excess greenness index (ExG) and normalized
    difference index (NDI), are also common (Tsouros et al., 2019). Software such
    as ArcGIS, QGIS, or other GIS-based tools facilitate feature extraction and VI
    calculations (Tresch et al., 2019). 5.4 Data analysis Data analysis is the critical
    step, involving classification, regression, or a combination based on the application.
    Classification predicts discrete values for detection applications, while regression
    predicts continuous values for estimation applications (Reza Ghafarian Malamiri
    et al., 2021; Shu et al., 2021). Previous studies have employed various methods,
    including ML and deep learning algorithms for UAV image processing (Table 6).
    CNN is commonly used for classification in deep learning, while ML algorithms
    like linear regression, random forest, and support vector machine serve both classification
    and regression purposes (Guilherme et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2021). Additionally,
    other deep learning algorithms such as Plant-Unit, recurrent neural network (RNN),
    multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and radial basis function networks (RBFNs) are
    utilized (Feng et al., 2021; Lu & He, 2018). TABLE 6. Diverse methods employed

    5.5 Evaluation The evaluation stage in most studies, while considered optional,
    is crucial for validating the method and ensuring result accuracy. Statistical
    analysis, particularly mean relative difference, is employed to compare field-measured
    values with OBIA-estimated values in field trials (Rallo et al., 2020). Additionally,
    statistical metrics, including overall accuracy, producer''s accuracy, user''s
    accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient, derived from the confusion matrix, assess
    the accuracy of object-based classification in UAV orthophotos (Daryaei et al.,
    2020). 6 UAV USE CASES IN PHENOTYPING A meta-analysis of UAV applications in phenotyping,
    involving a comprehensive review of 114 peer-reviewed articles from 2018 to 2022,
    categorizes studies into seven groups: cereals, horticulture, forestry, legumes
    and oil crops, root crops, pasture and livestock, and other crops (Figure 9).
    Findings indicate a predominant focus on cereal crops, trailed by horticulture,
    forestry, legumes, and oil crops, with insights into the distribution of research
    emphasis among crop categories. FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer Quantitative distribution

    of UAVs in various categories: horticulture, forestry, legumes and oilseeds, root
    crops, pasture and livestock, and other crops. Horticulture includes fruits and
    vegetables, focusing primarily on yield estimation and prediction. Forestry emphasizes
    disease detection and assessment, followed by mapping. Legume and oilseed crops
    exhibit a predominant interest in yield prediction. Pasture crops emphasize aboveground
    biomass estimation and mapping, while livestock phenotyping centers on animal
    detection. Root crops, challenging for UAVs due to underground data capture difficulties,
    receive fewer studies. Among other crops, cotton is prominent, with a focus on
    yield estimation and prediction. TABLE 8. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) use cases

    FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS In the evolving landscape of agricultural monitoring,
    UAV-based HTP holds immense potential, yet it grapples with multifaceted challenges
    that necessitate innovative solutions and strategic research directions. One of
    the primary challenges lies in the vulnerability of UAV-captured images to various
    factors, including atmospheric conditions, sensor calibration, and UAV stability.
    These factors collectively impact the reliability and accuracy of phenotyping
    data, crucial for informed decision-making in agriculture. Moreover, the sheer
    volume of data generated by drones, especially when equipped with advanced sensors
    capturing large datasets, presents significant challenges in terms of storage,
    processing, and efficient utilization. The absence of standardized protocols emerges
    as a critical hurdle, hindering the seamless integration and comparison of results
    across diverse studies and platforms. Without a common framework, researchers
    face difficulties in replicating and validating findings, impeding progress and
    collaboration in the field. Additionally, the regulatory landscape governing the
    use of drones for research and commercial purposes varies across countries and
    regions. Negotiating these variations poses legal and logistical challenges for
    researchers and operators, contributing to the complexity of adopting drone technology
    in agriculture. Financial constraints add another layer of difficulty, particularly
    for smaller research institutions or individual researchers. The cost associated
    with acquiring and maintaining drone technology, coupled with the expenses related
    to sophisticated data processing software, can be prohibitive. This financial
    barrier limits access to these transformative technologies, potentially excluding
    valuable contributors from participating in the advancement of agricultural monitoring.
    The expertise required for effective drone-based phenotyping is a significant
    challenge. Operating drones and analyzing the vast amount of data they produce
    demand specialized skills that may act as a barrier to entry for researchers and
    operators lacking this expertise. Bridging this skill gap is crucial for ensuring
    the widespread adoption and successful implementation of drone-based technologies
    in agriculture. Despite these challenges, the future of UAV-based HTP presents
    exciting research directions aimed at overcoming current limitations and maximizing
    the potential of this technology in agriculture. Researchers are exploring the
    development of advanced sensor technologies and algorithms to enhance the accuracy
    and precision of UAV-based platforms. This includes the detection and quantification
    of plant growth indicators, such as leaf chlorophyll content and plant height,
    using cutting-edge sensors and analytical techniques. The integration of multiple
    sensors, including hyperspectral, thermal, and LiDAR, is a key area of exploration.
    This multisensor approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and accurate dataset
    for phenotyping, capturing nuanced information about crop health and growth. Such
    advancements hold the promise of transforming drone-based phenotyping into a more
    sophisticated and reliable tool for agricultural monitoring. AI and ML are playing
    a pivotal role in addressing the challenges associated with data processing. These
    technologies enable the automation of complex analyses, pattern recognition, and
    correlation identification within the vast datasets collected by UAV-based platforms.
    Implementing AI and ML algorithms enhances the efficiency and accuracy of phenotyping,
    unlocking new possibilities for extracting valuable insights from the data. The
    integration of UAV-based platforms with other technologies, such as PA and unmanned
    ground vehicles (UGVs), is expanding the scope and impact of phenotyping. This
    holistic approach aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of crop growth
    and health by combining UAV-captured data with information from other sources,
    such as weather data or soil moisture sensors. UGVs, when combined with UAVs,
    offer ground-level data and validation for the information gathered from aerial
    platforms, contributing to a more robust and reliable dataset. To address the
    lack of standardization, researchers are actively working on developing protocols
    for UAV-based phenotyping. Standardized protocols would facilitate greater comparability
    and reproducibility of results across different studies and platforms. This concerted
    effort toward standardization is essential for establishing a cohesive framework
    that enables researchers to build upon each other''s work and collectively advance
    the field. Optimizing UAV parameters is another critical research direction. Identifying
    the optimal combination of parameters, including GSD, FA, speed, camera settings,
    and flight patterns, has the potential to significantly improve data quality,
    efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Real-time monitoring of UAV parameters, coupled
    with the development of open-source software for sharing and comparing optimized
    parameters, promotes collaboration and standardization within the research community.
    Expanding the applications of UAV platforms in phenotyping is a forward-looking
    research direction. Detection and monitoring of pests and diseases in crops using
    UAV technology represent a promising avenue for research. Developing new sensor
    technologies and analytical methods for detecting specific pests or diseases is
    key to enhancing the resilience and sustainability of agricultural practices.
    Ultimately, while UAV-based HTP faces substantial challenges, ongoing and future
    research directions promise to overcome these obstacles and elevate the role of
    UAVs in agricultural monitoring. The integration of advanced sensor technologies,
    AI, and ML, coupled with the optimization of UAV parameters and the development
    of standardized protocols, is shaping the future of this transformative technology.
    By addressing the challenges head-on and charting a course toward innovation,
    researchers are paving the way for a more precise, efficient, and widely applicable
    approach to agricultural monitoring. The collaborative efforts of the research
    community are instrumental in unlocking the full potential of UAV-based technologies
    and image processing technologies, contributing to sustainable and resilient agriculture
    in the years to come. 8 CONCLUSIONS The integration of UAV technology and image
    analytics in phenotyping has revolutionized the field of agriculture. With the
    ability to capture high-resolution images over large areas, UAVs have the potential
    to greatly increase the efficiency and accuracy of field phenotyping. The choice
    of UAV platform and its parameters, sensor type, and image processing techniques
    play important roles in obtaining reliable and accurate phenotyping data. ML and
    deep learning algorithms are rapidly advancing and have shown great potential
    in UAV-based phenotyping. However, there is a need for a standardized framework
    to aid in the decision-making process for selecting the appropriate methods and
    software for UAV-based phenotyping and image analytics. Overall, UAV-based phenotyping
    and image analytics hold great promise for advancing agricultural research and
    crop management practices. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Ocident Bongomin: Conceptualization;

    (IoT) is an artificial network that connects many objects and elements of a system
    by using contemporary Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and fundamental
    embedded systems, such as democratized detectors, gauges, and controllers. In
    their constant quest for sustainable and efficient distribution of energy, researchers
    are going on a revolutionary journey by investigating the integration of cutting-edge
    technology. The Internet of Things and cloud computing are at the vanguard of
    this revolutionary development, both of which hold the key to unleashing tremendous
    potential in the power systems (PS) area. In this article, we begin with a detailed
    investigation of the subtle interplay between IoT and cloud computing architecture,
    providing light on their cumulative significance in changing the prospects of
    power distribution. In this respect, it is referred to as the information revolution
    in this century. An improvement to the IoT called the Internet of Energy focuses
    on fusing ICT with energy generation [1]. The term \"IoT\" has gained popularity
    recently; it describes a network in which physical data and development software
    are exchanged between items through the Internet. Every time the concept of the
    Internet of Things is proposed, corporations and governments are immediately interested,
    which promotes research and development. Due to the widespread promotion of demand
    and research, it expanded quickly over the world [2]. The IoT, defined by its
    seamless interconnectedness of various elements inside the electrical system,
    is the beacon of an information revolution. IoT surpasses conventional electrical
    networks by leveraging modern Information and Communication Technology and embedded
    systems to imagine a dynamic, self-aware network of intelligent devices and assets.
    The Internet of Energy idea amplifies the revolutionary power of ICT by fusing
    it with energy generation, resulting in an ecosystem where efficiency, flexibility,
    and sustainability converge. Automation and intelligence in several facets of
    the electrical business are now closer to reality due to IoT in PS. In reality,
    the creation of this idea is what spurs the advancement of the smart grid''s (SG)
    capabilities as well as those of related ideas like the smart city, smart house,
    linked automobile, etc [3]. IoT is a network of interconnected computing devices
    and infrastructure that allows for the collection, analysis, and dissemination
    of data from disparate sources. IoT devices share the data they collect from sensors
    by connecting to an IoT network or another edge device, which then either sends
    the data to the cloud for analysis or does the analysis locally. Cloud computing
    develops as an influential trend, providing PS scientists with unparalleled data
    processing, storage, and computational capabilities. As IoT creates a deluge of
    real-time data, cloud computing provides a robust and scalable architecture that
    not only collects but also unleashes this torrent of information for informed
    decision-making. The combination of IoT with cloud computing, referred to as CloudIoT
    or Cloud of Things, is an empowered paradigm that offers up an ocean of opportunities
    for creative applications, predictive analytics, and optimized energy management
    in power distribution studies. At times, these devices exchange information with
    one another and take appropriate action based on that data. Although humans are
    involved in the process because they must line up the devices, give them instructions,
    and collect the data, the machines do most of the work themselves. We highlight
    the far-reaching influence of IoT and cloud-based solutions in the fields of distributed
    generation and renewable energy through an interactive look into real-time applications.
    From supporting SG with autonomous control systems to revolutionized smart cities
    through interconnected technologies such as home automation and smart transportation,
    the convergence of IoT and cloud computing offers a compelling vision for a truly
    interconnected and intelligent power ecosystem. The goal of IoT in power networks
    is to facilitate information sharing by enabling communication across all PS items,
    parts, and subsystems [4]. For users of PS, this concept''s implementation creates
    difficulties in addition to its numerous advantages and uses. Communication, storage
    capacity, and processing power will be the main obstacles in this field, especially
    when a big stream of data is continuously being produced and the controllers must
    cope with such a sizable data set [5]. The difficulties posed by IoT are handled
    via cloud computing. Delivering hosted services through the internet is referred
    to as \"cloud computing\" in general. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform
    as a Service (PaaS) [6], and Software as a Service (SaaS) are the three primary
    categories or kinds of cloud computing under which these services fall. The first
    method for gaining rapid access to massive computing resources through the Internet
    was cloud-based computing, which enables access to massive data handling and computational
    tasks in PS. The IoT and cloud computing are two distinct technologies that are
    currently part of our daily lives. It is anticipated that they will be extensively
    accepted and used, making them crucial components of the Digital Revolution. A
    novel approach that combines IoT with the cloud is anticipated to be significant
    and open up a large variety of application possibilities. By offering endless
    processing and storage capacity, this technology has addressed numerous issues
    related to the integration of IoT in PS. However, it is clear that cloud services
    technology has advanced more often than IoT, and so many IoT-related problems
    have been at least partially fixed. Since the cloud and the Internet of Things
    are compatible technologies, there is a phased rollout in the PS that has been
    anticipated to be combined. This new design is known as CloudIoT, commonly referred
    to as the Cloud of Things [7]. The major perspective of this article is to outline
    the characteristics of IoT and cloud-based computing in Power Distribution research.
    This article tries to not only clarify the present but also to imagine the range
    of possibilities as we travel towards the future of PS. The key roles and responsibilities
    served by IoT are listed as follows: power quality studies, renewable energy integration,
    SG communication, power monitoring and energy management studies. At the same
    time, Cloud computing categorized its purpose in SG operation, energy management
    and state estimation studies. It could drive the power sector to previously unattainable
    levels of efficiency, sustainability, and dependability by introducing fresh criteria
    and optimization approaches. In addition, we suggest future research directions
    with a focus on grid-to-vehicle technology and electric vehicle integration to
    promote efficient resource management and utilization of energy. The research
    objectives are summarized as follows: 1. Analyze the evolution of IoT by investigating
    its architecture and examining IoT security issues. 2. Explore the evolution of
    cloud computing by reviewing cloud computing deployment models. 3. Assess applications
    of IoT in PS studies by evaluating IoT-based power quality studies, renewable
    energy integration, SG communication, power monitoring, and energy management.
    4. Evaluate applications of cloud computing in PS studies by examining cloud computing-based
    SG operation, energy management, and power system state estimation. 5. Conclude
    and propose future research directions in the context of IoT and cloud computing
    in PS. For this article, a survey protocol was utilized, focusing on an array
    of prominent academic databases. The search strategy was meticulously designed
    around a set of targeted keywords relevant to the study. These keywords included
    terms such as ''Internet of Things'', ''Cloud Computing'', ''Power Systems'',
    ''Renewable Energy'', ''Cloud of Things'', ''IoT Security'', ''Data Processing'',
    ''Smart Grid'', and ''Energy Management''. Each term was explored individually
    and in various combinations to ensure a thorough and wide-ranging literature coverage.
    The selection criteria for the papers included in this survey were primarily based
    on the relevance to the predefined objectives, the novelty of the methodology,
    the breadth and depth of coverage, and the significance of contributions to the
    field. Special emphasis was placed on research published mainly in the last seven
    years. From this point on, it is organized as follows. Section 2 masteries the
    reader with the IoT evolution. While Section 3 depicts the progress of cloud computing,
    IoT and cloud-based applications in Power distribution research are discussed
    in Sections 4 Applications of IoT in power system studies, 5 Applications of cloud
    computing in power system studies, respectively. Conclusion and suggestions for
    further study are provided in Section 6. 2. Evolution of IoT The IoT is a set
    of various connected devices, utilities, humans, also technologies that can interlink,
    and segment data, and evidence to realize a common objective in many areas and
    software. Conveyance, agricultural production, Medicare, energy production, and
    distribution are just a few of the Orders to synchronize dimensions. Several important
    elements have contributed to the development of the IoT. The integration of smart
    features into a variety of products has been made possible by advancements in
    microelectronics and the miniaturization of sensors and processors. As a result,
    these gadgets can now collect data and communicate it over the internet. The widespread
    use of smartphones and the proliferation of wireless networks have created the
    framework required for seamless device-to-cloud connection, enabling vast data
    collection and analysis. The objective of the IoT is to have variations in the
    way to live currently by authorized embedded systems to execute regular tasks
    and Smart institutions, new technologies, smart conveyance and organization, and
    so on ensure all examples of smart technologies [8]. IoT devices are application-centric
    entities. They can only be utilized for the purpose for which they were designed.
    For instance, IoT devices designed for smart homes cannot be used for other business,
    industrial, or medical purposes. The power requirements, form factors, and user
    interface designs of IoT devices vary depending on the application; on the other
    hand, the underlying component technologies and IoT sensors could be similar.
    Since it introduces sub-optimality, a generic device design is avoided [9]. 2.1.
    Youth opportunities and prospects The Internet of Things (IoT) provides numerous
    business opportunities, allowing organizations to make new business strategies
    and techniques to incorporate the concept. Not only business occasions, but also
    effective and resourceful current research are required for multidisciplinary
    academic learners as shown in Fig. 1 (a). As a result, it encompasses business
    studies, technical skills, science, and social sciences. Also, as shown in Fig.
    1 (b), the internet of Things alters the universe into a smart world with its
    improved and economical operation, in which all activities are easy to access
    in less effort and time [10,11]. Download : Download high-res image (508KB) Download

    (b) IoT-based smart applications. 2.2. IoT architecture Each layer in the Internet
    of Things is described by the features it executes and the devices it employs.
    In the IoT, there are different viewpoints on the layer. However, many investigators
    consider the three levels of the IoT: perception, network, and application [12].
    Each layer of the Internet of Things has its own set of safety considerations.
    Fig. 1 (b) depicts the IoT''s basic analytical design in terms of the devices
    and systems that each layer incorporated in it [13]. 2.2.1. Perception layer In
    IoT, it remains also discussed as the Sensors layer. The objective of this layer
    is to collect data from the atmosphere using sensors and gadgets such as laptops,
    smart meters, etc. Before transmitting data to the network layer, this layer discovers,
    collects, and processes it. This layer also changes IoT node joint efforts in
    indigenous and short-range systems [14]. 2.2.2. Network layer The network layer
    of the Internet of Things is responsible for data directing and communication
    to various youth centres and equipment. Cloud-based computing systems, Internet
    gateways, switching, and routing strategies, and other technologies in this layer
    use cutting-edge innovations like WiFi, LTE, Bluetooth, 3G, and Zigbee. By combining,
    filtering, and transmission of data to and from sensor data, network interfaces
    act as a mediator among different IoT devices as given in Fig. 2 [13]. Download

    Layers of IoT architecture. 2.2.3. Application layer The data''s validity, integrity,
    and anonymity are all guaranteed by the application layer. Therefore, the goal
    of IoT or the emergence of a network grid is accomplished at this layer. 2.3.
    IoT security issues Various security issues are related to IoT whose description
    is being given in subsequent sections. 2.3.1. Confidentiality It is significant
    to guarantee that data is safe and accessible only to authenticate personnel.
    A user on the Internet of Things can be a person, a computer, or a service, as
    well as internal artefacts (strategies that are connected to the network) and
    outside substances (strategies that are not connected to the network). It is critical,
    for instance, to ensure that detectors do not expose information collected to
    nearby nodes. 2.3.2. Integrity Because the Internet of Things relies on data being
    exchanged between such a variety of devices, data accuracy is critical as depicted
    in Fig. 3. However, end-to-end safety in Communication protocols can be used to
    enforce the integrity feature. Since the quality base nature of short computing
    authority of IoT nodes, data traffic is handled using firewalls and procedures,
    but this does not assure security at the endpoints [15]. Download : Download high-res

    2.3.3. Availability The goal of the Internet of Things is to attach as many smart
    devices. Therefore, users of the Internet of Things should have access to all
    data at all times. However, data is not the only element used in the IoT; to meet
    IoT perceptions, products and applications must be attainable and available when
    needed promptly [16]. 2.3.4. Authentication Each IoT object is necessary to be
    able to recognize and verify other IoT objects. However, because of the evolution
    of the IoT, this process can be difficult; many objects are involved (devices,
    individuals, facilities, service workers, and processing units), and artefacts
    may be essential to communicate with others for the first time [17]. 3. Evolution
    of cloud computing Cloud-based Computing is popular equipment that provides facilities
    for both private and public such as easy access to data, applications, and files
    over the internet and accessible computing services online rather than nearby
    stored documents on employers'' computers and phones. It is too recognized to
    provide active services [18] to clients such as [19] affordable, flexible alternatives
    [20]. It is a product that benefits businesses all over the world by lowering
    hardware expenses. The skill is based on the Compensation model, and many of its
    services can be found in well-known technology businesses such as Google, Microsoft,
    IBM, and others. Compared to a regulated service, more often known as contributions,
    this model allows clients to buy the services they desire based on their needs.
    In the ‘Software as a Service’ (SaaS) distribution model, this type of approach
    is commonly utilized [21]. Computing is quickly becoming one of the most popular
    topics in the field of information technology. Large corporations and small and
    medium-sized firms aim to adopt cost-effective computer resources for their enterprise
    applications, i.e., by incorporating the cloud computing idea into their ecosystem.
    It''s a novel way of offering virtualization techniques. It is a collection of
    IT services provided to a client on a licensed basis across networks with the
    capacity to grow up or down their service requirements. Typically, a third-party
    supplier who owns the equipment delivers Cloud Services. Customers may use the
    cloud to demand services, apps, and services and store large amounts of data from
    many locations. It has the potential to eliminate the need for the business to
    build up a high-cost computing infrastructure to leverage IT-based software and
    products. It claims to deliver a flexible IT infrastructure that can be accessed
    via the internet from mobile devices. This would allow the capability and abilities
    to exist and new programs to be multiplied many times. This new computing economic
    model has taken root and is drawing significant worldwide investments. Due to
    the efficiency of services given by the pay-per-use uniform grid on assets such
    as power consumption utilized, transactions carried out, broadband used, data
    moved, or storage space, many sectors such as finance, health, and academia are
    shifting to the cloud. Due to the potential advantages of cloud computing, enterprises
    are apprehensive about using it owing to security concerns and obstacles. Security
    is a vital part of cloud computing, with several concerns and problems associated
    with it. Both the cloud provider and the cloud service customer must ensure that
    the cloud is secure from any external threats. There was also a chance that a
    malicious user could acquire the cloud by simulating a genuine user, contaminating
    the whole cloud and affecting a large number of customers who share the infected
    cloud. This study article explains what a public cloud is, the many cloud architectures,
    and the factors that influence data protection. The cloud computing model is provided

    users to immediately access up and down, providing greater validity, rapid response
    time, and adaptability to accommodate traffic variations and requirements. It
    also supports multi-tenancy, with machines designed in such a way that they''ll
    be aggregated and accessed by a large number of companies or consumers [22]. Cloud
    suppliers can use computing power to turn a single system into many virtual machines,
    removing the need for customer communication in subjective [23]. This optimizes
    integrated demand while also allowing clients to benefit from scale economies.
    Cloud computing involves a significant amount of data transfer. These include
    vendor-to-user communications, customer broadcasts, and user-to-third-party communications.
    Encrypted is perhaps the most straightforward approach to ensuring that all data
    transmissions are safe and that the data reaches its desired target without being
    tampered with. Data security is provided by monitoring and restricting access
    to data via security protocols, levels, and identity management. There are two
    parts of a standard Cloud Computing environment: the front and the back end. The
    front end is on the customer''s side, and it can be accessed via the Internet.
    On the other hand, the back end is disturbed by cloud services [19]. Cloud Computing

    models Some clients have access to the public cloud, which a 3rd person operates.
    During the same period, different businesses could use the technology supplied.
    Clients can constantly supply services from the service provider via the Internet.
    Waste of assets is reduced because customers pay for the services they receive.
    Cloud services are solely offered to a single client and maintained by the company
    or a third-party service provider [24]. This is a proprietary network that employs
    the idea of system emulation. Eucalyptus Systems [25] is one of the greatest instances
    of a private cloud. Equipment used by various organizations for a common goal
    is maintained either by individuals or by a third-party network operator. Facebook
    is an example of a Community Cloud. A combination of various cloud deployment
    models that are coupled in such a way that data is transferred from them without
    interfering with one another. Amazon is an example of a Hybrid Cloud. Additionally,
    cloud computing offers services and opens up new application categories that were
    previously unattainable. Some examples are (a) location-, environment-, and context-aware
    mobile interactive applications that react in real time to data from human users,
    sensors (such as stress and humidity sensors inside shipping containers), or even
    independent information services (like global weather data); (b) parallel batch
    processing, which enables users to leverage massive processing power to analyze
    terabytes of data for comparatively short periods of time, while programming abstractions
    like Google''s Map or its open source make the intricate process of parallel running
    an application across dozens of servers transparent to programmers [26]. 4. Applications
    of IoT in power system studies As an empirical study, we have predicted the rise
    in the proportion of IoT sensor devices based on the different datasets prevailing
    from the International Data Company (IDC) [27]. During 2015-16, a 2.27 % rise
    in the interconnection of sensor devices attained a peak of 11.01 % rise that
    occurred in 2023-24 as plotted in Fig. 6. The role of IoT in different PS studies
    has been listed in subsequent sections. Download : Download high-res image (235KB)

    devices interconnection for last 9 years. 4.1. IoT-based power quality studies
    Authors [28] proposed ‘k’ mapping as a successful technique for quickly activating
    the knowledge of a system in a smart network using IoT innovation. This research
    proposes an acceptable technique for enterprise power flow controllers for grid-connected
    systems to recover their strength and block organization in a grid by analyzing
    power flow between the multi-lines. IPFC integrates a collection of paying FACTS
    devices and makes use of their capabilities. This article examines the use of
    IoT in a web-based, globally collected grid-connected PS utilizing IoT, with an
    emphasis on the standard for the advancement of the dazzling matrix. The results
    were compared to those obtained using more traditional methods and the reduced
    time needed for the movements to settle after pay has decreased, as exemplified
    by the reaction. In this way, constant observation and early warning of disaster
    can be accepted, allowing the power framework to sufficiently reject or mitigate
    the harm caused by considerable cataclysmic events. The cost of our electricity
    broadcast line observing outline should decrease in the future, and the accuracy
    of our framework should be improved as well. 4.2. IoT-based renewable energy integration
    Authors [29] defined a method for analyzing citywide solar power services for
    a remote base IV tracing system. The development and execution of a remote base,
    observing system that allows investors to accurately measure the appearances and
    performance of solar sections under controlled circumstances were presented in
    this paper. The system also includes data storage and management infrastructure,
    as well as integration with different analysis engines. While the system can work
    independently, it was built with decentralized systems in mind and can successfully
    be implemented with other youth-based remote solar observing strategies. To analyze
    the effects of soiling on solar output power, the research conceptual test facility
    was employed, and the efficacy of PV assortments was evaluated for two months.
    A comparison of the goods from the two sites after two months in summer weather
    with a typical daily temperature of 45 °C demonstrates a soiling reduction of
    up to 40%. It is mandated to improve solar panel washing to decrease cleaning
    costs and increase power output by conducting thorough data analysis. This is
    an important step toward implementing solar power in areas where soiling is a
    major barrier. However, the system''s application is not restricted to the use
    case presented here. The software''s layout, which follows the IoT paradigm, allows
    it to represent a range of circumstances and use cases with minimal infrastructure
    changes. If anything, depending on the use case, control devices or software applications
    can be properly installed. Instead of relying on computer models, the ability
    to study levels in different configurations in a real-life setting could provide
    a more accurate representation of the facility''s actual performance. 4.3. IoT-based
    smart grid communication A flexible power scheme for solar-powered IoT sensors
    was presented [30]. Developers'' current design approach for long-lasting energy
    from the smart sun sensor in this paper. The quality characteristics of storage
    volume and solar cell region for five years of continuous procedure were calculated
    using innovative insight. The device can adjust its electricity consumption based
    on the available power. The battery public of responsibility and the average solar
    activity accessible to the device in the previous 24 h are used to determine the
    power generated. To compensate for the lower amount of information conducted per
    hour, the device''s power consumption is reduced. In both cases, adaptive power
    can aid in the reduction of PS sizing. The flexible power to SOC state reduces
    the battery constraint while allowing for a smaller solar cell area. Evolutionary
    power consumption in response to solar activity, on the other hand, has a greater
    impact on the required power consumption while maintaining the average transmission
    rate. In practice, integrating adaptive power necessitates electronic circuits
    and computing power considerations. Understanding the impact of different methods
    on a power layout can aid in the development of a better solution for a particular
    smart sensor. As a result, designing an adaptable and flexible solar-powered system
    requires knowledge of the system''s application and efficiency constraints. In
    Ref. [31], they were assigned to develop and implement an extraordinary precision,
    elevated, low power, and versatile influence system of measurement that could
    be used in various applications. A voltage trying to regulate, regulator loop,
    zero offset speakers, highly accurate equivalent to digital adapters, and the
    reference voltage are all part of the proposed system. Simulations and experimental
    measurements are used to validate the proposed circuit''s proper operation. The
    system architecture has a maximum sampling rate of 5 MHz, 0.16 % load guideline
    error, and 0.32 % correlation mistake. The implemented system is expected to provide
    accurate guidance for IoT device power behaviour, which can be used for system
    efficiency improvement as well as personality testing. It is worth emphasizing
    that, in contrast to other authority amount solutions and yields on the market,
    the power generation measurement system is intended for smart energy networks.
    To reduce IoT network power requirements, it has the desired precision of capacity,
    rapidity, usability, and reliability. Integration of the items in the research
    circuit is also economically viable due to the large number of IoT devices. SG
    Power Transmission was presented [32]. The use of the Internet of Things equipment
    on the power grid is an effective technique for speeding up the modernization
    of the power grid system, as well as for efficient power grid architecture design.
    One of the essential IoT application fields is disaster prevention and the decrease
    of power transmission lines. Innovative IoT sensing and social networks can accurately
    prevent or reduce transmission line damage from natural disasters, improve power
    transmission accuracy, and reduce economic loss. This paper discussed using it
    in an online observing program for power broadcast lines, focusing on SG design
    and maintenance characteristics. The cost of our power broadcast line monitoring
    organization needs to be minimized in the future, and the system''s consistency
    needs to be improved. Authors [33] collaborated on a smart farm irrigation system
    powered by IoT and solar power. The construction of an IoT-based solar power framework
    for smart irrigation is critical for locations throughout the world that face
    water shortages and power constraints. The suggested system focuses on a specific
    board system-on-a-chip console (hence referred to as the controller) with a built-in
    Wi-Fi connection and influences to a solar cell to deliver efficient management
    influence. The control system examines the field for moisture, temperature, and
    detectors before sending suitable actuation knowledge signals to the irrigation
    equipment. The controller also attempts to concentrate on the alternate water
    level, which is required to protect the pump motors from overheating owing to
    low water levels in the well. Federal control, mobile observation, switch, and
    fuzzy-based control are the three modes of operation of the suggested model. An
    example was deliberate, built, and evaluated in verifying the proposed system.
    For industrial drive applications [34], proposed that an IoT is a cloud intelligent
    voltage stability observing system. To keep the procedure going properly, industries
    are increasingly using IoT-based power feature monitoring equipment. As a result,
    the paper developed an automated power quality method that manages the power quality
    dynamic features logging with pre- and post-values to make the data combination
    system more efficient. The offered system logs the drive''s electrical measures
    as well as voltage stability event data in the Firebase cloud, reducing the amount
    of space required and saving time when evaluating power quality occurrences. Furthermore,
    end-users could choose the power quality requirements. Overall, the implemented
    application is faster, more cost-effective, more accurate, and simpler to use,
    and it can be applied to a variety of real-time applications. In the future, the
    researchers will create a smarter IoT device from two viewpoints. Techniques must
    be automatic to quantify the system''s harmonics at the measuring point. Authors
    must consider using ML to utilize all of the evidence gathered from IoT power
    superiority technology to monitor possible problems and anomalous behaviour on
    the cloudy side. Finally, the proposed model will be a plug-and-play scheme or
    a standardized device that can incorporate with any current system and begin monitoring
    operations. Power-system protection device [35] was suggested based on Internet-of-Things
    techniques that could be incorporated into intelligent devices. The detection
    system protects electrical customers linked to the community power grid by cutting
    off power in case of several faults, including short circuits, overcurrent, escape
    of the current, and electrical arc. The design, application, and useable validation
    of an efficient energy safety device with IoT-based assistance for incorporating
    intelligent devices such as Smart Homes and Smart Cities were discussed. The designed
    methodology refers to new functions of a power switch by offering security toward
    extra faults and fetching smart in the context that each detection system interconnects
    with a Web server via a concentrator-type architectural design. The system also
    has a Web-based configuration for an observing system of effective devices, as
    well as actual event notification via g-mail and SMS. IoT was proposed to monitor
    power broadcast and delivery for the SG. The basic Internet of Things design for
    power transmission and transfer observing is described in this paper. When creating
    a WSN-based IoT, it''s important to think about detector requirements as well
    as interface design that''s appropriate for a specific local power transmission
    system. Consequently, for distant monitoring and developing nations such as Indonesia,
    wireless transmission is used. To address the fundamental needs for data sources,
    real-time monitoring, and long-distance monitoring, GPRS is recommended. Using
    IoT technology, power broadcast and delivery constraints may be clearly shown
    on a PC or even a smartphone. The authors want to focus their future work on building
    enterprise-to-trial devices for power distribution systems that may be useful
    to Indonesia. Within the field of Energy Informatics, the essential part of Smart
    Dynamism and Power Schemes Demonstrating were defined [36]. The ultimate goal
    is to determine how the smart energy and Power Structures Molding themes may be
    applied to address challenges. To begin, the paper will explore how and where
    the topic of Smart Energy [37] and PS Modelling fits within the larger topic of
    energy informatics. The role of smart energy and PS modelling within the broader
    Energy Information systems area is then acknowledged, with explanations of the
    main connections between fundamental subjects, specific fields of study, qualitative
    and quantitative data, and IoT, to perform specific assessments for current and
    future PS. Furthermore, additional work will be carried out to establish a suitable
    vision for energy informatics academic courses based on the major challenges and
    interconnections found in this study. 4.4. IoT-based power monitoring In [38],
    the authors presented a systematic and comprehensive review of current ML methods
    and their possible applications in combined PS. In the framework of AI, machine
    learning presents a potential solution for constructing well-organized and correct
    data-driven defensive measures to deal with developing effective and switch issues
    in PS. Machine learning has the primary benefit of being able to process information
    on a larger scale and with more dimensions in a complex system. Furthermore, machine
    learning techniques rely heavily on historical datasets and quality training,
    which are typically unaffected by dynamic simulation and specifications. Machine
    learning techniques would have quick responses and important flexibility in various
    circumstances if efficient learning datasets were provided. This paper presented
    a thorough and systematic review of current ML methods in a wide range of youth-integrated
    PS. Authors [39] execute a review of the previous works on its use in energy systems
    in general and SG in specific. We also go over some of the IoT skills, such as
    cloud technology and various data analysis systems. They also look at some of
    the difficulties of deploying it in the energy sector, such as security and privacy,
    as well as some alternatives, such as blockchain technology. This survey gives
    energy policymakers, economic experts, and managers an overview in PS enhancement.
    The authors categorize various IoT use cases in each segment of the energy supply
    chain, from source to energy grids to end-user sectors. The benefits of its-based
    energy management to increase energy efficiency and integrate renewable energy
    are mentioned, and the results are summarized. The authors discuss some of the
    difficulties of using it in the energy sector, such as object identification,
    large information management, network connections and uncertainty, subsystem integration,
    privacy and security, the electricity consumption of IoT systems, optimization,
    and architecture. 4.5. IoT-based energy management For demand reduction [40],
    they suggested a fog-based PS. In a youth-based system, this paper suggests a
    multi-negotiator approach for a smart energy society. The competitive atmosphere
    in human civilizations has inspired this author to offer an Agent Negotiation
    system for source reduction. The IoT system''s agents haggle with the metering
    agent to accept a plan that reduces peak-hour use. Negotiations are conducted
    with hundreds of thousands of institutions, allowing benefits to manage supply
    and demand in general [41]. Customers receive good pricing based on the strategies
    that have been agreed upon. Installation of power line sensors to collect data
    on voltage, active power, and other electrical limitations might be added to the
    project in the future. This will make it easier to monitor the quality of power
    provided to houses. The data from the satellites and associated intelligent devices
    may be utilized to track the transformer''s health. It is possible to monitor
    the entire grid and use cutting-edge MLA such as deep learning to assess the probability
    of blackouts or outages. Its Architecture for SG was presented by Ref. [42]. The
    execution of the IoT in various parts of insolent grids was examined in this work.
    The application of the Internet of Things in various parts of SG was examined
    in this work. The research was divided into three sections. The implications of
    it in the generation layer were discussed in the first section. The importance
    of new technology in wind and solar alternative fuels, as well as thermal plants
    and power storage infrastructure, was thoroughly explained in this layer. The
    transmission layer is addressed in the second part. Its integration in this layer
    enhances line reliability, resulting in better power grid monitoring. Automatic
    IoT controllers result in more successful utilization as well as better congestion
    management in emergencies. Finally, the distribution level was treated within
    the third layer. In addition to industrial digital technology, the role of youth
    ineffective distribution systems, microgrids, smart cities, intelligent cities,
    and smart homes were evaluated in this section. Home automation is the future
    of energy management in smart buildings. Domotics, as a subfield of mechatronics,
    deals with home automation that allow one to regulate the lights, air conditioning,
    appliances, security, and theatre [43]. Devices on domestic zone become an essential
    part of the IoT when they are connected to the Internet. Automation, including
    automated control and decision-making, is another advancement in the SG. The terms
    \"unmanned aerial vehicles\" (UAV) and \"unmanned grounded vehicles\" (UGV) refer
    to robotic systems. UAVs and UGVs are basically utilized on the ground to further
    automate the current PS when they have an internet connection, making them IoT.
    It could be used to identify and locate faults in the PS. The literature has a
    few examples of how to integrate IoT technologies and mechanisms into the automation
    of SG. A solar power plant''s maximum power point tracking system based on the
    IoT has been visualized [44]. The scientists have looked into power transmission
    line fault diagnosis [45]. An Arduino platform IoT concept for a small virtual
    power plant is depicted. Through an examination of the relationships between various
    virtual power networks and high- or medium-voltage networks, the relationship
    between IoT and microgrid economics is further explored [46]. Furthermore, intelligent
    algorithms like ramping behavior analysis can be used to better integrate price-based
    demand response with system control. 5. Applications of cloud computing in power
    system studies The roles of cloud computing in different PS studies have been
    listed in subsequent sections. 5.1. Cloud computing-based smart grid operation
    SG Incorporation was performed using Cloud-Based Systems and Decentralized Platforms
    [47]. This research discusses critical issues that must be talked about in instruction
    to guarantee the security of decentralized cloud energy schemes. The paper also
    examines how cloud computing and blockchain can help Ghana improve its inefficient
    distribution and transmission networks. Following that, a strategy for the democratization
    of Ghana''s grid network is being developed. A blockchain and SDN-based architecture
    have been proposed to address the probable issues of integrating a legacy network
    with a processer cloud [48]. Taking care of these issues ensures that the SG in
    the cloud is safe and operates efficiently. Incorporating its SDNs, and Blockchain
    into DERs could help ensure that enough electricity is generated to meet available
    at any given time. Task scheduler [49] plans to enhance cloud system performance.
    By decreasing the task-to-come time, time of execution, and energy ingestion,
    the task development procedure aims to improve the efficiency of real-time applications
    and services. The proposed method is based on an artificial neural network (ANN)-based
    system with a genetic algorithm (GA)-based preparation model. According to the
    findings, the proposed GA-ANN model outperforms existing techniques in terms of
    power consumption, total achievement time (ms), average start time (ms), and average
    completion time (ms). The GA-ANN model used in this study is based on real-time
    user needs gathered from workload traces and produced data sets. The suggested
    framework reduces power consumption by 13%, reduces development time by 77.14%,
    and reduces implementation times by 36%. As a result, when compared with existing
    systems, the proposed GA-ANN method outperforms them. The cloud-based moderate
    PS simulator [50] was implemented. Cloud PSS, an elevated PS emulator, is described.
    Cloud PSS provides a high-efficiency, simple-to-use, and low-cost alternative
    for modelling large-scale PS and multi-scenario upgrades to the planned open cloud
    service integrated system, the intuitive code generator, and the various distributed
    processing approaches. It''s worth noting that the automated software generator''s
    framework and methods aren''t limited to simulations. Hybrid-cloud-based data
    processing in SG was suggested [51]. The technique indicated that a significant
    and productive wireless sensor network be built to supervise the numerous significant
    extent parameters in the PS. SG architectural design, monitoring and individual
    possesses to improve the performance for validating numerous demanding applications
    and trying to build a high-reliability, high-performance wireless sensor network
    for observing the power grid''s numerous significant measurement parameters. Renewable
    energy is illustrated by integrating accessible renewable energy sources (solar,
    biomass, or wave energy) into the electricity network and increasing storage capacity
    by participating in data processing hardware-based devices to the private cloud
    that can be used in power grid data processing and forecasting. PS evaluation
    and control, which entails enhancing power grid stability to deal with rapid changes
    in energy grid flow. Using data analysis hardware, improve adaptive security,
    transient stability switching, energy control, and capacity analysis. 5.2. Cloud
    computing-based energy management Load-balancing methods in a cloud computing
    system were studied [52]. Researchers could use this review paper to create optimized
    and efficient scheduling algorithms for cloud environments. Because it included
    an understanding of current and available load-balancing techniques, this study
    will aid researchers in identifying research issues related to load balancing,
    particularly in terms of reducing response time and avoiding server faults. Researchers
    can continue to examine ways to build strategies that are more dynamic and intelligent,
    as well as focus on fault tolerance concerns, to improve the performance of cloud
    services. Researchers will evaluate the environment and perceptive methodologies
    in the future, such as the use of machine learning or classification models. In
    Ref. [53], the authors suggested a cloud-based economic delivery model for SG.
    They proposed an intelligent grid, cloud economic power dispatch model. We presented
    an overview of current work that blends cloud computing into the established SG
    architectural design to develop a trustworthy and energy-efficient [54] distribution
    system in this research. Various topics of SG power management were debated. We
    identified several critical technical problems and suggested several areas for
    future research for cloud-based SG. This design provides additional memory for
    evaluating computing mechanisms for electricity management and cost-cutting. A
    novel way to provide low-cost cloud-based power for SG applications has been presented.
    According to the findings of this survey, the use of cloud computing in SG is
    expected to be helpful for further enhancing SG architectural design in areas
    such as cost monitoring, computer technology, and power organization. 5.3. Cloud
    computing-based power system state estimation A cloud-hosted virtualized explanation
    [55] has been done for additional generation messages based on PMU capabilities.
    Not only can the technique execute economic load dispatch to keep the system balanced,
    but it can also share emergency response information such as control signals,
    system balancing performance indicators, and operator rebuttals in a timely, precise,
    and secure manner. With the aid of this cloud-based technology, developing human
    mistakes produced by phone calls utilized for manual, verbal deployment may be
    avoided. Each procedure activity carried out on the platform is recorded in a
    database using a standard data format, making auditing and authority monitoring
    much simpler. This work also included the integration, and cybersecurity method
    that included data protection, access control, key rotation, and access authorization
    to meet critical organization specifications for the influence grid. It offers
    guidance for further grid operators trying to acquire their cloud storage. Overall
    experience in developing and implementing the first manufacturing cloud-based
    PS simulation framework was discussed [56]. The platform was built with an open
    architecture in mind. It can support a variety of resource management and work
    balancing tools, as well as various system simulation programs. The cloud-computing
    interface meets the requirements of existing cyber safety and data privacy necessities
    thanks to carefully deploying cyber security strategies that are exactly equivalent
    to establishing evidence infrastructure and services. The power production industry
    has struggled to implement cloud-based facilities, but as values strive to remain
    adaptable in the face of ever-changing technology, this framework is fast transforming.
    Discussions on architecture, enterprise, secure and resilient, computational display,
    cost savings, and difficulties will help all utilities that have been constrained
    by the ever-increasing need for sophisticated computing features in power scheme
    offline planning training. Based on the CHAIN framework [57] a cloud battery management
    system. Developers proposed a cloud-to-things outline with four systems: end,
    edge, cloud, and knowledge by merging digital twins with deep learning approaches,
    difficult identification, estimate, and optimum control functions [58,59]. We
    also used an example to demonstrate a successful direction. Using the cyber hierarchy
    and interactional network architecture, an end power cloud architecture design
    for a cloud-based BMS with multi-scale centralized data analysis was constructed
    as tabulated in Table 1. The current proposed structure is based on the CHAIN
    outline and has extremely large potential for improving battery and management
    system performance in a smart and maintainable manner [60,61]. Table 1. Comparative

    The primary goal of power automation system (PAS) was to offer an intelligent
    and self-sufficient monitoring solution through the use of affordable hardware
    and lightweight software. Deep ensemble models were employed by the PAS for PV
    system power forecast and fault detection. The following steps served as the foundation
    for the PAS fault diagnostics. First, by examining Current–Voltage (I–V) characteristics
    in a number of faulty and normal occurrences, the key aspects were identified.
    For comprehensive PV plant monitoring, including data collection, storing, pre-
    and post-processing, fault and failure diagnosis, performance and energy yield
    assessment, and output power projection, PAS offers an interoperable, scalable,
    and reproducible system. IoT applications can be utilized for user access and
    data transfer, while cloud servers can handle system processing. Remote locations
    might make advantage of this monitoring service [66]. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    platform is used by PAS to handle data and facilitate communication and interoperability
    between its various components and devices. Additionally, PAS comes with a personal
    cloud server for processing and archiving the PV system data that is collected.
    Additionally, the information is displayed to numerous users via an open-source,
    lightweight web monitor system that is part of the PAS. The monitoring and evaluation
    tasks covered in this study were composed of a series of independent steps; nevertheless,
    tasks may also be considered non-independent, or as a work flow in which dependent
    activities cannot be finished concurrently. This raises questions for future research.
    To enable quicker handling, some data with a high emergency level can be assigned
    a priority level. Several guidelines can be devised for data transfer. However,
    parameters such as energy, cost, demand prediction etc., might be included to
    identify where tasks should be performed. In subsequent study, we intend to precisely
    diagnose all electrical failures in PV arrays, including bypass diode problems,
    line-ground issues, shading, etc. The Deep learning algorithms can be challenging
    to select ensemble learning models. Thus, the optimization techniques could be
    incorporated. To increase the precision of power forecasting, we would also employ
    several loss functions. 6. Conclusion & future work This comprehensive review
    has shed light on the transformational possibilities of combining IoT and cloud
    computing in power distribution systems. The convergence of these cutting-edge
    technologies provides exceptional prospects to improve the power industry''s efficiency,
    sustainability, and dependability. IoT lays the groundwork for an information
    revolution by seamlessly integrating disparate parts inside the electrical grid,
    enabling a dynamic network of intelligent devices and assets. Furthermore, the
    Internet of Energy (IoE) accelerates this revolution by imagining a future in
    which ICT and energy generation merge to produce an adaptive and self-aware power
    ecosystem. Cloud computing arises as a major changer, supplying the infrastructure
    required to manage the massive volume of real-time data created by IoT devices.
    Cloud computing provides effective utilization of this information for informed
    decision-making by providing robust data processing, storage capabilities, and
    scalable resources. The combination of IoT with cloud computing, known as CloudIoT
    or Cloud of Things, enables innovation, predictive analytics, and optimized energy
    management, opening up previously unimagined possibilities in power distribution
    studies. But there will be difficulties ahead. Addressing connection bottlenecks,
    storage constraints, and data processing complexity is critical to establishing
    seamless integration. Fortunately, cloud computing provides IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
    models as a viable option to tackle these challenges. As we turn our gaze to the
    future, new research opportunities emerge day by day. CoT would be foreseen by
    researchers to locate energy hubs that can improve the efficiency and efficacy
    of power technology by adding fresh parameters and optimization approaches. Future
    endeavours can support seamless energy utilization and resource management, moving
    the power sector towards greener and further sustainable practices by emphasizing
    the integration of electric cars and grid-to-vehicle technology. This article
    serves as a foundation, motivating academics, practitioners, and politicians to
    work together to create a greener, more technologically advanced energy landscape.
    The convergence of IoT and cloud computing turns electricity distribution networks
    into intelligent, networked, and resilient grids, opening the path for generations
    to follow to enjoy a wealthy and sustainable future. We can pave a road towards
    a smarter, more efficient, and environmentally sensitive electricity ecosystem
    by continuing to explore and adopt these technologies. CRediT authorship contribution

    importance in the realm of space missions, as it necessitates the design of controllers
    that are capable of minimizing fuel consumption and ensuring the stability of
    orbits [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. The efficient regulation of satellite positioning
    is imperative for a myriad of applications, ranging from communication and weather
    monitoring to Earth observation [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. Consequently, there is a
    pressing need for advanced control strategies that can adeptly manage the dynamic
    nature of satellite systems, address uncertainties, and contend with time delays
    [[9], [10], [11], [12]]. This research is driven by the objective of tackling
    the challenges inherent in satellite orbit control through the development of
    a robust and efficient control methodology. Conventional control techniques often
    encounter difficulties when confronted with delays and uncertainties, which can
    result in compromised performance and system instability. Consequently, the motivation
    for this study lies in the development of an advanced control scheme that can
    effectively compensate for destructive effects, proficiently handle time-varying
    delays, and optimize control performance in satellite orbit systems. 1.2. Literature
    review Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to the field of satellite
    orbit control and the design of control systems for delayed systems [[13], [14],
    [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. Numerous studies have explored the implementation
    of predictive control approaches, which have exhibited promising outcomes in meeting
    performance requirements and accommodating system constraints [[20], [21], [22],
    [23], [24]]. Predictive control, a model-based control methodology, entails the
    resolution of an optimal control problem by predicting the future behavior of
    the system and generating a sequence of control inputs [[25], [26], [27]]. This
    sequence is subsequently applied to the system, taking into account the reducing
    horizon technique, with the overarching objective of attaining the desired control
    objectives [[28], [29], [30]]. Although predictive control has demonstrated efficacy
    across various domains, its application specifically to satellite orbit control
    involving discrete delay systems remains relatively limited [31,32]. A research
    gap exists concerning the development of an LQR controller with an infinite horizon
    that is purposefully tailored to address the nuances of delayed discrete systems
    in satellite orbit control [[33], [34], [35], [36]]. Moreover, the integration
    of the reduction method into the design of the predictive controller to mitigate
    destructive effects and account for time-varying delays further accentuates the
    existing research gap. Article [37], presents a survey on predictive control-based
    satellite orbit control. It provides an overview of the use of predictive control

    stability analysis of time-delayed systems and offers control methods to ensure
    stable satellite orbit behavior. Article [40], focuses on model predictive control
    (MPC) applied to satellite formation flying in the presence of communication time
    delays. It explores the challenges posed by communication delays and presents

    highlights the benefits of MPC in managing communication time delays and achieving
    reliable formation control. Paper [41], discusses LQR-based control strategies
    for satellite orbit maintenance considering time delays. It investigates the effects
    of time delays on-orbit maintenance and proposes control algorithms based on the
    LQR framework. The research focuses on utilizing LQR control techniques to effectively
    handle time delays and ensure precise orbit maintenance. Study [42], proposes
    an adaptive predictive control approach for satellite orbit control that incorporates
    neural networks. The research focuses on using neural networks to approximate
    system dynamics and employs adaptive control techniques to adaptively update the
    predictive controller based on online learning. The study demonstrates the effectiveness
    of the proposed method through simulations and highlights its potential for improving
    satellite orbit control performance. Article [43], explores the utilization of
    event-triggered predictive control for satellite orbit control. It presents a
    control scheme where control updates are triggered based on specific events or
    changes in the system, reducing the computational burden and communication requirements.
    The research investigates the performance and stability aspects of event-triggered
    predictive control and highlights its potential advantages in satellite orbit
    control applications. Research paper [44], focuses on satellite formation control
    and maintenance using predictive control techniques. It addresses the challenges
    of maintaining desired formations and relative positions among satellites in formation
    flying scenarios. The study proposes a predictive control strategy to regulate
    the formation and demonstrates its effectiveness through numerical simulations.
    The research contributes to the understanding of predictive control applications
    in satellite formation control systems. Article [45], investigates the application
    of robust predictive sliding mode control for satellite attitude tracking. While
    focusing on attitude control rather than orbit control, it provides insights into
    the utilization of predictive control combined with sliding mode control techniques.
    The research proposes a robust control scheme that can handle uncertainties and
    disturbances, ensuring precise attitude tracking for satellites. A Journal article
    [46], introduces an event-triggered predictive control approach for satellite
    orbit control while considering input constraints. The research focuses on the
    design of an event-triggering mechanism that updates the control action only when
    necessary, reducing computational requirements. Moreover, it addresses control
    input constraints to ensure the control actions remain within the desired bounds.
    The study presents simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
    proposed approach in satellite orbit control with input constraints. Research
    article [47], proposes an adaptive finite horizon predictive control approach
    for satellite orbit control in the presence of uncertain dynamics. It addresses
    the challenges posed by uncertainties in system parameters and dynamics. The study
    develops an adaptive control strategy that adjusts the control horizon based on
    real-time estimation of uncertainties. Through simulations, the research demonstrates
    the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving accurate orbit control
    under uncertain conditions. Study [48], introduces a satellite orbit control methodology
    based on data-driven predictive control and particle swarm optimization. The research
    explores the utilization of data-driven modeling techniques to approximate the
    system dynamics and employs predictive control with particle swarm optimization
    to optimize control actions. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
    approach through simulations, highlighting its potential for improving orbit control
    performance. The article [49], presents a novel control strategy designed for
    multiphase batch processes with time-varying delays. The proposed method is a
    two-dimensional iterative learning control (2D-ILC) combined with asynchronous
    switching predictive control (ASPC). This innovative approach aims to enhance
    the control of batch processes, which are common in industries such as chemical
    and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The primary advantage of this method is its
    ability to adapt to dynamic time delays and disturbances commonly found in multiphase
    batch processes. By using both ILC and ASPC, the system can learn and improve
    control performance over consecutive batches. This adaptive nature increases the
    robustness and reliability of the control strategy. On the flip side, implementing
    such complex control strategies might demand more computational resources and
    rigorous tuning, which could be a disadvantage. In terms of future work, further
    research could focus on optimizing the tuning process for these control methods
    and developing practical implementations in industrial settings to exploit their
    benefits fully. Research paper [50], presents a satellite orbit control strategy
    based on adaptive MPC with disturbance estimation. It addresses the challenges
    of uncertain disturbances affecting satellite orbits. The study develops an adaptive
    MPC framework that incorporates an online estimation of disturbances and adapts
    the control actions accordingly. The research demonstrates the efficacy of the
    proposed approach in maintaining precise orbit control in the presence of disturbances
    through numerical simulations. Article [51], focuses on robust finite-horizon
    predictive control for satellite orbit control in the presence of time-varying
    delays. It investigates the impact of delays in on-orbit control performance and
    proposes a robust predictive control framework to address the uncertainties introduced
    by time delays. The research utilizes a robust control strategy that considers
    uncertainty bounds on delays to ensure reliable orbit control. Simulation results
    demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in handling time-varying
    delays. The article [52], introduces a control strategy tailored for discrete-time
    systems dealing with interval time-varying delays and uncertain disturbances.
    The approach combines fuzzy predictive control with robust strategies, addressing
    the challenges posed by these complex systems. The primary advantage of this method
    lies in its adaptability to handle the uncertain time delays and disturbances
    often encountered in real-world applications. By utilizing fuzzy logic and predictive
    control, it can effectively mitigate the impact of these uncertainties. However,
    this level of complexity can demand substantial computational resources and more
    intricate control tuning, which may be considered a disadvantage. Future work
    in this area could concentrate on streamlining the implementation of these control
    strategies, potentially via optimization algorithms or innovative tuning methods,
    to make them more accessible for practical use in various industries where such
    systems are prevalent. Research article [53], presents an adaptive neural network
    control approach for satellite orbit tracking. It focuses on the utilization of
    neural network models to approximate the system dynamics and employs adaptive
    control techniques to adaptively update control actions based on online learning.
    The study showcases the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulations,
    highlighting its potential for improving orbit tracking performance in the presence
    of uncertainties. In Table 1, our proposed method, as detailed in the article,
    undergoes a comprehensive comparison with other articles in the field published
    in recent years. This comparative analysis is grounded in the indexing of various
    characteristics intrinsic to these articles. Through this meticulous process,
    it becomes evident that our proposed method excels across all the considered indicators,
    underscoring the robustness and strength of the approach detailed in our article.
    The comparison highlights the unique and superior features of our method in relation
    to contemporary works, solidifying its position as an impactful contribution to
    the field. Table 1. Comparing this article and related works. Empty Cell MPC Robust

    Note: In this article, the notation denotes that the sample matrix is positive
    definite and symmetric. Furthermore, the symbol used in the matrices denotes the
    presence of symmetrical elements. These notations and symbols are utilized consistently
    throughout the article to convey the mathematical properties of the matrices and
    facilitate clarity in the analysis and discussions. 2. Problem formulation In
    this section, we provide a comprehensive problem formulation for the design of
    an LQR controller with an infinite horizon for discrete delay systems in satellite
    orbit control. The problem at hand involves minimizing fuel consumption, ensuring
    orbit stability, and addressing challenges such as destructive effects and time-varying
    delays [[54], [55], [56], [57], [58]]. The objective is to design a robust and
    efficient control scheme that can compensate for the detrimental effects, handle
    uncertainties, and optimize control performance. By formulating the problem as
    a quadratic program and incorporating the reducing horizon method, we aim to develop
    a control strategy that can generate a sequence of control inputs for future moments,
    taking into account the constraints and objectives of the satellite orbit control
    system. The problem formulation serves as the foundation for the subsequent sections,
    where we delve into the design and analysis of the proposed control methodology.
    The primary objective of satellite orbit control design is to effectively guide
    the satellite back to its main orbit while simultaneously minimizing fuel consumption
    and reducing power magnitude [[59], [60], [61]]. To achieve these objectives,
    a predictive control approach based on a mathematical model is employed. The predictive
    control method ensures optimality by taking into account system performance and
    constraints [62]. It generates a control signal by solving an optimal control
    problem and making predictions about the system''s future behavior. This process
    involves the consideration of a cost function and constraints on the system''s
    input and state variables at each time step. The control algorithm calculates
    a sequence of control inputs for future instances of the system and applies the
    first input using the reducing horizon method. Subsequently, the output and the
    error between the system''s actual state and the desired state are measured, leading
    to the repetition of this process in subsequent time steps until the error reaches
    zero or an acceptable value. By linearly modeling the system''s equations, considering
    both equality and inequality constraints, and formulating the cost function as
    a quadratic, the predictive control problem can be reformulated as a quadratic
    program. This formulation provides the advantage of requiring a relatively low
    computational effort for online implementation [62,63]. The “Design of Infinite
    Horizon LQR Controller for Discrete Delay Systems\" presents an LQR controller
    tailored for discrete delay systems. To understand how it differs from existing
    controllers, we can explore its unique features. 1. The primary distinction is
    that this LQR controller is explicitly designed for systems with discrete delays.
    While traditional LQR controllers are well-suited for continuous-time systems
    or systems with small time delays, this approach focuses on mitigating the detrimental
    effects of discrete time delays. 2. The controller is designed with an infinite
    horizon, which means it considers control inputs and system behavior over an infinite
    time. Traditional LQR controllers might operate with finite time horizons, but
    in satellite orbit control, where long-term stability and fuel efficiency are
    crucial, an infinite horizon approach can be advantageous. 3. It utilizes a predictive
    control framework. In contrast to standard LQR controllers that rely solely on
    current state information, predictive control looks ahead into the future. It
    generates a sequence of control inputs that anticipates future system behavior.
    This is particularly beneficial in handling time delays, which can lead to instability
    if not managed correctly. 4. The approach incorporates a reduction method. This
    method involves a sequential series of control inputs, where each input considers
    a specific future system moment. This reduces the horizon, allowing for more effective
    control. It''s a technique explicitly chosen to address the challenges associated
    with time delays. In summary, the key differences lie in the explicit focus on
    discrete delay systems, the utilization of an infinite horizon, the use of predictive
    control with a reduction method, and the incorporation of stability analysis techniques.
    These features collectively make it a suitable choice for satellite orbit control,
    especially when dealing with the challenges posed by time delays. Existing controllers
    may not address these specific requirements as comprehensively. Let us consider
    a discrete linear system governed by a set of differential equation (1) that arises
    in the context of stabilizing input delay subsystems. The system is characterized
    by constant matrices and a constant delay term, denoted as . The objective of
    the stabilization problem is to design a control strategy that ensures the stability
    of the system, accounting for the presence of input delays [64,65]. The differential
    equations encapsulate the dynamic behavior of the system and provide a mathematical
    representation for studying and addressing the stabilization problem at hand [66,67].
    (1) In the given context, let us consider the following notations: represents
    the discrete time index, denotes the constant delay parameter, represents the
    state vector, and denotes the control input of the system. Furthermore, and represent
    the constant nominal matrices, each having dimensions suitable for the specific
    requirements of the system. These matrices capture the intrinsic characteristics
    and dynamics of the system, enabling the analysis and design of appropriate control
    strategies [68]. The initial condition, or more precisely, the initial function,
    is denoted by equation (2) in the context under consideration [69]. This equation
    captures the state of the system at the initial time instant, providing the starting
    point for the subsequent evolution of the system dynamics. The initial function
    plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of the system over time and serves
    as a fundamental component in the analysis and synthesis of control strategies.
    By specifying the initial function, one can establish the initial state of the
    system, which is essential for comprehensively understanding and addressing its
    dynamic characteristics [70]. (2) Through the utilization of the adjoint method,
    the augmented state vector can be defined as expressed in equation (3). The adjoint
    state vector plays a pivotal role in various fields, including optimal control,
    sensitivity analysis, and system identification. By employing the adjoint method,
    which involves solving the adjoint differential equations alongside the original
    system, the adjoint state vector can be computed. It provides valuable information
    regarding the sensitivity of the system''s performance concerning different parameters,
    enabling the derivation of gradient-based optimization algorithms and facilitating
    the analysis of system dynamics. The adjoint state vector serves as a fundamental
    tool for gaining insights into the behavior and characteristics of the system
    under investigation. (3) In the present scenario, the delayed system undergoes
    a transformation wherein it is converted into a non-delayed system, as indicated
    by equation (4). This transformation is significant as it allows for the analysis
    and application of methodologies and techniques developed for non-delayed systems.
    By eliminating the delay term, the system dynamics can be effectively treated
    as if there were no delays involved. This simplification facilitates the use of
    existing control strategies and techniques that are primarily designed for non-delayed
    systems, thus enabling a wider range of established methodologies to be applied
    to the transformed system. The transformation from a delayed to a non-delayed
    system expands the available control design options and simplifies the analysis
    and synthesis processes. (4) It is important to acknowledge that the matrix is
    singular in the given context. With consideration of the initial condition (2),
    we delve into the LQR problem with infinite horizon (5). Predictive control, as
    an optimal control approach, accommodates constraints on the system dynamics and
    control inputs while ensuring optimality. In predictive control, constraints are
    systematically incorporated, and as their strictness increases, the controller''s
    ability to handle uncertainties and disturbances is enhanced. The chosen cost
    function, being of a quadratic nature, encompasses terms associated with the control
    input and system output. By minimizing fuel consumption, the control scheme strives
    to enhance path-tracking accuracy while compensating for disturbances. The objective
    is to determine the control law that ensures the asymptotic stability of the system
    while minimizing the quadratic cost function. Here, and denote weighted square
    matrices used for adjusting the cost function parameters. By fine-tuning these
    matrices, control accuracy is improved, and energy consumption is reduced. The
    cost function comprises two terms: the first term considers the system error between
    the current state and the system output, while the second term aims to minimize
    energy consumption. To evaluate the performance of predictive control, a second-order
    regulator controller is considered, and the associated cost function is defined
    in equation (5). (5) Utilizing the adjoint method, the delayed LQR problem is
    transformed into a non-delayed LQR problem. The LQR problem for the delay-free
    system is characterized by an optimal control law, as given by equation (6), provided
    that the matrix pair is stable and the matrix pair is observable. It is important
    to note that the stability of the matrix pair corresponding implies the stability
    of the matrix pair . Hence, if the original system, disregarding delays, exhibits
    stability, the augmented system will also maintain stability. The adjoint method
    offers a means to handle delay-related complexities, enabling the application
    of established LQR techniques to address the non-delayed LQR problem while accounting
    for delays. (6) The matrix in this context represents the positive definite solution
    to the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE) expressed as equation (7).
    The DARE is a fundamental equation in control theory that characterizes the solution
    for the algebraic Riccati equation specific to discrete-time systems. By solving
    the DARE, one can obtain the matrix P, which is positive definite. The positive
    definiteness of P is a crucial property as it ensures the stability and convergence
    of the control system. The solution to the DARE provides valuable insights into
    the optimal control design and enables the assessment of stability and performance
    criteria for the controlled system. (7) In the given scenario, it can be observed
    that the matrix is stable. This observation is significant as it leads to the
    determination of an optimal feedback control law, as presented in equation (8),
    which incorporates distributed delay for the original system. By ensuring the
    stability of the matrix , the control scheme derived from equation (8) is deemed
    optimal and applicable to the system with distributed delay. The stability of
    the augmented system''s matrix validates the efficacy of the proposed control
    approach in addressing the challenges posed by distributed delays and contributes
    to the design of an effective feedback control strategy for the original system.
    (8) The aforementioned result is obtained through the application of the Hautus
    Criterion [71], as substantiated by the following proof. The Hautus Criterion
    is a fundamental tool used to assess the stability of a linear time-invariant
    system. By verifying the applicability of the Hautus Criterion, we can establish
    the stability properties of the system under consideration. The proof will provide
    a formal demonstration of the validity and effectiveness of the Hautus Criterion
    in determining system stability, thereby reinforcing the reliability and robustness
    of the obtained result. Proof: To establish the claim, consider the matrix [sI_n
    - A, B] for |s| ≥ 1. It can be observed that this matrix attains full rank for
    all . This conclusion holds since the adjoint system''s matrix exhibits full rank
    for . Consequently, this implies that the main system, which encompasses the system
    without delay, is stable. The stability of the system is guaranteed by the full-rank
    property of the matrix for | , establishing the desired result (9). (9) Henceforth,
    assuming the stability and observability of matrices (for ), it follows that there
    exists a unique optimal controller in the form of equation (8). This controller
    relies on the positive definite unique response obtained from the resulting discrete
    algebraic Riccati equation. The optimal control, expressed as equation (6), incorporates
    a distributed delay at the input, mirroring the characteristics of the prediction-based
    controller for the continuous system. The uniqueness of the optimal controller
    and the reliance on the discrete algebraic Riccati equation guarantee the optimality
    and effectiveness of the control strategy, thereby facilitating efficient satellite
    orbit control in the presence of distributed delays. Under the assumptions made
    regarding the considered system, the initial function, and the cost function,
    the reduction method is applied. This reduction method is primarily employed in
    the analysis of systems with delayed inputs. Its purpose is to derive the reduced-order
    response for the LQR problem with input delay. The design discussion relies on
    a predictive approach based on forecasting. By introducing the variable , the
    cost function can be expressed as equation (10). This transformation allows for
    a more concise representation of the cost function while accounting for the input
    delay. The utilization of the reduction method enables the extraction of a reduced-order
    response, leading to the formulation and analysis of an effective control strategy
    for the LQR problem with input delay. (10) Following equation (10), the terms
    within consist of fixed functions that are predetermined and cannot be altered.
    Conversely, functions that can be adjusted during the design process, such as
    the control input, appear within . Consequently, minimizing for the aforementioned
    system translates to the minimization of , aligning it with the system without
    delay. This alignment is achieved by introducing the function , which is based
    on the control input u. The definition of v allows for a direct correspondence
    between the optimization objectives for the system with delay and the system without
    delay. By establishing this connection, the minimization of can be effectively
    pursued, resulting in a control scheme that optimizes the system''s performance
    while accommodating the presence of input delay in equation (11). (11) Suppose
    the matrix pair is stable, and the matrix pair is observable. Under these assumptions,
    the resulting problem yields a unique optimal control, as indicated by equation
    (12). This optimal control solution is characterized by its uniqueness, ensuring
    that it is the only control strategy that attains the optimality criteria for
    the given problem. The stability of the matrix pair guarantees the stability of
    the control system, while the observability of the matrix pair ensures that the
    system''s states can be accurately estimated from the available measurements.
    These stability and observability conditions are essential prerequisites for the
    derivation and effectiveness of the optimal control law outlined in equation (12).
    (12) In this context, it is essential to highlight that the unique non-negative
    solution of the discrete algebraic Riccati equation plays a crucial role. This
    solution serves as a fundamental component in the design of the optimal control
    strategy. Furthermore, the application of optimal feedback ensures the stabilization
    of the closed-loop system, guaranteeing its stability and desired performance.
    A noteworthy aspect to emphasize is the derivation of the function ν through the
    aforementioned discussions. By making suitable modifications to this function,
    the control function u can be obtained by utilizing the relation presented in
    equation (13). This relationship allows for the transformation and implementation
    of the derived function , facilitating the determination of the control actions
    required to optimize system performance while considering the presence of delays.
    (13) By adjusting the upper and lower bounds of sigma in equation (13), we arrive
    at equation (14). This adjustment allows for the transformation and alignment
    of the two equations. The modification of the limits of sigma in equation (13)
    ensures that the resulting equation (14) captures the desired control relationship
    accurately. This adjustment is a critical step in refining the control function
    and achieving the desired control objectives. The revised equation (14) encapsulates
    the optimized control relationship and is instrumental in guiding the system toward
    its desired behavior. (14) Furthermore, through the application of optimal control,
    the optimal value of is determined as expressed in equation (15). This optimal
    value represents the minimum achievable value of the cost function , which is
    attained through the implementation of the optimal control strategy. By optimizing
    the control inputs and system dynamics, the control scheme aims to minimize and
    achieve superior system performance. The derived optimal value of serves as a
    benchmark, providing a quantitative measure of the system''s optimality and enabling
    comparisons between different control strategies. It serves as a valuable metric
    in evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control approach.
    (15) A method for reducing discrete indeterminate linear systems with input delay
    has been developed. This method focuses on addressing the main system, which features
    an indefinite and non-small delay denoted as . The reduction technique aims to
    simplify the analysis and control of such systems by transforming them into a
    more manageable form. By applying this reduction method, the complexities associated
    with input delay are effectively addressed in equation (16), enabling a more comprehensive
    understanding and control of the system dynamics. The reduction process facilitates
    the application of established control strategies and techniques to improve the
    stability and performance of the system with input delay. (16) In the aforementioned
    system, the parameter represents a fixed nominal value, while the condition characterizes
    the uncertainty associated with the delay. This condition implies that the absolute
    value of remains within the range of , which captures the uncertainty in the delay
    parameter. By introducing a change of variable, the system relation expressed
    in equation (17) is derived. This change of variable allows for a transformation
    of the system dynamics, resulting in the formulation of relation (17). The revised
    relation captures the modified system behavior, accounting for the uncertainty
    in the delay parameter and facilitating further analysis and control design. It
    enables the consideration of a broader range of scenarios and provides a more
    comprehensive understanding of the system''s response in the presence of delay
    uncertainty. (17) In the current scenario, the presence of variable delay within
    the system renders the direct reduction method impractical. Therefore, the variable
    change method is employed to address the problem effectively. Let us assume the
    existence of a gain K such that the matrix is stable. Under this condition, the
    feedback control law stabilizes the system if the system described by equation
    (18) is stable. The stability of the system is a crucial requirement to ensure
    that the control scheme effectively maintains the desired system behavior and
    mitigates any destabilizing effects. By establishing stability in the system as
    described in equation (18), the feedback control law proves effective in stabilizing
    the system and achieving the desired control objectives. (18) The stability analysis
    of the system with non-small delay can be conducted using the Lyapunov-Krasovsky
    method. This method provides a framework for assessing the stability properties
    of such systems. In this case, the LKF expressed as equation (19) can be considered
    for the analysis of the new system. By evaluating the LKF, one can gain insights
    into the system''s stability characteristics and determine conditions under which
    stability can be guaranteed. The Lyapunov-Krasovsky method offers a rigorous approach
    to stability analysis, enabling the assessment of system behavior and the design
    of control strategies that ensure stability in the presence of non-small delays.
    (19) Furthermore, the stability of the system can be assessed using the input-output
    method. This method provides an alternative approach to analyzing system stability
    by examining the relationship between system inputs and outputs. By studying the
    input-output behavior, one can gain valuable insights into the stability properties
    of the system. The input-output method enables the characterization of the system''s
    response to different input signals and disturbances, allowing for the identification
    of stability criteria. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of
    the system''s stability, complementing other stability analysis methods such as
    the Lyapunov-Krasovsky method. By employing the input-output method, researchers
    and practitioners can verify and validate the stability of the system and design
    appropriate control strategies to ensure its stable operation. Subsequently, the
    focus turns towards investigating the Guaranteed Cost Control (GCC) problem for
    systems with variable delay, where the delay time resides within the interval
    , and the system is characterized by fixed matrices A and B. In this context,
    the cost function under consideration is defined as presented in equation (20).
    The GCC problem aims to design a control strategy that not only ensures system
    stability but also minimizes the associated cost function. By formulating the
    cost function in this manner, the control design process can effectively incorporate
    both stability and performance objectives, enabling the development of control
    strategies that strike a balance between system stability and cost optimization.
    The investigation of the GCC problem for systems with variable delay with an indefinite
    time and fixed matrices and contribute to advancing the field of control theory
    by addressing the challenges posed by variable delay systems and establishing
    control strategies that guarantee system stability while achieving cost optimization.
    (20) In the case of systems characterized by delays or uncertain matrices, it
    is not always possible to obtain optimal control and optimal cost solutions such
    as the LQR. However, it is feasible to design a control law that ensures a guaranteed
    cost as small as possible, denoted as , for the cost function . This control law
    is capable of achieving the condition for all uncertainties, considering a given
    initial condition . To achieve this guaranteed minimum cost value for all uncertain
    delays , a feedback control mode is considered. The closed-loop system, described
    in equation (21), encompasses the interplay between the control law and the uncertain
    delays, resulting in a controlled system that strives to achieve the desired guaranteed
    cost with minimal uncertainty. By adopting this approach, the control strategy
    can effectively mitigate the impact of delays and uncertainties, leading to improved
    system performance and cost optimization. (21) Proof: To establish the exponential
    stability of the system with (where is a scalar), we consider a standard candidate
    Lyapunov function expressed as equation (22). Let denote a local continuous function.
    We aim to show that for all , there exists a such that the system equation (22)
    holds. By assuming the existence of such a δ, we can establish the desired exponential
    stability of the system. Through the analysis of the Lyapunov function and its
    associated properties, we can demonstrate the boundedness and convergence of over
    time. By imposing appropriate conditions on the system equation (22) and the Lyapunov
    function, we can establish the exponential stability of the system, providing
    a formal proof of the system''s stability properties. (22) Now, suppose we find
    that can nullify equation (23). In this case, the closed-loop system achieves
    stability. By selecting an appropriate value for , we can effectively counterbalance
    the effect of equation (23) and ensure system stability. The stability of the
    closed-loop system is of paramount importance in control theory as it guarantees
    the system''s ability to reach and maintain a desired equilibrium state in the
    presence of uncertainties and disturbances. By identifying the suitable α that
    counteracts the impact of equation (23), we establish the stability of the closed-loop
    system, ensuring its robust performance and reliable operation. (23) In this section,
    we consider the extension vector defined as equation (24). By employing the Schur
    complement [72], we derive the desired Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). Schur complement
    plays a significant role in obtaining the LMI in equation (25) by providing a
    mathematical framework and analytical tools for the analysis of matrix inequalities.
    It enables the conversion of complex inequalities into equivalent LMI formulations,
    which are easier to handle and manipulate. Through the application of the Schur
    complement and the extension vector (27), we can establish the LMI that serves
    as a crucial mathematical tool for the subsequent analysis and synthesis of control
    strategies. The derived LMI encapsulates the necessary conditions and constraints
    required for achieving desired system performance, stability, and optimality.
    (24) (25) As a consequence, by considering sigma in the range of to , inclusively,
    from the unequal sides, the guaranteed cost function in equation (26) is derived.
    This process involves selecting sigma values that satisfy the given constraints
    and bounds, allowing for the determination of the guaranteed cost function. By
    considering a range of sigma values and evaluating the associated cost function,
    we can assess the system''s performance and optimize it based on the desired cost
    criteria. The obtained guaranteed cost function serves as a valuable metric for
    evaluating and comparing different control strategies, providing insights into
    the system''s behavior and enabling the selection of an optimal control approach
    that minimizes costs while meeting the desired performance objectives. (26) Considering
    the provided initial condition , a positive constant , and a tuning parameter
    , let us assume the existence of matrices , a matrix Y of size , and a positive
    scalar that satisfy the aforementioned LMI. Under these conditions, the resulting
    closed-loop system is exponentially stable for all delays , and the cost of the
    system is guaranteed to satisfy . To minimize the guaranteed cost, the aforementioned
    LMIs can be solved by incorporating the minimization condition . By solving these
    LMIs to minimize δ, an optimal solution can be obtained, leading to a control
    strategy that not only ensures exponential stability of the closed-loop system
    but also minimizes the associated cost. This approach allows for the development
    of an optimized control scheme that balances stability and cost considerations,
    resulting in improved system performance and efficiency. In the realm of satellite
    orbit control, understanding the concept of isolated regions of space is of paramount
    importance. These isolated regions represent areas in which a satellite temporarily
    loses contact with ground stations or communication networks [[73], [74], [75],
    [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82]] due to its orbital path. The satellite
    effectively operates beyond the reach of immediate command and control. This phenomenon
    occurs regularly as satellites traverse their orbits, leading to brief periods
    of isolation. These isolated regions are a natural consequence of the satellite''s
    trajectory and the finite coverage of ground-based tracking stations. Therefore,
    comprehending these occurrences is vital for designing control systems that can
    autonomously manage the satellite during such communication outages, ensuring
    its safe operation and the continuation of its mission objectives. These regions
    of isolation are not truly infinite in extent but are instead characterized by
    their relatively long duration in the context of satellite orbit dynamics, rendering
    them a crucial consideration in satellite control strategies. Noted that the problem

    aims to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed control approach
    in the context of satellite orbit control. Through numerical simulations, the
    control scheme''s capabilities, such as maintaining orbit stability and minimizing
    fuel consumption, will be assessed. The simulations are conducted using a representative
    satellite orbit model and incorporate various scenarios to examine the control
    system''s robustness and adaptability to different operating conditions. The performance
    metrics, including orbit deviation, control input magnitude, and fuel consumption,
    will be analyzed to gauge the control scheme''s efficacy in achieving the desired
    control objectives. By examining the simulation results, valuable insights will
    be gained regarding the control system''s performance, its ability to handle uncertainties
    and time delays, and its overall effectiveness in satellite orbit control. These
    simulation-based findings will provide valuable empirical evidence to support
    the claims and contributions made in this research. 3.1. Mathematical modeling
    of satellite movement in orbit Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in understanding
    and analyzing the movement of satellites in orbit. By utilizing mathematical principles
    and physical laws, researchers can develop models that accurately describe the
    dynamics and behavior of satellites as they traverse their orbital paths. Mathematical
    models for satellite movement typically consider factors such as gravitational
    forces, orbital mechanics, atmospheric drag, and external perturbations. These
    models often involve differential equations that capture the time evolution of
    satellite position, velocity, and other relevant parameters. By simulating these
    mathematical models, researchers can gain insights into satellite behavior, predict
    future trajectories, and design control strategies to optimize satellite orbit
    control. The mathematical modeling of satellite movement in orbit serves as a
    foundation for further research and analysis, enabling a deeper understanding
    of satellite dynamics and facilitating the development of advanced control techniques
    for orbit stabilization, maneuvering, and mission planning. In this section, the
    orbital dynamics equations governing the motion of an Earth satellite, as depicted
    in Fig. 1, are presented. These equations capture the fundamental principles that
    govern the satellite''s orbital behavior. The orbital dynamics equations, expressed
    as equation (27), incorporate factors such as gravitational forces, the satellite''s
    position and velocity vectors, and the relevant celestial parameters [148]. By
    solving these equations, researchers can analyze the satellite''s trajectory,
    understand its orbital characteristics, and predict its future motion. These equations
    serve as a mathematical framework for studying the orbital dynamics of Earth satellites
    and provide a basis for further analysis and control design in the context of
    satellite orbit control. Download : Download high-res image (484KB) Download :

    associated with the orbital satellite elements. These elements play a crucial
    role in describing the characteristics and behavior of satellites in orbit. The
    figure illustrates key parameters such as the semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination,
    argument of perigee, and right ascension of the ascending node. Each element conveys
    specific information about the satellite''s orbit, including its size, shape,
    orientation, and position relative to the Earth. By understanding and analyzing
    these orbital satellite elements, researchers can gain valuable insights into
    the satellite''s orbital dynamics, mission requirements, and overall behavior
    in equation (27). Fig. 1 serves as a reference tool, aiding in the interpretation
    and comprehension of these physical aspects, and serves as a foundation for further
    analysis and investigation in the field of satellite orbit control. (27) The control
    forces applied to the satellite by the propellant are denoted as , , and , representing
    their respective components. These forces result in the acceleration , , and experienced
    by the satellite, while m represents the mass of the satellite. Furthermore, the
    relation holds, where r denotes the distance of the satellite from the center
    of the Earth and μ represents the constant of the Earth''s gravity. The linear
    equations described herein represent the discrepancy between the satellite''s
    movement and the desired main orbit. The objective of the control design is to
    minimize this discrepancy, effectively reducing it to zero and ensuring that the
    satellite remains in the reference orbit with minimal error. By considering the
    state variables as and the control input vector as , the state space equations
    governing the linear system are expressed as equation (28). These equations serve
    as the mathematical framework for analyzing and designing control strategies to
    maintain the satellite in the desired reference orbit. (28) To facilitate the
    implementation of predictive control for the system equations, a discrete representation
    is required. The discretization process is accomplished using Euler''s forward-step
    method, which is a widely adopted first-order numerical approximation technique.
    This method allows the continuous-time system equations to be translated into
    discrete-time counterparts that can be readily utilized for control algorithm
    implementation. Euler''s forward-step method involves dividing the continuous-time
    interval into discrete time steps and approximating the system dynamics by evaluating
    the derivative at each time step. By discretizing the system equations, the predictive
    control algorithm can be efficiently executed in discrete time, enabling real-time
    control and optimization. The utilization of Euler''s forward-step method serves
    as a fundamental step in transforming the continuous-time system equations into
    a suitable form for predictive control implementation. The proposed control plan
    for satellite orbit maintenance aims to improve orbit stability and fuel efficiency
    while its efficiency is confirmed in different ways. 1. Improved circuit maintenance:
    The proposed control scheme is designed to improve circuit maintenance in several
    ways: - Minimizing fuel consumption: Using predictive control strategies, this
    design has minimized fuel consumption, which not only reduced operating costs
    but also extended the satellite''s mission life by conserving propulsion. - Optimal
    Control: Using an LQR controller with an infinite horizon and predictive control
    approaches has helped to optimize the control inputs and allowed the satellite
    to stay closer to its intended orbit. - Stability analysis: The control design
    has used stability analysis techniques, such as Lyapunov-Krasovsky functions and
    linear matrix inequalities. The proposed method ensures that the satellite orbit
    remains stable despite uncertainties and time delays. 2. Validation: To verify
    the effectiveness of the proposed control plan, several steps have been carried
    out: - Numerical simulation: The proposed control plan has been evaluated through
    numerical simulation. The simulations include the use of a mathematical model
    of the satellite''s orbital dynamics and the use of a control scheme to evaluate
    its performance in different conditions and scenarios. - Performance measures:
    Various performance measures have been used, such as circuit deviation, control
    input value, and fuel consumption. These criteria provide quantifiable measures
    of how well the satellite orbit control scheme is maintained. 3.2. Simulation
    Example 1 . In this section, we demonstrate the performance of model-based predictive
    control in ensuring the satellite remains in the desired reference orbit. Additionally,
    we explore the integration of (LQR) control with predictive control. The reference
    circuit specifications for predictive control implementation, as well as the physical
    parameters of the satellite, are provided. The mass of the satellite is denoted
    as , the gravitational constant as , and the initial distance from the center
    of the Earth as . By utilizing Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) with specific
    values of and , along with the initial condition , we obtain a high-cost threshold
    of . This value serves as a benchmark for evaluating the cost associated with
    maintaining the satellite on the reference orbit. The results presented in this
    section highlight the effectiveness of combining model-based predictive control
    with LQR control in achieving the desired control objectives and optimizing the
    performance of the satellite orbit control system. The primary objective of the
    control design is to eliminate the initial error and maintain the satellite on
    the reference orbit with utmost accuracy, while simultaneously minimizing fuel
    consumption. To achieve this, weight matrices and are introduced to fine-tune
    the designed control. The matrix is specified as , indicating the relative importance
    of control input components in the control design. Similarly, the matrix is set
    as , reflecting the significance of the state variables in the control objective.
    Furthermore, a prediction horizon of is employed, defining the number of future
    time steps considered in the predictive control algorithm. By optimizing the control
    design with these weight matrices and prediction horizon, the control system aims
    to minimize the initial error, enhance orbit accuracy, and achieve efficient fuel
    utilization. Fig. 2 presents a graphical representation of the error between the
    satellite''s actual trajectory and the desired reference orbit during the implementation
    of the LQR controller using the predictive controller and reduction method. The
    graph showcases the temporal evolution of the error over a specific duration.
    Initially, there exists an error between the satellite''s position and the reference
    orbit, indicating a deviation from the desired trajectory. However, as time progresses,
    the error gradually diminishes, signifying the effectiveness of the control scheme
    in correcting the satellite''s trajectory. After approximately 30 s, the error
    is significantly reduced, indicating that the satellite has been successfully
    placed on the reference orbit with a high level of accuracy. This demonstrates
    the capability of the designed control strategy to eliminate the initial error
    and guide the satellite toward the desired trajectory. The graph serves as a visual
    confirmation of the control system''s ability to achieve precise orbit alignment
    and showcases the successful implementation of the predictive controller and reduction

    exerted to guide the satellite back to the main orbit and maintain its position.
    The graph illustrates the magnitude of the control force applied by the predictive
    controller over a specific time. Notably, the maximum control force observed in
    the graph is 0.1 N. This observation highlights the effectiveness of the control
    scheme in considering constraints on the control input. By imposing limitations
    on the control force, the controller ensures that the applied force remains within
    acceptable bounds. The graph reveals that the control force remains relatively
    low throughout the duration, indicating that the controller operates efficiently
    to achieve orbit maintenance with minimal force usage. Additionally, the graph
    demonstrates the controller''s ability to counteract disturbances that cause the
    satellite to deviate from the orbital plane. Once the satellite reaches the maximum
    allowable distance from the desired orbit, the controller activates and applies
    minimal force to bring the satellite back to the main orbit. Overall, Fig. 3 provides
    evidence of the controller''s effectiveness in maintaining the satellite''s position
    with minimal control force, showcasing its robustness in handling disturbances
    and achieving precise orbit control. Example 2 . Download : Download high-res

    the satellite''s motion. The satellite''s position and velocity will be updated
    using the Euler method, but keep in mind that more sophisticated integration methods,
    like the Runge-Kutta method, are preferred for better accuracy. The equations
    of motion for the satellite system using the proposed method can be derived from
    Newton''s second law and the law of universal gravitation in equation (29). The
    system can be represented by the following ordinary differential equations. 1.
    Position Equations: (29) Where is the position vector of the satellite at time

    influence of the Earth''s gravitational force. The proposed method is used to

    system for satellite orbit control, we use techniques such as predictive control
    or state feedback control with delay compensation with results in Fig. 6. In practice,
    we need to develop much more sophisticated control algorithms, considering factors

    was to control the satellite''s altitude. As shown in the first subplot of the
    figure, the satellite''s altitude gradually stabilizes around the desired level
    of 800 km (800,000 m). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the control scheme
    based on a small-time delay in maintaining the desired orbit. The second subplot
    of the figure illustrates the altitude error, which represents the deviation of
    the satellite''s actual altitude from the desired altitude. Initially, there''s
    an error as the satellite''s altitude adjusts to the desired level. As time progresses,
    this error decreases, showing that the control system is working to minimize deviations.
    This controller acts to reduce the current error and accumulates past errors to
    address any long-term deviations. Also, considers the rate of change of the error
    to anticipate future errors. The control loop operates in discrete time steps
    , and at each step, the control input is adjusted based on the altitude error.
    This process is representative of real-time control systems, which continually
    assess and adjust based on sensor feedback. In Fig. 7 the satellite''s altitude
    and Velocity are controlled by adjusting the thrust to maintain a desired altitude
    with control of a satellite with a small-time delay control system. Download :

    Altitude and Velocity with control of a satellite with a small-time delay. In
    this simulation, we implemented a control system to regulate the altitude of a
    satellite in orbit. The control scheme is based on a small-time delay system,
    which accounts for delays in the control input. The delay is crucial in satellite
    systems due to the finite speed at which control commands can be transmitted and
    executed. We began with an initial altitude for the satellite, and the control
    system aimed to maintain the altitude at a predefined reference value (R). The
    control strategy employed a control of a satellite with a small-time delay control
    system [149]. This controller is a common choice in control systems due to its
    ability to handle various types of errors and provide stability. The simulation
    incorporated a small-time delay in the control system. Small-time delays can occur
    due to the finite time it takes for control commands to propagate and influence
    the satellite''s altitude. The control system adjusted the altitude based on both
    the current error (the difference between the desired altitude and the actual
    altitude) and the derivative term of the error. The integral term accumulates
    past errors, and the derivative term considers the rate of change of the error.
    The performance of the control system can be evaluated by considering the following
    factors. ✓ Steady-State Error: The control system was able to minimize steady-state
    error, as the integral term helped eliminate any long-term deviations from the
    reference altitude. ✓ Settling Time: The satellite reached and maintained the
    desired altitude within a reasonable time frame. ✓ Overshoot: The control system
    helped reduce overshooting of the reference altitude during altitude changes.
    ✓ Stability: The control system demonstrated stability, as evidenced by the smooth
    tracking of the reference altitude. While the simulation was successful, it''s
    essential to acknowledge that this is a representation of satellite control. In
    practice, there may be additional complexities, such as external disturbances
    and system uncertainties that need to be addressed. For future work, it would
    be valuable to consider real-world factors and further refine the control strategy
    for robustness. Here''s an example that introduces a satellite''s orbit under
    the influence of gravitational perturbations in Fig. 8. This simulation includes
    the control scheme to maintain the desired orbit, considering the small-time delay.

    Fig. 8. Satellite orbit control with gravitational perturbations and small-time
    delay. This simulation considers both the control system based on the small-time
    delay [149] and the influence of gravitational perturbations on the satellite''s
    orbit, making it more complex and interesting. The result shows variations in
    the altitude as the satellite responds to both the control input and gravitational
    forces. In the satellite orbit control simulation with gravitational perturbations
    and a small-time delay, we introduced additional complexity to the control system
    to make the scenario more realistic. The simulation starts with the satellite
    at an initial altitude of 700,000 m. The desired orbit is maintained at this altitude
    throughout the simulation. The small-time delay in the control system introduces
    a realistic element that is often encountered in satellite systems. The controller
    continuously calculates the control input based on the error signal. These values
    are adjusted to achieve a balance between fast response and minimal oscillation.
    The simulation includes the influence of gravitational perturbations. These perturbations
    cause variations in the altitude of the satellite as it orbits the Earth. Gravitational
    forces are inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center
    of the Earth. As the satellite''s altitude changes, these forces affect its orbit.
    The control input calculated at time (t) is applied with a small delay, simulating
    the real-world delay in satellite control systems. This delay affects the satellite''s
    ability to respond instantaneously to changes in altitude. The simulation runs
    for a total time of 5000 s, and the final altitude is recorded. The final altitude
    may deviate slightly from the desired altitude due to the influence of perturbations
    and control system dynamics. In real satellite systems, the ability to control
    the orbit accurately, especially with small-time delays and external forces like
    gravitational perturbations, is crucial. Engineers use advanced control algorithms
    and modeling to maintain satellites within their desired orbits. To further improve
    this simulation, future work could involve more sophisticated control algorithms,
    modeling of additional environmental factors, and real-time implementation to
    account for practical constraints in satellite control systems. This simulation
    serves as a basic representation of the challenges faced in satellite orbit control
    and can be a starting point for more complex and realistic models used in the
    aerospace industry. 3.3. The proposed controller with practical approach Evaluating
    the effectiveness and performance of the proposed controller with a practical
    approach is indeed possible and often a crucial step in the development of control
    systems for real-world applications. Here''s how this can be achieved. ➢ Hardware-in-the-Loop
    (HIL) Simulation: HIL simulation involves connecting the proposed controller to
    physical hardware, such as a satellite simulator, to assess its performance in
    a controlled yet realistic environment. This approach allows for real hardware
    to be part of the evaluation process, making it closer to practical conditions.
    ➢ Testing on a Satellite Prototype: If available, a satellite prototype or a similar
    space vehicle can be used to test the controller. This approach allows the controller
    to interact with a physical satellite in a controlled setting, providing valuable
    insights into its performance. ➢ Field Testing: Conducting field tests with actual
    satellites is the most practical way to evaluate the controller''s effectiveness.
    This involves applying the controller to operational satellites under real space
    conditions. However, it''s a high-stakes approach and is typically reserved for
    highly mature systems. ➢ Hardware Emulation: Hardware emulation involves replicating
    the satellite''s hardware and environment as closely as possible in a controlled
    laboratory setting. This allows for practical testing without the need for actual
    space missions. ➢ Ground Stations: Ground stations can simulate satellite behavior
    and communication with the controller. This provides a controlled environment
    for testing the controller''s performance in scenarios such as communication disruptions
    and remote control. ➢ Flight Data Analysis: If the controller has been used in
    real satellite missions, analyzing the flight data is essential. This real-world
    data provides insights into how well the controller performs under actual space
    conditions. 3.4. The root mean square error (RMSE) Calculating the root mean square
    error (RMSE) for a satellite orbit control system using simulated and experimental
    data for a specific performance measure, such as orbit deviation, is as follows:
    Where. - indicates actual or experimental values. - indicates the values predicted
    by the control or simulation system. - N is the total number of data points. We
    want to calculate the RMSE for the orbit deviation in meters. Here is the dataset:
    Actual orbital deviation ( ) = [10.2, 9.8, 10.5, 11.0, 9.7] m Deviation of the
    predicted orbit ( ) = [10.0, 9.6, 10.3, 11.2, 9.5] m 1. Squared difference: (
    , , , , ) = (0.04, 0.04, 0.04, 0.04, 0.04). 2. Mean squared difference (0.04 +
    0.04 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.04)/5 = 0.04. 3. RMSE An RMSE value of approximately 0.2
    m represents the average difference between the predicted and actual orbital deviations.
    Lower RMSE values indicate that the predictions of the control system are closer
    to the actual behavior, indicating better performance. 4. Conclusions In conclusion,
    this article presented an advanced control methodology for satellite orbit control
    using a combination of predictive control, reduction methods, and LQR control.
    The proposed approach aimed to minimize fuel consumption, achieve orbit stability,
    and enhance control performance in the presence of uncertainties and time delays.
    Through mathematical modeling of the satellite''s orbital dynamics, the control
    problem was formulated as a quadratic program, considering performance objectives,
    system constraints, and optimal control principles. The results demonstrated the
    effectiveness of the designed control scheme in achieving accurate orbit maintenance.
    The simulation outcomes showcased the successful elimination of the initial error,
    bringing the satellite to the reference orbit with high precision. The predictive
    control, integrated with the reduction method, effectively handled time-varying
    delays and compensating for disturbances, ensuring the satellite''s stability
    and minimizing fuel consumption. The combination of LQR control and predictive
    control allowed for optimal feedback stabilization of the closed-loop system.
    The application of the Lyapunov-Krasovsky function and linear matrix inequalities
    provided stability guarantees and exponential convergence of the control system.
    The derived delay-independent conditions and the solution of the discrete algebraic
    Riccati equation contributed to the establishment of an optimal control law. Furthermore,
    the consideration of input and output constraints in the control design ensured
    robustness against uncertainties and disturbances. The graphical representations
    of the error evolution and control force application demonstrated the controller''s
    ability to achieve accurate orbit alignment with minimal control effort. The results
    indicated the achievement of the control objectives, including accurate trajectory
    tracking and efficient fuel utilization. In summary, the developed control methodology
    combining predictive control, reduction method, and LQR control provided an effective
    framework for satellite orbit control. The integration of these techniques addressed
    the challenges posed by system delays, uncertainties, and disturbances, resulting
    in precise orbit maintenance, reduced fuel consumption, and robust control performance.
    The presented results contribute to the advancement of control strategies for
    satellite systems, with implications for improved operational efficiency and mission
    success in space exploration and satellite applications. Looking ahead, the findings
    and advancements presented in this article lay the foundation for promising future
    research in satellite orbit control. The identified areas of focus include the
    exploration of advanced control algorithms, the integration of machine learning
    techniques, real-time implementation and experimental validation, multi-satellite
    coordination and formation control, and the optimization of control objectives.
    By delving deeper into these avenues, researchers can advance the field by developing
    more sophisticated and intelligent control strategies, improving system performance,
    and addressing the challenges posed by complex satellite missions. Future work
    in these areas will contribute to the continued enhancement of satellite orbit
    control, leading to more efficient, reliable, and sustainable satellite systems
    with broader applications in space exploration, communication, Earth observation,
    and beyond. Data availability The data used to support the finding of this study

  description: Climate changes and global warming has attracted attention toward the
    importance of sustainable smart cities. The main purpose of smart cities is to
    develop and improve city infrastructure, reduce living costs, decrease pollution,
    and enhance citizens’ lives. Internet of Things (IoT) technology has cooperated
    with various applications, which made everything smart and intelligent, such as
    smart cities, smart transportation, smart health services, smart energy, smart
    agriculture, and so on. The world population has increased. Nowadays, approximately
    56% of the world’s population lives in metropolitan areas. This increases the
    requirement of crop production. This is due to lack of space for agriculture in
    city areas, a rise in production costs, and the demand for increased pay by the
    work force. Thus, smart agriculture has evolved. Smart agriculture is a farm management
    concept that uses IoT. IoT agriculture devices can be accessed, monitored, and
    controlled remotely, which enables immediate integration of computing systems.
    Smart agriculture assists crop monitoring and control. Thus, it will help to improve
    farm management, cost-effectiveness, output quality, and output volume.

  description: Plant diseases are rising nowadays. Plant diseases lead to high economic
    losses. Internet of Things (IoT) technology has found its application in various
    sectors. This led to the introduction of smart farming, in which IoT has been
    utilized to help identify the exact spot of the diseased affected region on the
    leaf from the vast farmland in a well-organized and automated manner. Thus, the
    main focus of this task is the introduction of a novel plant disease detection
    model that relies on IoT technology. The collected images are given to the Image
    Transmission phase. Here, the encryption task is performed by employing the Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES) and also the decrypted plant images are fed to the pre-processing
    stage. The Mask Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) are used to
    segment the pre-processed images. Then, the segmented images are given to the
    detection phase in which the Adaptive Dense Hybrid Convolution Network with Attention
    Mechanism (ADHCN-AM) approach is utilized to perform the detection of plant disease.
    From the ADHCN-AM, the final detected plant disease outcomes are obtained. Throughout
    the entire validation, the offered model shows 95% enhancement in terms of MCC
    showcasing its effectiveness over the existing approaches.

    given to the Image Transmission phase. Here, the encryption task is performed
    by employing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and also the decrypted plant
    images are fed to the pre-processing stage. The Mask Regions with Convolutional
    Neural Networks (R-CNN) are used to segment the pre-processed images. Then, the
    segmented images are given to the detection phase in which the Adaptive Dense
    Hybrid Convolution Network with Attention Mechanism (ADHCN-AM) approach is utilized
    to perform the detection of plant disease. From the ADHCN-AM, the final detected
    plant disease outcomes are obtained. Throughout the entire validation, the offered
    model shows 95% enhancement in terms of MCC showcasing its effectiveness over
    the existing approaches. KEYWORDS: Plant disease detectionInternet of ThingsAdvanced

    maximization of accuracy and precision Introduction Recently, a new technology
    called the IoT has been used in various remote monitoring and data exchanging
    tasks over large environmental areas (Saleem et al. 2022). Thus, this IoT technology
    has been widely used in various automated applications. This IoT technology has
    also been used in the agricultural sector to help farmers improve their agricultural
    productivity, which in turn increases the overall economy of the entire country
    (Delnevo et al. 2022). In the agriculture field, the farmers suffer from various
    issues that arise as a result of sudden climatic change, pests, and different
    kinds of plant diseases (Zhao et al. 2022). Most of the agriculture losses, nearly
    39% are caused as a result of the occurrence of distinct plant diseases. Therefore,
    to enhance the productivity of crops, IoT-based devices are implemented in the
    agricultural field to protect the crops from different kinds of plant diseases.
    In the agriculture field, IoT-based sensors are used to track the presence of
    insects and monitor the condition of crops (Sunil et al. 2022). IoT networks can
    be accessed from any locality with less consumption of energy along with enhanced
    performance, thus its applicability in automatic monitoring of the agricultural
    field is vast. IoT is used for evaluating the soil type, environmental conditions,
    and chemical reactions that take place in plants as a result of photosynthesis.
    The temperature and humidity of the environment are also measured using IoT technologies
    (Ashourloo et al. 2016). Vibration can occur during the transportation process
    and can also be measured with the aid of IoT technology. The effects of this vibration
    can also be reduced by using IoT-based systems. The IoT-based systems are helpful
    in improving the communication between the grasslands and the respective landlords.
    The information related to the state of plants is gathered using the sensors in
    the IoT network (Zeng et al. 2020). Sensors are nothing but low-cost electronic
    devices that are connected to the IoT network to maintain the interaction between
    the farmers and the outside world (Chen et al. 2022). The data gathered from these
    devices are stored using the cloud platform. This cloud-aided IoT technology is
    implemented to improve agricultural productivity (Kumar et al. 2021). IoT-based
    models are designed to detect plant disease in agro-industry applications (Li
    et al. 2021). Basically, in the conventional agriculture system, the farming area
    is huge in size, and therefore it is a complicated task for the agronomist and
    the farmers to record the information related to the diseases that affect the
    plants in the field. Commonly, plant diseases initially affect the leaves of the
    plants. These diseases are then detected by placing distinct sensors in the leaf
    at various positions (Patle et al. 2021). Detection of plant disease in its initial
    stage may help in improving the productivity of the crops (Ashourloo et al. 2016).
    The sensors are placed at different ranges together with video recording equipment
    in order to generate and capture the plant images. The seized images are then
    sent to the sink node from these sensor nodes for further processing. Here, the
    sink node acts as a gateway for sending the data over the internet (Amin et al.
    2022). By using the IoT technique, the crops are protected from various diseases
    by sending alert signals to the farmers whenever a disease offsets a plant (Schor
    et al. 2016). Information regarding the plants and their diseases is sent to the
    farmers by means of these alert messages. Yet, various practical challenges have
    occurred in this process like some diseases that have been identified by the IoT
    device are more specific and are not even familiar to the farmers. Conversely,
    manual observation is time time-consuming, and expensive process. Therefore, automatic
    detection of plant disease, like digital image processing with IoT devices is
    very useful in diminishing the time and expense-related issues that occur in such
    systems. Different techniques are used in the agriculture field to improve overall
    productivity (Nie et al. 2019). Yet, various ecological and agricultural pollution
    affects the health of the plants. Artificial intelligence technology is used by
    farmers to minimize the risk factors associated with the detection of plant diseases.
    This artificial intelligence technology assists in generating an effective plant
    disease detection model (Deng et al. 2022). During the season times, farmers need
    a large number of experienced workers to carry out different tasks like picking
    fruits, eliminating weeds, harvesting, and sowing crops manually. All these manual
    methods are time-consuming and expensive (Ahmad et al. 2021). The disease, if
    present in plants will affect the entire growth of the plant and hence will result
    in higher losses for farmers. Therefore, a computer-based disease diagnostic system
    has to be implemented in order to prevent such occurrences. Predicting the affected
    area in the leaf with much accuracy is a difficult task in several existing traditional
    deep learning-based disease identification approaches (Huang et al. 2020). An
    outstanding application of artificial intelligence is its application in the detection
    of diverse kinds of plant diseases in the affected region. A few of the recent
    research works have been provided in the below section. In (Movassagh et al. 2023),
    an integrated algorithm to train the neural network with the help of meta-heuristic
    algorithms has been developed by the authors. Here, the key input to the neural
    network was determined using the recommended algorithm. However, this technique
    does not have the capacity to minimize the system overhead in producing accurate
    detection outcomes. In (Parida et al. 2023), a novel image encryption and authenticated
    framework using the Elliptic Curve have been generated. Here, the suggested Elliptic
    Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) has been generated for performing the encryption process.
    Moreover, the chaotic matrix was XORed by the non-shuffled image in this approach.
    However, the developed model was not able to predict effectively regarding accuracy.
    In (Gheisari et al. 2022), a cluster election algorithm with the help of a fuzzy
    logic inference system was executed. Here, the developed “Low Energy Adaptive
    Clustering Structure (LEACH)” algorithm and “Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm (FCA)”
    model have been adopted for evaluating the active nodes in the developed IoT-based
    plant disease detection system. Here, the maintenance of sensor efficiency becomes
    a challenging task. In order to alleviate these issues, a novel methodology was
    suggested along with the detection of the plant disease in an effective way. Contribution
    of the offered method The key contributions of the recommended detection of plant
    disease model based on the classifiers are specified as below. To adopt a new
    model for identifying plant disease using a deep learning model at the initial
    stage to maximize the overall productivity of the crops and help in enhancing
    the agricultural sector. To ensure security by implementing the AES encryption
    scheme in the image transmission phase. Here, the data encryption is accomplished
    using the encryption key and the data is then secured. To develop a Mask R-CNN
    for segmenting the pre-processed images. Here, the segmentation at the pixel level
    is performed to isolate the specific portion of the image from the whole image.
    To design the MHHO algorithm to maximize the prediction credibility of the proposed
    method by optimizing the constraints such as, “counts of hidden, step-per-epoch
    and count of epoch” in the ADHCN-AM To implement a hybrid model called the ADHCN-AM
    model for classifying plant diseases. Here, the variables are optimized to maximize
    precision; Negative Predictive Value (NPV) rate, accuracy, and Matthew’s Correlation
    Coefficient (MCC) for minimizing the False Positive Rate (FPR). To validate the
    performance offered by the executed model to show the superior performance provided
    by the executed approach by comparing it with various baseline approaches. The
    following sections of the research work are depicted here. Following Section I
    in which a detailed introduction to the IoT-based plant disease identification
    model is explained, the useful attributes and the disadvantages regarding the
    baseline works on the plant disease detection model are discussed in Section II.
    Section III shows the developed IoT-based smart plant disease identification model
    along with the elucidation of collected datasets. Section IV explains the standard
    encryption scheme for IoT-based smart plant disease detection. Image segmentation
    and enhanced deep structure-based disease detection approach with tuning of parameters
    are depicted in section V. The experimental evaluation and conclusion are discussed
    in Sections VI and VII, respectively. Literature survey Related works Mishra et
    al. ( 2021) introduced an automated plant disease detection approach using IoT
    devices. The images of the affected plant leaf were captured using the camera
    by means of an IoT device and then were transferred to the sink node. This sink
    node helped to transmit the data from the field to the pre-processing phase. A
    median filter was executed in the pre-processing phase to boost the grade of the
    image. Then, segmentation was done to eradicate the pixel factors that were present
    within the images. The Sine Cosine Rider Algorithm was used in the classification
    stage for optimizing the parameters The provocation results of the offered advent
    have upgraded the overall performance in identifying plant disease with high perfection.
    Chen et al. ( 2020) have innovated a pattern-based technique that has utilized
    various IoT devices for the identification of bugs in rice bursts. The disease
    detection technique that existed mostly relies on plant images for the recognition
    of bugs in the plant. In the proposed approach, non-image data were automatically
    collected and trained using artificial intelligence techniques. Concurrent data
    was clustered for the analysis of plant diseases. IoT devices have reduced the
    computation cost in real-time training and prediction tasks. The features were
    extracted using the spore germination mechanism. These extracted features have
    improved the overall accuracy rate in leaf disease detection tasks. Udutalapally
    et al. ( 2021) have developed a creative idea-based internet-of-agro-things for
    the automatic detection of bacterial disease in plants. Genetic variation in the
    crops raised the vulnerability of the disorder known as mutation pathogens. Most
    of the production in the agriculture field got degraded due to mutation disorder
    because the farmers didn’t have any idea about this disease. Therefore, implementing
    disease prediction technology using neural structure was needed, to help the farmers
    for improving their crop yield. A convolutional network with neural structure
    was used in this proposed model for performing the task of mutation disorder prediction.
    Input images were collected by the health maintenance system using various sensor
    nodes. In the wireless network, the real-time images from the environment were
    collected using the nodes with a camera module. The proposed model used several
    integrated circuits and smartphone applications to monitor the affected plant
    in the field. A separate protocol was developed to monitor the weather conditions
    of the environment as well. Debnath and Saha ( 2022) have recommended an artificial
    intelligence model based on the IoT network using machine learning for performing
    smart plant disease detection tasks. In this proposed model, CNN was used for
    discriminating the brown spot infection in the paddy crop from the healthy crop.
    Real-time images were collected, recognized, and pre-processed using the self-invented
    pre-processing tool. Next, the collected data were trained and tested using tensor
    flow and keras pattern. The validation has shown that the developed model has
    observed an elevated production rate thus helping in reducing production losses.
    Rezk et al. ( 2022) have introduced a plant infection recognition system using
    deep learning techniques. In this system, the input images were divided into multiple
    segmented images corresponding to their pixel values. Various semantic techniques
    were used in this model like U-Net, CED-Net, Deep LABV3, and Se-Net to recognize
    the disease-affected area from the obtained segmented plant images. Performances
    of the developed model were compared with other networks. Experimentation was
    carried out on the executed model by considering the “sensitivity, F1-score, and
    Intersection over Union (IoU)”. The preferred model with Se-net and Conditional
    Random Fields (CRFs) has given inflated outcomes when compared with other methods.
    The strength and capability of the proposed process and its enhancement were compared
    with numerous existing methods. Gunisetti et al. ( 2022) have proposed an intuitive
    model for the detection of leaf disease in crops. Sensor nodes were used to gather
    real-time leaf images from the platform and these images were transmitted using
    the routers in the wireless network model. The competitive Shuffled Shepherd Optimization
    (CSSO) algorithm was utilized to tune the optimal features for improving the prediction
    rate on disease detection. Swarm and Shepherd’s optimization was assimilated to
    choose a better path. The disease prediction process underwent pre-processing
    techniques. Features like energy and statistical features were extracted and finally,
    the type of disease was predicted. Region of Interest (ROI) and CNN were used
    for feature extraction and pre-processing. The weights were tuned using the executed
    CSSO algorithm. The resultant outcome illustrated that the assigned method’s performance
    was improved than the traditional methods based on their prediction and communication
    delay. Zhang et al. ( 2022) have suggested an IoT-based system to detect diseases
    in apple leaf. Multi-scale Dual Channel (MSDC) was developed in this suggested
    model for detecting apple plant diseases. Initially, the leaf images were collected
    and converted into “Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)”. Following this, the “Hue, Saturation,
    and Value (HSV)” colour scale images were performed to acquire the colour and
    consistency attributes from the input images. Texture features were extracted
    using an RGB colour image and colour analysis was carried out using the HSV colour
    scale on the input image. The weights were optimized to improve the prediction
    rate and to enhance their accuracy. Deep CNN with an attention mechanism was developed
    in this proposed model to perform the detection task. Finally, an IoT-based identification
    of infection in plants was established by merging appliances and identification
    patterns. The experimentations conducted on the developed while utilizing the
    self-gathered database and other scholars’ databases have shown that the innovative
    “Deep Multi-scale dual-channel Convolutional Neural Network (DMCNN)” has attained
    higher performance than other existing approaches. Jiang et al. ( 2019) have proposed
    a machine learning-based model for the detection of apple disease. Real-time images
    were collected automatically. These datasets were made of complex and laboratory
    images. These images have undergone data argumentation and image interpretation
    methods. In this proposed apple plant disease detection model, the Module and
    Rainbow Concentration (IMRC) method was used to identify the apple disease. The
    collected dataset has a total of 26,773 images of apple leaves with diseases.
    This dataset was considered for experimentation. The proposed IMRC was pre-trained
    to collect five kinds of apple leaf disease. The experimental outcomes of the
    IMRC model have obtained a high-speed detection of around 23.13 FPS. Further,
    the suggested IMRC pattern has provided a high-accomplishment solution for the
    advanced models used for the identification of apple leaf infection than the other
    models with higher perfection and better identification speed. Appe1 et al. (
    2023) developed an improved YOLOv5-based tomato plant disease detection algorithm.
    Here, the relevant features were extracted with the help of CAM-YOLO in which
    the YOLOv5 model was used. However, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)
    was suggested for the target identification. Here, the developed model has enhanced
    accuracy thus, has improved the overall detection performance of the system. Problem
    statement Conventionally, several plant diseases are analysed by professionals
    manually. However, these identification procedures have some complexity while
    finalizing the type of the disease due to the similarities in shape, colour, and
    size. The merits and drawbacks of the existing method are illustrated in Table
    1. Several complexities attained in the conventional IoT-based plant disease identification
    model as well are provided in Table 1. SCA-based RideNN (Mishra et al. 2021) effectively
    enhances the disease detection rate in terms of accuracy. However, it is not the
    ability to classify various types of plant diseases. CNN (Chen et al. 2020) automatically
    analyzes the data and generates the outcome relevant to that of the real-world
    outcome. Yet, it was not capable of encoding the position as well as the orientation
    of the objects. CNN (Udutalapally et al. 2021) has a higher robustness than the
    classical techniques and they are widely utilized in all types of applications.
    Still, it faces issues regarding a higher imbalance rate and also faces overfitting
    issues. CNN (Debnath and Saha 2022) didn’t need any human supervision to identify
    the essential features for the identification of disease in plants. However, it
    takes an enormous time to train the data and consumes more time to perform the
    identification task. CNN and CRF (Rezk et al. 2022) effectively improve the augmentation
    size of the dataset and also it has the ability to detect the disease-affected
    part specifically. However, it needs to enhance the performance rate effectively
    in terms of accuracy. CSSO (Gunisetti et al. 2022) offers high-quality solutions
    as the outcome within a reasonable period of time. Still, it easily falls into
    local optimal solutions. DMCNN (Zhang et al. 2022) effectively optimizes the double
    factor weight in order to enhance the textural feature extraction process. Yet,
    it needs a massive amount of data for training, and also it requires more storage
    space for computation. CNN (Jiang et al. 2019) has the capability to attain discriminate
    features automatically for effective analysis. Yet, it needs more time to obtain
    the important features for effective analysis. Thus, to tackle the above-mentioned
    complexities it is significant to develop a new IoT-based model for the identification
    of diseases in plants with the aid of deep structured approaches. Table 1. Advancement
    and complications of baseline blockchain-based smart grid security systems. Download
    CSVDisplay Table Structural view of the developed IoT-aided smart plant disease
    detection with elucidation of gathered Datasets Developed IoT-based smart plant
    disease detection Plant disease affects the natural growth of the plants and reduces
    the yield that is produced by the crop. Infectious plant diseases are caused by
    the attack caused by other living organisms. These infections reduce the nutritional
    contents in the plant. Fungi, bacteria, and viruses are the common pathogens that
    affect crops and reduce the overall plant yield. Various ecological factors like
    soil, heat, and acidic value are some of the other main causes of disease in plants.
    This results in a deduction in the overall productivity of the crop. Diseases
    affecting the food crops may lead to a situation in which there will be an inadequate
    supply of food to humankind leading to the death of people in the worst-case scenario.
    Hence, the identification of infectious plants is necessary to ensure the food
    supply to humans and to prevent the heavy losses that are caused to the farmers
    (Sreedevi and Manike 2022). Automatic identification of disease in plants with
    deep learning is introduced to expose the possible occurrence of plant diseases
    in an automated manner. However, the prediction accuracy of these models is very
    low and these models have a higher bug rate (Alzubi et al. 2022, 2022). Non-linear
    data computation is a little difficult in these developed structures. Even, though
    farmers use improved IoT-based technologies for farming, they are not able to
    obtain a profit due to poor communication framework and as a result of the high
    cost of equipment needed to implement IoT-based agriculture farming. The presence
    of the complex background cannot be easily separated from the original images
    that are collected by means of these IoT-based methods. The boundaries of the
    symptoms of various plant diseases are also not identified in this IoT-based plant
    disease detection framework. So, a hybrid convolution model with an attention
    network is implemented in this work to enlarge the reliability of plant disease
    prediction by reducing the error rate. The architectural view of the offered plant
    disease prediction approach is given in Figure 1. Figure 1. Architectural view
    of the offered plant disease detection model using adaptive deep learning approach.
    Display full size The latest approach for detecting various plant diseases in
    their early stages with high accuracy is executed in this work using an adaptive
    deep structured model. Using IoT technology, the images of the field are gathered.
    The raw data consisting of field images that are obtained by means of IoT technology
    are gathered from various datasets and are subjected as input to the image transmission
    stage, where encryption and decryption are carried out using the AES scheme. At
    first, the raw images are encrypted using AES, and then the encrypted images are
    forwarded to attain the decrypted plant image. Then, the decrypted images are
    subjected to the pre-processing stage, where the quality of the decrypted real-time
    images is improved using the CLAHE technique. Following this, the noises in the
    images are removed with the aid of a median filter. Here, the grey level of the
    pixel value is replaced by the median value using an averaging operation. The
    median filter in the pre-processing stage protects the edge pixel value. Next,
    the pre-processed images are taken for the segmentation phase. Here, the pre-trained
    mask R-CNN network is used for executing the pixel-level segmentation on the pre-processed
    images. Finally, the attained segmented images are passed to the classification
    stage where the ADHCN-AM is utilized to detect the presence of plant diseases.
    The proposed method’s detection accuracy is enhanced by optimizing parameters
    like epoch count, step-per-epoch size, and the hidden count in the recommended
    detection model using the improved MHHO algorithm. The parameters are tuned to
    improve “MCC, accuracy, precision, NPV” as well as minimize the error rate. The
    obtained outcomes are compared with various traditional algorithms and classifiers
    to check the superiority of the suggested IoT-based plant disease detection model.
    The final outcomes of the proposed model produce a high disease detection rate
    with less prediction error. Dataset description The useful data that are required
    for the identification of plant disease are collected from two standard datasets,
    namely the Plantify Dr Dataset and the Plant Village Dataset. A detailed explanation
    of the data gathered from these two datasets is given below. Plantify Dr. Dataset:
    This plant disease dataset is available on the data sources which are available
    in the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lavaman151/plantifydr-dataset, and
    it was accessed on 5 July 2023. It contains a total of 134,000 jpg images with
    plant disease regarding various plant varieties. These images include the leaf
    images of cherry plants, citrus, peach, tomato, strawberry, and apple. A total
    of 32 images are taken in this dataset, and these images are used for training
    our deep learning technique. Plant Village Dataset: The data is garnered from
    online sources which are available in the link https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset.
    This dataset was accessed on 5 June 2023. It contains RGB colour images of the
    affected plant, greyscale images, and RGB images with leaf segmented and some
    high-quality images. The gathered images needed for the designed model are denoted
    by the term B N h C L . The variable h presents the average of images, such that
    h = 1 , 2 , 3 , \\ldotsH , where the variable H indicates the total number of
    collected samples. The garnered sample images are given in Figure 2. Figure 2.
    Sample images collected for detecting plant diseases from various standard datasets.
    Display full size Image transmission using standard encryption scheme for IoT-based
    smart farming AES algorithm The gathered input images are initially given as input
    to the image transmission phase. Here, the images are secured with the aid of
    encryption and decryption processes. For performing the process of encryption
    and decryption, the AES algorithm is utilized. Here, the collected images are
    encrypted using AES and then the encrypted images are forwarded to the node from
    there the decryption process is executed to attain the decrypted plant images.
    AES (Anurekha1 et al. 2022): This algorithm is flexible in nature so it can be
    effectively used in various hardware and software during implementation. In the
    encryption process, a secret key is used to convert the input data into cipher
    text, then using the same key the cipher text is again converted into its original
    data. A number of steps of transmission round in the AES algorithm take place
    based on the key size. Data encryption provides security to the data and prevents
    unauthorized users from reading these protected data. It also prevents mischievous
    one-path attacks in the gathered images. The most significant drawback of using
    a symmetric chipper is associated with the management of the keys in a secure
    manner. Communicating user must share their secret key with enhanced security.
    The number of users in the network is selected according to the number of secret
    keys used in the network. If the network has multiple users, then maintaining
    the security while transferring the data is difficult. Hence, an advanced AES
    scheme is used in this proposed plant disease detection model. AES-based image
    transmission and image decryption The raw images B N h C L are given as input
    to the image transmission phase, where the images are decrypted and encrypted
    by the AES algorithm. Here, the AES algorithm encloses three processes such as
    cipher, inverse cipher, and key description. A cipher is used to convert the original
    images into meaningless information. This information is secured using some special
    key and again is converted into meaningless information. These meaningless ciphers
    are again converted back into original images using an inverse cipher. Computation
    in the AES algorithm utilizes an alternation-permutation module. Here, streams
    of linked mathematical operations are performed and are represented in terms of
    bytes. AES uses 128 bites of plaintext block and these blocks are arranged into
    four columns and rows. The 128-bit round original key is used in this AES algorithm
    for encrypting the images. During the encryption process, the images and the secret
    key are collected from the user. This secret key is used to encrypt the images
    using the AES algorithm. Each block in the image is encrypted separately for the
    entire image. The first block is encrypted using the special key and a cipher
    block is generated from it. The second block is encrypted using the previously
    generated cipher block and the action is repeated till the end of the final block.
    Next, the output is fed to the image steganography phase to hide the secret data
    within the encrypted images in order to improve the overall accuracy. These images
    are divided into two different parts and are merged to form the cover image. Finally,
    these cover images are transmitted over the internet with high security and these
    images are denoted as the steno-images. Each image uses a different routing path
    in the networks, so the hackers are not allowed to retrieve the secret image in
    the encrypted form. On the receiver side, all the shares of images are collected
    and merged to form a single image and are decrypted using the same secret keys.
    The AES-based decryption undergoes four processes, Shift row, inverse mix column,
    Add round key, and Inverse subbyte, and their execution is similar to that of
    the encryption process. Thus, data encryption helps to secure important data in
    the database and helps protect the personal information within the collected images.
    Financial records are stored on the devices. Here, each block is decrypted to
    produce the original images. Thus, the original images are decrypted and retrieved
    without any loss. Finally, the decrypted images Y U h Q W are produced as the
    output from the image transmission phase. Developed MHHO A new MHHO algorithm
    is generated in the implemented IoT-based plant disease detection model. The detection
    accuracy of the system is improved by optimizing the parameters in the ADHCN-AM-based
    detection model. The variables like “step-per-epoch, hidden neuron count, and
    epoch size” are tuned to enlarge precision, MCC, NPV, and accuracy to decrease
    the FPR value with the aid of the MHHO algorithm. In this proposed plant disease
    detection system, the Horse Herd Optimization (HHO) algorithm is utilized because
    of its very few parameter requirements, as it reduces the burden of degrading
    the performance of the executed complex structure. This algorithm also has a high
    convergence speed and strong searching capacity. Yet, falling for the local optimum
    is very high in this algorithm. To overcome this problem, the HHO algorithm is
    modified by uniformly selecting a random number λ between 0 − 1 . HOA (Naeimi
    et al. 2021): The HHO algorithm is developed by considering certain behaviours
    of horses like Sociability, Grazing, Hierarchy, and Defense mechanisms at their
    distinct ages. The iterative movement of each horse is given by Equation (1) .
    C V l iter = B ⃗ l iter , AGE + C V l iter − 1 , A G E AGE = α , ε , η (1) In
    Equation (1) , the term B ⃗ l iter , AGE denotes the initial position of the horse,
    AGE denotes the specified age of the horse, and iter denotes the current iteration
    of the HHO algorithm. The behaviour of horses is changed with respect to their
    age. The maximum life span of horses is 25–30 years. This term α represents the
    horse at the age limit of 0 − 10 years, the term ε represents the horse at the
    age limit of 10 − 20 years, and the term η represents the horse above 25 years.
    Matrix performance is conducted to identify the age of the horse. The behaviour
    of the horses is numerically evaluated to identify the velocity vector. The position
    vector of each horse at different ages is mentioned as computed in Equation (2)
    . B l iter , = H l iter + J ⃗ l iter + D l iter + O m iter + G m iter _ T m iter
    (2) Usually, horses graze for about 16 to 20 hours a day. A specific area is considered
    for grazing and the coefficient of each horse while grazing is denoted by h .
    Horse grazes at any age throughout their lifetime. The gazing of the horse is
    mathematically formulated using Equation (3) . H ⃗ l iter , AGE = kiter χ + κλ
    C m iter − 1 , age = α , ε , η (3) kiter = kite r iter − 1 , A G E × E g (4) In
    Equation (3) , the term H ⃗ l iter , AGE denotes the motion parameters, the terms
    χ and κ denotes the maximum and the minimum grazing bound, and λ denotes the random
    number that is selected between 0 − 1 . Horses are divided into several groups
    with a leader for each group. Members in each group follow the orders from their
    respective leaders. The coefficient of the strongest member in the group is denoted
    as j . Middle age horses ages between 5 − 15 is considered as the strongest horse
    and the position of these strongest horses is determined using Equation (5) and
    Equation (6) . F G l iter , A G E = k l iter , A G E B iter − 1 − B l iter − 1
    (5) j l iter , A G E = j l iter − 1 , A G E × λ (6) In Equation (5) , the term
    F G l iter , A G E denotes the better position of the horse in the population
    based on the velocity parameter. To ensure security, the horses live together
    and they fight with each other due to their social behaviour. Some of the horses
    are always happy with other animals and move towards the average position of other
    horses using the formula given in Equation (7) and Equation (8) . D l iter , a
    g e = d l iter , a g e 1 \\overm ∑ k = 1 M C k iter − 1 − C l iter − 1 , age =
    ε , η (7) d l iter , a g e = d m iter − 1 , a g e × β (8) In Equation (7) , the
    term D l iter , a g e denotes the social motion vector of the horses, d l iter
    , a g e denotes the movement of horses towards the leader in the ite r th iteration,
    and m presents the total number of horses in a group. In each group, the motion
    vector decreases with respect to the factor β . To find the appropriate position,
    the horse imitates one another, and they grasp each other’s best and worst habits.
    The imitation behaviours of the horse are denoted by the term y in this algorithm.
    The movement vector of the horse towards the better position is determined using
    Equation (9) and Equation (10) . D ⃗ l iter , age = d l iter , a g e 1 QM ∑ k
    = 1 M C ˆ k it − 1 − C l i r − 1 , age = η (9) d l i r , a g e = d m i r − 1 ,
    a g e × ξ (10) In Equation (9) , QM notes the total number of horses having only
    the best position and ξ denotes the reduction factor that is used in the motion
    vector. In the HHO algorithm, the characterization of the defence system is noted
    as f and the main function of the defence system is neglecting the position of
    horses having improper responses far away from the target point. Horses fight
    for food and water to reduce their survival difficulties. The defence mechanism
    of a horse is computed using Equation (11) . F ˉ z iter , age = − f z iter , a
    g e 1 wM ∑ k = 1 wM C k iter − 1 − C iter − 1 (11) In Equation (11) , the variable
    F ˉ z iter , age notes the escape matrix and wM denotes the number of horses with
    the worst location. Horses move from one location to another location for grazing.
    They are always eager to visit new locations and to know about the neighbour’s
    location. Horses see each other using the side wall and move towards the stable
    point. This movement is represented as an arbitrary propagation and is represented
    by the term q . Roaming in the horses is carried out only at a young age and this
    behaviour stops when they reach maturity. The process of roaming in the horse
    is mathematically represented using Equation (12) . T n iter , a g e = q n iter
    , a g e λ E iter − 1 (12) q n i t r , a g e = q m i t r − 1 , a g e × e t (13)
    In Equation (12) , the variable T n iter , a g e denotes the velocity vector value
    in a random position and e t denotes the reduction factor. The α horses obtain
    the best solution and are considered the leader of the group. This leader horse
    starts the algorithm by searching for the best position by making use of the exploitation
    strategy. The most common optimal position is denoted as ζ . This position of
    the horses is selected using the attention mechanism. Algorithm 1 gives the pseudocode
    of the offered MHHO algorithm and the Flowchart of this MHHO algorithm is given
    in Figure 3. Table Display Table Figure 3. Flow diagram of proposed MHHO algorithm.
    Display full size Image segmentation and dense hybrid convolution-based disease
    detection with tuning of parameters Image preprocessing The decrypted images Y
    U h Q W are subjected as input to the pre-processing stage. The encrypted images
    are passed through the pre-processing stage, where techniques like “Contrast-Limited
    Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Median filter” are utilized to enhance
    the quality of the images. CLAHE: Amplification noise in the images is reduced
    to enlarge the quantity of the concurrent images using the CLAHE approach. It
    concentrates on a small portion of the entire image called tiles at a time to
    generate the enhanced images. The neighbouring pixels are combined using the bilinear
    interpolation method. Thus, the contrast of the image is improved. This in turn
    enhances the clarity of the pixel value at the edge region of an image. Therefore,
    the user can limit the divergences of the resemblances by decreasing the size
    of the image on the basis of the need before and after CLAHE. The image obtained
    from the CLAHE is denoted as Y U h H J . Median filter: The output image from
    the CLAHE Y U h H J is provided as the input to the median filter. The noise from
    the images is removed with the help of a median filter without losing any edge
    information during the noise-removal process. In the median filter, the result
    is not a statistical function of the input and the median value is equal to one
    of the pixel values. When the median filter moves towards the edge it doesn’t
    create any unrealistic pixel values. Thus, the median filter is good for preserving
    sharp edges in the images. Finally, the pre-processed images obtained from the
    median filter P L h R F are provided as input to the segmentation phase. MR-CNN-based
    image segmentation The pre-processed image P L h R F is given as input to the
    distribution phase, where mask R-CNN is used for segmenting the images. MR-CNN
    (Park 2017) is a state-of-the-art method that is used for performing valuable
    detection and real-time image segmentation tasks. The backbone branch, ROI align
    branch, and mask branch are the three major branches that constitute the basic
    operation in the mask R-CNN. The pooling function generated in the ROI branch
    helps to reduce the quantization error. A convolutional network with different
    weighted layers is used for segmenting the images. Yet, CNN leads to a high training
    error and poor accuracy; therefore, the ResNet model is used to clear up the problems
    that arise in the conventional CNN-based image segmentation model with the aid
    of multiple layers. During the training process, many small features from the
    original images get rejected due to their poor quality. In order to maintain these
    small features, the DensNet with a feed-forward network is used in the mask R-CNN
    model. It enhances feature proliferation and enhances segmentation accuracy. The
    product from each layer is connected to the initial layer to provide continuous
    transmission of information. In this network, the input image is denoted by v
    o , and the number of layers is represented as Y , which executes a non-linear
    transformation function K z ⋅ . Here, the term z denotes the z th layer and the
    cascaded function of the feature map is computed using Equation (14) . v o = K
    z v o , v 1 , … , v z − 1 (14) The input and output of the q th layer are denoted
    by G q − 1 and G q , respectively. The output feature map of the convolution layer
    is computed as given in Equation (15) . G q , v = J G q − 1 , G q , … , G q ,
    G q , v − 1 (15) The maximum information flow is maintained between each layer
    by connecting one layer with another. The resemblance of each layer is the summation
    of the previous output layer and this results in a feed-forward mechanism. A multilayer
    feature of the obtained image is fused to obtain strong semantic information with
    the aim of enhancing the accuracy of the image segmentation process. The ROI align
    layer is utilized to reduce the quantization error in the network. The ROI images
    are divided into H × H boundary cells with their coordinate positions and these
    positions are evaluated using the bilinear interpolation. Finally, the pooling
    function is performed to produce a stable ROI image with less quantization error.
    Region proposal network in mask R-CNN is used to detach the ROI features. Single-layer
    features are replaced with multilayer features, then these features are fused
    together to produce the essential ROI images with multiple features. In mask R-CNN,
    the segmented images are produced after the mask accession method. The ROI images
    after pooling are given to the fully connected layer for employing the classification
    of plant disease task. Here, the bounding box, regression, and instant segmentation
    are done to speed up the processing and execution of this approach. The feature
    size of the images is reduced using convolution and pooling operation and de-convolution
    operation is carried out to improve the quality of the feature by adopting the
    interpolation method. Finally, each pixel is classified and an accurate segmented
    image is produced as an output. The structural demonstration of the image segmentation
    process using mask R-CNN is given in Figure 4. Figure 4. Structural demonstration
    of image segmentation process using mask R-CNN. Display full size Basic DenseNet
    DenseNet is a deeply connected variant of CNN that has the capability to automatically
    acquire the features and optimize the average weight to deduce the overall computational
    complexity. DenseNet uses a feed-forward mechanism for connecting every layer
    in the network with one another. Pooling, convolution, and Rectified Linear Unit
    (ReLU) are the inbuilt operations performed in each layer of the DenseNet in the
    downsampling process. The multichannel input is given as the input to the DenseNet,
    in which the features get extracted and the outcome feature map is created by
    means of the distinct layers in the DenseNet structure. The structural arrangement
    of DenseNet is very easy and straightforward. The DenseNet model has the ability
    to rescue the features across the layers with the aim of improving the efficacy
    of the system and reducing the complexity that arises across the entire system.
    In this DenseNet, the H H + 1 / 2 layers are used, where the outcome of each layer
    is considered as input to the next layer. A rectified layer with a distributed
    activation function is provided as the first layer of the architecture. The nonlinearity
    of the image is improved by using the ReLU layer in the next layer. Moreover,
    the overfitting problem can be reduced using the third layer which is specified
    as the dropout. This dropout layer has a dropout rate of 0.2. The fourth layer
    is the pooling layer which has the tendency to deduce the size of the feature
    map, and finally, the softmax operation is performed by the final layer of the
    DenseNet. The basic architectural view of DenseNet is given in Figure 5. Figure
    5. The basic architecture of DenseNet. Display full size Developed ADHCN-AM for
    plant disease detection The modified ADHCN-AM is utilized in this work to classify
    the types of plant disease at its initial stage. Here, several constraints like
    hidden neuron counts, epoch count, and step-per-epoch are optimized to improve
    the disease detection accuracy with the aid of the MHHO algorithm. The optimization
    helps to attain enhanced accuracy, MCC, NPV, and precision along with the reduction
    in the FPR error value. In this modified dense hybrid convolution network, the
    output layer of each 3DCNN block is densely connected with the 2DCNN layer with
    an attention mechanism in between for performing non-linear transformation in
    the network. The main advantage of concatenating these 3D features with the 2D
    features is for reshaping. Then, maximum pooling is performed using the kernel
    function. This max pooling is a very easy process. Finally, a fusion layer was
    performed to fuse the features to detect the presence of diseases. In this proposed
    model, the attention mechanism was performed to point out special features in
    the segmented images, by allocating different weights to various features in the
    input. Thus, the performance and accuracy of the developed model are increased
    along with reducing the information loss and the burden on the hidden layer in
    the model. The major fitness function of the proposed ADHCN-AM-based plant disease
    prediction is given mathematically as given in Equation (16) . G H 1 = arg min
    W S g ∗ A D H C N , E D h ∗ A D H C N , R F j ∗ A D H C N 1 Aq + Pr e + MC + NPV
    + FDR (16) In Equation (16) , the term W S g ∗ A D H C N denotes the hidden neuron
    which lies in the range 5 − 255 , E D h ∗ A D H C N indicates the epoch, whose
    size varies in the range 5 − 50 and the term R F j ∗ A D H C N denotes the step
    per epoch, which varies in the range 5 − 250 . The terms Aq , Pr e , MC , NPV
    denote the Accuracy, Precision, MCC, and NPV, respectively, and the term FDR denotes
    the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The mathematical expression for computing the
    value of Accuracy, Precision, MCC, and NPV is given below in Equation (17) , (
    18 ), ( 19 ), and ( 20 ), respectively. Ac = T Y p 1 + G H n 1 T Y p 1 + G H n

    1 + Y H p 1 G H n 1 + U J n 1 (19) NPV = G H n 1 G H n 1 + Y H p 1 (20) In the
    aforementioned terms from Equation (17) to Equation (20) , the terms T Y p 1 ,
    G H n 1 , Y H p 1 and U J n 1 note the true positive observations, true negative
    observations, false positive observations, and false negative observations. In
    the classification stage, the attention mechanism is applicable to enhance the
    performance and detection accuracy of the developed advanced plant disease detection
    model, in which Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized. Initially, the feature
    map is assigned and passed to the global maximum and average pooling function
    to produce a fused feature. Then, the resultant features are fed to the Perceptron
    layer, where the activation function is performed to produce the final feature
    vector of the image. The mathematical expression for the channel attention mechanism
    is given by Equation (21) . Z v g = δ ZAQ avgpool g + ZAQ max pool q Z v g = δ
    E 1 E o G a v g V + E 1 E o G max V (21) In Equation (21) , the variable δ presents
    the sigmoid function, and the terms E 1 and E o denote the specified weights after
    the activation function is performed. Using the convolution operation, the features
    are fused to produce the required output. The spatial attention module is mathematically
    indicated as Equation (22) . Z v g = δ g 7 × 7 g a v g d , g max d (22) Thus,
    the complex network is utilized to easily compute the assigned task of plant disease
    detection using the attention network by dividing the area into smaller areas
    and then processing it sequentially by deducing the noise to improve the efficacy
    of the approach. The diagrammatic illustration of the hybrid ADHCN-AM model that
    is developed to employ the task of plant disease detection is illustrated in Figure

    In recent years, diverse research has been explored in the field of plant disease
    using various techniques. This is because plant disease identification is important
    to aid the farmers in attaining a higher yield with reduced production loss. Detecting
    plant disease effectively enhances the overall profit margin for the farmers and
    also enhances the overall productivity of the plant. However, the large amount
    of data was not handled effectively by the existing plant disease detection models
    and these models require more computation time. So, an effective model was suggested
    for detecting the plant disease in an effective way using a deep learning model
    in this work. In order to solve the issues that exist in the conventional models,
    a deep learning-based plant disease detection model has been introduced in this
    research work to predict the disease in plants with higher reliability and accuracy
    at the very beginning stage. Two different datasets were collected and given to
    the image transmission stage, where the AES scheme was used for encrypting and
    decrypting the images to enhance their privacy. The decrypted images were then
    fed to the pre-processing stage, where the quality of the image was enhanced by
    using CLAHE, and the noise in the image was removed by using a median filter.
    The pre-processed images from the median filters were given as input to the image
    segmentation phase. Here, the mask RCNN was utilized to provide the segmented
    images. Finally, the segmented images were given to the classification stage.
    Here, the ADHCN network was used to produce classified outcomes. The parameters
    in the ADCN were optimized using the proposed MHHO algorithm to enhance MCC, accuracy,
    and precision and to reduce the FPR error rate at the time of plant disease detection.
    Various experimentations were performed on the implemented deep learning-based
    plant disease detection model, and the results were compared with other existing
    algorithms and detection techniques. The experimental outcomes have shown that
    the implemented MHHO-ADHCN-AM-based plant disease detection model has achieved
    high accuracy in prediction with around 9.30% higher than DOA-ADHCN, 8.4% higher
    than COA-ADHCN (Mansour et al. 2022), 4.4% more than VLPA-ADHCN, 2.13% better
    than HHO-ADHCN algorithms, respectively. Finally, from this analysis, the righteous
    model for the detection of various diseases in the crops with high accuracy is
    attained by the executed MHHO-ADHCN-AM-based plant disease detection model when
    compared with various existing detection models and conventional algorithms. However,
    certain limitations were faced while implementing this MHHO-ADHCN-AM-based plant
    disease detection model. The limitations faced during the research works are described
    below. Due to the different climatic conditions, the collection of plant images
    with disease has become a challenging factor. However, in future work, the real-time
    “Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)” will be analysed and the experiments will be
    carried out using enhanced deep-learning models. Additionally, the real-time implementation
    will be performed for the same crop using different datasets for the same crops
    in the near future. Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was

  description: The agricultural sector plays an important role in contributing significantly
    to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing countries. On the other
    hand, agriculture is widely affected by major factors such as environmental changes,
    natural disasters, pesticide control, and soil and irrigation-related issues,
    which reduce crop yield. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and agriculture offers
    an opportunity to move into the next generation of Agriculture 4.0. The internet
    of things (IoT), remote sensing, machine learning, deep learning, big data, cloud
    computing, thermal imaging, end-user apps and unmanned aerial vehicles offer a
    full-stack solution. IoT provides the ubiquitous connectivity of smart devices
    to the internet to collect, process and analyse a large amount of agriculture
    field data more quickly and synthesize them to make smart decisions using various
    machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This study reviews the challenges
    and major issues in the IoT agriculture domain and explores its emergence with
    new technologies. It covers the existing literature and illustrates how IoT applicationbased
    precision agriculture solutions have contributed. A case study on weed detection
    for smart agriculture using the YOLOv5 model is presented, achieving high accuracy.
    Finally, various IoT agriculture use cases are discussed, along with current research
    issues and possible solutions for future IoT-based agriculture advancement.

  description: Today farmers around the world are gradually embracing Smart farming
    assisted by different cutting-edge technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    is playing a major role in the development of smart agriculture applications.
    Artificial intelligence, edge computing, cloud computing, big data, etc are other
    forefront technologies used in smart agriculture. Stages of Agriculture activities
    for a certain crop can be broadly classified into three categories, viz, pre-harvest,
    during harvest and post-harvest phases. In each phase, many activities have to
    be performed. Pre-harvesting stage involves seed selection, land preparation,
    crop selection, etc., during harvesting includes irrigation, disease analysis,
    pathogens detection, etc. and Post harvesting involves storage, cooling, reaping,
    etc. In the current work, we have carried out a thorough literature review of
    these activities involving smart farming one by one. We have attempted to find
    the flaws in terms of IoT devices, security, dataset, and methodologies used in
    these existing works. Based on the research gaps a 5G-based smart farming framework
    has been proposed. We have also presented a brief comparative analysis between
    our survey and the existing surveys. Our survey has been found to be more comprehensive
    compared to the existing ones in many regards.

    Today farmers around the world are gradually embracing Smart farming assisted
    by different cutting-edge technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) is playing
    a major role in the development of smart agriculture applications. Artificial
    intelligence, edge computing, cloud computing, big data, etc are other forefront
    technologies used in smart agriculture. Stages of Agriculture activities for a
    certain crop can be broadly classified into three categories, viz, pre-harvest,
    during harvest and post-harvest phases. In each phase, many activities have to
    be performed. Pre-harvesting stage involves seed selection, land preparation,
    crop selection, etc., during harvesting includes irrigation, disease analysis,
    pathogens detection, etc. and Post harvesting involves storage, cooling, reaping,
    etc. In the current work, we have carried out a thorough literature review of
    these activities involving smart farming one by one. We have attempted to find
    the flaws in terms of IoT devices, security, dataset, and methodologies used in
    these existing works. Based on the research gaps a 5G-based smart farming framework
    has been proposed. We have also presented a brief comparative analysis between
    our survey and the existing surveys. Our survey has been found to be more comprehensive
    compared to the existing ones in many regards. Previous article in issue Next

    harvestingNB-IoTSDN 1. Introduction One of the most important pillars of human
    society is agriculture. According to the food and agriculture organization (FAO),
    to cater the needs of growing population, food (FAO, 2009) production need to
    be increased by 70–65 % in 2050. Farmers must put in more effort while using the
    traditional agricultural approach, which also uses resources inefficiently. Several
    issues, including population expansion, climatic circumstances, a shortage of
    resources, etc., occur from this ancient farming approach. The term smart agriculture
    refers to digital farming practices that are used to maximize effectiveness instead
    (Javaid et al., 2022) of capability. This system performs structured and optimal
    input and output analytics through smart technologies, objective-focused analysis,
    planning, and monitoring. As a result of collecting and pooling analytical data
    using advanced sensor, a methodology group is built that is optimized for achieving
    this objective-oriented analysis. For monitoring and managing agricultural operations,
    this cutting-edge technology combines Internet of Things (IoT) networks, devices,
    AI, and big data analytics. Through the use of diverse electronic, biochemical,
    and electrical sensors and actuators, various farming field data can be collected,
    and through this data, different sub-operations of farming applications can be
    developed. Using IoT to monitor crops (Sreekantha and Kavya A.M., 2017), detect
    diseases and pests, predict crop yields, robotics-based harvesting of crops, and
    much more. The creation of a wireless sensor network (WSN) can be accomplished
    using various types of wireless connections, each with a range, bandwidth, and
    topology that varies. A novel kind of wireless network can be built using topologies
    like bus, star, and mesh and a variety of communication technologies including
    Bluetooth, ZigBee, LTE-M, thread, Sigfox, etc. to communicate data from one node
    to another about the farming field. The edge gateway layer where all sensor node
    data are stored and processed for further analysis is connected to this sensor
    network. The data can be communicated to a different distributed network over
    the internet to a cloud server for additional analysis and monitoring at the user
    end by using application protocols like “Hypertext transfer protocol” (HTTP),
    “Message queuing telemetry transport protocol” (MQTT), etc. The gateway can be
    utilized as single-board microcontrollers and computers similar the Raspberry
    Pi (Charania and Li, 2020). Digital transformation is the main advancement in
    agricultural development which (Baryshnikova et al., 2022) transforms 1.0 into
    5.0 in the twenty-first century. The key to advancing digital transformation in
    smart agriculture from version 5.0 to version 6.0 is the development of wireless
    communication technology. A number of wireless communication technologies, including
    “Long Range Radio (LoRa)”, Radio frequency module (RFM69)“, ”Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)“,
    and ”SigFox“ etc (Hidayat et al., 2020) have been utilised in agriculture. It
    is possible to create a secure smart farm system, also known as a 5G beyond Smart
    agriculture system (Tomaszewski et al., 2022) by fusing several technologies including
    IoT, Edge computing, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and Blockchain
    (Andreadis et al., 2022, Kasera et al., 2022). The ability to manage and achieves
    a variety of computing workloads and necessities for storage can be encouraged
    by developing a hybrid or dispersed sensor network employing cloud computing and
    edge computing. In this regard, edge computing will be able to regulate jobs that
    demand speed or limitations on connectivity. In addition, cloud computing will
    be able to accommodate operations that demand higher processing capabilities,
    for instance, machine learning (MCLRN), as well as managing enormous volumes of
    data by utilizing load-balancing techniques. From this type of technologies farmers
    will be able to access farming field status remotely and the system will be entirely
    automated through interoperability between machines (Li et al., 2021). Considering
    the research strategy that was used to write this review article is discussed
    in Fig. 1 below. Download : Download high-res image (265KB) Download : Download

    Fig. 1 denotes the simplified structure of how the review article is organized.
    Based on pre-, during-, and post-harvesting operations, the various IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture literature has been identified and categorized. After classifying
    and reading the literature, each pre-harvesting, during-harvesting, and post-harvesting
    operations’ existing subsystems have been thoroughly discussed and its weaknesses
    analyzed. This analysis has been accomplished based on the IoT-enabled technologies,
    data set gathering, and approaches that have been used in the past and it also
    includes an overall thorough assessment of the pre-, during-, and post-harvesting
    subsystem''s research gaps. Based on this research gap a modified 5G IoT-based
    smart agriculture framework has been proposed to reduce the shortcomings of the
    existing work. The Pre-harvest to post-harvest activities have been categorized
    in this article to explain the existing work for the smart farming system. The
    classification of pre- to post-harvest activities is presented in the Fig. 2.

    2. Pre-harvesting system (PHRS) Throughout the pre-harvest process, there are
    a number of land preparation (LPR) sub-activities that considerably increase agricultural
    yield. Researchers, scientists, and engineers have made a number of advancements
    in the past to create a smart PHRS using smart agriculture technology (Gaikwad
    et al., 2021), that can choose the crop in advance depending on climate conditions,
    region, area, etc. and prepare the land for production. The sub-areas of PHRS
    that are used when preparing the land for farming are depicted in Fig. 3. Download

    PHRS subsystem classification. 2.1. Crop yield prediction (CYP) IoT-based method
    for yield prediction in which sensor node data is shared with data centers (Gayatri
    et al., 2015) and made available to the sons of the soil. To anticipate agricultural
    yield, supervised MCLRN is carried out utilizing (Kumar et al., 2020) the “Random
    Forest” (RADF) and “Decision tree” (DT) algorithm. In this situation the RADF''s
    accuracy is superior compared to the DT''s. A two-tier MCLRN model called the
    “adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier (aKNCN)” and the “Extreme Learning
    Machine algorithm (ELM)” were proposed to predict crop yield. By applying ELM
    to (Gupta and Nahar, 2023) increase performance accuracy, the suggested system
    optimize the weights using a modified version of the Butterfly Optimisation Algorithm
    (mBOA). The creation of an algorithm for predicting crop yield (Bhojani and Bhatt,
    2020) three new activation functions called “DharaSig,” “DharaSigm,” and “SHBSig”
    are employed to enhance the neural network''s performance on agricultural datasets.
    K Closest neighbor procedure is employed to identify the crop that is most acceptable
    (Gajula et al., 2021). For the purpose of forecasting the yield of the sorghum
    crop, (Jayaram and Marad, 2012) a fuzzy inference approach is implemented. A fuzzy
    model''s input tools are physio-morphological features. Due to estimates and ambiguity,
    the model''s performance depends on quantum data. A method for managing massive
    data and predicting crop productivity three different types of (Fan et al., 2015)
    approaches have been employed that is MapReduce weather data for computing large
    datasets; nearest neighbor weather data for comparing distances across like years;
    and, finally, an “Autoregressive moving average” (ARMA) model for forecasting.
    To determine crop yield, a “Support vector machine” (SVM) and DT approach are
    used. While choosing (Reshma et al., 2020) features for a specific location, factors
    like soil type, temperature, humidity, groundwater level, local population, farmers''
    availability, variety of plantations, and variety of farmed land were taken into
    account. Analysis has been conducted based on these traits to determine the optimal
    crop. A mixed MCLRN approach was put forth to estimate agricultural yield. The
    most precise (Anbananthen et al., 2021) MCLRN prediction from two models is combined
    using the stacking generalization model. Cross-validation is used to evaluate
    a hybrid MCLRN model''s performance to that of other MCLRN models for evaluation.
    For the purpose of predicting agricultural yield (Sajja et al., 2021) an MCLRN
    simulation is designed, where crop segments are built up experimentally for the
    training of models using SVM, random forest, and ID3. In which case SVM outperforms
    other methods. The key advantage of the current CYP is that most systems classify
    soil nutrients and geographic data for crop yield prediction using data mining
    techniques like KNN, ID3 and fuzzy inference systems, which produce superior prediction
    outcomes. The geographic information was gathered using a GPS approach that is
    IoT-enabled. The RGB-D camera is utilized as a mobile platform to enhance the
    CYP. Crop quality, data-driven decision-making, cost reduction, and resource optimization
    are all improved by using IoT-enabled data mining approaches. The shortcomings
    of the existing techniques are as follows: prediction based on time series analysis,
    area-wise analysis, soil quality analysis, country-wise analysis, and geospatial
    analysis remain to be explored. There is no hybrid MCLRN algorithm for handling
    huge datasets. Full IoT based system still need to be worked upon. 2.2. Crop selection
    (CSL) Enhancing Agricultural Sustainability through Crowdsensing (Ginige and Sivagnanasundaram,
    2019) a mobile-based agricultural information-sharing system is developed for
    monitoring real-time farming activities (CSL LPR, “seed selection”, “seed sowing”,
    “irrigation, “crop growth”, “fertilizing”, and “harvesting”) with the help of
    a crop calendar marker. IoT-based system for crop selection and monitoring precision
    farming (Bhojwani et al., 2020) various sensors are employed to measure environmental
    variables and interface with the microprocessor. An IoT gateway using ESP8266
    sends the data acquired to a cloud server. On the basis of data collected earlier
    from the cloud server, the existing working model uses K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
    to estimate prospective predictions to be able to make precise decisions about
    what crops to grow in a particular environment. Maximize the crop yield (Kumar
    et al., 2015) for selecting which crops to cultivate over a season the MCLRN method
    predict yield rates based on environmental variables including weather, soil type,
    water density, and crop type. Smart agriculture-based crop selection analysis
    utilising (Tseng et al., 2019) big data a platform is created to track environmental
    elements on a farm and use those environmental factors to evaluate farmers'' agricultural
    practices. The findings suggest that farmers can determine a crop''s suitability
    for their land with greater insight. This is so they can take a look at things
    like soil moisture levels and temperature. The suggested environmental factor
    analysis methodology aids farmers in learning which crops they can produce. In
    order to optimize food production (Udutalapally et al., 2021) an innovative agricultural
    solution is proposed that uses AI and IoT for selecting crops, disease monitoring,
    and automated irrigation systems. The fuzzy MULTIMOORA technology on (Balezentiene
    et al., 2013) language and numerical reasoning is provided as a fuzzy-based system
    for crop selection in Lithuanian climatic conditions. “Johnson''s reduct” classifier
    method is used (Deepa and Ganesan, 2019) to produce classification rules for three
    crops, including rice, “groundnut”, and “sugarcane”, in a decision-based system
    for crop selection. According to present environmental (Bakthavatchalam et al.,
    2022) circumstances a system has been established for precision agriculture that
    uses IoT and classifier-based MCLRN algorithms to recommend the crop for irrigation
    and acquire the highest yield. AI for characterization and forecasting the (Amkor
    and El Barbri, 2023) results of potato samples cultivated with “Nitrogen”, “Phosphorus”,
    “Potassium” (NPK) fertilizers has been suggested in which KNNs are used for classification
    and nonlinear autoregressive models for prediction. Machine learning and artificial
    intelligence advancements for the existing CSL system improve the decision-making
    for planting crops according to climate conditions and location. By using IoT-enabled
    solar power-based crop recommendation systems, energy consumption is reduced.
    Genetic optimization is the most common method for optimizing CSL performance.
    Crop guidance is improved when weather conditions are forecasted through the development
    of a crop calendar-based system. Some of the shortcomings may be as follows: the
    current CSL solution lacks self-sustainability, testing for additional crops,
    security of sensor node data, system optimization, and subsystem integration.
    2.3. Seed selection (SSL) A tillage drip architecture is used for recommending
    seeds for (Indira et al., 2018) planting. Additionally, it discusses how effective
    seed selection based on soil can produce precise results. Seed selection is possible
    in the first phase, automatic watering is covered in the second phase, and plant
    disease diagnosis is covered in the third phase. A computer vision to identify
    (Koklu and Ozkan, 2020) different dry bean seed kinds the user interface was created
    using MATLAB, and 13,611 grains of seven different types of dry beans were photographed.
    The model has undergone 20-fold cross-validation and has been constructed using
    a variety of MCLRN classification methods, including MLP, SVM, KNN, and DT. When
    compared to other classification model results, SVM performance performed better.
    Deep-learning methods for seed classification were proposed in which fourteen
    (Hamid et al., 2022) different types of seeds were gathered and pre-trained using
    “MobileNetV2″ to create a model. The trained model claimed accuracy of 98 % on
    the training set and 95 % on the test set after rigorous experiments, extensive
    pre-processing, and fine-tuning. The advantage of the current SSL system is that
    it chooses the appropriate seeds for individual fields using a computer vision-based
    method based on MCLRN and AI. Water, insecticides, and fertilisers may all be
    used more efficiently by farmers. This has good effects on the environment in
    addition to lowering costs. The existing work lacks a fully automated system and
    limited use of data. Need more research for various types of seed classification
    based on climate condition, geographical region wise, and land wise. 2.4. Seed
    germination (SGM) Proposed and created a smart germination assistance (SGA) system
    for SGM. “Temperature”, “humidity”, “light intensity”, “moisture”, and soil “pH”
    are all factors that (Islam et al., 2019) affect SGM. Using particular sensors,
    the system continuously measures the values of various factors in the surrounding
    environment. Each sensor reading from a different seed is kept and connected to
    an ideal value. Using a low-power embedded system (Shadrin et al., 2019) an AI
    method is proposed that can recognise SGM dynamics without necessitating heavy
    data transfer between nearby nodes. 97 % accuracy is attained with a “convolutional
    neural networks” (CNNs) model for seed recognition. A system based on the IoT
    was proposed to monitor, manage, and (Theparod and Harnsoongnoen, 2022) collect
    data regarding the effects of narrow-band light emitting diodes (LEDs) on sunflower
    nodes. With the help of “narrow-band LEDs” and dynamic germination, it was found
    through research that the germination of sunflower seeds was more successful in
    the red-light zones. IoT-based study is carried out for indoor tomato SGM (Seyar
    and Ahamed, 2023) systems at thresholds. Where transplanted seedlings were grown
    outdoors with a comparison of two irrigation systems using soil water balance
    methods with a long-range LoRa communication system, and the subsurface drip irrigation
    system produced the highest seedling levels of growth based on agronomical parameters
    at a 12 % threshold. A feature of the current SGM system is the usage of a LoRa-based
    data communication system for various modules during the SGM process, such as
    irrigation and seed growing status. For the dynamic seed germination process,
    the usage of IoT-based “narrow-band LEDs” produces better results. The system
    in place uses only one type of seed for testing, and it is not entirely IoT-based.
    As a result, there is a lack of a fully validated testbed system that uses an
    ideal sensor, is self-sustaining, and can be utilised for other crops. The current
    system still has flaws as it does not deal with plant biomass growth, flowering,
    fruits, and other types of crops utilising IoT-based technique and image processing
    algorithm. 2.5. Drought or flood monitoring (DFM) A “WPART” IoT-enabled smart
    farming system is established that uses MCLRN (Rezk et al., 2021) to anticipate
    crop productivity and drought for informed decision-making. The following data
    factors are used to pick features: year, month, rainfall, temperature, air pressure,
    season, crop, “area”, “production”, and productivity. An IoT-based tackle has
    been put up for agricultural drought (Ping, 2014) data transmission and accumulating.
    The outcome shows that the system''s data capture and transmission performance
    is flawless, and it has good application value for gathering and analysing agricultural
    drought data. An MCLRN/IoT-based flood tracking system is portrayed (Rani et al.,
    2020) to gauge the water level in a flood-prone site. The intensity of floods
    is gauged using raindrop and water sensors. An IoT-based dam water monitoring
    alerting system is developed (Ganesh et al., 2022) for calculating how much rain
    fell, one may determine how much water will be released from the dam. The signal
    is analysed and judgements are made using the Arduino UNO. IoT data collection
    in real-time and MCLRN analysis and drought result prediction are two benefits
    of the current DFM. For obtaining and analysing data on agricultural drought,
    the gearbox performance is faultless, and it has strong application value. Absence
    of a long-term analysis based on previously established value and absence of coverage
    based on humidity and rainfall across a vast area were observed. There is lack
    of long-distance data connection methods in remote fields. The absence of dark
    shadow detection in the current technology makes it difficult to detect noisy
    pixels values in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for flooded regions, which can
    lead to erroneous data. 2.6. Soil testing and measurement (STM) The optical transducer
    is used as a detecting sensor. This sensor (Goswami et al., 2020) comprises of
    three LEDs as a light source and an as “Light detector” (LDR) for assessing the
    results of soil tests performed on four distinct types of soils. Each nutrient''s
    threshold values divide its level into three voltage levels: Low, Mid, and High.
    A technique for monitoring soil health utilising four dynamic parameters was developed.
    In which the (Ramson et al., 2021) effectiveness of a network made up of nine
    soil health monitoring units was tested over the course of several weeks in an
    agricultural field site. Soil sensing, wireless range, power consumption, life
    expectancy, and implementation cost were all evaluated. An IoT-powered soil health
    tracking (Sengupta et al., 2021) approach that can manage agricultural parameters
    has been created. The variations in stimuli, including those related to light,
    heat, sound, motion, magnetic fields, etc., are converted into electrical signals
    by a sensor node and then processed and graphically displayed by the Thingspeak
    cloud server. Using cellphones or personal computers, a methodology is proposed
    for sensing (Saikia and Khatoon, 2022) the percentage of wetness of the soil and
    temperature remotely and continuously. Raspberry Pi-based soil nutrient monitoring
    system for tomato plantations is proposed using various soil sensors (Manickam,
    2020) such as PH and Soil NPK sensors for monitoring the soil continuously. The
    present STM''s strongest point is its use of an IoT-enabled method to assess soil
    health. Thanks to the existing technology that farmers can precisely administer
    fertilisers, insecticides, and water based on the soil''s nutrients, PH, and type,
    crop disease is reduced, and crop yields are increased. There are still lack of
    sensor assessment based on a specified period, in-depth data analysis, additional
    parameters for optimising soil testing in various existing activities etc. There
    is a demand for an affordable, universal solution that can be used to all kinds
    of farms. 2.7. Weather prediction & monitoring (WPM) An agro weather station (AWS)
    that is intended for farmers and researchers is (Faid et al., 2021) develop using
    four layers: perception, transmission, presentation, and administration. For various
    end users, it offers frequently data and AI-based insights. IoT-based intelligent
    energy-efficient approaches have been originated for monitoring and managing greenhouse
    interior temperatures. Many (Subahi and Bouazza, 2020) simulations utilizing a
    greenhouse temperature transfer function are run to show the usefulness of the
    recommended strategy. For temperature and irrigation control a computerized procedure
    is acquired. Using an Android app that connects (Kori et al., 2021) to the controller,
    many agricultural parameters, including as temperature, humidity, soil wetness,
    and rainfall, are tracked and visualised. A strategy to schedule weather forecasts
    was put out in order to foresee (Li et al., 2019) adoption of weather prediction
    information as well as future energy harvesting values based on historical harvesting
    values. A low-cost solar-powered (Devapal, 2020) soil and weather analysis system
    has been offered that looks at different soil properties and weather patterns
    to set up a high-tech smart farm for farmers. IoT, data mining, and android mobile
    applications are all used in the system''s development. Integrating a provincial
    weather station with dual modules to serve as a LoRa-based soil sensor node (Singh
    et al., 2022) for scrutinizing the state of the soil and the weather. During experiment,
    a LoRa portable communication device and an IoT cloud are used to transmit meteorological
    data. Constructed, and tested a flexible (El-magrous et al., 2019) meteorological-soil
    sensor station for acquiring site-specific maps of soil elements, atmospheric
    information, and yield information for the 2018 soybeans season of cultivation.
    Farmers were able to make well-informed decisions on soil selection, irrigation,
    planting, and harvesting thanks to the use of sophisticated tools for weather
    forecasting and data from already-existing systems. The existing weather monitoring
    and forecasting systems have a number of drawbacks, including the absence of AI
    fault detection approaches, a lack of integration with the existing IoT-based
    agriculture system, and a lack of optimize long-range communication technologies.
    There is a need for an intelligent weather system that can identify the soil''s
    nutritional needs and suggest a suitable crop. 2.8. Soil digging (SDG) To enhance
    tillage processes more significant by fusing IoT, “cloud computing”, and “Decision
    support system” (DESS) technologies (Fawzi et al., 2021) the ”Tillage Operations
    Quality Optimization (TOQO)“ model is constructed using two levels: ”Tillage Depth
    1 (TD1)“ and ”Tillage Depth 2 (TD2)“. TD1 = 10–15 cm and TD2 = 25–30 cm. The TOQO
    standard''s tested results improve long-term evolution for the agribusiness by
    maximizing farmer expenditures, accelerating field productivity, and optimizing
    tillage routines. Real-time monitoring of soil-digging machinery, which enables
    farmers to optimise the depth and spacing of rows or holes, is a strength of the
    current system. This accuracy supports resource utilisation that is efficient
    and minimises reductions in waste. Due to the significant differences in soil
    properties, such as moisture content and hardness, the current system needs to
    be improved in terms of performance, affordability, and sensor calibration. Analysis
    to reduce the environmental impact of soil tilling is still lacking in the system.
    More accurate measurements may be possible by the use of the cutting-edge MCLRN
    algorithm. The average growth rate of research publications published between
    2012 and 2023 for PHRS applications that are based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other
    techniques is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (193KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Publication growth rate analysis of PHRS application
    based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. The growth
    rate of publication has been assessed based on the quantity of articles published
    in a given year for a specific PHRS application, such as CYP, CSL, SSL, SGM, DFM,
    STM, WPM, and SDG, and the average growth rate analysis has been assessed based
    on the overall quantity of publications for PHRS application year-wise. As observed
    in Fig. 4 graph, a growing number of publications based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and
    other approaches for PHRS application are made each year, with a high percentage
    of IoT-based PHRS applications. Thus, it can be concluded that the number of PHRS-based
    smart agriculture applications is growing steadily as a result of the convergence
    of IoT, edge, cloud, and AI technologies. 3. During harvesting system (DHRS) After
    preparing the land for the cultivation of crops, there are numerous sub-operations
    engaged during harvesting. The subsystem of the DHRS is shown in Fig. 5. Using
    cutting-edge technologies to automate crop monitoring and irrigation (IoT, MCLRN,
    Data Mining, etc.). It not only emphasises the value of improved production but
    also strongly emphasises data analytics and environmental sustainability. This
    is done to assess the needs and anticipate the compatibility of crops and fertilisers
    in light of the soil and environment. Download : Download high-res image (261KB)

    sensor network is essential for the implementation of smart agriculture (Haseeb
    et al., 2020). There are numerously IoT-enabled prior related work that has been
    done (Ahmed et al., 2018, Anagha et al., 2023, Sah Tyagi et al., 2021) in the
    domain of during the harvesting process. 3.1. Smart irrigation (SIR) Low-cost
    intelligent smart irrigation system using IoT is proposed in three modules. Combined
    (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) sensor module, irrigation module, and sensor communication
    module. The combined sensor module is used to access crop, plantation, and soil-related
    information. After accessing sensor monitoring data it uses a neural network model
    to make an intelligent decision. These decisions are sent to an irrigation module
    and sensor communication module. The aforementioned data determines whether the
    water machine has to be turned on or off in a certain location. The system keeps
    track of incoming data, and the sensor communication module logs it via the MQTT
    broker. The “AtMega 328” microcontroller and (Saraf and Gawali, 2017) Zigbee communications
    are used to monitor and control sensor data in the existing work. Each field''s
    central node stores sensor data in the cloud database. The report on automatic
    irrigation is delivered to a user via an Android application. An intelligent irrigation
    (Alomar and Alazzam, 2018) system is achieved using IoT and fuzzy logic. As environmental
    variables, air climate and humidity sensors, soil wetness sensors, and light intensity
    sensors are used. By utilizing all the sensor information, a Mamdani fuzzy controller
    controls the flow of water. IoT, a DPLRN, and fuzzy computation are combined to
    form an ecosystem for creating a self-sustaining irrigation system. Soil wetness,
    atmospheric (P. Patel et al., 2022) variables, and the state of crops are all
    input variables in this operational simulation. Leveraging the Raspberry Pi, a
    device called an IoT gateway allows for uploading data to the cloud. To estimate
    if a crop is healthy or slumping, an assortment of DPLRN algorithms are used.
    In order to determine the appropriate time to irrigate the crops, all measured
    input variables are analyzed with a fuzzy logic controller. RFID and sensors to
    establish an efficient farm tracking framework exploiting (Saha et al., 2022)
    “Long range wide area network” (LoRaWAN) protocol with six distinct harvesting
    issues, prohibiting fungal attacks on crops, screening cattle, appropriate watering,
    accurate soil wellness inspection, accurate inspection of crops, and enhancing
    productivity. It maintains appropriate irrigation while conserving water by using
    incredibly effective temperature and humidity sensors. Four distinct categories
    of sensors are used in the soil and crop wellness tracking system to gauge the
    “NDVI” readings of the crops, the “pH” rating of the soil, the percentage of nutrients
    that are contained in the soil, the soil''s compaction, and the amount of water
    in the soil. Cowlar is used by the cattle monitoring system to continuously check
    on the health of the cows. Smart farm decision-making powered by IoT and the cloud
    system that has been designed in order to communicate sensor (Lova Raju and Vijayaraghavan,
    2022) data using “NRF24L01” modules. A suitable irrigation is schedule in which
    the author, without (Sayanthan et al., 2018) the assistance of labour, employed
    an Arduino soil moisture analyzer to measure water requirements at various phases
    of eggplant growth. Using an “Arduino Uno R3” board and an “Arduino DUE”, the
    (Jamroen et al., 2020) intelligent irrigation system is scheduled. For data connectivity,
    the “NRF24L01” module is intended. The current method guards against crop water
    stress situations using a fuzzy inference system. The MCLRN-enabled autonomous
    watering mechanism has been constructed. The raspberry pi and (Vij et al., 2020)
    Arduino mega are two different types of microcontrollers employs in this method.
    The Arduino Mega is equipped with a number of sensors. Arduino Mega sends sensor
    data to Raspberry Pi through the wifi module. Weather data will be retrieved using
    an open-source Application programing interface (API), and a raspberry pi will
    operate to alert a system using weather data and sensor node data. A soil type''s
    propensity for irrigation is predicted using MCLRN. A way to regulating irrigation
    (Mohammed et al., 2023) systems using DPLRN that takes into account the moisture
    and soil structure. In their methodology, soil pictures and moisture sensors are
    used to gather data, which is then processed using real-time videos to determine
    the crop''s need for irrigation and moisture levels. A “VGG-19” model analyses
    the type of image and crop seeded to predict irrigation needs. “TensorFlow” lite
    is used to run experiments on cheap computational hardware and test the proposed
    model on a private dataset. A remote irrigation water pump monitoring, management,
    and (Kirar, 2022) security is developed. The sensors used in this work to detect
    supply voltage and motor current to estimate operating conditions and offer protection.
    The user receives the measured parameters via the SIM900 GSM component regarding
    the intent of remote oversight and management. The Android application was created
    with a better user interface, timer-based functionality, notifications for feedback
    and pump status, among other features. An ATmega 328P microprocessor that is included
    into the Arduino Uno board protects the pump. To track agricultural factors like
    temperature and relative humidity (Hamouda and Elhabil, 2017) a greenhouse smart
    management mechanism is suggested. The watering and cooling of greenhouses are
    managed and controlled automatically by the system. An intelligent system is created
    to track and control several subsystems, including irrigation, (Cecchetti and
    Ruscelli, 2022) lighting, heating, and solar. To enable sensor data to be connected
    to the farm Ethernet network, RS485 bus Ethernet convertor is employed. Automation
    of the heating system, irrigation system, circulation pump, and solenoid valve
    are accomplished using a relay board coupled to a Raspberry Pi 4 microcontroller,
    which is controlled using the HTTP. PHP scripts handle the system''s overall business
    logic. A connected device WSN is created using the “SIXFAB” module (Kiani and
    Seyyedabbasi, 2018) to irrigate crops in agricultural fields, and the Arduino
    component of the module transmits data to a Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway. One
    of the strengths of the existing SIR system is its use of WSNs and machine learning
    techniques for monitoring and scheduling irrigation of crops for large and small
    farming fields by collecting wet and dry soil data according to the climate and
    soil condition, which ensures crops are irrigated at the right time and irrigation
    systems optimize crop growth. There should be irrigation and crop-specific field
    monitoring, which are weaknesses of the current approaches. The current system
    relies on a single kind of irrigation for a variety of crops. There are lackings
    of self-sustaining system and sensor calibration system. Based on the soil nutrients,
    moisture, temperature, and humidity, more data analysis needs to be done. Heuristic
    techniques for improving irrigation and minimising water use are still lacking.
    To prevent water waste for different crops, the water irrigation system can be
    scheduled or rain harvesting strategies need to be used. Transparency of sensor
    data is lacking. The current process is unable to communicate with another system.
    The system''s performance can be enhanced by using simple cryptographic techniques
    to safeguard data flowing from all the sensors. Communication over long distances
    for data is still unpredictable. 3.2. Soil health monitoring and fertilizer management
    (SHMFM) A methodical approach that accumulates instantaneous data from the farm
    site, such as light strength, wetness of the soil, surface temperature, humidity,
    etc was proposed to provide local access (Bachuwar et al., 2018) to soil temperature,
    humidity, soil wetness, and light intensity, an ESP826612E transmits sensor data
    over a Wi-Fi network using the “IEEE 802.11” protocol. A method to produce data
    sources made up of temperature, humidity, and N, P, and K nutrient content (Rahman
    et al., 2019) that are produced from soil data sensor readings. In order to create
    a soil fertility data warehouse, sensor data is uploaded using IoT technologies.
    By combining Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) in
    a novel NPK sensor (G et al., 2020) an IoT-based system took into account. To
    determine whether N, P, and K deficiencies exist in the soil chosen for testing,
    the Mamdani inference procedure is used. At regular intervals, the farmer is alerted
    to the quantity of fertilizer to be applied. A technique that (Postolache et al.,
    2022) can aid in the evaluation of changes in soil nutrients for more effective
    administration of drainage and fertiliser control. The appliance may gather information
    on the amount of NPK in the soil, further information on soil temperature, conductivity,
    pH, and moisture. A solar fertigation control mechanism for watering using a hybrid
    model and forecasting control (Ahmad et al., 2022) is built on a weather-based
    system accompanied by a crop a repository controlled by real-time sensors that
    keep track of the water condition of the plants as well as the soil moisture and
    water quality. The continuous gauging system for evaluating the water in the soil
    and nutrients for citrus (Zhang et al., 2017) moisture and nutrient status in
    citrus orchards, so that fruit farmers can understand their orchard''s condition
    in time and adjust fertilization and irrigation strategies according to the data.
    To make it simpler for farmers to plant citrus seeds, (Pratama et al., 2021) an
    IoT-enabled gadget that indicates the soil''s nutrients for citrus seedlings using
    a “NPK” indicators and feeds the outcomes to the Thingspeak cloud. A soil wetness
    monitoring system was developed using LoRaWAN detectors with (Hossain et al.,
    2022) blended transmission modules, no in-field root stations or routers, and
    an unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based mobile router to retrieve the gauges of
    soil wetness taken from buried indicators for a variety of crops. A continuous
    measurement system is proposed for soil nutrition content using an automated fertilizer
    unit for (Visvesvaran et al., 2021) greenhouse systems. The fertilizer system
    automatically provides the plants with the nutrients required once the measurement
    value reduces under the trigger value. The NodeMSU is utilized throughout the
    system for data communication. The performance of the LoRaWAN network beats that
    of the current system for long-distance data transmission, and the “Mamdani inference”
    optimization method based on IoT fuzzy logic yields the best results for measuring
    soil health. From the discussion above, it can be seen that the current system
    has some drawbacks, such as a lack of standardisation due to the fact that different
    soil sensors use different data formats and protocols to collect data. Due to
    the dependence of soil temperature on climate, sensor calibration is still lacking.
    To better manage soil surface and fertilisation, the current system has to be
    optimized. 3.3. Disease detection and analysis (DDAN) For autonomously identifying
    and categorising plant diseases from leaf photos, a DPLRN algorithm is suggested.
    Using the collected images, (Sladojevic et al., 2016) CNNs are trained and validated
    along with fine-tuning. A convolutional neural network model with squeeze net
    architecture is utilised (Hidayatuloh et al., 2018) to distinguish between healthy
    and diseased tomato plant leaves. There are four steps to creating a DPLRN based
    (Andrianto et al., 2020) smartphone application for spotting rice plant diseases.
    These are creating a system architecture for plant disease detection, creating
    a cloud server application and a smartphone application, testing the smartphone
    application, and assessing the system''s performance. The MLP simulation of plant
    diseases, which acquires information as 10 characteristics and 4139 data points,
    was put forward as a real-time (Kumar et al., 2021) detection method. The four
    common forms of disorders are accurately detected by the neural network. An app
    for cellphones that makes use of deep convolutional neural networks to (Pallagani
    et al., 2019) anticipate crop diseases. A total of 38 different diseases have
    been predicted by the app. Farmers everywhere can make use of it even without
    an internet connection. Controlling a pandemic illness with an IoT-based gauge
    is a crucial agricultural (Khattab et al., 2019) application. The system architecture
    can forecast a variety of plant diseases, and the model has been put to the test
    on tomato and potato crops in lab settings. An electronic method designed to communicate
    with mobile phones (Nagasubramanian et al., 2021) to manipulate disease classification,
    environmental objects, and farmer suggestions. MCLRN algorithms, SVMs, and CNNs
    are used to develop the farming suggestion. A leaf detection analysis is put forward
    using (Thorat et al., 2017) an assortment of sensors, such as temperature and
    soil moisture meters, etc. After processing, the leaf image is collected and uploaded
    to the server. The status of the leaf disease is also communicated to the farmer
    via the mobile app. Using “MDFC-ResNet” and DPLRN-based IoT (Hu et al., 2020)
    devices, a crop diagnosis of illnesses IoT system for several crop types is being
    developed. A publicly accessible collection of 54,306 pictures of ailing and healthy
    plant leaves has been assembled (Mohanty et al., 2016) in which a deep CNNs was
    utilised to identify 14 crop types and 26 illnesses from this controlled sample.
    An IoT-based system that uses MCLRN to deliver conveniently (Truong et al., 2017)
    available real-time local environmental data in rural crop fields. With the method,
    it is possible to both identify fungal illnesses and forecast their potential
    spread among crop fields. A “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based technique for
    plant disease identification is designed. Once the model has been trained using
    (Adeola et al., 2022) MCLRN methods, it is transformed into a lightweight model
    with a kilobyte (KB) size that can be placed into devices with external memory.
    Tensorflow lite is used to perform the model conversion with the already installed
    library. The existing method''s strength is its effectiveness in locating the
    illness at the plant''s root system using information on the soil and environment
    of a given region. The performance of the “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based
    technique to identify the kind of sickness was superior to that of existing DPLRN
    systems. For gathering a vast number of statistics on various plants and climatic
    circumstances, the aforementioned existing method still has several shortcomings.
    Lack of ability to detect and control various diseases. To identify plant diseases,
    several existing systems used CNN-based DPLRN algorithms, but the algorithm performance
    still has to be optimized in terms of accuracy, usefulness and real time plant
    disease analysis. 3.4. Pathogens detection (PDT) Biosensors possessed the ability
    to develop into the forefront of diagnostic techniques for various fields of biological
    studies, which comprises immediate assessment of human blood (Sonu and Chaudhary,
    2022) ingredients for both animal and plant infection recognition, environmental
    surveillance, and airborne pathogen identification. As a result variety of techniques
    for detection of (R. Patel et al., 2022) plant pathogens and mechanisms of biosensing
    systems have been examined, whose two main categories of conventional analytical
    methods for the detection of plant diseases are the “Digital droplet polymerase
    chain reaction” and the “Quantum dots-based biosensor”. The exploration of techniques
    for agricultural disease detection is the overall strength of the present work.
    The analysis illustrates the benefits of miniaturized sensors in terms of convenience
    in production; affordability, speed of reaction, and responsiveness, establishing
    those instruments useful for observations in the field. In terms of high levels
    of automation, the work currently being done for pathogen detection still has
    a research gap. It is lacking sensor standardisation. It is necessary to improve
    the methods for detecting various pathogen types, sensor calibration, dataset
    gathering, and technology integration. A cheap sensor needs to be deployed in
    the creation of an affordable, eco-friendly system. Due to the need for further
    optimisation of IoT-enabled systems, there is still a gap in field testing. 3.5.
    Pest controlling (PCN) IoT and CNN-based insect recognition techniques are combined
    in a system. The technology is (Ramalingam et al., 2020) utilized by pest management
    businesses to keep an eye on pests in a variety of settings, including food storage
    areas, hospitals, gardens, etc. Using the IoT for crop monitoring and pest control
    (Tian et al., 2021) an infrastructure for simultaneous and collaborative simulation
    strategy has been provided. Based on the results, the applied simulation with
    IoT assistance system is the most efficient and accurate solution. An artificial
    IoT and DPLRN (Chen et al., 2020) technology can be used to analyze crop growth
    and predict pest occurrences in an environment. A neural network algorithm called
    “You Only Look Once (YOLO)” is used to identify pests in images. A system for
    the detection and control of pests embedded in an embedded environment is proposed
    in which (Vijayalakshmi et al., 2019) if the acceptable limit gets surpassed in
    terms of both temperature and humidity, then the “raspberry pi” captures the image
    of the plant and compares it to the database, and if pests are found, the farmers
    are notified to fertilize. A “Multi-Agent System (MAS)” by deploying a (Debauche
    et al., 2020) Docker environment orchestrated by “Kubernetes” in the Edge AI-IoT
    architecture is constructed. The system utilizes an AI algorithm to identify plant
    diseases and pests and uses an irrigation pivot to treat the crop. The positive
    aspects of MCLRN algorithms like KNN and the (Materne and Inoue, 2018) linear
    regression framework are used to construct a prediction model in a plantation
    to forecast disease and insect outbreaks. The upside of already-existing systems
    is that building a decentralized and accordance simulation structure with the
    IoT for pest control and crop monitoring in combination to increase crop yields,
    lessens the load on one GPU, and contributes to the operation evenly and concurrently
    with all accessible GPUs and perceives data. Based on the usefulness of data,
    the current pest management method still has a gap. For a robotic technique based
    on DPLRN to detect different kinds of insects and rodents, the current solution
    still has to be improved. Due to various data formats and IoT protocols, there
    are still issues when integrating the current system with another system. The
    amount of manual field monitoring by farmers can be decreased, for example, by
    merging deep irrigation systems with current pest management techniques. By including
    preprocessing to normalise the image before the prediction to minimise the effects
    of photo exposure (varying light intensity in outdoor situations), plant disease
    and pest detection can be enhanced. IoT-based security and privacy of sent data
    still require improvement. 3.6. Weed detection (WDT) Robotic weed control that
    uses MCLRN and IoT to detect weeds in onion fields and (Arakeri et al., 2017)
    spray them with the required herbicide. Installing a weed detecting system in
    a chilli (Islam et al., 2021) field using RADF, KNN, and SVM, among other MCLRN
    and image processing algorithms. Systems were built using MATLAB. In order to
    identify weeds in soybean crops (Razfar et al., 2022) a DPLRN based vision-based
    weed identification system is prepared. Three unique CNNs models and MobileNetV2
    are employed in the five-layer DPLRN architecture. In order to increase agricultural
    productivity (Dasgupta et al., 2020) a concept is suggested by utilizing wireless
    sensor networks and AI models for crop forecast and weed identification. In this
    approach, MCLRN is used to create a model after data are collected from sensors
    via WSN. CNN is used in conjunction with this to detect marijuana in drone-taken
    photo. An algorithm is designed based on CNNs to identify and (Jabir and Falih,
    2022) locate weeds in wheat harvests in the region of Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Morocco,
    using an intelligent system. The YOLO model is used to construct a real-time detection
    and identification model on the Raspberry Pi. A network is established for detecting
    weeds (Kulkarni and Angadi, 2019) using a CNN. The CNN is constructed as a pooling
    layer, and the activation function is a “ReLU”. A remote-controlled robot based
    on a Raspberry (Dankhara et al., 2019) Pi is used to detect weed using an image
    processing technique. A model has been formed for precision (Karthikeyan et al.,
    2021) agriculture based on K-means clustering to classify weed plants. A “CNN”
    technique associated with IoT is used for image processing. When compared to another
    neural network technique, the performance of a WSN employing a Raspberry-based
    system with the DPLRN approach is superior. More accurate results were obtained.
    The above-discussed existing work has flaws based on real-time mobile application
    monitoring of weed detection; more parameters can be added to make the DPLRN model
    performance optimised so that real-time weed can be detected accurately; and analysis
    of weed mapping method still has a gap where more research can be carried out.
    Improvements still need to be made to real-time UAV-based technique optimisation.
    The existing system does not incorporate the integration of various environmental
    sensors, actuators, or feedback controllers for monitoring. More research is still
    needed to develop a custom deep learning algorithm that can identify different
    weed types based on plants. 3.7. Crop losses (CLO) To gain an adequate understanding
    of crop health, an apparatus has been (Shafi et al., 2020) put together that combines
    multi-modal data from the IoT nodes and drone photos. The fused data was subjected
    to MCLRN and DPLRN algorithms for crop health classification and creating health
    maps. Data from the sensor nodes is transmitted via a LoRa module. The system
    is intended to design, develop, and test a next generation of automated (Pérez-Ruiz
    et al., 2015) and robotic systems for efficient pest management in agriculture
    and forestry operations using a real-time kinematics (RTK) and “Global positioning
    system” (GPS) controlled autonomous tractor for straight-line tracking. A drone-based
    system is designed in which a “Raspberry Pi” module is integrated (Saha et al.,
    2018) with an array of 64 separate temperature sensors over 12C, an RGB-D camera
    for taking real-time photos, and a GPS navigation module. The cloud server receives
    and stores all sensor data. A system that makes use of multiple sensors to assess
    the temperature, humidity, pH level and scent of the leaves is compared and examined
    (Giri Babu and Anjan Babu, 2020) to check if the gathered leaf values fall within
    the range specified in the actual dataset for tracking crop health. Using IoT
    and remote sensing (Shukla et al., 2021) a method is proposed for agricultural
    health monitoring. To identify healthy crops, IOT-connected UAVs and MCLRN are
    used. Prescription maps are important because they make use of resources like
    pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Farmers are able to decide what resources
    are necessary to ensure that crops are healthy at every stage of growth. An IoT
    platform is constructed that uses image processing and a classifier algorithm
    to detect plant illnesses. If an (Ayalew et al., 2022) automatic medicine system
    identifies ailments, a sprinkler sprays medication. Additionally, disease transmission
    is tracked based on changes in weather using soil humidity and temperature sensors.
    An automated decision-making (Grimblatt et al., 2021) tools and metrics that track
    plant development and health, which have an immediate and measurable effect on
    farmers'' ability to produce crops. Experiments are carried out using two separate
    sensors, soil moisture and temperature, to ascertain the significance of each
    parameter as the foundation for plant growth. An agricultural production system
    simulation is designed (Matsumoto et al., 2017) to carry out intricate business-based
    assessments of the abundance of inventories and crop destruction brought on by
    an absence of knowledge about the quantity of food acquired, the number of unit
    crops, and the enlargement of cultivated fields. IoT-Edge module (Park and Kim,
    2021) collects strawberry hydroponic environment data and strawberry photos, allowing
    for monitoring and determining strawberry harvest time. Utilizing a Wide-area
    inexpensively network (LPWAN) based on the “NB-IoT” (Chang et al., 2018) a smart
    lighting system is developed for greenhouses of expensive crops. Using the temperature,
    humidity, and methane gas sensors MQ4, LDR, and DHT11 (Mahfuz et al., 2020) an
    embedded system is established based on microcontrollers. Its purpose is to keep
    track of the atmosphere all over the greenhouse. In the event that any sensor
    value is outside of its acceptable range, the Arduino will send the user a notification
    SMS using a SIM 900 GSM modem. Through the Android app, a new threshold value
    is also configured. The performance of the smart monitoring of healthy crops is
    outperformed by the IoT that utilises drone and hybrid MCLRN to detect healthy
    crops in the growing environment. The data is transmitted quickly and cheaply
    between the edge and the cloud using an LPWAN based on the “NB-IoT”. It has been
    determined through research of the already-existing system previously described
    that there is still a gap in monitoring and controlling the crop from numerous
    losses. The current system is missing data processing steps and robotic sensors
    with intelligence that can detect different soil parameters, such as soil PH,
    soil water levels, and other characteristics. The ability for mobile-based applications
    to provide the end user with real-time access to farming field information from
    any location still needs refinement. For example, alerts for watering plants,
    temperature control notifications, and disease detection alarms based on the disease
    types and how this disease might be controlled. The examination of extensive data
    based on various crop types is still lacking. Because of climatic circumstances,
    dissimilar data formats, and dissimilar communication protocols, the system is
    not self-sustaining; it is dependent on a certain region and environmental condition.
    It is also unable to integrate with another subsystem. Fig. 6 exhibits the average
    annual growth rate of papers on research produced throughout 2012 and 2023 for
    DHRS implementations based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other procedures. Download :

    growth rate analysis of DHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other
    methodology from 2012 to 2023. According to Fig. 6, the DHRS application research
    publication growth rate analysis has been conducted similarly to that of the PHRS
    application research publication growth rate analysis. The DHRS publishing analysis
    graph shows an increase in the number of research published articles year over
    year. Comparing IoT-based DHRS applications to AI, MCLRN, and other techniques,
    the publishing growth rate was higher between 2019 and 2022. This is because more
    research is being done on SIR, DDAN, and CLO-based applications. In comparison
    to the period from 2012 to 2018, the average annual growth rate of publications
    for SIR-based applications between 2019 and 2022 has been calculated to be 69.23
    %. In contrast, between 2019 and 2022, the average growth rates for CLO and DDAN,
    respectively, were 53.26 % and 63.98 %. It is therefore possible to predict that
    there will be an increase in the number of research publications using IoT and
    AI-based approaches for developing DHRS applications. 4. Post harvesting system
    (POHRS) When preparing the ground for agricultural cultivation, farmers that practice
    traditional farming face a number of challenges. These challenges were brought
    on by the rising demand for agricultural production, and it is not simple to match
    this rising demand for food processing, storage, and supply. The Fig. 7 shows
    the post-harvesting subsystem in which various existing research work has been
    done based on storage, harvesting cycle, supply chain, food processing, etc. (Abouelsaad
    et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (213KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. POHRS subsystem classification. The post-harvest physiology
    and management of fruits and vegetables are covered in this area, along with topics
    like harvesting, handling, packaging, storage, hygienic practises, transportation,
    crop waste, etc. In the context of severe weather, it also covered postharvest
    handling. 4.1. Reaping, sorting, cooling, and storage (RSCS) An agricultural robot
    design is incorporated that would use “Autodesk Fusion 360″ (Sazid et al., 2022)
    and ”Webots Simulator“ for reaping, seed sowing, excavating, unmanned ploughing,
    watering, fertilising, and harvesting. “Proteus 8.9” simulates the complete system.
    For data analysis, “MATLAB” is being used. An IoT-based microcontroller farm robot
    automates the system as a whole. An IoT-based low-cost solution is structured
    in which warehouse''s (Banerjee et al., 2020) hazardous gas, CO2, is detected
    using a gas sensor. Tilts or lateral motions of the rack are picked up by shock
    sensors. To safeguard grains from fire, a warning is issued if a fire flame is
    discovered. The Node-Red dashboard allows a user to view the findings of live
    sensor data anywhere, at any time. IoT has been used to monitor and manage food
    grain waste in warehouses. A “DHT11” indicator (Devi et al., 2021) for temperature
    and humidity, a CO2 sensor for air quality, a PIR sensor for moving object detection,
    and other sensors are integrated using “Arduino” to act as a rat and insect repellant.
    A fan is activated to cool the room if the temperature and humidity are above
    and below, respectively, the threshold levels. All sensor node data is accessible
    on the mobile application. Immediate terms surveillance equipment powered by IoT
    that (Siddiqua et al., 2022) can track temperature, humidity, brightness, and
    gas concentration in freezing storage and notify the user of potentially dangerous
    values when the levels surpass the thresholds. The “Arduino UNO” microcontroller
    regulates sensor data and provides it to the ESP32. The MIT App Inventor is used
    on either a computer or an Android phone to monitor the status of the storage
    room. Using a combination of blockchain technology (Sangeetha et al., 2021) a
    system for gauging crop quality and monitoring storage that links farmers with
    distributors directly. Data is gathered in real-time both in the warehouse and
    on the field. All sensor nodes are linked together using Arduino, and information
    is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway using Lora communication.
    Farmers and distributors can visualise and analyse data via a web application,
    which is stored in Azure SQL databases. The invention of a stated IoT-enabled
    warehouse management system in which (Anoop et al., 2021) the NodeMSU microcontroller
    is set up to receive temperature and humidity data in this study. A DT method
    is used to examine the temperature swings that took place in Kerala during the
    past five years. To assess and display the warehouse''s climate state, this climate
    data is transmitted to the cloud server Thingspeak. A system based on IoT is established
    for controlling and monitoring food (Hema et al., 2020) instantaneous grain storage
    and procurement. To monitor the overall status under the granary, the system makes
    use of gauges for climate control, moisture, gas, real-time clocks, and burning
    flame gauges. Sensor data is visualized using the thingSpeak cloud platform. An
    MQTT-based application control warehouse system is developed for fruits and vegetables
    storage. Using MQTT and COAP protocol (Deshmukh and Bhalerao, 2017) sensor information
    can be displayed on a web page and accessed via mobile apps. Compared two techniques,
    ”Evaporative Cooling Chambers“ (ECCs) (Verploegen et al., 2018) and ”clay pot
    coolers,“ and proposed employing non-electric cooling and storage devices as a
    potential solution to the post-harvest warehouse issues in rural Mali. An IoT-enabled
    approach is structured that employs sensors to track the condition of agricultural
    fields and warehouses in real-time. The (Nayak et al., 2022) necessary region
    is surrounded by a number of sensors that can identify any impending dangers and
    notify the appropriate people. The infrastructure for safeguarding the harvested
    crops in the warehouse and monitoring the same in real time through an IoT sensor
    network performs better than the performance of the entire existing system for
    developing refrigeration sections through WSN-based clay pots. The system is affordable
    and accessible to all farmers. The aforementioned summary of current research
    has a number of drawbacks based on harvesting, storing, and cooling. There is
    a dearth of smart alert notifications in the storage system. The current storage
    system still lacks real-time monitoring of insects and rodents. There is a need
    for such a sophisticated intelligent-based algorithm that can regulate the warehouse''s
    temperature automatically in accordance with diverse environmental factors and
    locales. For different fruits and vegetables, storage systems should be based
    on weight and long-term storage capability, which is still lacking in the current
    work. On the security and usability of the system at the user end, there is a
    research gap. To boost the performance of the current system, other sensors can
    be added, including RFID, sound sensors, and various gas sensors. 4.2. Crop waste
    management (CWM) A solution to identify (Chihana et al., 2018) warehouse breaches
    and track grains using IoT prototypes is suggested. The usage of cloud storage,
    WSN, and RFID technologies increases accountability and efficiency while reducing
    theft and administrative mistakes. Using an IR sensor, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi
    module a smart garbage management (Jayalakshmi et al., 2017) system built on IOT.
    After garbage levels reach maximum, dustbins are cleaned as soon as possible.
    A framework is formed for smart (Bong Cassendra P. C. et al., 2018) agriculture
    based on a smart waste management perspective. The author discusses the various
    sensor and communication protocols that can be used to track the waste of crops
    in agriculture. The current system''s main strength is its ability to collect
    data instantaneously on the amount and type of agricultural waste. These data
    are examined using cloud computing to determine where crop waste is accumulating
    and to evaluate the risk of fire, illness, and pest infestation. Satellite images
    and ground-based sensors can be used to monitor crop waste degradation. Farmers
    at present have access to information on greenhouse gas emissions and decomposition
    rates. According to a study of previous research, smart agro-waste control research
    is still in its early stages. Low-energy power sensors and sophisticated techniques
    for managing post-harvest waste are not used. Research is still needed for all
    forms of crop loss management. 4.3. Transportation and tracking (TTN) A three-layer
    perishable generate fog computing model is proposed (Musa and Vidyasankar, 2017)
    in which the RFID-embedded sensors that generate sensor readings for the monitoring
    and control layer are among the data producers. A system for the effective distribution
    and transportation of fresh fruit is developed by utilizing the MQ3 sensor. The
    (Elavarasi et al., 2019) system''s result was that it lessened fruit contamination.
    When damaged fruit is discovered, an SMS is delivered to the user''s mobile device,
    and through a remote, the system removes the spoiled fruit using a pick-and-place
    robot. In this article the author go into great (Onwude et al., 2020) detail about
    how cutting food losses during postharvest cold chain activities might enhance
    food security. IoT and blockchain were suggested (Pervez and Haq, 2019) as a means
    of digitally disrupting supply chains and logistics. The supply-chain architecture
    built on a block chain is designed using a direct acyclic graph data structure.
    The IoT-based technologies used in the management of the agricultural supply chain
    in a developing nation like India are discussed. Real-time data sharing (Luthra
    et al., 2018) uses embedded components including actuators, sensors, and network
    connectivity. Digital technologies enable the (Dadi et al., 2021) creation of
    effective agri-food supply networks. “Big data” and IoT are a combination of several
    technologies that the system uses to evaluate enormous amounts of information
    quickly. RFID can sense the food environment. The Blockchain-based supply chain
    management plan (Bhutta and Ahmad, 2021) that places an emphasis on employing
    IoT devices and Blockchain technology to securely identify, trace, and track agricultural
    food during transportation. The methods used to anticipate backorders include
    SVM, KNN, RADF, and AdaBoost. The IoT-based dairy supply chain model is suggested
    and put into practise. In which (Jachimczyk et al., 2021) the related solution
    and the domain-oriented knowledge model are well matched for the integration and
    synergy-enabling processes. RFID is used to capture and share data for production,
    warehousing, sales, supply, and other processes. Advocated in China by integrating
    blockchain and RFID in the (Feng Tian, 2016) supply chain. Information is transferred
    securely and made public via the traceability system by using blockchain. Real-time
    monitoring of the climate, humidity, and geolocation guarantees that harvested
    crops get to their destination in the best feasible conditions, reducing spoiling
    and improving crop quality. Blockchain technology leveraging RFID-based sensor
    nodes optimises supply chains for all crops in real-time. It reduces waste and
    guarantees that crops get there at their intended location in the best feasible
    condition. It has been determined from the discussion of the TTN''s current system
    that the secure supply chain technique has to be updated for all agricultural
    products. Sensor-based technologies, device security and failure, software security,
    and power management all require improvement. The current infrastructure does
    not allow for the dynamic scheduling of transportation based on the agricultural
    products'' shelf lives. There are significant research gaps in the areas of cloud
    platform load balancing, computational cost, and security protocol. Logistical
    processes based on smart contracts can be added to the system to increase its
    efficiency and power. There is still a need for an autonomous system that unifies
    numerous subsystems using IoT with technologies like blockchain and AI. 4.4. Food
    processing (FDP) “Big data” analytics, MCLRN, and the IoT are used to build a
    (Konur et al., 2023) cyber-physical / IoT based food manufacturing system. The
    intelligent production control system offers intelligent decision assistance.
    A tools is structured for tracking and (Jagtap et al., 2021) lowering energy and
    water consumption (FEW), as well as a decision-support system with pertinent hardware
    and software components, utilizing an IoT four-layer architecture. FEW data are
    gathered and used in the food manufacturing sector to examine and improve procedures.
    The food processing system is more effective when IoT, big data analytics, MCLRN,
    and cyber-physical systems are incorporated than when they are automated. Additionally,
    this analysis teaches data professionals new information about how to forecast
    the baking process for achieving product consistency. Productivity may be raised,
    and performance and profitability can be raised by analyzing these data. The current
    research has been examined for individual agricultural goods. For all agricultural
    goods, testing can be done based on the ingredients and food processing. It is
    necessary to integrate seamless IoT devices to improve food processing. The current
    system lacks a strong security system to safeguard system data. Based on IoT,
    AI, MCLRN, and other processes, Fig. 8 presents the average annual growth rate
    estimation of research publication for POHRS application from 2012 to 2023. Download

    Publication growth rate analysis of POHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN
    and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. For the TTN and RSCS system implementations,
    a large number of research articles have been published between 2018 and 2022.
    The average growth rate for the IoT and blockchain-based TTN system has been measured
    as 63.23 % between 2018 and 2021, and the average growth rate has been measured
    for the IoT and AI-based system for storage and cooling at 58.41 % between 2018
    and 2021. However, there has been less growth in research publications on the
    topics of IoT and AI for the other POHRS applications, such as FDP, CWM, sorting,
    and cooling, between 2012 and 2022. Therefore, there is a need for greater study
    in that area. Using IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other methodology categories, the average
    growth rate of research papers for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS was 41.12 %, 43.23 %,
    and 36.10 %, respectively, till January 2023. 5. Metaheuristic based algorithm
    in smart agriculture application From growing to reaping, an agricultural application
    (Kiani et al., 2022a) uses a meta-heuristic approach. In the first unit, the “Sand
    Cat Swarm Optimization” (SCSO) based algorithm has been created to delegate the
    cultivation work to the appropriate autonomous machines, reducing the labor factor.
    In the second unit, IoT devices keep track of cultivated crops. For crop harvesting
    in the third unit, an improved “ANT colony optimization” (ACO) algorithm has been
    created. A 3D strategy approach has been (Kiani et al., 2022b) employed using
    a couple of Progressive enhancement Grey Wolf Optimisation (I-GWO) and Improved
    Grey Wolf Optimisation (Ex-GWO) for self-sustaining farm operations to search
    for a collision-free feasible route in a sufficient period with minimal expenditure
    in various atmospheric conditions and for multiple barriers. The goal is to tackle
    the NP-hard problem of successful crop harvesting by identifying the finest and
    most suitable paths for UAVs. The results indicate an endeavor to avoid any local
    optima pitfalls and determine the most effective response in an adequate span
    of duration. The fuzzy logic-based “Non-dominated sorting (Fathollahi-Fard et
    al., 2023) genetic algorithm” (NSGEA) model has been developed as a metaheuristic
    optimization strategy where the model incorporates the advantage of multiple factors
    of apprehension such as harvesters'' effectiveness, waves of crops that become
    ripe, parameter weather, as well as adjustments in the value of commodities. The
    framework takes into consideration a wide range of desired results, including
    profitability optimization, preventing waste, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction,
    and it is utilized to calculate the optimum amount of day''s labor for farmers
    and laborers on every block of land. The usefulness of the currently available
    SCSO, ACO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, and NSGEA metaheuristic algorithms put into effect in
    IoT-based agriculture exceeded other approaches, and the model suggested may be
    used for different applications in a variety of agricultural areas. There are
    still some issues with the optimised performance technique that is currently being
    used to solve NP-hard issues in the field of smart agriculture. Lack of standardisation
    for big croplands utilising IoT and IoT of transportation employing a portable
    robot system to monitor the farming field based on SIR, SCL, CSL, CYP, SGM, SSL,
    STM, SHMFM, DDAN, PDT, WDT, PCN, CLO, TTN, FDP, and RSCS. While supply chain optimizer
    for several harvested crops is currently lacking, the used NSGEA algorithms in
    multiobjective problems can be extended by “Benders decomposition” or “Lagrangian
    relaxation”. 6. Technologies based on the IoT for smart agriculture The development
    of IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems has relied on a variety of technologies
    in the past. It is possible to use this technology wirelessly or wiredly. It is
    conceivable to build an infrastructure for intelligent agriculture at a low cost
    by combining sensors, controllers, and communication technologies. Through the
    synthesis of IoT, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and cloud computing,
    IoT-enabled technologies have made advancements in developing smart agriculture
    systems as well. This section analyses various technologies for developing smart
    agriculture systems in the different major areas of farming operations on the
    basis of discussion in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application. The estimation average rate of several technologies utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS system is depicted in Fig. 9 of the graph.
    According to the existing survey (Kalyani and Collier, 2021) and proposed survey
    report, this is the estimated percentage of technologies used in smart agriculture
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (215KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Growth rate of various technologies used in PHRS, DHRS, POHRS subsystem
    between 2012 and 2022. According to an average percentage analysis of various
    technologies conducted between 2012 and 2022, the use of IoT and other technologies
    for the development of smart agriculture would increase by 2028 (Research and
    Markets, 2023). Table 1 presents cutting-edge technologies, sensor or devices
    that can be applied to build smart agriculture using IoT architecture (Chamara
    et al., 2022) based on PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS. From Table 1 it can be seen that
    the use of IoT has advanced the field of smart agriculture from 2012 to 2023.
    The advancement has been done by deploying various IoT devices / sensors (Pyingkodi
    et al., 2022), wireless communication protocols (Khanh et al., 2022), and UAVs
    using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technologies to automate the farming
    field operations (Boursianis et al., 2022). It is possible to communicate from
    machine to machine using a variety of communication standards (Orfanos et al.,
    2023). Table 1. Analysis of Technologies used in the smart agriculture between

    The graph in Fig. 10 represent how much data is consumed in GBPS by PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems. This data bandwidth estimate is evaluated and (Annual Internet,
    2023; Virtual Cisco, 2017) measured using prior research. This information is
    obtained through a variety of IoT sensors and actuators, including cameras, DHT
    temperature and humidity sensors, air pressure sensors, rain sensors, distance
    sensors, water flow metres, and others. These sensors and actuators are utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Information for real-time crop
    management is updated often, like every minute or hour. In the upcoming years,
    it is anticipated that the average data bandwidth for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems would keep expanding. The rapid development of sensors and actuators,
    as well as the rising demand for real-time crop management data, are to blame
    for this. As technology has developed, the maximum data bandwidth for IoT-based
    smart agriculture systems has increased year over year. The available data bandwidth
    for various IoT based PHRS, DHRS and POHRS applications from 2012 to 2022 is shown
    in the graph Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download : Download

    wise for various IoT based subsystems in smart agriculture. IoT technologies were
    still in their infancy between 2012 and 2014, and data storage capacity for applications
    in the IoT remained quite constrained. Data rates ranging from a few kilobyte
    per second (Kbps) to a few megabyte per second (Mbps) were accessible via wireless
    technologies including 2G and 3G cellular networks, which were widely used. The
    data bandwidth for IoT applications has increased dramatically between 2015 and
    2018 thanks to 4G LTE cellular networks technologies. Higher data speeds were
    offered by 4G networks, which typically oscillated between tens of Mbps to hundreds
    of Mbps. This made it possible to collect and analyse more data thoroughly while
    also enabling the transfer of data more quickly. Improvements to 4G networks and
    the rollout of 5G networks, which promise even more data bandwidth and lower latency,
    started in 2019 to 2021. Data rates of up to several gigabits per second (Gbps)
    are available with 5G technology. Even while 5G was not yet widely available,
    its promise for fast data transfer was becoming more and more clear. The global
    rollout of 5G networks, which are currently in development, will continue in 2022
    and 2023. This will result in enhanced data bandwidth for IoT-based smart agriculture
    applications. Although the actual data rates that can be achieved in real-world
    settings depend on network coverage and infrastructure, the data bandwidth needed
    for IoT-based smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems might vary depending on the
    implementation and the amount of data being communicated. The overall bandwidth
    needs will be influenced by elements including the volume of data gathering, the
    number of sensors placed, and the complexity of the data being conveyed. Communication
    involves a number of factors, such as the data rate, the frequency bands, the
    range, the application, and the cost. A systematic analysis of these factors has
    been conducted in Table 2 to determine which communication standards are to be
    used in PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystem. As from Table 1 and Table 2, some IoT-based
    communication technologies can also be considered in the 5G/5G beyond smart agriculture
    system. Table 2. Comparative analysis of various communication technologies used
    in smart agriculture. Communication Technologies Frequency Bands Data Rate Range

    (Yogesh Suryawanshi et al., 2022) An image collection consists of four vegetables:
    “Bell Pepper”, “Tomato”, “Chili Pepper”, and “New Mexico Chile”. The five distinct
    substructure classes in each vegetable collection are Ripe, Old, Dried, and Wounded.
    (Natnael Tilahun, 2022) This image collection was gathered from a potato farm
    in Holeta, Ethiopia to help in the detection of potato leaf disease. The aforementioned
    collection comprises two distinct varieties of photos. Both “Healthy” and “Late
    Blight” have 363 and 63 images, respectively. The potato disease issue can be
    resolved with this dataset. 8. Comprehensive shortcomings of PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS
    As discussed above in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application, some shortcomings have been addressed from the existing
    work on IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems. Individually, these gaps are identified
    according to the various farming activities. The gaps that are noticeable for
    PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS are discussed in the Table 4 from which it can be analysed
    that smart agriculture is a broad research area and the developed existing IoT-enabled
    system still has shortcomings in terms of standard protocols, inconsistencies
    in collected data, and inconsistencies of IoT devices (such as there are multiple
    temperature sensors but their data formats are different and also it is difficult
    to interface that sensor with multiple subsystem microcontroller because of the
    varying platform), difficult to integrate existing system to multiple regions
    because of the environmental factor, cost, lack of technologies enhancement of
    the system and endorsement with real-time information with external source information.
    As from sections, 2, 3, 4 and 5 it can be extrapolated that more examination needs
    to be performed to accomplish IoT-based solutions for the SSL, SGM, SDG, PDT,
    affected crop sorting, CWM, and FDP. Research can be conducted on different crop
    types location-wise. IoT data security is a significant uncertainty, so there
    is a need for scalable WSN or robust mechanisms to protect data. Table 4. In depth
    shortcomings analysis of the existing smart agriculture system based on PHRS,
    DHRS and POHRS. PHRS Problems Focused Description Inconsistency with Standards
    Security protocols, device compatibility, and firmware still need to be standardized
    for IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM, SSL, SGM, DFM, WPM, and SDG systems. Compared to
    other methods and outcomes, the existing systems are difficult to compare. Standardized
    procedures and frameworks are necessary for assessing and comparing different
    methods. Limited Data analysis IoT is dependent on the volume of data. Most of
    the time that information is not easily accessible because of non-availability
    of open source data. More trustworthy sensor data and adequate data-gathering
    techniques are required because still depended on external source data. Data should
    be location-wise, all types of data, and should be validated with real-time and
    existing data. There is need for advanced data analytics techniques to make sense
    of these vast generated data. Inadequate scalability For IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM,
    DFM, and WPM applications, there are many active research projects; nevertheless,
    there is still work to be done to scale this system for commercial applications.
    SGM, SSL and SD-based IoT-based systems require more research. This system are
    not fully automated. Inadequate knowledge Performing experiments on the crop relies
    on understanding of the crop physiology as well as a range of environmental factors,
    which is yet not fully understood. More study is needed on the physiological processes
    of various crops, as well as the effects of environmental conditions on crop growth
    and development. Inability to integrate with current agricultural systems To make
    the fully IoT-based pre-harvesting method more effective, the system can be incorporated
    with the existing agricultural systems such as smart crop recommendation system
    based on weather, location, seed selection and soil nutrients analysis, smart
    soil digging, etc. There is a lack of research in this area of integration. The
    study has to be performed to discover the potential benefits and drawbacks of
    the integration. Limited Accuracy Currently, most IoT devices lead to erroneous
    and inconsistent data, as they have limitations in terms of accuracy, reliability,
    and precision. In addition, sensor calibration is also important despite being
    complex and time-consuming and can result in inconsistent results if not done.
    Also, these devices have to place optimally to ensure correct data collection,
    which can be further used for analysis. The study has to be performed to make
    a system accurate and reliable. Cost Effective IoT-based systems can be expensive
    to install and maintain and thus can be a barrier while adopting the technique,
    especially for small-scale farmers. Although the cost of devices has decreased
    in recent years, the overall integration can still lead to a higher cost. Research
    has to be focused to investigate cost-effective solutions. Use of MCLRN approaches
    The present work has used MCLRN techniques in IoT-based systems, however due to
    the overfitting issue, the trained MCLRN model still cannot make an accurate forecast.
    DHRS Multi-technology incorporating IoT makes it possible for the system to apply
    a variety of technologies during the harvesting process. These technologies can
    be combined to create a system, but research is needed to determine the best way
    to do so. According to the study of the current work, several systems have not
    been fully incorporated. Such as SIR with SHMFM, PCN, PDT, WDT, CLO etc. System
    for Enhancing Irrigation Research must be conducted to point out the efficient
    way to irrigate the plants as compared to the traditional methods of irrigation.
    Such as irrigation system should be managed automatically on behalf of different
    of types crops. Acquiring and adopting users Existing IoT-based DHRS systems are
    still mishandled and challenging to adopt in various environments. Research must
    be performed to make a system that can be easily handled and adopted by end users
    in different environments. Soil health The DHRS process includes IoT enabled system
    for crop monitoring and SHMFM. Research must be performed to examine how SIR affects
    soil systems, microbial residents, and nutrient process for various crops. Environment''s
    impact Still, research is to be investigated based on environmental factors such
    as calibration of temperature, humidity, and rainfall during SHMFM and DDAN. Privacy
    and Security As far as the security of IoT-based DHR systems is concerned, very
    little research has been conducted. Detecting the diseases accurately Although
    IoT-based systems can provide real-time plant health data, there are still limitations
    to how precise the data is. Various factors affect accuracy and research must
    be done to monitor those factors, which can impact accuracy. Efficient Energy
    Continuous data collection is difficult in remote regions. A cost-effective, self-sustaining,
    and optimised technique should be implemented in the current IoT-based systems
    for PDT, DDAN, SHMFM, and WDT so that field monitoring data can be gathered continually.
    Analysing pest behaviour The system to detect pests accurately still needs improvement.
    As various pests respond differently in different environments. Optimization of
    Object Detection algorithms Need more research in the areas of IoT-enabled systems
    for WDT, PDT, CLO, and PCN to provide optimized solutions for accurate results.
    So system performance can be increased. POHRS Security and Privacy While most
    harvesting data must be stored properly and securely. Various IoT-based systems
    can be implemented to monitor and store the data. In this era of cyber threats,
    the system must be made in such a way to make the data properly stored, thus making
    it secure. Innovative solutions with a low cost Developing IoT enables cost-effective
    solutions in post-harvest activities is challenging based on security and privacy.
    As in POHRS, there are still some shortcomings in the existing system, which needed
    to be addressed. Such as in RSCS, SWM, and TTN there is still lacking data security,
    data storage, and low-cost automated system of fruits and vegetables monitoring.
    Research must be done to deeply understand such a situation and make a cost-efficient
    system so that it can be used by small-scale farmers also. Miniature studies In
    POHRS most of the ongoing work is focused on TTN, RSCS, and CWM but missing this
    existing system on a large scale for post-harvest phases. In the current automated
    RSCS system, the sorting technique management can be improved by including scheduling
    and weightage systems for post-harvest storage of crops during the TTN process,
    because Indian farmers have fewer low-cost smart facilities. Research can be done
    to investigate the effectiveness of the IoT system on a large scale as well. Incorporating
    multiple methods IoT system integrates different components which are somehow
    correlated to each other. Research should be carried out to determine how those
    components must be integrated as a distributed system that develops a self-sustainable
    and cost-efficient system. Availability and Reliability The IoT-based system should
    be readily available for the end users. Research should be done regarding the
    improvements in the availability of the data during TTN as well as while RSCS,
    utilizing real-time monitoring. 9. Proposed architecture for smart agriculture
    From PHRS to POHRS, a number of existing smart methodologies have been established
    for all different types of farming tasks, and they are all covered above along
    with their benefits as well as their drawbacks. By using the proposed architecture
    the limitations of the present structures can be reduced in light of the discussion
    above. A compact sensor network is made possible. Thanks to the integration of
    IoT, MCLRN, metaheuristic optimisation algorithm, AI, edge computing, cloud computing,
    SDN, cryptography for data security, UAVs, etc. Using 5G (gNB architecture) and
    5G beyond networks (Abdulghaffar et al., 2021), the recommended IoT-facilitated
    smart farming architecture is designed on the basis of IoT layered architecture
    in the Fig. 11. The sensor layer consists of different types of sensors, and data
    transmitters (“sx1276”, “nrf24l01”, etc.), cameras, high-frequency navigation
    (GPS), etc. It acts to collect and transmit facts it to the central server utilizing
    a 5G network connectivity via an edge gateway for data processing and analytics.
    The central server gives the farmers useful information using miscellaneous algorithms
    and standard procedures. These details may be on the choice of crop, seed germination,
    irrigation, soil analysis, and status, livestock status, crop diseases detection,
    crop sorting and storage, tracking, etc. The collected data are about the PHRS
    subsystem, DHRS subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. These subsystems are interconnected
    to each other to make the overall agriculture system automated. So that farmers
    can optimize their farming procedures and enhance crop yields. Under this system,
    the automated actuators can be used to enable farmers to remotely control some
    of the devices such as irrigation motors, pest control, soil digging, etc. Layer
    by layer, smart agriculture can be developed as follows: Download : Download high-res
    image (896KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Proposed 5G based Smart
    Agriculture Framework. 9.1. Perception layer In this layer, multiple sensor networks
    can be created by deploying various sensor nodes for the PHRS subsystem, DHRS
    subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. This subsystem is communicated to each other as
    machine-to-machine communication (Sakthivel and Vidhya, 2021) and connected to
    an each 5GIoT base edge gateway. The PHRS subsystem retrieves the data of various
    environmental factors, including water in the soil, fertiliser, temperature, and
    humidity, sunlight, flood and drought-related, etc, and transmits this data to
    the local IoT edge gateway for further computation and analysis. The DHRS subsystem
    consists of the sensor data of irrigation, NPK, pest controlling, weed detection,
    disease prediction, livestock, insects sound, crop field, etc. This data is also
    transmitted to a local IoT edge gateway and the same as POHRS sensor network data
    will be collected and transmitted to its IoT local edge gateway for further computing
    and analysis. This all subsystems are the backbone of the IoT sensor network.
    9.2. Network layer The entire IoT AGRI subsystem is designed based on the 5G network,
    but it can enable 5G beyond the network as needed. Essentially, a 5G core network
    is a high-level network that is made up of a radio access network and one or more
    edge networks. The 5G base stations are connected to open flow switches which
    are known as gNB switches (edge network). For traffic offloading and “quality
    of service (QoS)” implementation, SDN controllers can interface with base stations
    using the open flow protocol. The “protocol data unit (PDU) session” or “user
    plane function (UPF)” is used in the core network to connect the data network
    (DN). The SDN controller controls all gNB, UPF, and data plane switches. This
    layer is responsible for all transmissions and communications between sensors,
    IoT gateways, and cloud servers. 9.3. Cloud layer The network layer''s via SDN
    controller would transport the sensor data acquired from the perception layer
    to the cloud layer platform, where analytics would be carried out utilising tools
    like AI, MCLRN, Weka, and Hadoop, among others. Cloud platforms include “AWS”,
    “Azure”, “IBM Cloud”, etc. To handle and analyse the data gathered from the sensors,
    this cloud service offers storage and computational capabilities. The designed
    API gateway is used to manage communication between the edge gateway and the cloud
    server while utilising all authentication services. 9.4. Application layer The
    insights produced by the cloud server will be available to the end user through
    mobile applications, web applications, etc., including farmers, stack holders,
    suppliers, ranchers, purchasers, etc. So that farmers may make informed judgements,
    this programme gives them real-time information regarding the PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS. 9.5. Data storage and processing layer Depending on the particular applications
    and the volume of data collected, the data storage needs for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems can change. Numerous services, including data source, data
    processing, decision support, transmission system, authorization, storage space,
    and reliability, are offered in the data storage and processing layer. The digital
    footprint of the data collection and storing for the IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems in smart agriculture is shown in Fig. 12. Download : Download
    high-res image (611KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Data processing
    and storage footprint. Data gathering: Obtaining information from numerous agricultural
    fields (F) using a variety of sensors, including those that measure things like
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil ph, soil NPK, air pressure, RFID, rodents,
    insects, and other animals, as well as things like plant color recognition, rainfall,
    disease detection, and recognization through cameras, storage and cooling control
    of harvested vegetables or fruits, transportation and tracking, water flow measurement,
    level, and pump control. This sensor and actuator data is sent to the server for
    analysis and decision-making for the farm fields, or real-time monitoring. Depending
    on the sensor type and frequency, a single sensor node may generate data on average
    in the range of KB to a megabyte (MB) each day. The expected data storage, for
    instance, can range from GB to terabytes (TB) per year if there is a vast farming
    area with numerous sensors. In addition, image and video data are gathered from
    drones to monitor crop health, pest detection, weed detection, and crop yield.
    This data contains high-definition images of farms in 5 to 100 MB sizes. It is
    possible to estimate total storage capacity by estimating the frequency of capturing
    such imaginary data. The sensor data for CYP, CSL, SGM, STM, SDG, SIR, RSCS, CWM,
    DDAN, PDT, CLO, WDT, SHMFM TTN, and FDP systems as well as scheduling irrigation,
    measuring insect control effectiveness, managing livestock, keeping track of crop
    yields, and managing agribusiness depend on the overall dimension of the farm,
    the variety of crops grown there, and the amount of detail that can be gathered.
    For each crop every year, this data size can be in the KB to MB range. However,
    WPM generates climate-related data that can be recorded for historical research
    and transmitted in KB each hour or day. Data pre-processing: In the pre-processing,
    the gathered data are prepared for further analysis. Which is used to fill in
    the missing data, remove the redundant data, format the data into its size, type,
    and classes, and normalize the data to make data more reliable and knowledgeable.
    Data repository: The local storage server, which may be a NoSql, time-series,
    or relational database, stores all pre-process data. It is quite difficult to
    make the data more trustworthy and long-lasting because the database storage can
    come from a variety of sources of different types and sizes. The data is cleaned
    using a variety of pre-processing techniques throughout the pre-process. There
    are different, specialised cleaning techniques for text and picture data, such
    as stemming and lemmatization, as well as image geometric conversions, image filtering,
    segmentation, Fourier transform, and image restoration, among others. Data from
    both the past and the present is kept in the storage repository. In the edge computing
    layer, data transmission management is carried out between this data processing
    layer. The interval between acquisition and utilisation might vary extensively,
    ranging from a couple of seconds, minutes, or hours to a few weeks, or possibly
    a full year in extreme circumstances. Therefore, several transmission techniques
    can be used for quick and secure long-distance transmission via wired or wireless
    means. High-speed data connection, such as a 5G communication network, is also
    necessary. Various data flow control techniques, including stop and wait, feedback
    control, sliding windows, two-directional communications, etc., will be used to
    manage the data communication traffic between these two communications. Throughout
    all of these steps, data analyses are carried out utilising different MCLRN and
    AI algorithms to send actions and notifications to the user''s cloud server. A
    suggested approach for smart farming system data footprint is developed based
    on smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS existing work deficiencies using a 5G data communication
    network. For the storage of this PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the maximum
    average data volume analysis is shown as a graph in Fig. 13. The regular data
    volume analysis is estimated in Fig. 13 as a graph based on the communication
    technologies range, periodicity of the sensor devices, camera resolution, data
    bandwidth, etc. Using different types of agricultural activity properties, this
    average data volume utilisation analysis over the past 30 days has been calculated.
    The analysis of the 30-day total average data volume was calculated at 1.38856
    GB. Depending on the particular PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the data transfer
    frequency changes. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Estimated digital footprint for one month of proposed
    PHRS,DHRS and POHRS Systems. For instance, a system used to track soil temperature
    and nutrient content might release information once each hour or day. Meanwhile,
    a different system will deliver data every minute for crop growth assessment.
    As more smart sensors are deployed and technology is developed, the amount of
    data conveyed for different crops in soil and crop growth monitoring will expand
    in the future. Aspects that can increase the volume of data include the number
    of sensors used, the type of data (image, text, or numerical), frequency, distance,
    time, cost of data transmission, size of the farmed area, crop type, climate,
    irrigation method, soil type, disease type, etc. 10. Comparative analysis of existing
    smart agriculture system with proposed 5G based architecture For the recommendation
    of a 5G-based smart agriculture framework, some of the existing available research
    surveys have already (Liu et al., 2023) been carried out, in which the major technologies
    and technological barriers preventing the advancement and development of smart
    agriculture applications leveraging 5G technologies are described. The resultant
    effect of 5G on the IoT for smart agriculture is outlined. An exploration of precision
    agricultural (Majumdar et al., 2023) applications has been explored using green
    IoT-based solutions, utilizing UAVs, LPWANs, and 5G networks as well as an assortment
    of technical issues. Utilizing 5G networks and beyond, the long-lasting expansion
    of digital farming through the incorporation of green IoT technology enables the
    IoT greener. The proposed architecture above has been recommended by incorporating
    each multiple-edge gateway grid with the central controller for all small and
    large farming area data based on the existing 5G-based smart agriculture architecture.
    The advantages of using this agriculture system over existing IoT-based agriculture
    systems include the immediately apparent advancement across multiple agriculture
    applications, centralised archives of data, estimation process power, etc. Existing
    smart agriculture exhibits challenging obstacles and demands to handle high volume
    data storing processes, computation power, and managing various agriculture applications
    of small and large farming areas. Therefore, in this instance, data computation,
    interpreting, and other capabilities can be offered close to the network''s edge,
    where initially the data are originated. Edge computing power has benefits such
    as decreased latency, bandwidth savings, reduced downtime, increased trustworthiness,
    improved privacy and security, etc. The proposed IoT-based architecture allows
    for the best provisioning of resources using SDN, network segmentation, route
    optimisation, load balancing, and other practises. A evaluation of current smart
    farm systems with the proposed IoT architecture is shown in Table 5 below based
    on the various parameter. Some of the characteristics are identical in the proposed
    5G-based smart agriculture architecture and the existing smart agriculture architecture.
    The comparison has been verified based on this characteristic. Table 5. Advantages
    of the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system with existing smart agriculture
    system. Comparative parameter (Udutalapally et al., 2021) (Liu et al., 2023) Proposed
    5G based IoT agriculture architecture system Bandwidth Low Bandwidth Fast bandwidth
    with single edge network Fast bandwidth with single and multiple edge network
    with LPWAN communication Latency High latency rate and risk of data loss during
    cloud transmission. Delay time will be increased for large farming area. Delay
    time is reduced as of using multiple edge gateway. Interruption Interruption rate
    are high Interruption rate can be high if switching to 5G beyond network or multiple
    edge network. Interruption are reduced because authenticated edge connection for
    small and large farming field WSN and can be customized based on the network.
    Data storage Limited storage capacity and complicated database management because
    of limited globalization. High storage capacity at the cloud end, as the architecture
    is for small farming area. Capable of managing databases at the edge network and
    storage capacity will be maximum as using distributed system. Energy efficient
    Requires a lot of energy for calculation and processing while transmitting various
    types of data at long distances. More energy required as system is not fully distributed.
    Less energy consumption as system is distributed. Minimises the necessity for
    transmission of data over long distances. Real time decision Real-time decision-making
    can be accomplished although has a larger latency, which restricts its effectiveness
    for circumstances where timeliness is essential. Real time decision possible but
    lack in independency at each edge network. Increase productivity and yield by
    enabling real-time decision-making with exposure to the constantly changing conditions
    on the farm. PHRS Subsystems Integration of PHRS sub systems is possible with
    other farming sub system but need much enhancement, as limited range of network
    connections and no such algorithm for intelligent decision making at the edge
    level. Since PHRS module data differ from farm to farm, there are chances of data
    overload at the edge network level because there are no such discussions on NP-hard
    problem optimization strategies. Using of metaheuristic-based algorithms it is
    possible to increase the efficiency of PHRS, sub-systems in 5G-based or beyond
    networks. DHRS Subsystems Integration of DHRS sub-systems is limited as it provides
    a huge volume of image and video-type data. Integration of the DHRS subsystem
    is achievable as discussed about the UAVs-based system for various image vision
    problems. Integration of DHRS with PHRS subsystem is achievable using NB-IoT M2M
    communication. POHRS Subsystems Integration of POHRS subsystem is limited. POHRS
    subsystem integration for supply chain management. Management of POHRS subsystems
    for TTN, FDP, cooling, harvesting, and farmers'' inventory. Security and privacy
    Device security, data authentication, network slicing, and encryption still need
    to be improved. There is no analogous method discussed for recognising security
    ambiguity while deploying IoT devices for securing inconsistent energy-efficient
    communication devices for considerable distance and durability. The system becomes
    more efficient and capable with the help of 5G, SDN, and distributed edge computing
    structures and is able to oversee massive amounts of network traffic and data
    authentication. As a result of the discussion in Table 5 above, it can be concluded
    that creating the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system using edge computing
    could effortlessly extend to meet the increasing necessities of modern farming.
    The entire structure can be customized by how the agricultural operation grows
    and network changes or whether its operations require more sensors and devices.

    surveys information. Table 6. Comparative analysis of proposed survey from existing

    the gap in existing reviews for IoT-based smart agriculture by classifying pre-
    and post-harvest activities into PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Based on this
    categorization, various existing work has been discussed in detail with an analysis
    of the IoT communication technologies and metaheuristic approach used in the IoT
    based smart agriculture system. As a result of the discussion of the problem in
    existing work, the 5G and 5G beyond smart agriculture system architecture are
    being prepared. With this recommended framework, the shortcomings of the existing
    work can be reduced, and the system can be optimized. 11. Conclusion IoT-based
    smart agriculture is the advancement of the digital transformation of various
    traditional farming subactivities. In this a comprehensive review by categorizing
    the farming subactivities based on the Pre, During, and Post harvests of the smart
    agriculture-based existing application has been discussed in detail. We have also
    observed the research gaps for each and every activity separately. Based on these
    research gaps it has been analyzed that developing an intelligent farming system
    is still a challenging process. We have tried to address these challenges and
    enhance the performance of the existing systems by proposing a 5G-based hybrid
    framework for smart agriculture. The outcome of the proposed survey is validated
    by comparison with the existing survey papers. It is found that various existing
    surveys have not been represented considering the smart agriculture applications
    according to the Pre, During, and Post harvesting phases. Therefore, our survey
    methodology and outcome seem to outperform the other surveys conducted so far
    for smart agriculture. In future work the technology wise survey for the different
    aspects of smart agriculture may be conducted. For example, we can have a comprehensive
    survey on the use of Machine learning algorithms for each activity of smart agriculture.
    Also crop wise comprehensive survey can be conducted involving all the pre, during
    and post-harvest activities. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

  description: 'This study evaluated the efficacy of two heat stress mitigation techniques,
    i.e., modified evaporative cooling (EC), and drape/shade net (SN) against untreated
    control (UC) in terms of fruit surface temperature (FST) suppression and internal
    fruit quality for cv. WA 38. The EC treatment used foggers (flow rate: 4.1 L s−1
    ha−1) spaced at 3.3 m along the row to create mist within the canopy. The experiment
    was conducted in a 0.2 acre block planted on two randomly distributed rootstocks
    [Geneva 41 (G41) and Malling 9-Nic 29 (M9)], trained in a bi-axis vertical wall
    architecture. Treatments were divided into three sub-blocks. Alternate wet and
    dry zones were observed in the sub-block treated with fogger-based EC and was
    therefore subdivided into EC-Wet and EC-Dry treatments. The proximal thermal-RGB
    imaging and in-field weather sensing integrated crop physiology sensing system
    (CPS2.0) was upgraded with edge computing capability to monitor real-time apple
    FST, an indicator of heat stress. Deployed nodes monitored imagery and weather
    data based FST in each treatment at an interval of 5-min throughout the growing
    season (i.e., during fruit maturation). Aerial imagery-based canopy temperature
    mapping with ground sampling distance of 4 cm/pixel was also utilized to monitor
    the canopy heat stress at key growth stages. CPS2.0 imagery derived apple FST
    was effectively reduced by EC-Wet (G41: 27.1 ± 0.4 and M9: 28.8 ± 0.4 °C) (mean
    ± std. error) and SN (G41: 29.8 ± 0.2 and M9: 30.5 ± 0.1 °C) treatments compared
    to the UC (G41: 33.1 ± 0.2 and M9: 31.4 ± 0.4 °C) throughout the production season.
    However, convective cooling from EC-Dry (G41: 33.1 ± 0.2 and M9: 32.5 ± 0.2 °C)
    treatment failed to mitigate heat stress. Results suggest that fogger spacing,
    and orientation need adjustments along tree-rows for effective sunburn management.
    Overall, canopy temperature quantified by aerial imagery was significantly lower
    under modified EC (30.3 ± 1.3 °C) than UC (34.2 ± 1.3 °C) treatment. Compared
    to UC, EC-Wet and SN protection enhanced fruit quality with higher or similar
    crop load, fruit firmness, and quality.'

    • Aerial thermal-RGB imaging was conducted to map canopy level heat-stress. •
    Modified evaporative cooling (EC) and shade net (SN) treatments were evaluated.
    • Fruit qualities were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of sunburn management
    treatments. • SN and wet EC effectively reduced the fruit surface temperature
    and improved the fruit quality. Abstract This study evaluated the efficacy of
    two heat stress mitigation techniques, i.e., modified evaporative cooling (EC),
    and drape/shade net (SN) against untreated control (UC) in terms of fruit surface
    temperature (FST) suppression and internal fruit quality for cv. WA 38. The EC
    treatment used foggers (flow rate: 4.1 L s−1 ha−1) spaced at 3.3 m along the row
    to create mist within the canopy. The experiment was conducted in a 0.2 acre block
    planted on two randomly distributed rootstocks [Geneva 41 (G41) and Malling 9-Nic
    29 (M9)], trained in a bi-axis vertical wall architecture. Treatments were divided
    into three sub-blocks. Alternate wet and dry zones were observed in the sub-block
    treated with fogger-based EC and was therefore subdivided into EC-Wet and EC-Dry
    treatments. The proximal thermal-RGB imaging and in-field weather sensing integrated
    crop physiology sensing system (CPS2.0) was upgraded with edge computing capability
    to monitor real-time apple FST, an indicator of heat stress. Deployed nodes monitored
    imagery and weather data based FST in each treatment at an interval of 5-min throughout
    the growing season (i.e., during fruit maturation). Aerial imagery-based canopy
    temperature mapping with ground sampling distance of 4 cm/pixel was also utilized
    to monitor the canopy heat stress at key growth stages. CPS2.0 imagery derived
    apple FST was effectively reduced by EC-Wet (G41: 27.1 ± 0.4 and M9: 28.8 ± 0.4
    °C) (mean ± std. error) and SN (G41: 29.8 ± 0.2 and M9: 30.5 ± 0.1 °C) treatments
    compared to the UC (G41: 33.1 ± 0.2 and M9: 31.4 ± 0.4 °C) throughout the production
    season. However, convective cooling from EC-Dry (G41: 33.1 ± 0.2 and M9: 32.5
    ± 0.2 °C) treatment failed to mitigate heat stress. Results suggest that fogger
    spacing, and orientation need adjustments along tree-rows for effective sunburn
    management. Overall, canopy temperature quantified by aerial imagery was significantly
    lower under modified EC (30.3 ± 1.3 °C) than UC (34.2 ± 1.3 °C) treatment. Compared
    to UC, EC-Wet and SN protection enhanced fruit quality with higher or similar
    crop load, fruit firmness, and quality. Previous article in issue Next article

    quality is significantly influenced by the abiotic stress during ripening. Washington
    state, the largest producer of apples in the United States, contributes to about
    69 % of total fresh market production (USDA, 2019) and 33 % to the state’s agricultural
    economy (WSDA, 2019). However, growers lose 10–40 % of their produce due to abiotic
    heat and/or light stress that results in necrosis, browning, or photo-oxidative
    sunburn defect in the fruit at maturation (Yuri et al., 1996, Schrader et al.,
    2006; Rasco and Schrader, 2012; Good Fruit Grower, 2015, Schmidt, 2018). Sunburn
    is caused by the combination of intense solar heat and light that may damage the
    external skin and adversely affect the appearance, internal quality (soluble solids,
    firmness, titratable acidity, and water content, etc.) (Racskó, 2010), and yield.
    Sunburn susceptibility has further aggravated in modern high-density apple orchard
    systems due to augmented exposure to solar radiation (Parchomchuk and Meheriuk,
    1996, Middleton et al., 2002, Morales-Quintana et al., 2020). The cultivar, rootstock
    selection, orchard location, row direction, and plant density have been identified
    as the key factors that affect sunburn susceptibility in apples (Racskó et al.,
    2005). Sunburn necrosis is the most instantly visible and lethal sunburn type,
    caused by intense solar heat that increases the fruit surface temperature (FST)
    beyond a tolerance limit. Necrosis permanently damages the epidermal and sub-epidermal
    tissues, leaving a black or dark brown spot on the exposed surface. Typically,
    necrosis occurs when the apple FST reaches ∼ 52 °C and retains that temperature
    for 10 min (Schrader et al., 2001, 2006). Unlike necrosis, sunburn browning occurs
    at a relatively lower FST (∼46 °C) and exposure time of 60 min (Schrader et al.,
    2003, Racsko and Schrader, 2012). Browning of fruit (Schrader et al., 2003, Makeredza,
    2011) is a combined effect of heat and ultraviolet (UV) light that decreases the
    anthocyanin and chlorophyll concentration and increases the quercetin glycosides
    and carotenoids concentration in the fruit peel (Felicetti and Schrader, 2009a,
    Felicetti and Schrader, 2009b). Photo-oxidative sunburn is another type that can
    trigger at moderate FST (∼30 °C) due to sudden exposure of the shaded fruit to
    the photo-synthetically active radiation (Felicetti and Schrader, 2008). This
    results in bleaching of the exposed surface leaving a white spot on the fruit.
    Typically, shade/drape net [hereafter termed as ‘shade net (SN)’], protectant
    sprays, and evaporative cooling (EC) is adopted by the grower to manage sunburn.
    These practices alter the canopy and fruit microclimate to alleviate the adverse
    effects of heat and light stressors. SN is a well-adapted mitigation technique
    in high-value apple cultivars that scatters and diffuses the solar radiation to
    minimize FST and subsequent lethal effects (Gindaba and Wand, 2005, Gindaba and
    Wand, 2008, Iglesias and Alegre, 2006). The SN color and density can further affect
    the light attenuation potential (Tanny and Cohen, 2003, Elad et al., 2007). Improper
    net selection can thus result in deficient red and blush coloring of the fruit
    and impairment in vegetative growth, canopy vigor, and crop load (Solomakhin and
    Blanke, 2007, Solomakhin and Blanke, 2009, Blanke, 2009). The high installation
    and maintenance cost of SN may further increase the production cost and narrow
    the profit margins (Dussi et al., 2005). Spray application of the calcium-based
    material on canopy and fruits is also common for sunburn management (Schrader
    et al., 2001, Makeredza, 2011). The reflectance material acts as a protective
    film that minimizes direct fruit exposure to solar radiation. However, such coating
    may affect the fruit appearance and increase the costs of residue removal (Erez
    and Glenn, 2004). EC is one of the widely adopted management techniques to mitigate
    high FST-instigated sunburn (i.e., necrosis and browning) through overhead water
    application (Evans et al., 1995, Schrader et al., 2003, Gindaba and Wand, 2005,
    2008). Surplus energy in the fruit mass is utilized to evaporate water that assists
    in maintaining the FST below the critical limits (Evans et al., 1995). Despite
    effective heat removal, EC fails to reduce the effect of UV irradiance and may
    not be adequate to control sunburn browning under agroclimatic zones experiencing
    high solar radiation (Quickenden and Irvin, 1980, Racsko and Schrader, 2012).
    Besides heat stress, EC system design (emitter type, flow rate, droplet size)
    and operations (cycle frequency) are also critical for sunburn protection (Evans
    and Engineer, 1999). A conventional EC system equipped with high-flow overhead
    nozzles [6.2–7.8 L s−1 ha−1 for continuous and 9.4–10.9 L s−1 ha−1 for cyclic
    spraying] often causes under or over application of water (Evans and Engineer,
    1999, Ranjan et al., 2020a). Under-application may result in inadequate sunburn
    control while over-application may lead to excess watering leading to crop disorders
    and diseases (e.g., blister spot, bitter pit, scab, among others), agrochemical
    leaching, and associated groundwater contamination (Evans and Engineer, 1999).
    Moreover, limited water availability for irrigation and cooling during the peak
    summer season (Evans, 2004) limits the suitability of high-flow nozzles for EC.
    Alternatively, a micro-sprinkler system, that produces very fine droplets (fog/mist),
    can potentially be used for evaporative/convective cooling to efficiently manage
    sunburn. The duration and frequency of EC are critical for efficient sunburn management.
    Such decisions are taken based on the ambient temperature (Shi et al., 2020, Wang
    et al., 2020) irrespective of solar radiation, wind speed, and dew point temperature
    (Li et al., 2014). These weather parameters substantially affect the heat transfer
    between fruit and atmosphere and hence the FST. Ranjan et al., (2020a) developed
    a crop physiology sensing (CPS) system that utilizes proximal thermal-RGB imaging
    and in-field weather data inputs to evaluate apple FST in real-time. Such information
    could better help to regulate EC frequency and duration for efficient sunburn
    management. However, CPS unit was a standalone device that was limited to monitoring
    only the sunburn susceptibility. Adding an Internet of Things (IoT) capability
    to CPS for real-time data acquisition, visualization, sharing, and cloud computing
    potential could enhance the applicability of CPS for precise sunburn management
    decisions. Further improvements to edge computation potential of the system could
    enable data processing near the source to reduce the network stress (i.e., latency)
    associated with central cloud computing (Shahzadi et al., 2017). Integrating IoT
    and edge computing capability to the existing CPS unit and modification of conventional
    EC system is therefore hypothesized to achieve water and energy-efficient sunburn
    management, and improved fruit quality. In line with the above background discussion,
    this study was conducted with the following specific objectives: 1. Evaluate the
    efficacies of modified evaporative cooling and shade net protection type heat
    stress mitigation techniques through season-long fruit surface temperature monitoring
    of WA 38 apple cultivar using upgraded crop physiology sensing system. This in-field
    localized evaluation was supplemented with periodic aerial thermal-RGB imaging.
    2. Develop a scientific understanding of the performance of stress mitigation
    techniques on postharvest fruit quality. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Proximal
    sunburn monitoring Advanced crop physiology sensing system (hereafter termed as
    ‘CPS2.0’) nodes were deployed in the orchard for real-time apple FST monitoring.
    CPS2.0 (Fig. 1) consists of four major components, i.e., i) Sensing device, ii)
    Edge computing unit, iii) Integration accessories, and iv) Networking device.

    Fig. 1. Internet of Things-enabled CPS2.0 for imagery and weather data acquisition,
    data compute on-board edge devices, real-time fruit surface temperature visualization,
    and data communication with guest computers, control devices and cloud. 2.1.1.
    Sensing device The sensing device comprises a thermal-RGB imaging sensor (Duo
    R, FLIR Systems, Inc., Wilsonville, OR, USA) and an all-in-one weather sensor
    (ATMOS 41, METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). The imaging sensor synchronously
    acquires radiometric thermal image (temperature range: 0–50 °C, accuracy: ±5%,
    resolution: 160 × 120 pixels, emissivity: 0.95) and a red–green–blue (RGB) image
    (resolution: 1920 × 1080 pixels). Weather sensor acquires 12 parameters including
    air temperature (accuracy: ±0.6 °C, resolution: 0.1 °C), dew point temperature
    (accuracy: ±1 °C, resolution: 0.1 °C), solar radiation (accuracy: ±5%, resolution:
    1 W m−2), and wind speed (accuracy: ±3%, resolution: 0.01 m/s). The edge computing
    unit was programmed to trigger thermal-RGB imaging sensor using pulse width modulation
    and weather sensor using serial-digital-interface (SDI–12) communication protocols.
    2.1.2. Edge computing unit This unit comprises of an IoT enabled single board
    computer (Raspberry Pi 4B, Raspberry Pi foundation, Cambridge, UK) with 1.5 GHz
    quad core processor (64-bit ARM-Cortex A72). The general-purpose input/output
    (GPIO) interface on the computer was utilized to communicate with the thermal-RGB
    imaging sensor. A microcontroller (ATmega328 RedBoard, SparkFun Electronics, Niwot,
    CO, USA) was integrated with the single board computer through a 10-pin mini universal
    serial bus (USB). The microcontroller was programmed in integrated development
    environment (IDE) of Arduino with SDI–12 library to acquire data from the weather
    sensor and parse it to the single board computer for further processing. Acquired
    thermal-RGB images and weather data were processed on-board the computing unit
    to estimate apple FST. 2.1.3. Integration accessories The imaging sensor, computing
    unit, and cables/internal wires were accommodated in a custom designed (software:
    Tinkercad, Autodesk, Inc., Mill Valley, CA, USA) and 3D printed enclosure (printer:
    Ultimaker S3, Dynamism, Chicago, IL, USA). This enclosure also consists of a voltage
    regulator (12–5 V DC) to power the CPS2.0 with an external 12 V DC battery via
    a push-fit type female jack connector [5.5 mm (O) × 2.5 mm (I)] for prolonged
    and uninterrupted operation. Since CPS2.0 was designed for outdoor and extreme
    heat conditions, a cooling fan was also embedded inside the enclosure to dissipate
    excess heat from processing units to avoid overheating-associated system failure.
    2.1.4. Networking device A cellular router (Diolink, network: 4G LTE, China) was
    used as networking device to enable IoT capability of CPS2.0. A subscriber identification
    module (SIM) was inserted in the router to create a local Wireless Fidelity (WiFi)
    grid for connectivity to all the CPS2.0 nodes. The web-connected nodes were remotely
    accessed and controlled by a guest computer and processed data were sent to the
    cloud server using Cloud Backup TeamViewer services (TeamViewer AG, Göppingen,
    Germany). 2.2. Aerial sunburn monitoring While proximal in-field sensing facilitates
    continuous fruit level heat stress monitoring, high-resolution spatiotemporal
    aerial thermal imaging could be useful for orchard or block-level monitoring (Wang
    et al., 2003, Jones et al., 2009, Sankaran et al., 2015, Ranjan et al., 2019,
    Ranjan et al., 2022, Chandel et al., 2020, Chandel et al., 2021). A small unmanned
    aerial system (UAS) (AgBOT, Aerial Technology International, Wilsonville, OR,
    USA) with a thermal infrared–visible imaging sensor on-board (Duo Pro R, FLIR
    Systems, Inc., Wilsonville, OR, USA; detector: uncooled microbolometer) was deployed
    for aerial canopy temperature mapping. The sensor synchronously acquires radiometric
    thermal (measurement range: −25–135 °C; thermal resolution: 336 × 256 pixels;
    Thermal sensitivity = 50 mK; emissivity = 0.95) and RGB (visible resolution: 4000
    × 3000 pixels) images. A ground control software (version 1.3.49, MissionPlanner,
    Ardupilot, open source) was used to configure the flight altitude of 30 m above
    the ground level (AGL) to obtain images at 4 cm/pixel spatial resolution. Three
    aerial imaging campaigns were conducted over the experimental block on 41, 36,
    and 34 days before harvest, between 2 and 3 PM local time (PST). Thermal-RGB images
    were acquired at a frequency of 0.5 Hz to ensure overlap of ∼ 90 % between subsequent
    images. The treatment blocks were marked on-ground with aluminum boards in the
    inter-tree-row region for their easy identification in the aerial ortho-maps.
    Captured images were stored in the sensor on-board memory card in the “RJPEG”
    format. 2.3. Field trials 2.3.1. Experimental site The field trials were conducted
    in an apple orchard (cv. WA 38, area = 0.3 ha), located at the Washington State
    University experimental orchard, Roza Farm (46.29° N, 119.73° W), Prosser, WA.
    Trees grafted on ‘Malling 9 selection NIC 29 (M9)’ and ‘Geneva 41 (G41)’ rootstock
    were planted in 2013. Trees were trained in a modern vertical wall with two leaders
    per tree as bi-axis architecture (orchard density: 4284 tree ha−1, row spacing:
    3.0 m, tree spacing: 0.8 m, mean tree height: 3.0 m). Three rows of the orchard
    block (0.07 ha, 210 trees) were selected for this experiment during the 2020 season.
    Under tree, surface drip irrigation was applied to the trees for six hours, twice
    a week. 2.3.2. Sunburn management treatments The selected block was longitudinally
    divided into three parts for modified EC, SN, and UC treatments (Fig. 2). To realize
    modified EC, the high-flow nozzles associated with the conventional system were
    replaced with low-flow foggers (Jain Irrigation Inc., Fresno, CA, USA; flow rate:
    3.4 L h−1; Nominal pressure: 400 kPa). Such foggers create an in-canopy water
    mist to cool the microclimate and canopy through convection and evaporation. Alternatively,
    if mist interacts with the canopy and creates water run-off, conduction could
    be another mode of heat transfer. A polyethylene tubing (ϕ = 1.27 cm) was installed
    atop the canopy at a height of 3 m AGL. A pair of foggers were mounted on a two-way
    tee assembly and installed on the polyethylene tubing parallel to the row at a
    linear spacing of 3.3 m to achieve an application rate of 1.9 L s−1 ha−1. The
    modified EC system was integrated with an irrigation outlet pressurized at 275
    kPa. A digital irrigation controller (Tacklife, Aukey Technology Co, Ltd, Shenzhen,
    China) was installed at the hose inlet and was programmed to automate the EC schedules
    between 12 and 6 pm. Download : Download high-res image (321KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Experimental block with modified evaporative cooling (EC),
    shade net, and untreated control treatments [alternate turquoise and grey patch
    in the inset indicates EC-Wet and EC-Dry within modified EC treatment; orange
    dotted box represents sub-blocks with G41 rootstock; red solid line depicts sub-blocks
    with M9 rootstock; white box represents a buffer of 7.5 m provided to minimize
    the inter treatment-interactions]. An alternate wet and dry zone was observed
    along the canopy during modified EC operations. This was due to the limited wetted
    span of the two-way fogger. Trees in the proximity of the foggers were saturated
    with water (i.e., wet zone) and cooled through combined evaporative (i.e., evaporation
    of accumulated water) and convective (i.e., cooler ambient) heat transfers. Unlike
    wet zones, trees farther from foggers did not receive direct water (i.e., dry
    zone) and cooling probably only took place through convection. To investigate
    the effects of combined evaporative and convective cooling, and standalone convective
    cooling, the sub-block under modified EC treatment was divided into EC-Wet and
    EC-Dry zones (Fig. 2). Tree canopies under SN treatment were covered with sunshade
    drape netting (screening factor: 12 %, type: monofilament, color: white) while
    those under UC did not receive any mitigation treatment. 2.3.3. Data collection
    One CPS2.0 node was deployed in each treatment to monitor FST between 12 and 6
    pm on sunny (noon solar intensity > 600 W m−2) and warm (ambient temperature >
    30 °C) days of the growing season. Out of the twelve high sunburn susceptibility
    days, the first six days of data was collected in G41 rootstock block. Nodes were
    then transferred to the M9 rootstock blocks for data collection during the remaining
    six days. The sensing unit was installed on a customized T-slot aluminum extrusion
    frame (size: 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) (Fig. 3a–c) at a height of 3 m and 0.7 m offset
    from the canopy center. The node was oriented at 45° downward of the horizontal
    plane to maintain an imaging distance of ∼ 1 m from the fruits in the field of
    view. Two all-in-one weather sensors were also installed in the UC block at a
    height of 1.5 and 4.5 m AGL and connected to the CPS2.0 unit to log the in-field
    weather data within and above the canopy, respectively (Fig. 3c). Installed nodes
    were secured in a way that imagery sensor faces east so that FST of the high solar
    intensity receiving side (i.e., west) of the canopy can be monitored during the
    afternoon. The node was programmed to acquire imagery and weather data at intervals
    of 5 and 1 min respectively, followed by on-board processing and FST estimation.
    The field deployed CPS2.0 nodes were controlled, and data was transmitted as discussed
    in section 2.1 (Fig. 3d–e). At maturity (Washington starch scale: 4–5; Hanrahan
    and Schuhmann, 2018), total 32 replicates trees (2 rootstock × 4 treatment/rootstock
    × 4 replicate trees/treatment) were randomly selected and harvested zone-wise
    (top [2.2–3.0 m AGL], mid [1.4–2.2 m AGL], and bottom [0.6–1.4 m AGL]) for post-harvest
    fruit quality analysis. Harvested fruits were stored for 30 days in a controlled
    environment [temperature = 0.5 °C, CO2: 1 % (v/v), O2: 2 % (v/v)] prior to quality
    analysis. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    2.4. Fruit surface temperature 2.4.1. Imagery-based Acquired imagery were analyzed
    in the ‘OpenCV-Python’ (open source) on-board the edge computing unit of CPS2.0
    node to estimate FST (Ranjan et al., 2020a). Arithmetic operations were performed
    on the resultant temperature matrix (Fig. 4) to extract mean pixel temperature
    (hereafter termed as ‘mean FST’ or ‘Ti’), maximum pixel temperature (hereafter
    termed as ‘maximum FST’ or ‘Tmax’) and mean FST of 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % hottest
    pixels (hereafter termed as ‘T10′. ‘T15′. ‘T20′, respectively). The detailed FST
    algorithm workflow can be referred from Ranjan et al., (2020a). Download : Download

    An apple FST prediction model developed by Li et al., (2014) was used to derive
    weather-based FST. This model uses crop [fruit emissivity (ɛ), albedo constant
    (a), fruit size (d), shading ratio (r)] and weather [solar radiation (W m−2),
    air temperature (°C), dew point temperature (°C), and wind speed (m s−1)] parameters
    for FST estimation. The standard values of crop parameters [ɛ = 0.95, a = 0.3,
    d = 0.08 m, r = 0.5] (Ranjan et al., 2020a) were used in this study. The weather
    inputs were obtained from sensors installed within and above canopy to estimate
    FST (hereafter termed as ‘Twwc’ and ‘Twac’, respectively). 2.5. Canopy temperature
    Small UAS-acquired radiometric raw images were extracted and then stitched using
    a series of image stitching operations in a photogrammetric and mapping software
    platform (Software: Pix4D mapper, Pix4D, Inc., Lausanne, Switzerland). The stitched
    and geotagged temperature orthomosaic was then exported to QGIS (version 2.18.16,
    open source) to extract the canopy temperature profiles of the treatment blocks.
    The regions of interest (ROI, Size: 1.5 m × 12 m) were drawn over the treatment
    blocks in a polygon shapefile layer and clipped using “raster clipper tool”. The
    mean, median and standard deviation of the canopy temperatures in ROIs were extracted
    using the “Zonal Statistics” toolbox and were exported into “*.xls” format for
    further analysis. 2.6. Fruit quality analysis 30 days after the harvesting, 480
    fruits (4 treatment × 2 rootstock/treatment × 4 replicate trees/rootstock × 3
    zone/replicate tree × 5 fruits/zone) were randomly selected to assess critical
    fruit quality parameters: weight (g), firmness (kg), soluble solid content (SSC,
    °Brix), and titratable acidity [TA, % (w/v)]. An automated penetrometer and texture
    analyzer (MDT-2, MOHR Test and Measurement LLC, Richland, WA, USA; load cell sensitivity:
    6.8 g; range: 0–30 kg; Data acquisition rate: 5 kHz) was used to obtain the fruit
    firmness (Fig. 5b). Fruit skin was peeled at two opposite sides between stem-end
    and calyx-end and fruit was placed on the load cell attached to the penetrometer
    to log the fruit weight (Fig. 5a). Post-weighing, the peeled face of the fruit
    was aligned below the penetrometer probe (ϕ = 11 mm) to allow puncturing of the
    fruit. A similar process was repeated for the peeled surface on the other side.
    The penetrometer also outputs the fruit quality factor (QF) as a function of maximum
    force, average firmness, creep and crisp information (Mohr, 2006). QF ranges from
    0 to 100 %, where 0 % represents inferior whereas 100 % represents best fruit
    quality. The firmness and QF data were automatically logged in the internal memory
    of the penetrometer and was retrieved on a computer. Juice accumulated at the
    penetrometer platform during firmness trials was utilized to access the SSC. Two
    drops of the juice were poured on the optical prism of a digital refractometer
    (HI 96811, Woonsocket, Rhode Island, USA; accuracy = ± 0.2 °Brix; measurement
    range: 0–50 °Brix) (Fig. 5c) to evaluate the SSC, an indicator of sugar content.
    Lastly, punctured fruits were sliced and processed in a juicer to extract juice
    for TA analysis (Fig. 5d). About 5 ml of juice was fed into an automated titrator
    (815 Robotic USB Sample Processor XL, Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland) to evaluate
    the TA (%) of juice samples. Download : Download high-res image (506KB) Download

    quality data for two rootstocks (i.e., G41 and M9) were separately analyzed in
    R Studio (2017, version: 3.4.1). The data followed normal distribution on preliminary
    normality tests. The imagery-based FST data were analyzed using 5 × 4 factorial
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) with FST type (Ti, Tmax, T10, T15, and T20) and treatment
    (EC-Wet, EC-Dry, SN, and UC) as fixed factors. Post ANOVA, a Tukey Honest Significant
    Difference (HSD) post-hoc test was performed for multiple comparison of imagery
    based FSTs. Separate ANOVA model was run to compare imagery and weather-based
    FSTs (Twwc, and Twac) for the blocks under UC treatment. Aerial imagery derived
    canopy temperature data was analyzed using 3 × 3 factorial ANOVA with treatment
    (EC, SN, and UC) and imaging date (41, 36, and 34 days before the harvest) as
    fixed factor. Furthermore, an ANOVA model was run to analyze fruit quality with
    crop load (i.e., number of fruits per tree), fruit firmness, SSC, TA, and QF as
    response variables. Pertaining to fruit quality, the treatment and canopy zone
    (bottom, mid, and top) were used as a fixed factor. A confidence level of 95 %
    was considered for all the analysis. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Fruit surface
    temperature 3.1.1. Imagery-based For both the rootstock (G41 and M9) blocks, significant
    differences were observed in the mean FST between the treatments (G41: F3, 597
    = 73.4, M9: F3,876 = 28.5, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 6). The lowest mean FST was observed
    for EC-Wet (G41: 27.1 ± 0.4 °C, M9: 28.8 ± 0.4 °C) (mean ± std. error) followed
    by SN (G41: 29.8 ± 0.2 °C, M9: 30.5 ± 0.1 °C), and EC-Dry (G41: 33.1 ± 0.2 °C,
    M9: 32.5 ± 0.2 °C). Mean FST for EC-Dry and UC (G41: 33.1 ± 0.2 °C, M9: 31.4 ±
    0.4 °C) treatments were not significantly different. Maximum FST (Tmax) for the
    treatments were also significantly different (G41: F3, 597 = 49.7, M9: F3,876
    = 127.3, p < 0.0001) with EC-Wet being cooler than other treatments (G41: 37.6
    ± 0.5 °C, M9: 38.5 ± 0.5 °C). Also, Tmax for UC (G41: 45.3 ± 0.5 °C, M9: 43.6
    ± 0.3 °C) or EC-Dry (G41: 42.7 ± 0.5 °C, M9: 45.3 ± 0.2 °C) treatment was significantly
    higher than EC-Wet and SN (G41: 38.6 ± 0.4 °C, M9: 42.2 ± 0.1 °C) treatments.
    Within specific treatments, maximum FST for SN, EC-Dry and UC treatments was significantly
    higher than respective mean FST and mean FST of 10 %, 15 % and 20 % hottest pixels
    (i.e., T10, T15, and T20). However, for EC-Wet, no significant difference was
    observed between Tmax and mean FSTs of hottest pixels (i.e., T10, T15, and T20).
    No significant difference was observed between T10, T15, and T20 across all treatments.

    Fig. 6. Proximal thermal-RGB imagery-derived fruit surface temperatures (FST)
    obtained for wet and dry canopy zones of modified evaporative cooling (EC-Wet,
    and EC-Dry), shade net (SN) and untreated control (UC) blocks grafted on (a) G41
    and (b) M9 rootstocks [Ti, and Tmax are mean and maximum FST; T10, T15, and T20
    are mean temperature of 10%. 15%, and 20% hottest pixels; Different lowercase
    letters above individual bar plots indicate the significance of mean differences
    at 5% level and associated error bars indicate standard error]. EC-Wet and SN
    treatments reduced the mean and maximum apple FST below 40 °C for both rootstocks.
    EC-Wet showed effective FST management through combined evaporative and convective
    heat dissipation. No significant difference in the maximum and mean FST of hottest
    pixels indicate uniform cooling in the EC-Wet treatment zones. Unlike wet zone,
    EC-Dry was ineffective in mitigating the heat implying that standalone convective
    cooling may not be sufficient for effective sunburn management. SN treatments
    also effectively reduced the mean and maximum FST, showing effective diffusion
    of the incident solar radiation, light intensity, and in-canopy ambient temperature
    and results were confirmatory of study by Kalcsits et al. (2016). Moreover, mean
    FST of hottest 10 % pixels (T10), reported reliable for sunburn monitoring (Ranjan
    et al., 2020a), did not exceeded 43.7 °C (EC-Wet) and 43.1 °C (SN) during the
    entire production season which was well below the critical limit (i.e., 45 °C)
    (Rasco and Schrader, 2012). Such observations indicate effective sunburn protection
    capability of EC-Wet and SN techniques. Unlike EC-Wet and SN, UC and EC-Dry treatments
    failed to decrease T10 (51.8 and 48.1 °C, respectively) within the critical limit.
    The convective cooling in EC-Dry treated canopy marginally reduced the FST compared
    to UC; nonetheless, was unable to keep the fruit temperature within the safe limits.
    UC treatment does not dissipate the surplus heat energy stored in the fruit and
    therefore results in the highest FST. A study from Evans and Engineer (1999) also
    reports that direct evaporation of water from the fruit surface (i.e., evaporative
    cooling) provides most effective heat mitigation. Overall, the modified EC system
    was effective in FST mitigation near the fogger (i.e., wet canopy zone); however,
    failed in providing adequate protection away from the fogger (i.e., dry canopy
    zone). Increasing spatial density of fogger placement along the assembly may eliminate
    dry zone and provide uniform sunburn alleviation. Also, since the foggers were
    installed on the top-most trellis, the mist jet was interrupted by the canopy
    at several instances, thereby reducing the mist-spread. Further increasing the
    installation height could eliminate such interference and improve the system efficiency.
    3.1.2. Weather-based Within-canopy weather-derived FST (Twwc) (G41: 49.2 ± 0.4
    °C and M9: 48.7 ± 0.2 °C) was significantly higher than above-canopy weather-derived
    FST (Twac) (G41: 45.3 ± 0.5 °C and M9: 44.9 ± 0.2 °C) (Fig. 7) in UC. Weather
    parameter derived FSTs (Twwc, and Twac) were significantly higher than T10 (G41:
    42.4 ± 0.4 °C and M9: 41.1 ± 0.3 °C), indicating overpredictions with weather-based
    models. Similar differences were reported by Chandel et al. (2018) and Wang et
    al. (2020). This could be probably due to a higher sensitivity of FST prediction
    model (Li et al., 2014, Ranjan et al., 2020a) to the weather (e.g., solar radiation,
    air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed) and crop (e.g., emissivity,
    albedo constant, fruit diameter, shading condition) specific parameters. For instance,
    the FST prediction for an entirely sun-exposed apple could be 8.1 °C higher than
    fruits under complete shade (Ranjan et al., 2020a). Similarly, variation in the
    fruit size from 6 to 8 cm can introduce an error of 3.4 °C in FST prediction.
    Wind is also critical for fruit cooling as it assists in dissipating the heat
    energy from the fruit system through convection (Evan, 2004). Analysis showed
    that wind speed within the canopy was almost 50 % lower than above-canopy, conceivably
    due to canopy obstructions. Such wind profile variation is not accommodated in
    the weather-based model, resulting in overprediction as it ignores the fact that
    lower wind speed within-canopy will reduce the heat dissipation rates. Download

    Comparison of thermal-RGB and weather-derived fruit surface temperatures (FST)
    of untreated control blocks grafted on (a) G41 and (b) M9 rootstocks [Twwc and
    Twac are within and above canopy weather parameter derived FST; Ti, and Tmax are
    imagery-derived mean and maximum FST; T10, T15, and T20 are imagery-derived mean
    temperature of 10%. 15%, and 20% hottest pixels; Different lowercase letters above
    individual bar plots indicate the significance of mean differences at 5% level
    and associated error bars indicate standard error]. 3.1.3. Canopy temperature
    Aerial thermal imagery mapped canopy temperature had significant differences among
    the treatments (F2, 49 = 85.5, p < 0,0001). The mean canopy temperature of the
    modified EC (combined Dry and Wet zones) (30.3 ± 1.3 °C, Fig. 8a) was lowest followed
    by SN (33.3 ± 1.4 °C) treatment. However, the difference in the canopy temperature
    between SN and UC (34.2 ± 1.3 °C) treatments was not significant. Interaction
    effects of treatments and imaging days were also significant (F4, 49 = 3.0, p
    = 0.03). For EC treatment block, alternate hot and cold zones were clearly visible
    in the temperature maps showing disparity due to wet and dry canopy zones as discussed
    in section 3.1.1 (Fig. 8b). Similar trends were observed in imagery-based FST
    estimates where mean and maximum FSTs for EC-Wet was found significantly lower
    than EC-Dry treatment (Fig. 6). Unlike EC, no significant temperature difference
    was reported between UC and SN treated canopies. The FST results obtained from
    the proximal monitoring contradict this finding. The mean and maximum FST for
    SN treatment was significantly lower than UC treatment. Unlike proximal sensing,
    aerial imagery captures the temperature of the net rather than underneath canopy
    (Fig. 2). The SN cover under direct exposure to solar radiation would essentially
    be at higher temperature than canopy underneath. Overall, while for exposed canopies,
    aerially mapped canopy temperatures were in accordance with the proximal imagery-derived
    FST, aerial imagery was unreliable to quantify the effect of SN on heat stress
    mitigation. Download : Download high-res image (509KB) Download : Download full-size

    the harvesting for (b) evaporative cooling (EC), (c) shade net (SN), and (d) untreated
    control blocks (UC). The dark blue zone (marked in solid black oval shape) represents
    wet canopy with lower temperature compared to yellow zone (marked in dotted red
    oval shape) at higher temperature of the dry canopy zone. The pixels with dark
    red color on the thermal map of UC block signifies the elevated temperature in
    the untreated canopy. 3.2. Fruit quality attributes 3.2.1. Crop load Overall,
    the yield (kg) per tree for G41 was 20.4 % lower than M9. The ANOVA of crop load
    for G41 rootstock grafted blocks indicated significant difference in mean fruit
    weight for the main effect of the treatments (F3, 221 = 16.9, p < 0.0001) (Supplementary
    Fig. S1a). However, there was no significant difference corresponding to the main
    effect of the canopy zones (F2, 221 = 16.9, p = 0.06) or the interaction effect
    (F6, 221 = 0.24, p = 0.96) (Fig. S1b). Mean fruit weight for G41 (258.1 ± 2.9
    g) was 7.2 % higher than M9 (239.6 ± 2.8 g) rootstock. Nonetheless, the average
    number of fruits per tree for G41 was 29 % lesser than M9. The fruit weight of
    EC-Wet (300 ± 5.8 g) was highest followed by SN (279 ± 4.1 g) treated block. Unlike
    G41, for M9 rootstock planted block, there was no significant difference in the
    mean fruit weight corresponding to the main effect of the treatments (F3, 205
    = 1.45, p = 0.23) (Fig. S1c). Moreover, there was no significant effect for the
    main effect of the canopy zone (F2, 205 = 0.17, p = 0.84) and no significant interaction
    effect between treatment and canopy zone (F6, 205 = 0.51, p = 0.80) (Fig. S1d).
    Overall, the EC-Wet and SN protected canopies resulted in either higher or similar
    fruit weight compared to unprotected fruits with no significant effect of the
    canopy zones on the crop load for the tested rootstocks. Previous studies (Igleasias
    et al., 2002; Wand et al., 2002, Gindaba and Wand, 2005) support these findings.
    Lower ambient temperature, higher in-field humidity, and high soil moisture in
    EC treated block promote photosynthetic activity by opening the stomata during
    hot summer afternoon period (Wand et al., 2002). Additionally, mild leaf and fruit
    microclimates minimize the respiratory losses, resulting in higher carbohydrate
    formation for the fruit growth (Gindaba and Wand, 2005). These factors could have
    resulted in a larger size fruit under EC-treatment. Interestingly, SN also maintained
    a milder microclimate but resulted in relatively smaller fruit size compared to
    EC treatment probably due to reduced PAR that decreases photosynthetic activity
    (Lambers et al., 2008, Gindaba and Wand, 2005). 3.2.2. Fruit firmness There was
    a significant difference in the firmness corresponding to the main effect of the
    treatment for G41 (F3, 221 = 9.2, p < 0.0001) and M9 (F3, 205 = 4.5, p = 0.0004)
    rootstock. Unlike treatment, no significant difference in the firmness was observed
    for G41 (F2, 221 = 0.42, p = 0.64) and M9 (F2, 205 = 2.5, p = 0.09) as the main
    effect of the canopy zone. For G41, the firmness of the SN treated fruits was
    highest (7.1 ± 0.06 kg) however there was no significant difference in the firmness
    associated to the fruits treated with EC-Wet, EC-Dry, and UC (Fig. S2a). For M9
    rootstock, there was no significant difference in the firmness between fruits
    treated with SN, UC, and EC-Wet. However, the fruit firmness for EC-Dry was significantly
    lower than rest of the treatments (Fig. S2c). Likewise, no significant interaction
    effect in the fruit firmness were observed between treatment and canopy zone for
    G41 (F6, 205 = 0.46, p = 0.83) and M9 (F6, 205 = 0.92, p = 0.47) rootstock (Fig.
    S2b,d). Overall, the unprotected fruits either had similar or lower firmness compared
    to those under EC-Wet and SN. Studies by Racsko et al., (2005b) and Schrader et
    al., 2009a, Schrader et al., 2009b) reported unprotected canopies to yield higher
    firmness fruits, due to internal water movement from sun-exposed face to shaded
    face, resulting in higher dry matter percentage toward sun exposed face (Curtis,
    1937). While Iglesias et al. (2002), and Gindaba and Wand (2005) reported enhanced
    fruit firmness for EC protected ‘Topred Delicious’ and ‘Royal Gala’ apples, respectively
    and no effect on ‘Cripps Pink’ apples (Gindaba and Wand, 2005). Similar to those
    studies, concrete conclusion on the effect of sunburn protection on fruit firmness
    could not be devised in this study probably for its further dependency on cultivars,
    protection methods, growing regions, and agro-climatic conditions. 3.2.3. Soluble
    solid content Pertinent to both the rootstocks, significant difference in the
    °Brix was obtained for the main effect of the treatments (G41: F3, 221 = 70.5,
    M9: F3, 205 = 14.9, p < 0.0001) and canopy zones (G41: F2, 221 = 32.7, M9: F2,
    205 = 38.7, p < 0.0001) but not their interaction (G41: F6, 221 = 1.87, p = 0.09,
    M9: F6, 205 = 0.96, p = 0.45). For G41, the °Brix for the SN treated fruits were
    highest (13.1 ± 0.10) followed by the EC-Wet (12.4 ± 0.08) (Fig. S3a) and no difference
    was observed for EC-Dry and UC treatments. Additionally, for UC and SN treatment
    blocks, the SSC of the fruits harvested from top zone was significantly higher
    than bottom zone (Fig. S3b). A similar trend was obtained for EC-Wet and EC-Dry
    treatments; however, the differences were not significant. For M9 rootstock, fruits
    from UC had the highest SSC (13.4 ± 0.08) while no significant difference was
    observed between rest of the treatments (Fig. S3c). Moreover, fruits in the top
    zone had significantly higher SSC compared to the bottom zone for tested treatments
    (Fig. S3d). Studies from Racsko et al., (2005b) and Schrader et al., 2009a, Schrader
    et al., 2009b) reported that sunburn necrosis and browning increase the fruit
    solute content and dry matter percentage. The SSC results for the M9 rootstock
    were in accordance with this theory. However, for the G41 rootstock, unprotected
    apples had either lower or similar SSC than protected apples. Like fruit firmness,
    concrete agreement on the effect of sunburn protection techniques on SSC could
    not be established, similar to other studies (Glenn et al., 2001; Gindaba and
    Wand, 2005). Moderate sunburn susceptibility during the 2022 season could have
    resulted in such discrepancies. Although SSC was not consistent for the tested
    treatments, the SSC for top-zone fruits was consistently higher than the bottom
    zone for all treatments and both rootstocks. The longer and higher solar exposure
    increases the mean temperatures in top canopy zone (Acimovic, 2019), often results
    to elevated FST (Li et al., 2014, Ranjan et al., 2020a, Ranjan et al., 2020b).
    The water content of the apple tissue decreases as the severity of heat stress
    increases (Schrader et al., 2009a, Schrader et al., 2009b), which could have led
    to a higher dry matter percentage and SSC (Racsko and Schrader, 2012) in the top
    zone fruits. 3.2.4. Titratable acidity Significant difference in the TA was observed
    for both rootstocks pertaining to the main effect of the treatments (G41: F3,
    221 = 28.0, M9: F3,205 = 9.2, p < 0.0001). A significant difference in TA was
    evident for fruits from different the canopy zones (F3, 205 = 6.8, p = 0.001)
    for M9 rootstock but not for G41 rootstock (F3, 221 = 0.5, p = 0.59). For G41,
    the TA of the SN (0.64 ± 0.02 %) and EC-Wet (0.63 ± 0.01 %) treated fruits was
    significantly higher than EC-Dry and UC (Fig. S4a) treated fruits. While for M9,
    there was no significant difference in the TA for the SN (0.47 ± 0.01 %) and EC-Wet
    (0.51 ± 0.01 %) fruits and TA was highest for UC (0.53 ± 0.01 %) fruits (Fig.
    S4c). Furthermore, for both rootstock, interaction effects of treatments and canopy
    zones were not significant (G41: F3, 221 = 0.68, p = 0.12, M9: F3, 205 = 1.99,
    p = 0.06) (Fig. S4b,d). For G41 rootstock, the TA of fruits from no sunburn protection
    treatment was lower than EC-Wet and SN protected fruits. Schrader et al., 2009a,
    Schrader et al., 2009b) also reported depletion in TA for the sunburn defected
    apples. However, for M9 rootstock, no such difference was observed in the TA for
    the fruits from UC and EC-Wet treatment block. Comparison of TA for EC-Dry and
    EC-Wet treatments showed significantly lower acidity for the former in both rootstocks
    indicating higher heat stress effects in the dry canopies as reported in section
    3.1.1. 3.2.5. Quality factor Pertinent to both rootstocks, a significant difference
    in QF was observed for the main effect of treatments (G41: F3, 221 = 7.8, p <
    0.0001, M9: F3, 205 = 4.8, p = 0.002). Similarly, for M9 rootstock, there was
    a significant difference in QF for the main effect of canopy zone (F2, 205 = 8.1,
    p = 0.0003); however, no difference was observed for G41 rootstock (F2, 221 =
    2.5, p = 0.09,). The QF corresponding to G41 for EC-Wet (90.4 ± 2.0 %) and SN
    (82.5 ± 2.4 %) was highest among the tested treatments (Fig. S5a). While for M9,
    no significant difference in the QF was observed between UC (77.3 ± 2.4 %), EC-Wet
    (75.8 ± 2.1 %) and SN (76.1 ± 1.8 %). QF for EC-Dry (66.2 ± 2.5 %) was the lowest
    (Fig. S5c) and significantly different than other treatments. Moreover, there
    was no interaction between treatment and canopy zones for both the rootstocks
    (G41: F6, 221 = 0.65, p = 0.69, M9: F6, 205 = 0.8, p = 0.56) (Fig. S5b,d). Overall,
    higher QF associated with EC-Wet and SN treatment of G41 rootstock indicates better
    fruit quality (Mohr, 2006) compared to UC treatment. Unlike wet, the dry zone
    of the EC protected block (i.e., EC-Dry) had a lower QF for G41 as well as M9
    rootstocks, further indicating inadequate protection from sunburn resulting in
    inferior fruit quality. The M9 rootstock did not show substantial reduction in
    the fruit quality probably due to higher resistance to sunburn. 4. Conclusions
    Following are the conclusions from the presented study. 1. The CPS2.0 effectively
    monitored the fruit sunburn susceptibility throughout the fruit maturation period
    of the season. The SN protection effectively reduced the FST for both rootstocks.
    The fogging-based EC was also effective in mitigating the surface temperature
    in the wet zone of treatment block. However, the dry zones that did not receive
    direct water were cooled only through convection and such protection was inadequate
    to mitigate heat stress. 2. The aerial thermal imagery further confirmed the discrepancy
    in the heat stress between wet and dry zones of the canopy in modified EC treatments.
    The wet zone maintained the cooler canopy temperature that were below the UC.
    Netting prevented aerial imagery-based quantification. 3. The postharvest internal
    fruit quality analysis indicated either higher or similar crop load, fruit firmness,
    and quality factor for the EC-Wet and SN protected canopy. However, like previous
    studies, the SSC and TA results did not follow any trend across treatments for
    the tested rootstocks. Overall, the upgraded sunburn monitoring tool (CPS2.0)
    demonstrated the potential to better manage sunburn in apples to improve fruit
    quality. Future research should take into consideration this study''s limitation
    of a non-randomized experimental design due to limited orchard block area. The
    reproducibility and replicability of the findings from this study are being further
    validated on a large scale in a commercial apple orchard. To enhance versatility,
    our lab is also upgrading the existing monitoring tool with additional features.
    Crucial in-field fruit quality estimation capability will be added to the unit
    along with the existing sunburn monitoring features. The RGB imagery data collected
    by the unit will be utilized to monitor the fruit growth (i.e., size and shape)
    and color development in real-time and machine learning approach would be adapted
    for accurate and rapid data processing. Furthermore, a CPS compatible decision
    support system is being developed that can be integrated with a modified EC system
    for water and energy-efficient sunburn management. The orientation of foggers
    is also being modified to eliminate the dry patches and improve the uniformity
    in cooling achieved from the modified EC. Additionally, our ongoing study is focused
    on assessing the degree of sunburn during harvest and post-harvest storage so
    that the treatment effect can be directly correlated with sunburn. Although CPS2.0
    relies on edge computing to process the data, cloud resources (e.g., data-based
    management systems, servers, scalable storage) can be helpful in sharing critical
    information with growers in near real-time. Declaration of competing interest

    Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction Smart irrigation or Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)
    is an emerging technique for precision agriculture where an area is irrigated
    according to its requirement. A field is divided into smaller sub-regions (event
    regions) of varying water requirement subject to soil texture, topography, crop,
    and environmental parameters. These event regions are called Management Zones
    (MZs). In traditional VRI setup, an irrigation machinery called Linear is guided
    by Base Station (BS) to move on a predefined linear path and irrigate the field.
    To generate control actions for irrigation, BS collects data from sensors in two
    ways. First, sensors send data to BS (placed outside the farmland) via multi-hop
    in flat [1, 2] or clustered architecture [3]. Second, data is collected from the
    nodes deployed in MZs of farmland having similar soil properties and irrigation
    requirement [4, 5]. These arrangements suffer from high energy consumption in
    data transmission from sensor nodes to BS for community agriculture where a large
    farmland is to be irrigated. Moreover, studies from agronomy [6] report the need
    of dynamic identification of MZs for monitoring purpose. MZs are spatio-temporally
    varying. To make the information regarding this change available near real-time
    at the Linear, is a key challenge. To accomplish this, Boundary Nodes (BNs) and
    non-BNs of MZ are marked in distributed fashion in our previous work [7]. The
    next step is to send information of BNs to Linear for generation of actions. Hence,
    the proposed work investigates the challenges of data harvesting from BNs of MZs.
    We assume that BS is mounted on Linear that stops at on-the-go identified locations,
    collects data from BNs, generates control actions and irrigates field while moving.
    In this work we intend to explore following research questions: Can a subset of
    BNs be identified as source nodes without loss of information of the event region
    boundary? How can stop time of Linear at a location be calculated at BS without
    any information of BNs? How does a Linear disseminate its location information
    with reduced network traffic and how a path is constructed from BNs to Linear?
    Will partial event region information be able to facilitate required action? What
    are the other applications where similar problem of data harvesting from BNs exists?
    Fig. 1 Data collection from a small region (Source: http://www.valleyirrigation.com)
    Full size image Figure 1 presents a scenario of data collection from BNs. A large
    irrigating machinery called Linear is guided by BS to move on a predefined linear
    path and irrigate the field. Linear moves at a low speed (\\(\\approx 2 m/s\\))
    or stops at some locations depending on the control action generated by BS. Data
    from the sensor nodes in a small region in front of Linear is collected at the
    BS, which then controls the sprinklers (actuators) mounted on Linear accordingly.
    For example, in Fig. 1, Linear is at position A and irrigating the region around
    it. The next region to be irrigated is B (enclosed by red line). Therefore, the
    information from sensors deployed in the shaded region must be delivered before
    Linear moves from position A and enters region B. Region B may consist of more
    than one event regions (sub regions of different irrigation requirements). Partial
    boundary information of all the sub regions facilitate irrigation schedule for
    region B. If all BNs send data to BS, the boundary information received at BS
    will be correct and proper actuation is ensured. However, if the number of BNs
    is large in a sub-region, network traffic increases. So, to reduce network traffic,
    the proposed work identifies a minimal set of BNs as sources laying in an event
    region. The minimal set must be selected such that the information from identified
    nodes suffice for the decision at BS. The nodes belonging to such minimal set
    are called Representative Nodes (RNs). Information from these nodes are sufficient
    to construct event boundary at BS. To demonstrate the impact of reducing BNs and
    hence, loss of information at BS, concept of event region map construction is
    introduced. Event region map is the virtual boundary of event regions created
    at BS from the position and data information of RNs. An example scenario (see
    Fig. 2a) consists of three event regions (MZs) A, B, and C where BNs 1–10 form
    boundary of A, 11–15 and 16–22 are the BNs of B and C, respectively. Suppose the
    RNs for construction of the event regions A, B, and C are \\(\\{2, 4, 6, 7, 10\\}\\),
    \\(\\{12, 13, 15\\}\\), and \\(\\{16, 17, 19, 21\\}\\), respectively. The coarsely
    constructed local map at BS from the information of these RNs, is shown in Fig.
    2b. Exclusion of any of these nodes will result in incorrect event region map
    and addition of other BNs to the set of RNs will fine grain the coarsely constructed
    boundary, however, increase the energy consumption. Thus, a trade-off between
    network traffic and information loss is to be maintained. Fig. 2 Minimal set of
    BNs Full size image Construction of event region map is limited to our work and
    actual decision making process depends on the algorithm running on BS. This work
    identifies a minimal set BNs as sources and explores the challenges of mobility
    assisted data collection (as explained with the help of Fig. 1). These challenges
    are application specific and vary from application to application. For example,
    in enemy troop detection [8], where soldiers move in their own area of surveillance,
    if there are some intruders, it becomes important to be aware of the area ahead
    of the troop. The problem is same to that of VRI, however, precise boundary information
    is required for this application. In automated brooding systems (chick, quail,
    goose, ducks) [9], temperature and humidity sensors are deployed to report different
    temperature zones. The problem of local map construction is similar to VRI, however,
    network of sensors is three dimensional. Thus, for enemy detection and livestock
    monitoring, the proposed scheme must be modified according to the challenges posed
    by specific scenario. This work takes VRI as use case and investigates the challenges
    of energy efficient data collection for reconstruction of event region map at
    Linear. Having discussed the application specific scenario and the other application
    where the problem may find its place, the essential features of the problem considered
    in the work are presented as follows: To minimize the traffic and energy consumption,
    a minimal set BNs known as RN is identified in such a way that correct actions
    are ensured at BS using the information of these nodes. Fig. 3 Taxonomy of data
    harvesting schemes in WSAN/WSN. Deploying Linear as a data harvesting and processing
    infrastructure for smart irrigation is proposed for the first time in this work
    to the best of our knowledge. This taxonomy presents existing mobility assisted
    data harvesting techniques Full size image Considering the RNs are identified
    through a distributed scheme, another challenge is posed by data acquisition from
    these RNs. Linear stops at some locations and collects data from the BNs laying
    in sub-region ahead, constructs a local view of the sub-region and generates control
    actions. In this context, the stop time of Linear must be adequate to collect
    data from all RNs. Inadequate stop time can result into insufficient information
    from RNs leading to inaccurate event decision at Linear. Hence, a data collection
    dependent stop time of Linear at a location is proposed. Moreover, to reduce energy
    consumption in location information dissemination, a reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme is proposed where a node transmits only one location information message.
    Temporal and spatial suppression of information is prevalent to reduce energy
    consumption of nodes. For example, authors in [10] have reduced the volume of
    data by modified version of KNN algorithm on sensor node and further aggregation
    of data at Cluster Head (CH). Authors in [11] proposed Data Transmission (DaT)
    Protocol for suppressing redundant data to save the energy while maintaining a
    suitable level of accuracy. Other temporal data compression techniques to reduce
    the energy consumption is proposed in [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Spatial information
    suppression focuses on reducing number of source node in the network. The existing
    algorithms for identifying RNs as source nodes are designed for boundary monitoring
    [18,19,20,21]. These schemes are energy efficient and select lesser number of
    BNs, however, construct incorrect event region in the case of more than two subregions
    (A, B, and C in Fig. 2). The mechanisms give inaccurate result when neighbors
    of a sensor node lay in two different event regions. For example, BN 4 and its
    neighbors 15 and 16 in Fig. 2a. Node 4 suppresses the data of its neighbors and
    sends information to BS that 15 and 16 are BNs of another region. However, while
    constructing the event region map, BS can not visualize that nodes 15 and 16 are
    the BNs of two different subregions. Detailed discussion is presented in Section
    4.2.2 with the help of Figs. 17, 18, and 19. Moreover, these schemes do not investigate
    data acquisition from RNs. There is a plethora of mobile infrastructure based
    data collection schemes (a taxonomy is presented in Fig. 3). In most of these
    works, the stop time is either independent of data collection [22, 23] or negligible
    [24, 25] for a mobile BS. A few research works have modelled the stop time of
    mobile BS. Table 1 discusses these works and the limitations regarding applicability
    to the scenario under consideration. The paper aims to design a distributed Lightweight
    Event Region map Construction based data harvesting protocol LERC, for delay tolerant
    applications with following contributions: To reduce network traffic, RNs are
    identified as data transmitters. The scheme identifies RNs that in turn construct
    correct event region map even when BNs of more than two event region lay in the
    neighborhood (explained in Section 4.2.2). BN calculates the gradient (defined
    in the first paragraph of Section 3.3) of line joining it to previous RN. If the
    gradient is greater than an application dependent threshold, BN marks itself as
    RN. The decision of BNs is evaluated by plotting the boundary of event region
    at Linear in which less number (at least 58%) of BNs are required for correct
    event region construction. A reduced overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for
    path construction that ensures only one message transmission by each node. It
    restricts transmission of multiple copies of location information message of Linear
    in the network. The efficiency of this scheme is measured in terms of energy consumption.
    Reduced overhead broadcast decreases the energy consumption of network by 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    with respect to the limited broadcast scheme proposed in [26]. Sojourn locations
    of Linear are identified on-the-go and data collection dependent stop time at
    a location is modelled. The modelled stop time is adequate to collect data from
    all RNs laying in the event region ahead that in turn ensures correct event region
    map construction at BS. Modelled stop time is the sum of maximum time required
    for dissemination of location information to the farthest BN of the region and
    data transmission from it to Linear. 2 Related work This section discusses the
    research related to RN selection, limited broadcasting, stop time, and stop location
    modelling. A summarized discussion of the research gaps with respect to the applicative
    scenario’s requirements, follows. 2.1 Selection of RNs (data reporting nodes to
    sink) In [19] energy efficient Continuous Boundary Monitoring (COBOM), only one
    BN is selected randomly as RN among its neighbor BNs. Selected RNs maintain and
    transmit a BN-array to sink that includes the boundary information around the
    RN. First all nodes send their position to sink to maintain a neighborhood map
    at sink. In each iteration, only one BN sends the data to sink along with the
    status of its neighbors as BN or non-BN. COBOM suppresses the BNs and achieves
    desired accuracy when nodes are belonging to only one event region that is either
    a node is inside the event region or outside of it. However, for smart irrigation
    there may be more than one event regions present. A node’s neighbors may belong
    to different event regions and in such condition boundary construction at sink
    will fail. It is proved by simulation in Section 4.2.2 with the help of Fig. 17.
    Authors in [20] have proposed a BN selection algorithm that identifies a small
    set of BNs independent of node density and provides well-balanced RN selection
    from the small set. It chooses only the closest sensor nodes to the boundary of
    an object as BN. A Neighbor Descriptor Table (NDT) that includes neighbor location
    information and event detection status is maintained as each node. From the selected
    BNs, the algorithm tries to choose only one RN per each radio range regardless
    of node density. The algorithm selects a BN as RN if no RN selection message arrives
    from its neighbor BNs and the two most distant neighbor BNs are selected as left
    and right RNs. Since the RN selection algorithm identifies only one RN per each
    radio range, it is not suitable for the applications where one-hop neighbors belong
    to different event regions. For the applicative scenario considered in our work
    one-hop neighbors may lay in different event regions and selection of only one
    BN among neighbors as RN lead to information suppression and incorrect decision.
    Hence, the above mentioned scheme is not applicable to the applications mentioned
    earlier in Section 1. Energy-efficient DEtection and MOnitoring for COntinuous
    objects in wireless sensor networks (DEMOCO) [21] focuses on reducing the number
    of BNs that eventually results in lowering the number of RNs to reduce traffic
    as well as communication between sensor nodes. It selects the nodes inward to
    the boundary of continuous event as RNs and ignores the outward BNs. It reduces
    number of RNs to half in comparison to COBOM. In this work, minimizing number
    of RNs and hence, overall energy consumption in data reporting are the main objectives.
    However, event region construction at BS is ignored. Hence, DEMOCO is not suitable
    for the applications where information from RNs facilitate construction of event
    region at BS. In [18], authors have proposed BN detection and boundary refinement
    scheme for continuous boundary monitoring in heterogeneous Internet of Things
    (IoT). Boundary of event region consists of resource rich backbone nodes that
    are assisted by resource constrained edge nodes. Planarization algorithms are
    applied to generate a coarse boundary region. Sensory data of edge nodes is estimated
    by backbone nodes by applying interpolation techniques. For boundary refinement,
    mobile BS visits each BN to collect data. The path of mobile BS is optimally planned
    by applying models including the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) with
    time constraints and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), to enable the near real-time
    requirement of domain applications. The scheme identifies less number of BNs,
    however, the accuracy of boundary region decreases. Moreover, the scheme is centralized
    and hence, not suitable for automated smart irrigation scenario where BNs are
    identified by a distributed algorithm. 2.2 Limited broadcast Authors in [27] have
    proposed a limited broadcast scheme, where an actor transmits the location information
    in its Voronoi cell. Authors have assumed that sensors belonging to the Voronoi
    cell of an actor, are one-hop distant to it. Hence, number of messages transmitted
    for location update reduces. However, in applications such as VRI a few RNs may
    or may not be one-hop neighbors of Linear at its current stop location. In such
    scenario, the above mentioned scheme tends to perform as flooding. A Mobile Actor
    Routing Protocol (MARP) for data transmission in mobile Wireless Sensor and Actuator
    Networks (WSAN) is proposed in [28]. Actors stop at some locations for random
    time and broadcast two control signals to construct cluster around it. Cluster
    members send data to the actor within its pause time at that location. Stop locations
    and stop time are independent of data collection. The location information dissemination
    is restricted to the nodes belonging to the cluster around stop location of actor.
    However, the approach is still flooding that causes high energy consumption and
    moreover, if cluster size or node density increases energy consumption increases
    exponentially. Authors have proposed sensor-actor coordination mechanism in [29]
    where network is divided into grids and a CH is chosen for each grid. Actor broadcasts
    its location information while moving and CHs further floods it to other CHs and
    sensor nodes. The location information dissemination is restricted to the grid
    however, flooding of location messages consumes much energy. Moreover, if size
    of grid or density of nodes increases energy consumption increases exponentially.
    A limited flooding mechanism for cluster formation is proposed in [26], in which
    mobile BS broadcasts beacon periodically. Beacon contains hop count, energy, source
    address, and time to live (ttl). A node discards a packet if hop count of received
    packet is greater than the hop count stored at the node. If hop count is less
    than current value, it is updated and broadcasted again. Cluster formation stops
    if ttl has expired. Though limited flooding consumes less energy than flooding,
    the repetitive transmission by a node till ttl is reached, causes significant
    energy consumption in larger networks and hence is not scalable. 2.3 Stop time
    modelling A taxonomy of research works utilizing mobile BS is shown in Fig. 3.
    In WSAN (where mobile BS works as actuators), mechanisms of periodic visit are
    not appropriate to the problem under consideration, as the stop locations depend
    either on the nearness of previous stop point [30] or on the probability of event
    occurrence [31] and thus, are independent of data collection. However, for Linear
    move irrigation, next stop locations and stop time should take decision making
    and actuation into account. In existing works of on-demand visit [32], the key
    concern is to select an optimal actuator to take action in the event region. Table
    1 Evaluation of stop time based models Full size table In Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN) (where mobile BS acts as a data collector), for Linear visiting each node
    [38], the stop time is modelled for one hop transmission taking buffer constraint
    and speed of mobile BS into account. Another way of data collection is to visit
    a subset of nodes such as Rendezvous Points (RPs) [24, 25, 39,40,41] or Rendezvous
    Area (RA) [42, 43]. The stop locations are RPs that are decided by BS and known
    a priori to mobile data collector. Stop time at RPs are negligible most of the
    time. These algorithms do not fit for the applicative scenarios’ requirement as
    BS mounted on Linear has no prior knowledge of the BNs. Moreover, BNs are subject
    to change, so every time transmitting location of all BNs for calculation of stop
    locations will be wastage of constrained resources. In RA based mechanisms, stop
    time and stop location are random. When RPs are selected along the path of mobile
    BS, stop time is either negligible or modelled for one hop transmission. To the
    best of authors’ knowledge, none of the works design stop time and stop location
    taking the crucial aspects (collision, number of hops) of multi hop data collection
    into account. Apart from stop time and stop location, neither RP nor RA can furnish
    Linear with the event region boundary information. The mechanisms that model stop
    time are discussed in Table 1. 2.4 Discussion Limited flooding mechanisms broadcast
    location updates in a smaller region rather than entire network and hence, perform
    better than flooding. However, nodes are involved in repetitive transmission that
    consumes a considerable amount of energy. Stop time modelling in literature is
    either negligible or dependent on the energy consumption of the nodes for lifetime
    maximization. However, in application under consideration, stop time of the Linear
    should be adequate to collect data from enough BNs to construct a map of the event
    region. For reducing network traffic, data aggregation on CHs is a much prevalent
    method. However, CH election and cluster formation itself consume a considerable
    amount of energy [19, 20]. Moreover, CHs are not able to demarcate the boundary
    of a subregion (detailed discussion is presented in [7]). On the other hand, the
    RN selection schemes are energy efficient, however, fail to construct accurate
    map at sink when neighbors of a node lies in two different subregions. In VRI,
    incorrect boundary identification at sink hampers the decision making and actions
    to event region. 3 Lightweight Event Region Construction (LERC) protocol This
    section discusses the proposed methodology for data collection from BNs of a MZ.
    First, system framework and problem formulation are presented. Next, the three
    modules of the proposed methodology namely, reduced overhead broadcasting method
    (Section 3.2), RN selection scheme (Section 3.3), and calculations of stop time
    and next stop location (Section 3.4) are discussed. 3.1 System framework In this
    subsection, first we present the network model, energy model and problem formulation
    follows. 3.1.1 Network model Figure 4 depicts a scenario of farmland where a set
    of sensor nodes S = {\\(s_1, s_2...., s_n\\)} are deployed in an irregular polygon
    shaped field. The uniformly distributed sensors form a network represented as
    a graph \\(G=(S,E)\\) where sensor nodes form the vertices and connection among
    them is represented by a set of edges E = {\\(e_1, e_2...., e_m\\)}. \\(\\forall\\)
    s\\(_i\\), \\(\\exists\\) NB\\(^{d}_i\\) where NB\\(^{d}_i\\) is the one hop Neighborhood
    set of \\(s_i\\) with d members and \\(d <n\\). A node \\(s_j \\in\\) NB\\(^{d}_i
    \\iff \\left| s_i-s_j \\right| \\le\\) 2r, where \\(\\left| s_i-s_j \\right|\\)
    is the Euclidean distance between \\(s_i\\) and \\(s_j\\) and r is the communication
    range of \\(s_i\\). A multi attribute sensing sensor node \\(s_i\\) is capable
    of measuring different soil properties (for example soil moisture, temperature,
    AWC). In Fig. 4 there are two categories of nodes, namely, Boundary Nodes (BNs)
    and Interior Nodes (INs) where boundary of a MZ is demarcated by the BNs (solid
    circles). A node \\(s_i\\) marks itself as BN or IN depending on the measurements
    and position information received from the nodes in NB\\(^{d}_i\\). Each node
    upon receiving data from its neighbors runs MZ delineation algorithm (for details,
    please refer [7]). A list of symbols is presented in Table 2. Table 2 List of
    symbols Full size table BNs represent the MZ, on boundary of which, these are
    laying. To collect data from the BNs, Linear are deployed in the field. BS is
    responsible for data collection and generation of control actions and is mounted
    on a self propelled Linear move irrigation machinery (shown in Fig. 1). The actuators
    (mounted on Linear) control the rate, amount, timing of irrigation as well as
    the on/off mode of sprinklers according to the location of BNs. Fig. 4 An example
    scenario with multi Linears Full size image Linear (\\(Linear_1\\) or \\(Linear_2\\))
    starts from the periphery of the farm that is the first stop location of it. It
    gathers data from RNs (a subset of BNs), construct MZ map, generates control actions
    and irrigates the field while moving. Thus, there are two states of Linear namely,
    Stop and Collect (S&C) and Move and Irrigate (M&I). The assumptions made are based
    on the various real life VRI systems. VARIwise [44] is an autonomous control platform
    developed to generate Prescription Map for automated VRI. In an another project,
    VRI system developed by University of Georgia [45], for generating dynamic Prescription
    Map takes feedback from the sensor network. The University of Georgia Smart Sensor
    Array (UGA SSA) consists of smart sensor nodes and a base station that form a
    mesh network. 3.1.2 Energy model In this setup, sensor nodes are deployed in the
    field having transmission range equal to r. Nodes remain in sleep state till a
    control signal from Linear arrives to wake these nodes. Energy consumption of
    a node is the sum of the energy consumed in various states of a node namely, idle
    (\\(E_{idle}\\)), transmit (\\(E_t\\)), and receive (\\(E_r\\)) as proposed in
    [46, 47]. Where, \\(E_{idle}\\) is the energy consumed in Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access (CSMA) backoffs and idle state (waiting for data or control packet). Since,
    we are not optimizing any parameter of idle state, energy consumed is depicted
    as \\(E_{idle}\\) to keep it simple. Energy consumed in transmit state (\\(E_t\\))
    and receive state (\\(E_r\\)) are as follows [46]: $$\\begin{aligned} E_t= (e_t+e_{d}r^{p})B.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (1) $$\\begin{aligned} E_r=e_{r}B. \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where,
    \\(e_t\\) is the energy/bit consumed by the transmitter electronics, and \\(e_d\\)
    accounts for energy dissipated in the transmit op-amp. r is the transmission range
    and p is the channel path loss index. B is the bit rate of radio. The first phase
    of LERC protocol is Reduced Overhead Broadcast, where, each node receives a control
    message from all its predecessors and broadcast one message to its successors.
    Thus, in this phase, a maximum of k messages are received and one message is transmitted
    for a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{ROB}_i
    = (k_i*E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where, \\(k_i\\) is the number of neighbors
    of node \\(s_i\\). A node enters in RN selection phase after it receives a control
    message \\(RN_c\\) from its predecessor (explained in the first paragraph of Section
    3.3). It broadcasts this control message after deciding about its role as RN or
    non-RN. Thus, in this phase at most one message is transmitted and received by
    a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{RN}_i
    = n_{BN}(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where, \\(n_{BN}\\) is the number of BNs.
    Though size of packets in downstream, upstream and RN selection phase differs,
    it is ignored to make calculations simple. After deciding its role as RN or non-RN,
    a node transmits its data towards Linear (via the path constructed in reduced
    overhead broadcasting phase) if it is a RN or waits for the data from RNs to forward,
    otherwise. In worse case, a node may forward data packets of all RNs. So, for
    upstream data transmission, a node receives and transmits messages equal to number
    of RNs. So, the maximum energy consumption is written as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    max E^{DT}_i = n_{RN}*(E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (5) Thus, the maximum energy
    consumption of a node \\(s_i\\) is written as: $$\\begin{aligned} max E_i = E_{idle}+
    (k_i*E_r+E_t)+(n_{RN}+n_{BN})*(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where, \\(E_{idle}\\)
    is the energy consumed in idle state for during all phases mentioned above. LERC
    aims to reduce number of transmissions of a node for location information dissemination.
    Moreover, it selects a subset of nodes as the source nodes that further decreases
    in-network traffic. Thus, LERC regulates \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\), and \\(n_{BN}\\).
    The objective function of the proposed work can be formulated as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\forall {s_i\\in S} \\hspace{.1in}Minimize \\sum _{i=1}^{|S|} E_i \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) Subject to constraints: $$\\begin{aligned} Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge R_0.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (8) $$\\begin{aligned} D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN) \\le
    T. \\end{aligned}$$ (9) where, the constraints in Eqs. (8) and (9) are explained
    as follows: 1. Minimum reliability constraint \\(Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge
    R_0\\) The constraint depicts that number of RNs must not be reduced beyond \\(R_0\\),
    where, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs to achieve correct event region
    map at BS. In this work, we define reliability (Re) with respect to MZ map construction.
    It is the number of BNs sending data to Linear for MZ map construction. If all
    BNs transmit data to Linear, Re is 100% and the map constructed is correct and
    can be treated as the reference. However, in-network traffic and energy consumption
    in this case is high. Let us define a set of BNs as \\(BN=\\{BN_1, BN_2...., BN_{n_{BN}}\\}\\).
    To reduce in-network traffic, a subset of BN defined as \\(RN= \\{RN_1, RN_2....,
    RN_{n_{RN}}\\}\\) is chosen as source nodes such that \\(RN \\subseteq BN\\) and
    \\(n_{RN}\\le n_{BN}\\). As the number of selected RNs decreases, the constructed
    map can deviate from the correct (reference). After one point, the deviation in
    map hampers the decision making and implementation of actions (explained by Figs.
    14 and 15 in Section 4.2). The number of RNs at this point is defined as the minimum
    reliability \\(R_0\\). Thus, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs required to
    demarcate the boundary of MZs at Linear such that the decision and implementation
    remains same to the reference. A generalized approach to calculate \\(R_0\\) is
    not mentioned in the proposed work since it is topology and event region dependent.
    Minimum number of BNs to construct an event region (MZ) at BS is \\(R_0\\) and
    its value ranges from 1 to \\(n_{BN}\\). So, an event region may be represented
    by 1 BN or may be represented by all BNs laying in that event region. As the soil
    parameters change, shape of event region (MZ) changes and so the BNs representing
    the MZ. Thus, proposing a method to calculate the exact number of \\(R_0\\) is
    out of scope of this study. However, an empirical study is shown with the help
    of Figs. 14 and 15. 2. Delay constraint \\(D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN)
    \\le T\\) T is the stop time of Linear at a location for data acquisition. If
    delay of a packet is greater than T, it will be discarded by Linear. Thus, D is
    the maximum end to end delay of data transmission of a RN that is selected as
    data transmitter to construct MZ map at Linear. Fig. 5 Flow chart of the proposed
    method Full size image Thus, the work intends to minimize energy consumption of
    sensor nodes. The energy consumption of a node depends on \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\),
    and \\(n_{BN}\\) (as represented by Eq. (6)). These variables are in turn depend
    on the number of transmissions of control packets in disseminating the location
    information of Linear and data packets in sending information from source nodes.
    To minimize the number of messages during location information dissemination of
    Linear a Reduced Overhead Broadcast mechanism (explained in Section 3.2) is proposed
    where nodes receive control packets from all predecessors and transmit only one
    message. To reduce number of data packets, number of source nodes are minimized
    by selecting a sub-set of BNs namely, RNs, where the number of RNs must be sufficient
    to construct boundary of event region at Linear. RN selection mechanism minimizes
    \\(n_{BN}\\). It is an angle-based greedy approach where each BN marks itself
    as RN or non-RN depending on the angle formed with previous RN (explained in Section
    3.3). Since, RNs are identified in a distributed fashion, stop time (T) of Linear
    must be adequate to collect data from all RNs to ensure the correct construction
    of event region boundary at Linear. A data collection dependent stop time is modelled
    and explained in Section 3.4. Section 3.5 discusses the RN selection when one-hop
    neighbors belong to multiple MZs and data collection by multiple Linears. A flow
    chart of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 5. 3.2 Reduced overhead broadcasting In
    S &C state, at a stop location, Linear sends two control signals. First control
    signal is broadcasted with a transmission range R that is greater than the transmission
    range of sensor nodes (r). This control signal is sent to wake up the nodes from
    sleep state. R depends on the Region of Action (ROA) of Linear that in turn depends
    on the length of field (L) and number of sinks deployed. For example, in Fig.
    4, \\(R=L/4\\), to cover the ROA of Linears. However, for single sink in the same
    region R will be L/2. Fig. 6 Structure of start message Full size image Next,
    a control message start is transmitted with a transmission range of r. start is
    sent for path construction from BNs to Linear. It contains the coordinates of
    Linear (coordinate), hop, residual energy (energy), and sleep time = present time
    + stop time (time) of nodes as shown in Fig 6. Nodes receiving start from neighbors,
    will increment value of hop by one and store its remaining energy in residual
    energy field. Every node will broadcast only one start message to its neighbors
    to reduce network traffic. To ensure reduced overhead broadcast, once a node receives
    first start message (at time \\(t_{start}\\)), it will wait for time \\(t_w\\)
    (Please refer Eq. (15) in Section 3.4), to collect start messages from other neighbors.
    Among all of its neighbors, a node will select one having smallest hop as next
    hop node, for upstream data transmission. If two nodes with same hop are there,
    then a node with largest energy is selected. If multiple nodes with same energy
    and hop are there, randomly a node will be selected as next hop. After next hop
    selection, each node will broadcast its start message to neighbors. Any start
    message received after this broadcast will be discarded. For example, please refer
    Fig. 7 that represents a small portion of a larger network. It consists of a Linear
    (diamond shaped) near node 41 and 42 and BNs (laying on the boundary of network
    and MZ). Let us suppose all nodes shown in the figure are in receive state and
    waiting for start message. Linear broadcasts start message that is received by
    the one-hop neighbors of Linear, nodes 41, 42, 40, 39, 38, 37, 33, and 32. Since
    these nodes are one-hop neighbors of Linear (hop = 0), they update hop and energy
    of the start message and broadcasts it. After this broadcast, these nodes start
    contending for data transmission (explained in the second last paragraph of right
    column on page 12) and discard the start message received from their one-hop neighbors.
    Fig. 7 An example scenario for start message dissemination and RN selection Full
    size image Next, we take example of node 27 to elaborate the reduced overhead
    broadcast scheme. It will wait for \\(t_w\\) time (depends on the maximum transmission
    time of all neighbors), after it receives first start message. After \\(t_w\\)
    time expires, it has start messages from nodes 33(hop = 2), 34(hop = 3), and 26(hop
    = 2). It does not receive start from nodes 35 and 30, since these nodes will broadcast
    start after \\(t_w\\) for node 27 is expired. It selects node 33 or node 26 depending
    on the energy as its next hop since hop is least for them. Node 27 then broadcasts
    start message. Figure 8 depicts various states of Linear and activities associated
    with it. S &C state comprises of three states namely, transmit, wait, and receive.
    In transmit state, Linear sends two signals, wake and start. It then switches
    to wait state, where it waits for a time T (calculation is shown Section 3.4).
    If data packets are received from sensor nodes, it switches to receive state and
    start preparing the Prescription Map (PM) that is set of control actions such
    as rate, location, on/off state for sprinklers, etc. When timer T expires Linear
    switches to M &I state and irrigate the field according to the PM generated. When
    the next stop location is reached, calculation of which was done in S &C state,
    Linear switches to next S &C state and repeats the above mentioned activities.
    Fig. 8 State space representation of Linear Full size image 3.3 Representative
    Node (RN) selection Key idea of RN selection scheme is to select a BN as RN if
    it lies on a large gradient (\\(\\theta\\)) with respect to previous RN. Large
    \\(\\theta\\) depicts a significant change in the shape of event region. Each
    BN marks itself as RN or non-RN. One hop neighbors of Linear (nodes 41, 42, etc.)
    and corner nodes, for example nodes 36 and 37 in Fig. 7 (for corner node identification
    please refer Outward Nodes in the algorithm proposed in [7]), are RNs by default.
    One hop neighbors of Linear are RNs as only one hop transmission is required for
    these nodes. Corner nodes are RNs as these nodes are key enablers to achieve minimum
    reliability (shown by Fig. 15 and discussed in the last paragraph of left column
    on page 18). These nodes broadcast a control message \\(RN_c\\) to inform others
    that they are default RNs. Other nodes, when receive this message, first calculate
    Euclidean distance from Linear. If the calculated distance is in between \\(R-r\\)
    and \\(R+r\\), the BN marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message. If the
    calculated distance is less than \\(R-r\\), BNs calculate angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with its neighbor RN. \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1})\\)
    if \\(y_2-y_1 < x_2-x_1\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{x_2-x_1}{y_2-y_1})\\),
    otherwise. (\\(x_2, y_2\\)) is the coordinate of neighbor RN and (\\(x_1,y_1\\))
    is the coordinate of the node calculating \\(\\theta\\). If \\(\\theta\\) is less
    than \\(\\theta _0\\) (an application dependent threshold discussed in the next
    paragraph), it marks itself as non-RN and as RN otherwise. A non-RN node sends
    \\(RN_c\\) message containing coordinate of RN with which it has calculated the
    angle \\(\\theta\\). The BN receiving this message calculates the angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with the coordinate received in the message. A BN receiving multiple \\(RN_c\\)
    messages will decide according to the lowest \\(\\theta\\). Exact \\(\\theta _0\\)
    can be calculated in a distributed fashion by local talk of sensor nodes where
    nodes between two corner nodes can decide among themselves the value of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) for that setting. However, when boundary pattern changes significantly re-tuning
    \\(\\theta _0\\) is required. Exact mechanism for fixing \\(\\theta _0\\) is a
    work in progress. For the sake of simplicity, in this work, we assume that the
    boundary does not change significantly to change \\(\\theta _0\\). However, a
    safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) is provided by recording the effect of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) on energy consumption and reconstruction of coarse boundary by simulating
    various networks (explained in Section 4.2.1). We elaborate RN selection by an
    example scenario, shown in Fig. 7. The one hop neighbors of Linear (node 41, 42,
    37, 38, 39) excluding the non-BNs (32 and 40) mark themselves as RN and send \\(RN_c\\)
    message to their neighbor node. Moreover, the corner nodes (36 and 37) also mark
    themselves as RN by default. Among neighbors of node 42, only node 33 calculates
    the angle \\(\\theta\\) since others are either non-BNs or RNs. Suppose \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\) for this case. \\(\\theta\\) for node 33 is \\(32^\\circ\\)
    and hence, node 33 marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message to its neighbors.
    Angle \\(\\theta\\) for nodes 34, 26, 27, 29 are \\(4^\\circ\\), \\(12^\\circ\\),
    \\(17^\\circ\\), and \\(38^\\circ\\) respectively. Node 29 marks itself as RN.
    However, when node 29 receives message of node 27 and calculates angle with node
    27 (it is an RN because distance from Linear is \\(R-r\\)) that is \\(6.7^\\circ\\),
    it marks itself as non-RN. Nodes 34 and 35 will mark themselves as non-RN with
    respect to node 33. Node 30 will mark itself as RN with respect to node 36. All
    default RNs (one hop neighbors of Linear and corner nodes) start contending for
    channel access through Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
    (CSMA/CA) [48] scheme as soon as they receive start message. Other nodes contend
    after marking themselves as RNs or non-RNs. If a RN has residual energy less than
    a threshold, it informs its neighbors about the situation and go to sleep. Its
    neighbors transmit data and its position information to next hop neighbors. Figure
    9 shows various states of sensor nodes and actions associated with it. Each sensor
    node can be in one of the four states namely, sleep, receive, wait, and transmit.
    Sensor nodes switch from sleep state to receive state when they receive wake signal
    from Linear and go to sleep state when timer T expires. When start message is
    received, a node (BN or non-BN) broadcasts it by changing hop and residual energy.
    A BN first decides whether it is a RN or not. If it is RN, it follows CSMA/CA
    mechanism. Various activities associated with it is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 State
    space representation of a sensor node Full size image 3.4 Stop time modelling
    and next stop location calculation for the Linear Stop time of Linear at a location
    depends on the data collection delay from all RNs. This delay in turn is the sum
    of propagation time of start message to the farthest RN (within range R) and data
    transmission time from this RN to Linear. The stop time (T) can be calculated
    as: $$\\begin{aligned} T = h_{max}*(delay_{d,max} + delay_{u,max}). \\end{aligned}$$
    (10) where, \\(h_{max}\\) is the maximum number of hops between Linear and the
    farthest RN, \\(delay_{d,max}\\) and \\(delay_{u,max}\\) is the one hop delay
    of downstream and upstream traffic respectively. \\(h_{max}\\) is calculated from
    the probability density function (pdf) of distance covered in one hop proposed
    in [49]. The pdf depends on the number of neighbors of a node that can forward
    data towards Linear, transmission range of nodes (r), and the maximum transmission
    range of Linear (R). The maximum one hop delay in transmitting start message to
    the farthest RN is the sum of the waiting time (\\(t_w\\)) a node waits for its
    neighbors to send start message and the time required for that node to successfully
    broadcast it. $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{d,max} = t_w + t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) where, \\(n_R\\) is the average number of retransmissions and \\(t_{tx}\\)
    is the total time required for transmission of a packet that depends on the back
    off time (\\(t_{BO}\\)), Clear Channel Access (CCA) time (\\(t_{CCA}\\)), transmission
    time of a packet (\\(t_{txn}\\)), and transmission of an acknowledgement (\\(t_{Ack}\\)).
    $$\\begin{aligned} t_{tx}=t_{BO} + t_{CCA} + t_{txn} +t_{Ack}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (12) The upper bound of \\(t_{BO} + t_{CCA}\\) is reached when a node extracts
    highest back off timer at each back off stage, and at each back off stage it finds
    the channel busy. The value is 120*\\(t_b\\), where \\(t_b\\) is the duration
    of one time slot [48]. The average number of retransmissions \\(n_R\\) is modelled
    using Geometric distribution, that is the probability of number of failures before
    first successful transmission [50]. $$\\begin{aligned} n_R= (1-p)/p. \\end{aligned}$$
    (13) where, p is the probability of successful transmission given by: $$\\begin{aligned}
    p=\\frac{1}{n_c}. \\end{aligned}$$ (14) where, \\(n_c\\) is the number of nodes
    contending for channel access. For the worse case analysis, number of nodes contending
    is taken as number of nodes of the network (n) as stated in [48]. Based on the
    above discussion, \\(t_w\\) of a node can be calculated as the time required for
    receiving start message from all neighbors. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} t_w = k*(t_{tx}+
    n_R*t_{tx}). \\end{aligned}$$ (15) where, k is the average degree of the network.
    Similarly, \\(delay_{u,max}\\) can be written as: $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{u,max}=
    t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$ (16) Next stop location of Linear The data
    packets received in S &C state contain the coordinates of source RNs. The farthest
    RN in the direction of move of Linear will be its next stop location. However,
    there may be a situation where no data packet is received from the farthest RN.
    Such situation may arise due to two reasons: first, there are no BNs (in receive
    state) in the direction of move of Linear and second, data packet from BN may
    be lost due to various reasons (congestion, link quality, etc.). In this case,
    Linear stops at a location that is R meters away from present stop location. Although
    the probability of packet loss is low due to re-transmission, however, loss of
    packet of corner nodes for \\(Re \\ge R_0\\) and of RNs for \\(Re=R_0\\), can
    effect the decision of Linear. 3.5 Critical cases In this subsection, we discuss
    some critical situations that may occur during data acquisition. These situations
    are discussed separately for ease of understanding. 3.5.1 How will a BN mark itself
    as RN if BNs of two MZs are in receive state Fig. 10 BNs laying in different MZs
    Full size image The example discussed for RN selection in previous subsection
    assumed that BNs of one MZ are in receive state. However, in some cases BNs of
    two adjacent MZs may be in receive state as shown in Fig. 10. Nodes 6, 17, 20,
    29, 26, 27, and 30 are the BNs of one subregion. Nodes 7, 19, and 18 are the BNs
    of second subregion and nodes 8, 9, and 21 are the BNs of third subregion. We
    propose a rule based scheme for marking a BN as RN, when BNs of two MZs are in
    receive state. When all neighbors of a BN are BNs of another MZ: The BN will mark
    itself as RN, since it is the only BN of its MZ, among its neighbors. For example,
    refer Fig. 10, where BNs of three subregions are shown, as mentioned above. Node
    8 is a BN of third subregion, and all other neighbors are the BNs of second subregion,
    Hence, node 8 marks itself as RN. When only one neighbor of a BN is in its MZ
    and others are in different MZs: The BN will mark itself as RN, since it is the
    node laying on the corner of its MZ. For example please refer nodes 7, 19, 9,
    and 21 in Fig. 10. For nodes 7 and 19, node 18 is the only neighbor BN in their
    subregion. Similarly, node 9 and node 21 are the only BN neighbors of each other
    laying in same subregion. Thus, these nodes mark themselves as RNs. When more
    than one neighbors of a BN are its MZ and others are in different MZs: The BN
    will measure angle \\(\\theta\\) with RN of its MZ, and declare itself as RN if
    \\(\\theta > \\theta _0\\) (as explained in Section 3.3). For example, refer nodes
    27, 26, 29, 20, and 17 of the first subregion and node 18 of second subregion
    in Fig. 10. These nodes will calculate \\(\\theta\\) from neighboring RN and will
    decide accordingly. 3.5.2 How will data collection be accomplished by multiple
    Linears We have discussed data harvesting by single Linear, so far. However, for
    a large area multiple Linears can be utilized for data collection. Figure 4 shows
    data acquisition by two Linears, where each Linear has a fixed area in which it
    can collect data, named as its ROA. It is equal to \\(\\frac{L}{S}\\), where,
    L is length of the field perpendicular to the direction of move of Linear and
    S is number of sinks. The area is divided into three subregions namely, A, B,
    and C. RN selection, next stop location, and stop time calculation remain same
    for multiple Linears to that of single Linear. However, the maximum range (R)
    with which Linear transmits control signal to wake the nodes, changes for multiple
    Linears. R should be selected in such a way, so that it covers the nodes laying
    in the ROA of the Linear horizontally. Thus, \\(R=\\frac{L}{2S}\\) for proper
    functioning of the proposed protocol. However, the BNs laying near to the dividing
    boundary of ROAs of both sinks (nodes 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 4) may receive signals
    from both Linears. These nodes can send data to any of the Linear, and Linears
    can exchange data before the generation of control actions. The range R decreases
    with increase in number of sinks and so does the area from which data is to be
    collected for current S &C state. However, number of sinks must be bounded by
    a value where R becomes 2r. Since increasing number of sinks beyond this point
    will result in a collecting region as small as the sensing range of a sensor node
    that in turn leads to one hop data collection by Linear. Number of collecting
    regions are \\(\\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil\\) for one sink where W is the length
    of the area along the direction of move of Linear. Lemma 1 Total energy consumption
    of the network decreases by \\(\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}\\) for S Linears.
    Proof Let us assume that energy consumption of the network with \\(N_b\\) sources
    (BNs) and one sink is \\(E_T\\), where, $$\\begin{aligned} E_T= N_{b}h_{avg}E_b.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (17) where, \\(E_b\\) is the average energy consumed in one hop
    transmission and is calculated taking the various factors (backoff and retransmissions)
    into account, as discussed in Section 3.4 and \\(h_{avg}\\) is average number
    of hops between source and destination. As number of sinks increases by 1, ROA
    and R of a sink shrink by a fraction of 2. Number of collecting regions are \\(\\lceil
    \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S\\), from which data is to be collected for S sinks. Energy
    consumption for S sinks is: $$\\begin{aligned} E_{T}^{''}= \\lceil \\frac{W}{R}
    \\rceil SE_S. \\end{aligned}$$ (18) where, \\(E_S\\) is energy consumption for
    one collecting region and is given by: $$\\begin{aligned} E_S= N_b^{''}h_{avg}^{''}E_b=\\frac{N_b}{
    \\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S}h_{avg}^{''}E_b. \\end{aligned}$$ (19) where, \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is the average number of hops when distance between source and destination in
    one collecting region with reduced range R. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{E_{T}}{E_{T}^{''}}=\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (20) Validation of the proposed lemma is done through numerical
    analysis and network simulation. For numerical analysis, \\(h_{avg}\\) and \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is calculated by the pdf given in [49] and \\(E_b\\) is calculated as the sum
    of energy dissipated in different states namely, idle, transmit, and receive.
    In idle state, average number of backoffs is calculated by the equation proposed
    in [48]. Energy in transmit and receive states are calculated taking average number
    of retransmissions (discussed in Section 3.4) and packet size into account. Values
    are calculated and simulated for two networks of 42 nodes (low average degree
    \\(\\approx\\) 6) and 150 nodes (high average degree \\(\\approx\\) 20) deployed
    in an area of \\(900\\times 500\\) \\(m^2\\). For network simulation, average
    of 100 runs is considered as the values saturate after this point. The result
    shown in Fig. 11 depicts that numerical analysis matches with the simulation.
    Number of sinks is varied from 1–2 for this network since, range of sink R reduces
    to 125m that is less than 2r (160m). 4 Results and discussion Fig. 11 Validation
    of Lemma 1 through numerical analysis and simulation Full size image Table 3 Simulation
    setup Full size table The section discusses the performance of the three modules
    of LERC. Simulation is performed on the discrete event simulator NS3.30.1 and
    various simulation parameters are mentioned in Table 3. Experiments are performed
    on a data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes deployed in a \\(900\\times 500 m^2\\)
    area. The range of sensor nodes is set as 80m as this is the minimum range for
    connected graph. The data set [51] consists of soil moisture values and position
    information at 42 locations in a farm. The proposed work identifies source nodes
    (RNs) among BNs that in turn depend on position information of sensor nodes. Moreover,
    the proposed work intends to reduce energy consumption in data collection from
    RNs. Thus, the data set is apt to add a realistic flavor for simulating the impact
    of the proposed work. First, energy consumption in reduced overhead broadcast
    is discussed in comparison to cluster trail [26] and MARP [28]. Since, reduced
    overhead broadcast does not depend on the data values of sensor nodes, different
    networks are created keeping transmission range constant. Number of nodes are
    increased randomly to vary average degree of the network by 2. Average degree
    is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. In Section 4.2, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear and event region map construction at Linear
    for different value of \\(\\theta _0\\) is discussed. RN selection depends on
    BN identification (proposed in [7]) that in turn is data dependent. Scarcity of
    available agriculture data set restricts the evaluation of RN selection, stop
    time modelling and total energy consumption to one data set [51]. However, robustness
    of RN selection is shown in different topology by varying \\(\\theta _0\\). RN
    selection is scheme is compared with the recent state-of-the-art methods in terms
    of event region map construction in Section 4.2.2 for \\(\\theta _0=0^\\circ\\).
    Stop time modelling is evaluated by comparing the end to end delay in transmitting
    data from RNs to Linear with the modelled stop time of Linear. End to end delay
    is recorded for different values of \\(\\theta _0\\). Total energy consumption
    of the proposed scheme compared with CH based data transmission, cluster trail,
    and MARP is presented in Section 4.4. Total energy consumption of data collection
    is the sum of energy consumed in BN detection, RN selection and transmission from
    identified RNs to Linear. BN detection mechanism [7] is our previous work and
    is evaluated in same simulation environment and data set. Thus, reduced overhead
    broadcast, RN selection, and stop time modeling are evaluated by simulation in
    this work and total energy consumption includes simulation results from our previous
    work in same simulation environment. 4.1 Analysis of reduced overhead broadcast
    Energy consumption in dissemination of start message for the proposed reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme, cluster trail scheme, and flooding is shown in Fig.
    12. The proposed mechanism is tested for different networks, keeping transmission
    range constant. Number of nodes are increased to vary average degree of the network
    by 2. Average degree is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. The proposed
    reduced overhead broadcast scheme consumes 33.3%\\(-\\)61.1% and 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    less energy than the flooding scheme [28] and cluster trail [26] respectively.
    A node receives k number of messages and transmits only one message as opposed
    to multiple message transmissions in others. Fig. 12 Energy consumption in start
    message dissemination Full size image 4.2 Analysis of data transmission from BNs
    to Linear and construction of MZ map at Linear In this subsection, variation in
    number of RNs and corresponding energy consumption of the network, with respect
    to the tuning of angle \\(\\theta _0\\) is presented. As \\(\\theta _0\\) increases,
    number of RNs (source) decreases and so is the energy consumption (as shown in
    Fig. 13). The values written in brackets are the number of RNs for corresponding
    \\(\\theta _0\\). \\(\\theta _0\\) is varied from 0\\(^\\circ\\) to 45\\(^\\circ\\)
    (maximum \\(\\theta\\) is 45\\(^\\circ\\) from the formula given in Section 3.3),
    with an interval of 1. However, only those values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in the figure for which there is a change from previous value. When \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\), all BNs act as data transmitters to Linear. A BN does
    not mark itself as a RN if its \\(\\theta\\) (angle of the gradient of line joining
    it to its previous RN) is less than \\(\\theta _0\\). Thus, number of RNs keeps
    on decreasing with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\),
    number of RNs and energy consumption are minimum. For this value, only the BNs
    that are one hop neighbors of Linear and the corner nodes act as RNs. However,
    this value is not the optimum one to achieve reliability (Re), since it depends
    on the MZ construction at Linear. Fig. 13 Variation of energy consumption in data
    transmission from RNs to Linear with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Fig. 14 MZ map at Linear for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 0 Full size image Fig. 15 Variation
    in the construction of MZ at Linear with varying \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Linear constructs MZs, depending on the data and position information received
    from RNs. Constructed MZs at Linear for some values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in Figs. 14 and 15. When \\(\\theta _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\) (refer Fig. 14), all
    BNs send data to Linear and MZ is constructed with 100% reliability. As \\(\\theta
    _0\\) increases, number of RNs decreases gradually and MZ at Linear changes. For
    example, when \\(\\theta _0\\) is 5\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 34
    do not mark themselves as RNs. However, exclusion of these nodes have insignificant
    impact on construction of MZ at Linear (it can be clearly seen in Fig. 15a). Similarly,
    for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 15\\(^\\circ\\) nodes 15, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31 are excluded
    (Fig. 15b) and for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 20\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 17 and 20 are removed
    from RN set having a negligible variation in MZ map at Linear (Fig. 15c). When
    node 30 marks itself as non-RN node for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) (Fig.
    15d), distortion in MZ map is seen with respect to the original MZ for \\(\\theta
    _0\\) = 0\\(^\\circ\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\) only corner nodes
    and one hop neighbors are marked as RNs. (refer Fig. 15e). Thus, it can be inferred
    from the above discussion that as value of \\(\\theta _0\\) increases, number
    of data transmitter BNs and overall energy consumption decreases. However, after
    a certain value of \\(\\theta _0\\), data collected from RNs become insufficient
    to construct a correct MZ map at Linear. For the topology under consideration
    \\(\\theta _0\\) should be less than or equal to 20\\(^\\circ\\) for a reliable
    construction of MZ map at Linear. Moreover, Fig. 15f shows the constructed MZ
    map for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) without corner nodes 4 and 12. The
    map shows that corner nodes are key enablers for MZ map construction and hence,
    must be selected as RNs. 4.2.1 Safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) To test the variation
    of MZ map with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) further, networks are deployed by varying
    number of nodes from 50–150 with an increase of 1 in average degree in the area
    900\\(\\times\\)500 \\(m^2\\). Change in boundary and BNs was insignificant for
    the networks of more than 150 nodes. RNs are identified by varying \\(\\theta
    _0\\) from \\(0^\\circ -45^\\circ\\) and effect on the boundary is observed. As
    \\(\\theta _0\\) increases number of RNs decreases and so is the energy consumption
    of the network. However, the reconstructed boundary of MZs deforLinear with decrease
    in number of RNs. \\(\\theta _0\\) after which no significant change in energy
    consumption is recorded for various networks is shown in Fig. 16. The results
    show that the minimum value among all recorded values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(20^\\circ\\).
    Maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) to retain the shape of coarse boundary is shown in Fig.
    16. For correct reconstruction of boundary, maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\).
    Thus, \\(\\theta _0\\) must be tuned between \\(20^\\circ\\) and \\(30^\\circ\\).
    \\(\\theta _0\\) selected in this range reduces energy consumption while maintaining
    the correctness of coarse boundary of reconstructed MZ map. Limitation Exact tuning
    of \\(\\theta _0\\) is a limitation of the proposed work as mentioned in Section
    3.3. Fig. 16 Optimal values of \\(\\theta _0\\) for energy consumption and correct
    MZ map reconstruction Full size image 4.2.2 Comparison with RN selection schemes
    The RN selection algorithm of the proposed LERC protocol is compared with COBOM
    [19], DEMOCO [21], and the algorithm proposed in [20]. Figures 17, 18 and 19 show
    the selected RNs among BNs and the demarcated boundary map by the algorithms.
    Both the algorithms identify lesser number of RNs than the proposed scheme, however,
    give ambiguous and incorrect results. Fig. 17 RNs and event region construction
    by COBOM [19] Full size image As shown in Fig. 17, COBOM identifies 9 RNs among
    20 BNs. If a node has different reading (depending on threshold) than its neighbors,
    it is marked as BNs. RNs are selected among BNs by suppressing the neighbors.
    A node in COBOM declares itself as RN if none of its neighbors broadcast their
    status as RN within a predefined time. RN transmits its data and its neighbors’
    IDs. Thus, every two-hop neighbors are marked as RNs. Node 27 informs the sink
    that its neighbors, nodes 18, 19, and 22 are in different subregion. On the other
    hand, node 21 informs that nodes 9, 13, and 22 are in same subregion. Nodes 17
    and 8 informs that nodes 7 and 18 are in different subregion. According to these
    reports, sink draws a boundary as shown in Fig. 17 where nodes of two different
    subregions are merged (please refer Fig. 14 for correct map). COBOM is designed
    for continuous object boundary monitoring, where only two subregions exist: one
    in which object is present and second in which object is not present. Fig. 18
    RNs and event region construction by DEMOCO [21] Full size image Fig. 19 RNs and
    event region construction by the scheme proposed in [20] Full size image DEMOCO
    reduces number of BNs and hence, number of RNs to minimize number of source nodes.
    It enhances COBOM by selecting only \"IN\" nodes as BNs leaving \"OUT\" nodes.
    Thus, it selects BNs that lay on one side of the boundary. BNs, RNs, and the event
    region boundary constructed at BS by DEMOCO is shown in Fig. 18. It reduces number
    of RNs to 5, however the event region boundary formed at BS is Incorrect. The
    BNs belonging to four event regions are entirely suppressed since, DEMOCO selects
    nodes laying one side of the boundary as BNs. Thus, neighbors of BNs laying in
    different event regions are not selected as BNs and RNs. DEMOCO reduces number
    of RNs to a great extent, however, this in turn leads to suppression of information
    from different event regions. The algorithm proposed in [20], identifies a node
    as BN if its data value is different from at least one neighbor and distance from
    this neighbor is least among the distances from all of its neighbors. Every two
    hop neighbor among BNs is selected as RN. In this course, the algorithm reduces
    RNs by 72% as compared to LERC. However, such suppression leads to information
    loss and the constructed event region map is faulty as shown in Fig. 19. 4.3 Stop
    time for the Linear In this subsection, the modelled stop time is evaluated by
    varying the application dependent threshold \\(\\theta _0\\) as shown in Fig.
    20. Calculated stop time is 30seconds for network of 42 nodes and simulated End
    to End (E2E) delay for \\(\\theta _0\\) = \\(0^\\circ\\) is 23.5seconds. The E2E
    delay decreases slightly with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\), as number of RNs decreases
    with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\) (explained in previous subsection). Decrease
    in number of source nodes in turn decreases in-network traffic and retransmissions.
    Hence, E2E delay decreases. However, for \\(\\theta _0>40^\\circ\\) E2E delay
    saturates at 23.05seconds as decrease in number of RNs seizes beyond this point
    (shown in previous subsection). The modelled stop time for two sinks is lesser
    than that of one sink because of the number of hops between Linear and farthest
    RN. E2E delay for two sinks is less than the modelled stop time and decreases
    slightly with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). Hence, it can be concluded that modelled
    stop time of Linear is adequate to collect data from all RNs. Fig. 20 Variation
    in end to end delay with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image 4.4 Overall
    analysis of the system The proposed scheme is compared with a clustering based
    data collection by mobile BS moving on fixed trajectory [41], to prove the efficacy
    (in terms of energy consumption) of data transmission from BNs to Linear over
    the data transmission from CHs to mobile BS. Next, the proposed scheme is compared
    with MARP that is a recent sensor actuator coordination protocol. Further, the
    proposed scheme is compared with two recent agent based routing protocols. Energy
    efficient Geographic Routing Protocol based on mobile sink (EGRPM) [23] is mobile
    BS based data collection protocol, whereas, Energy Efficient Layered Routing Protocol
    (EELRP) [52] is a static BS based layered routing protocol. In addition, the proposed
    scheme is compared with cluster trail [26] that is a communication protocol implementing
    limited broadcast for mobile BS location information dissemination. Experiments
    are performed on the data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes. Total energy consumption
    is the energy consumed in transmitting start message from Linear to nodes and
    data transmission from RNs to Linear. To test reduced overhead broadcast scheme
    we varied number of nodes since BNs are not required for it. However, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear for varying number of nodes requires selection
    of BNs in each setting. Scarcity of available agriculture data set restricts the
    performance evaluation to this data set [51]. However, variation in number of
    nodes can be done by extrapolation technique. Fig. 21 Comparison of total energy
    consumption with recent protocols Full size image The proposed scheme performs
    better in terms of energy consumption as shown in Fig. 21. For network of 42 sensors,
    there is 12 %, 19%, 24%, 34%, 56% decrease in energy consumption with respect
    to EGRPM, CH based scheme, cluster trail, MARP, and EELRP, respectively. Total
    energy consumption of the proposed scheme is the sum of energy dissipation in
    BN selection (algorithm proposed in [9]), start message dissemination, and data
    transmission from selected RNs to Linear. For CH based data transmission, there
    are two phases namely, initial and collection. Initial phase involves control
    message flooding from mobile BS to the sensor nodes, hop count transmission from
    each node to BS, and maximum and minimum hop count flooding from BS to sensor
    nodes. Flooding of several control messages incur high energy consumption, however,
    it is a one time process. In collection phase, CHs are elected by several control
    message transmission, sensor nodes are attached to CHs as Cluster Members (CMs),
    and CHs choose another CH as next hop for forwarding of data transmission. At
    the end, data is transmitted from CMs to respective CHs and is forwarded to BS
    via another CHs. In the proposed scheme, BN selection algorithm consumes approximately
    529 mJ in which identification of BNs laying on network boundary (one time process)
    consumes 400 mJ (for details please refer [7]). The initial phase of [41] consumes
    less energy (=350 mJ) than the proposed scheme despite of more number of message
    exchanges. The reason behind this decrease is the size of packets. In BN identification,
    data packets are transmitted in addition to the control packet transmission whereas,
    in [41], only control packets are flooded. However, in collection phase the CH
    election, cluster formation, and data transmission consumes more energy than reduced
    overhead broadcast and data transmission from selected RNs. EELRP [52] divides
    the network into sectors centered at the BS that sits in the middle of it. Each
    node transmits three control packets to select agent of their sector and sends
    data to the agent via multi-hop. Agents of the sectors aggregates and forwards
    the data to BS via multi-hop. The proposed scheme performs better than EELRP since
    selecting agent involves multiple messages and moreover, multi-hop data transmission
    between sensor nodes to agent and agent to BS causes high energy consumption.
    Table 4 Key findings of the research Full size table EGRPM [23] divides the network
    into similar grids where the size of grid is decided based on the length and width
    of the network. Each cell nodes flood control messages to identify agent of the
    cell. Mobile BS traverses through the network and stops at four locations on the
    periphery of the network. Each cell node sends data to the agent of cell via one-hop
    or multi-hop. The agent then transmits data to mobile BS via one-hop or multi-hop.
    LERC performs better than EGRPM in terms of energy consumption as in EGRPM selection
    of agent is an energy consuming process due to flooding of control messages. Moreover,
    all nodes are source nodes and forwards data towards agent via multi-hop. Moreover,
    agent forwards data to mobile BS via multi-hop. Average path length is 5 for EGRPM.
    LERC achieves less energy consumption by reducing number of source nodes and minimizing
    location information messages of mobile BS. Energy consumption of cluster trail
    is more than the proposed scheme as mobile BS location information broadcast consumes
    much energy as shown in previous subsection. Data transmissions from sensor nodes
    consume slightly more energy due to the movement of sink. In some cases, BS moves
    before data is received by it. In such cases, nodes follow the trail generated
    and ends up into many multihop transmissions. The proposed scheme consumes less
    energy than MARP [28], because of two reasons. First, the reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme and second is the selective sources. In MARP, actuator floods its control
    message to establish a path from each source to it. Flooding causes high energy
    consumption as already shown in previous subsection. Moreover, all nodes transmit
    sensed data to the actuator during its pause time that consumes more energy than
    the data transmission from a few RNs in the proposed scheme. A summary of the
    key findings in this research is presented in Table 4. 4.5 Interpretability and
    explainability of performance gain over existing methods The performance gain
    of the proposed mechanism is twofold: Correct map construction and Low energy
    consumption. Correct map construction is achieved by transmitting data from RNs.
    The existing mechanisms for RN selection mechanism are developed for selecting
    appropriate nodes among BNs. However, these methods do not include the communication
    cost from RNs to BS. Therefore, to evaluate the communication cost of the proposed
    mechanism, it is compared with existing communication protocols. Thus, the proposed
    scheme is compared with two class of state-of-art mechanisms: RN selection mechanisms
    and communication protocols. Correct map construction is achieved by the proposed
    mechanism even if nodes of more than two event regions lie nearby. The existing
    methods fail to reconstruct the boundaries at BS in such a scenario (As described
    in Introduction section and shown in the results (Figs. 17 and 19). However, in
    case of two event regions sharing a single boundary, existing methods perform
    better than the proposed mechanism as less number of RNs are selected by existing
    mechanisms. As RNs are the sources for data transmission, less number of RNs result
    into reduced energy consumption. There are two components contributing for low
    energy consumption in data transmission for local map construction than the existing
    methods. First component is the reduced overhead in Linear location information
    dissemination. Each node waits for its neighbour to transmit the control packet
    having Linear location information and sends only one message. Second component
    is the reduced number of sources. However, for a particular boundary, decrease
    in number of RNs beyond a point reduces the energy consumption but hampers the
    correctness of map constructed at Linear. Selection of this point is the limitation
    of our work as mentioned in above subsection. The cost of correct local map construction
    with low energy consumption at Linear is increased delay. Linear waits for a certain
    period of time modelled as the Stop Time before decision making and actuation.
    This time includes the waiting time of nodes for location information dissemination
    of Linear and the data transmission time from the farthest RNs to Linear. The
    waiting time for Linear location information dissemination ensures reduced energy
    consumption and data transmission time guarantees the correctness of constructed
    map. However, the application under consideration can tolerate the increased delay.
    5 Conclusion The paper develops a distributed lightweight scheme for event region
    map construction at Linear. It identifies minimal set BNs as source nodes and
    models stop time of Linear to collect information from these nodes. A reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for location information dissemination where
    each node transmits only one message. This scheme addresses the challenge of reducing
    message overhead in location information dissemination. Stop time is modelled
    as the sum of control message transmission to the farthest BN, and data packet
    transmission from it to Linear. The challenge of modelling adequate stop time
    for data collection is addressed in this module. Next, to reduce network traffic,
    a minimal set BNs are selected as data transmitters (RN) to Linear. The RNs are
    selected such as the data transmitted by them must construct a correct map at
    Linear. Moreover, data collection in multiple Linear scenario is investigated.
    Simulation results demonstrated a significant decrease in energy consumption with
    respect to the state-of-art mechanisms. Data availability Not applicable. References

    Keywords: Internet of Everything; Internet of Things; cloud computing; security;
    privacy; smart systems 1. Introduction The digital transformation of the 21st
    century has ushered in a new era of connectivity, where everyday objects, devices,
    and systems are becoming increasingly interconnected, intelligent, and data-driven.
    As a result of the exponential emergence of the Internet in interconnected networks,
    most technology must adhere to more rigorous standards. This transformative phenomenon
    is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) [1,2]. However, beyond
    the IoT lies a more comprehensive and expansive concept known as the Internet
    of Everything (IoE), which expands the boundaries of network connectivity with
    intelligent devices and is forecasted to see even more rapid advancement in the
    future [3]. The IoE is an ecosystem where devices and things are connected to
    the Internet, and where people, processes, and data are seamlessly integrated,
    creating a web of interconnectedness that transcends traditional boundaries [4].
    The Internet of Everything (IoE), as delineated by Cisco Systems Inc., encompasses
    an intricate network of interconnections involving individuals, processes, data,
    and IoT devices. According to Cisco’s estimations, the forthcoming 15 years are
    poised to yield substantial advantages from IoE implementation in the global public
    sector, amounting to an impressive USD 4.6 trillion. Simultaneously, the private
    sector is expected to generate a remarkable USD 14.4 trillion in economic value
    during this period [5]. In this digital realm, objects can communicate with each
    other, make autonomous decisions, and interact with humans in ways that were once
    the stuff of science fiction. The IoE concept not only encompasses smart devices
    and sensors but also leverages data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud
    computing, and advanced networking technologies to create a symbiotic relationship
    between the digital and physical worlds. It promises to revolutionize industries,
    enhance the quality of life, and address some of the most pressing global challenges,
    from healthcare and transportation to energy efficiency and sustainability. This
    introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the IoE ecosystem, its
    key components and challenges, and the transformative impact it is poised to have
    on various domains of human activity. In the following sections, we will delve
    into the fundamental concepts, technologies, applications, and emerging trends
    of the Internet of Everything. In this paper, we have divided the structure into
    sections and subsections. In the introduction part, we introduced the concept
    of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and its transformative potential, setting
    the stage for our journey. In the section on related works, we examine existing
    research and innovation efforts, highlighting the progress made thus far. The
    materials and methods section delves into the critical components of the IoE,
    emphasizing the convergence of the IoE that underpins this revolutionary concept.
    Our discussion of the results underscores the dynamic and multifaceted nature
    of IoE innovation. Ultima, the promise of IoE technologies and innovation is substantial,
    offering boundless opportunities for a brighter and more connected future. The
    motivation to explore IoE technologies is driven by its capacity to solve complex
    challenges. The IoE has the potential to address global issues such as the integration
    of physical and digital realms, creating a landscape where devices, systems, and
    individuals converge, interoperate, and share data in real time. In conclusion,
    this exploration of IoE technologies and innovation sets the stage for a compelling
    journey into the interconnected world of the future. By understanding and leveraging
    IoE, we can pave the way for a more efficient, sustainable, and connected society
    that unlocks opportunities for growth and transformation across all sectors. 2.
    Related Works The evolution of the Internet of Everything (IoE) has been a subject
    of profound interest and investigation in recent years. Researchers and scholars
    alike have delved into various facets of the IoE, seeking to unravel its intricate
    web of connections between people, processes, data, and objects. A significant
    body of related works has emerged, shedding light on the transformative potential
    of the IoE in diverse domains, including industry IoT (IIoT) and cognitive IoT
    (CIoT), as shown in Figure 1. These studies have elucidated the critical role
    of the IoE in enhancing efficiency, enabling data-driven decision making, and
    ushering in the new era of connectivity. Figure 1. The Internet of Everything
    (IoE). The IoE plays a pivotal role in enabling the creation of innovative services,
    based on the Internet of Things (IoT), fog, and cloud computing paradigms. IoT-based
    sensors are poised to enhance data transmission for analysis, thus contributing
    to improved decision making and an overall increase in the quality of citizens’
    lives [6]. The IoE is anticipated to receive significant amounts of attention
    in the coming years, especially with the emergence of new, exciting technologies
    in the sectors of networking, software, hardware, and luxury-oriented services
    for humans [5]. Several researchers have made significant contributions, with
    diverse objectives that collectively enhance the capabilities of the IoE. Antonios
    et al. conducted a systematic literature review on semantic technologies in smart
    cities, with objectives centered on identifying trends and challenges in adopting
    semantic interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient urban
    environments [7]. In the context of the Internet of Everything (IoE) environment,
    the incorporation of infrared communication into the smart home system emerges
    as a noteworthy development. Researchers [8] have effectively addressed the longstanding
    challenge wherein a significant portion of infrared-communication-based household
    appliances faced limitations in their integration into the smart home network.
    This innovative effort not only resolves this problem but also helps to lower
    the implementation costs of such a smart home system, making it more affordable
    and useful in the everyday lives of the general population. Another study attempted
    to replicate a multitude of pragmatic Internet of Everything (IoE) scenarios,
    mirroring real-world applications. In this pursuit, this paper adeptly harnesses
    the capabilities of the Cisco Packet Tracer, an instrumental tool employed in
    the experimental setup [9]. This comprehensive exploration necessitates the interconnection
    of a substantial array of sensors and devices, effectively emulating the complexities
    that are inherent to IoE ecosystems. Moreover, this investigative work encompasses
    the deployment of a diverse range of network components, including routers, switches,
    and servers, with IoT devices thus culminating in the establishment of a fully
    operational network infrastructure, like the contributions such as [10]. Numerous
    researchers are eagerly contributing to holistic performance enhancement by adopting
    heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms that are used extensively for time–cost
    optimization in cloud computing [11]. Equally, in [12], the study focuses on elevating
    various performance aspects of quality management (QM) and bolstering consumer
    confidence within the Internet of Everything (IoE) framework. The study introduces
    a QM platform designed to prioritize swift responses and minimize latency in acquiring
    sensor data, while also ensuring authentication, data consistency, and transparency
    in the context of cold supply chain logistics. Additionally, an innovative adaptive
    data smoothing and compression (ADSC) mechanism is proposed to efficiently reduce
    the size of IoE data. This facilitates storage within edge gateways, even when
    they have limited computational and storage capacities. This research contributes
    significantly to optimizing cold supply chain logistics by harnessing IoE and
    blockchain technologies to enhance quality management and transparency in supply
    chain operations. 3. Materials and Methods Systematic mapping or scoping studies
    aim to offer a comprehensive perspective on a specific research field by categorizing
    and organizing existing research. These studies primarily delve into the body
    of available research to assess the breadth of various subjects, publication frequency,
    emerging research patterns, and the sources where relevant studies have been disseminated.
    In this particular study, the systematic mapping process adheres to the recommendations
    outlined by Petersen et al. [13]. In accordance with the systematic mapping study
    guidelines, the key procedural stages encompass defining research inquiries, scouring
    for pertinent academic papers, screening these papers, annotating abstracts with
    relevant keywords, extracting data, and creating a visual representation, as illustrated
    in Figure 2. Each of these steps yields specific outcomes, and the ultimate product
    of this entire undertaking is a systematic map, which is further elucidated in
    [13,14]. Figure 2. Systematic mapping [13]. Definition of Research Questions (Research
    Scope)—The principal objective of a systematic mapping study is to establish a
    comprehensive view of a specific research domain, determining the extent and nature
    of the research and findings available in that domain. Conducting the Search for
    Primary Studies (All Papers)—The identification of primary studies was accomplished
    by employing search terms within scientific databases or by manually perusing
    relevant conference proceedings and journal publications. Screening of Papers
    for Inclusion and Exclusion (Relevant Papers)—Inclusion and exclusion criteria
    were applied to sift through studies that were pertinent to addressing the research
    inquiries, discarding those that did not meet the criteria. Keywording of Abstracts
    (Classification Scheme)—Keywording served as a method to expedite the development
    of the classification scheme and ensure that it took into account existing studies,
    thereby reducing the time required. Data Extraction and Mapping of Studies (Systematic
    Map)—Once the classification scheme had been established, the relevant articles
    were organized within it, signifying the practical phase of data extraction. 3.1.
    Research Questions The primary research question (RQ) of this systematic mapping
    study was: “What innovations are derived from IoE technology?” This primary question
    was divided into seven RQs. Table 1 lists the formulated RQs along with the rationale
    behind each RQ. Table 1. Research questions. 3.2. Data Sources We examined twelve
    electronic databases as our main sources for potentially relevant studies. Google
    Scholar was omitted from the selection due to its lower precision in delivering
    results and the significant overlap with results from other data sources. The
    electronic databases utilized during the search process are detailed in Table
    2. Table 2. Electronic databases. 3.3. Search Terms To ensure a thorough search
    of pertinent studies, it is crucial to identify the appropriate search terms.
    Kitchenham et al. [15] introduced the population, intervention, comparison, and
    outcome (PICO) perspective as a valuable framework for this purpose. This perspective
    has been widely adopted in numerous systematic literature reviews (SLRs). Below,
    the relevant PICO terms are listed: Population: primary studies on the Internet
    of Things; Intervention: IoE innovations; Comparison: problems, innovation, advantages,
    limitation performance metrics, and future directions; Outcome: innovation, advantages,
    and limitations of IoE technology. (‘‘Internet of Things” OR “Internet of Everything’’
    OR “Internet of Everything Technologies’’ OR “Internet of Everything Trends” OR
    “Internet of Everything Limitation” OR “Internet of Everything Innovations’’)
    AND (‘‘Artificial Intelligence’’ OR ‘‘Smart Environment’’ OR “Smart Systems’’
    OR ‘‘Cloud Computing” OR ‘‘Security Privacy’’ OR “Network Technologies”) 3.4.
    Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria In this systematic mapping study, inclusion and
    exclusion criteria were used to select and excludestudies from the data sources
    to answer the RQs. These criteria were applied to all studies retrieved during
    the different phases of the study selection procedure (see Table 3). Early cited
    articles were also included, provided the full text was available. Table 3. Inclusion
    and exclusion criteria. 4. Results and Discussion In this section, all the RQs
    are answered by analyzing the results extracted from the collection of primary
    studies. In the course of our discussions, each primary study is referenced using
    a unique Paper Identification (PID), and these PIDs correspond to the research
    works summarized in Appendix A. 4.1. RQ1: To Which Domains Has the IoE Been Heavily

    enhancing industrial robotics and manufacturing through innovative sensor devices.
    Optimization of Network Technologies: Various researchers [3,24,45,46] have made
    8% contributions to IoE research in the domain of network technology optimization.
    Through the connection of terrestrial IoT networks and the resolution of associated
    problems, their research aims to improve networking performance. Business Strategies:
    Researchers [47,48,49,50,51] have extended IoE research into the realm of business
    strategies. Together these, research initiatives explore the transformative potential
    of the IoE in various business contexts. The business domain makes a substantial
    contribution, accounting for approximately 9% of the overall IoE applications
    compared with other domains. The Education Domain: In the field of education,
    6% of IoE research is applied to this domain. Researchers [52,53,54] are focused
    on unlocking the revolutionary possibilities offered by the Internet of Everything
    (IoE). These research initiatives, taken together, aim to improve educational
    experiences and reinforce security by incorporating IoE platforms. The Smart Systems
    Domain: Within the domain of smart systems, researchers [37,44,55,56] share common
    objectives in IoE research contributing significantly to the research landscape,
    with an 8% contribution among other domains. These researchers have successfully
    enhanced relevant strategies within the smart systems domain. The Agriculture
    Domain: In the domain of agriculture, researchers [27,57] have made significant
    contributions, with IoE technologies representing 8% of their collective efforts
    to enhance agricultural best practices. In summary, a total of 11 diverse domains
    within the Internet of Everything (IoE) landscape have benefited from the collaborative
    efforts of researchers who share common objectives, which are described in this
    study. As depicted in Figure 3, the cloud computing, fog, and edge collaboration
    domain represents 25%, signifying its substantial prevalence in the IoE landscape
    compared with other domains. This prominence can be attributed to its central
    role in enabling IoE services, minimizing latency, and streamlining data processing
    and analysis. This domain effectively caters to the fundamental infrastructure
    and connectivity demands of IoE, rendering it a primary focal point for researchers
    and practitioners in this field. Figure 3. IoE technology in various domains.
    Collectively, these researchers have contributed to the advancement of similar
    domains, addressing critical challenges and fostering innovation through their
    IoE expertise. Therefore, there are also interconnections between researchers’
    work in various domains. This interdisciplinary collaboration leads to innovations
    that leverage IoT technologies to address complex challenges across diverse domains.
    Table 4 offers a structured summary of the number of studies within the IoE field,
    illustrating the interconnections among studies in different domains and their
    contributions to diverse IoT applications. Furthermore, as addressed in RQ1 discussions,
    Figure 3 presents the percentages of research undertaken in various domains, enhancing
    the comprehensibility of the analysis. Table 4. Number of studies and interconnections
    in IoT applications. 4.2. RQ2: What Types of Problems Exist in IoE Innovations?
    The Internet of Everything (IoE) encompasses a wide range of innovations and technologies
    that aim to connect not onlydevices and people, but also data, processes, and
    things in a more comprehensive and integrated manner. As a result, IoE innovations
    can address a diverse set of problems and challenges across various domains. Based
    on the analysis of this study, we identify the current problems in IoE innovations.
    Below are some common types of problems in IoE innovation. 4.2.1. Healthcare As
    healthcare becomes more patient-centric, it needs a multilayer architecture to
    manage the enormous amount of data generated by the system, such as to control
    COVID epidemics/pandemics while maintaining privacy and addressing protection
    issues in healthcare [16,17]. The proliferation of the e-commerce market has posed
    challenges to staff safety, product quality, and operational efficiency, especially
    for cold-chain logistics (CCL). Recently, the logistics of vaccine supply under
    the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has re-aroused public attention and led to calls
    for innovative solutions to tackle the challenges remaining in CCL [18]. 4.2.2.
    Smart Environments Due to the unprecedented increase in the use of IoE technology
    and the volume of data it generates, there is a need to develop a state-of-the-art
    architecture to support a wide range of applications to manage smart city resources
    efficiently and intelligently [19,47]. The main challenge in realizing the smart
    city vision is providing seamless interoperability between the IoE entities [7].
    This is due to most of the systems nowadays working in a silo-based manner and
    not being able to be connected or communicate with other systems [8,20,23]. Security
    has become a hot subject of particular concern, with issues of complicated technology
    and a massive volume of data [37]. The IoE also poses considerable challenges
    to firms, including the development of interoperability between systems, coping
    with entrenched industry partners that do not collaborate with the new developments,
    path-dependent legacy processes and transactions, contractual and liability issues,
    security challenges, loss of control, as well as privacy concerns related to the
    explosion of data collected and used by businesses and their smart things [41,44,48,58].
    4.2.3. Power Systems, Virtualization, Distributed Systems, and Automation The
    IoT evolves into the IoE by incorporating the concept of things. A further step
    towards a Tactile Internet requires significantly reduced latency [3]. The coordination
    and management of the IoE in different equipment is challenging, and the energy
    consumption efficiency could be much higher, which is the bottleneck of battery-operated
    IoT equipment [46]. To meet the growing demands for IoE devices, the current power
    supply system needs improvement in both system and unit-level energy storage and
    management [55]. Challenging environments include environments where the medium
    is inhomogeneous, or the signal propagation is subject to high scattering and
    multipath effects. In addition, peer-to-peer networking of small devices and smart
    sensors will attract even more attention, with increased integration of participator
    sensing within the Internet of Things [29]. The disaster area is a constantly
    changing environment, making it challenging to distribute supplies effectively.
    The lack of credibility of IoE devices’ data operations, trust evaluation, and
    accurate information about the required goods and potential bottlenecks in the
    distribution process can be detrimental [42,43]. The IoE is expected to reinvent
    the business and the automation wheel altogether. From operational models to business
    and manufacturing frameworks, everything is likely to change with the change in
    data available and the smart connectivity between people and machines for critical
    decision making [59]. For several IoT applications, a long range, low cost, and
    low power consumption are the main connectivity constraints to meet, making many
    network technologies impractical [60]. 4.2.4. Cloud, Fog, and Edge Sensory infrastructure
    deployment and sensing technique development across different domains may share
    common challenges and specificities, which should be considered when designing
    an architecture. That is, sensors or sensory infrastructures belonging to one
    domain should be transmitted to and used by another domain when needed [24,26].
    One main challenge is moving these data from the underlying IoT to the cloud;
    architecture must support resource sharing across other domains [26,28]. Malicious
    attack detection and mitigation are essential issues for the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) [29]. Massive devices will lead to explosive traffic growth, which in turn
    will cause a significant burden for data transmission and content delivery [25,33].
    The distributed environment used for the IoE’s generation of big data (BD) has
    the potential to lead to data storage and processing problems. Inherent problems
    are the reason for the inefficient working of the applications in the cloud environment
    [21,22,34]. Several challenges include the significant fluctuation of user devices’
    requests at the edge side, the lack of collaboration among edge nodes, service
    delays, resource exploitation in multidevice fog-cloud architecture, and problems
    associated with time-sensitive applications [19,30,31,32]. 4.2.5. Digital Marketing
    and Blockchain Ongoing challenges persist in maintaining security within this
    context, while also adapting to evolving legal privacy requirements, many of which
    demand further technical clarification [60]. In the age of the Internet of Everything
    (IoE), intricate patterns of connectivity emerge among individuals, processes,
    data, and devices. When evaluating the assessment of companies operating within
    the IoE industry, the predominant issue revolves around substantial uncertainty
    [51]. Critical concerns in the IoE domain include user consent and data security,
    encompassing mobile devices and diverse service providers [27,58]. In the IoE
    ecosystem, the majority of “things” consist of low-power, low-performance devices.
    Several device attributes, such as security, privacy, power consumption, and computational
    capabilities, pose challenges when integrating a blockchain environment into the
    IoE [35]. 4.2.6. Data Security and Deep Learning With the increasing ubiquity
    and sophistication of facial recognition technology, a potential security and
    privacy concern regarding the exposure of facial data linked to sensitive personal
    information within the expansive Internet of Everything application platform arises
    [40]. Across various domains, the Internet of Everything generates copious data,
    encompassing domains like healthcare systems, traffic management, smart city surveillance,
    educational platforms, social networks, and government entities, among others.
    Scouring through this extensive dataset and locating specific data or keys presents
    a formidable challenge [56]. To safeguard the integrity of data, multiple security
    protocols operate in tandem with confidential keys, aiming to furnish security
    services. The primary hurdle lies in securely exchanging or distributing keys
    between two parties operating over an inherently insecure network [39]. Most existing
    anomaly detection solutions within the Internet of Everything are characterized
    by time-consuming processes and exhibit suboptimal accuracy levels [61]. 4.2.7.
    Agriculture The combined forces of climate change and a swiftly growing global
    population have significantly burdened agriculture. This, in turn, has created
    a ripple effect on the Earth’s water resources, a critical component of sustainable
    development. The imperative to transition away from fossil fuels for powering
    irrigation systems, prompted by climate change, necessitates striking a delicate
    balance [57]. Addressing the challenges within this sector is pivotal in order
    to reinvigorate it and propel it towards enhanced progress [27]. 4.2.8. Education
    Teaching has evolved beyond the mere transmission of content knowledge; it now
    emphasizes the development of the practical “how, when, and why” aspects of applying
    this knowledge in real-world contexts [53]. The complexity in designing and implementing
    IoE-based educational systems arises from the need to create multiple intelligent
    agents that infuse intelligence into every facet of the teaching–learning experience.
    The absence of intelligence within IoE-related systems can impede the management
    of the vast volume of information generated by individuals and devices within
    these systems [52]. To establish a smart campus, a range of systems is essential,
    including those for detection, monitoring, and analysis [54]. Based on the discussion,
    Table 5 has outlined the common challenges encountered in IoE innovation across
    diverse domains. Meanwhile, Figure 4 showcases the specific number of problems
    that researchers have focused on within their respective domains in the IoE landscape.
    Figure 4. Number of IoE problems focused on. Table 5. Common problems in IoE innovation.
    4.3. RQ3: What Is the Contribution of the IoE to Each Innovation? Researchers
    from different fields have strived to harness the IoE’s potential for addressing
    domain-specific challenges. This subsection synthesizes their efforts, highlighting
    common themes in research contributions. 4.3.1. Healthcare An exceptionally spectacular
    usage of the IoE was while the whole world suffered with the COVID-19 pandemic.
    The healthcare domain has witnessed significant IoE-driven improvements, and one
    of them is aimed at tracking and containing pandemics such as COVID-19 [16]. Leveraging
    accurate tracking technologies, cloud computing, and interoperable devices, researchers
    have focused on screening and identifying infected individuals during their daily
    routines. Other research endeavors [17,18] have proposed a multilayer architecture
    and a cyber-physical platform framework that applied the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) and digital twin (DT) technologies, respectively, to promote information
    integration and provide smart services for different stakeholders in the healthcare
    area. 4.3.2. Smart Cities and Urban Environments Smart cities have been at the
    forefront of IoE research, with a focus on resource allocation and job offloading
    architectures using intelligence-enriched 6G architectures [19]. The concept of
    EdgeOSH [20] has been introduced, revolutionizing home automation through edge
    computing. Researchers [21,22] have adopted fog aims to enhance data processing
    through the blockchain–fog architecture network (BFAN) whereas others [22] have
    introduced fog nodes (FN) within fog computing (FC) to facilitate IoT applications
    in urban environments, satisfying mobility support, low latency, and geo-distribution
    requirements. As a part of smart cities, [8] specifically focused on smart homes
    through introducing convenience and energy efficiency to daily life within smart
    homes. 4.3.3. Cloud, Fog, and Edge Collaborations Mutual objectives shared by
    several researchers [24,25,26,27,28] were achieved through adopting cloud, fog,
    and edge environments in IoE. Researchers have proposed a cloud-based architecture
    for resource sharing (CARS) and the energy-efficient cloud-based Internet of Everything
    (EECloudIoE) [25]. These architectures introduce geographically distributed platforms
    connecting sensors and various IoE components, providing valuable services to
    end-users. Dhaya and Khantavel contribute to this landscape by focusing on algorithmic
    efficiency within multi-data-center environments, further optimizing resource
    management in cloud-based IoE platforms [28]. Moreover, the paper [26] underscores
    the importance of integration by outlining a research agenda for the integration
    of IoT and cloud computing across various application fields. The peer-to-peer
    central-registry-biased Internet of Everything protocol (P2PRioEP) [27] formalizes
    provisions for hybrid peer-to-peer IoT networks, promoting efficient collaboration
    and data exchange within IoE ecosystems. Xu et al. introduce adaptive mechanisms
    for dynamically collaborative computing power and task scheduling (ADCS) [32].
    This approach enhances the efficiency of edge computing by dynamically allocating
    resources and tasks, aligning to optimize edge computing in IoE scenarios. Yi
    et al. reimagine IoE as an end–edge–cloud collaborative system that promotes the
    development of digital twin-based methods within edge computing [33]. Jain et
    al. highlight the importance of cyber twins in network frameworks by introducing
    a metaheuristic with blockchain-based resource allocation techniques [34]. Sachdev
    navigates key security and privacy issues related to edge AI in IoT/IoE digital
    marketing environments [56]. Bera et al. focus on enhancing security by introducing
    an artificial-intelligence-based blockchain-envisioned access control framework.
    This framework addresses the critical need for robust security measures within
    fog and cloud environments [29]. Velasquez et al. identify key challenges in developing
    a fog orchestrator to support IoE, particularly its impact on fog service orchestration
    tasks [30]. This research objective aims to streamline the orchestration of services
    within fog environments, ensuring efficient and reliable IoE operations. The objective
    of [31] is to introduce a conceptual model for mixed reality (MR) applications
    within fog and cloud environments. By enhancing user experiences through IoT/IoE
    models, this research contributes to the evolving landscape of mixed reality applications,
    which is increasingly relevant in the context of IoE. 4.3.4. Advancements in AI
    The authors of [59,61] both leveraged artificial intelligence in the IoE to enhance
    anomaly detection. The authors of [61] propose a novel deep learning framework
    that combines decomposition methods, deep neural networks, and evolutionary computation.
    Furthermore, innovations in force and tactile sensors, along with AR sensors,
    drive advancements in industrial robotics and manufacturing [59]. 4.3.5. Security
    in the IoE Security remains a paramount concern in IoE research. Innovations include
    novel blockchains such as “PUFChain” [35], which is designed for resource-constrained
    IoT environments. Various authentication schemes have been proposed for 6G IoE-based
    vehicular communication environments [36], emphasizing privacy preservation and
    security. Security and privacy challenges posed by personal smart devices used
    within enterprise settings were explored by [41]. Zhan et al., in their study,
    introduced the Internet of Everything smart logistic network (IoE-SLN) to improve
    smart logistics [37]. Various transportation system applications were integrated
    to enhance logistics parameters, supported by mathematical analysis. IoE research
    on distributed systems focuses on disaster management [42]. Researchers propose
    the integration of blockchain, the IoT, and the IoE to streamline disaster responses,
    reduce response times, and ensure the secure distribution of goods. Furthermore,
    content-based intelligent trust evaluation (CITE) schemes have been introduced
    for collecting trustworthy data in large-scale sensor-cloud systems [43]. 4.3.6.
    Optimization of Network Technologies with IoE The virtualization of networking
    services is explored, with a focus on customized and on-the-fly interconnectivity
    [29]. Other research emphasizes connecting terrestrial IoT network segments to
    satellite backends via satellite broadband [62]. Further, Iannacci aims to build
    an inclusive vision of the IoT, IoE, Tactile Internet, and 5G by leveraging MEMS
    technology, with a focus on energy harvesters (EH-MEMS) and radio frequency passives
    (RF-MEMS) [3]. A data manipulation method proposed by [46] aims to reduce energy
    consumption and network traffic in IoT networks, with an enhancement from software-defined
    networking (SDN). 4.3.7. Enhancing Business Strategies via the IoE IoE research
    extends to the realm of business strategies. Researchers explore how the IoE impacts
    business models and value creation [48]. Additionally, studies evaluate the implications
    of the IoE on marketing analytics [49], new product development, and management
    [50]. Approaches for determining objective and subjective weights in decision
    making are also introduced [51]. Demirkan et al. explored the impact of emerging
    big data and smart analytics on transforming connected products into “smart service”
    businesses [47]. This described a paradigm shift in value chains towards continuous
    data flow through complex business systems. 4.3.8. The IoE in Education Looking
    at an education perspective, the IoE has a transformative potential in improvising
    the field of learning. Ref. [52] focuses on developing system of systems (SoS)
    architectures to support educational contexts, fostering novel educational applications
    and dynamic interactions. Secure and agile architectures for IoE-based educational
    models and learning analytics systems (LAS) are proposed [53]. Furthermore, campus
    security management and notification systems are designed to enhance security
    and monitoring [54]. Researchers have similar objectives in terms of providing
    advancement in education services in the IoE environment. 4.3.9. IoE Research
    for Smart Systems The authors of [44,55] are both engaged in the area of smart
    systems in IoE research. Specifically, their research underlines the significance
    of efficient power supply systems with a high-output performance and extended
    lifetime, placing a strong emphasis on self-power capability in order to guarantee
    the long-term viability and maintenance-free operation of IoE networks. Additionally,
    these researchers expand their focus to include the design of architectural models
    for managing tourism information effectively, introducing the concept of smart
    tourism [44]. Fan et al., in their paper, describe that their objectives revolve
    around enhancing power supply systems and architectural models for the IoE while
    incorporating tourism management strategies [55]. Next, in their research, Pedro
    et al. introduced a cognition module for gathering information from smart systems
    to create knowledge for intelligent services [58]. The goal was to develop a generic
    framework for various smart systems, enabling horizontal integration. Similarly,
    research by Vaya and Hadpawat aimed to provide efficient keys or data-searching
    mechanisms for clients to explore big data within a database [56]. The respective
    studies share common objectives in the realm of IoE in terms of contributing to
    various smart system enhancements. Adenugba et al. demonstrated how smart irrigation
    systems powered by renewable energy sources (RES) could substantially improve
    crop yield and agricultural profitability [57]. They emphasized control and monitoring
    using sensors and environmental data from the Internet of Everything (IoE). Kumar
    et al. aimed to attain a standard quality in crops, focusing on duration, measure,
    hygiene, and blooming stem. They proposed an advanced prototype to enable continuous
    tracking and informed decision making for farmers, using data mining principles
    [27]. Researchers have proposed smart operating systems to streamline IoE system
    management for practitioners [23]. Further, the emerging areas in Internet of
    Everything (IoE) research were examined, revealing several key domains where researchers
    have made notable contributions. Figure 5 illustrates this and includes smart
    cities (23.08%), marked by urban applications and resource allocation; smart systems
    (30.77%), focusing on efficient power supply and architectural models; cloud/fog/edge
    (15.38%), involving collaborations between the IoE and cloud technologies; disaster
    management (15.38%), integrating blockchain and the IoT for logistics and disaster
    response; network technologies (7.69%), emphasizing networking virtualization;
    and education (7.69%), aiming to enhance educational systems. Smart systems garnered
    the most attention from researchers, with smart cities being the second most explored
    domain. This analysis showcases the multifaceted nature of IoE research, spanning
    various domains and applications. Figure 5. Contributions in Emerging Areas. The
    research contributions summarized in this article emphasize the IoE’s versatility
    and transformative potential. They highlight the diverse ways in which IoE technologies
    can address domain-specific challenges and inspire interdisciplinary collaboration.
    As the IoE continues to evolve, researchers from various domains are poised to
    contribute to its growth and maturity [63]. 4.4. RQ4: What Are the Most Frequently
    Used Evaluation Metrics? Evaluation metrics play a vital role in gauging the quality
    of the IoE. Various evaluation metrics are at our disposal for assessing IoE innovation,
    as illustrated in Figure 6. The lines and circles in Figure 6. represent the evaluation
    metrics and the total number of primary studies associated with the enhancement
    of each specific performance metrics. The employment of multiple evaluation metrics
    is of paramount importance, since an innovation may excel under one metric but
    underperform when assessed with another [64]. Therefore, selecting the right evaluation
    metrics is crucial for ensuring the proper and optimal development of IoE innovation.
    Quantitative evaluation, a methodology that relies on numerical indices derived
    primarily from objective data collection methods, systematic and controlled observation,
    and a well-defined research design, comes into play. Specifically, it is imperative
    to specify the evaluation metric. Within the realm of IoE innovations, the researchers
    in this study primarily considered accuracy, energy consumption, power consumption,
    completion time, and cost as the most significant dimensions for evaluation, as
    illustrated in Table 6. Figure 6. Visualization of performance metrics used in
    IoE. Table 6. Performance metrics in primary studies. 4.5. RQ5: What Are the Limitations
    in Each IoE Innovation? In the realm of Internet of Everything (IoE) research,
    several research works across various domains have made significant contributions,
    but they are not without their limitations. These limitations, when analyzed collectively,
    provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by researchers in harnessing
    the potential of the IoE. The limitations identified in most of the research works
    are summarized below. 4.5.1. Storage Challenges Several research works, such as
    [16], highlight the challenge of high storage usage when collecting data in IoE
    applications. The sheer volume of data generated by IoE devices can lead to storage
    constraints, impacting the scalability and long-term feasibility of solutions.
    Limited storage capacity, as observed in [17], can result in extended data transfer
    times to the cloud. This limitation hampers the timely availability of critical
    information, potentially impacting decision making processes. 4.5.2. Computation
    Overhead Computation-intensive tasks, driven by multiple scheduling algorithms,
    as can be seen in [19,33], can lead to a high computational overhead. This limit
    affects the efficiency and real-time performance of IoE systems, especially in
    resource-constrained environments. In IoE systems, especially those involving
    financial transactions, drawbacks related to latency, as identified in [42], can
    impact the overall user experience. Transaction processing delays may deter users
    from adopting IoE solutions. 4.5.3. Power Supply Assessment The research work
    [55] emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive assessment of power supply systems
    in IoE. Neglecting to evaluate the continuity and quality of power supplies can
    lead to disruptions in IoE applications, particularly in scenarios where uninterrupted
    power is crucial. 4.5.4. Lack of Assessment Some research, including [20], has
    limitations in terms of assessment. Failure to evaluate factors such as user experience,
    cost, and delay can result in incomplete insights into the overall performance
    and feasibility of IoE solutions. 4.5.5. Data Size Effect The impact of the data
    size on performance [34], as mentioned in [37], can be a significant disadvantage.
    The researcher overlooked and underestimated the need for efficient data handling
    and processing techniques in IoE applications. 4.5.6. Cost-Intensive Technologies
    High costs associated with infrastructure, such as core cloud connectivity via
    high-speed optical links pose a limitation in terms of the scalability and affordability
    of IoE deployments, as in [34]. Nevertheless, Ref. [29] used blockchain technology,
    known for its cost-intensive nature. Hence, implementing such technologies, as
    [29,34] do, can lead to high expenses, making scalability and cost-effectiveness
    challenging. 4.5.7. Technical Feasibility The research work [48] focuses on business
    model management but may not be directly applicable at the technical infrastructure
    level. This constraint highlights the need for aligning business models with technical
    feasibility. 4.5.8. Response Time Oversights Response time oversights, as noted
    in [19], can be resulted from extensive routing packets in networks. Equally,
    Ref. [27] focused on passing messages safely; however, the response time was not
    measured as well as in [39]. Failure to consider response times can impact the
    usability and efficiency of IoE environments. 4.5.9. Data Privacy, Accuracy, and
    Integration Ensuring data accuracy and fostering inter-agency collaboration are
    essential for data-driven decision making in the IoE. Research works in [22] overlooked
    the limitations associated with data accuracy and integration between different
    government agencies. Elsewhere, accuracy discussions, as omitted in [53], are
    critical, especially in applications where precision is paramount. Data privacy
    in [31] needs to be addressed comprehensively to ensure the trustworthiness of
    IoE systems. This research is closely linked to security concerns, as discussed
    in [65], where data integrity emerges as a prominent issue in various cloud computing
    scenarios, necessitating the implementation of robust security strategies to tackle
    this challenge. 4.5.10. Extensive Network Network elements, such as the case discussed
    in [39], disregarded the heavy utilization of the network, while the research
    work in [46] describes the omission of the packet loss adversely affected the
    network’s heavy usage in their research contributions. 4.5.11. Adaptability Dhaya
    and Kanthavel focused on the requirement for adaptive adaptability to a variety
    of platforms and contexts, neglecting the limitations of pre-defined approaches
    in multi-data-center systems [28]. 4.5.12. Limited Data Ingestion Conversely,
    studies conducted by [27,43,57] exhibit limitations related to restricted data
    acquisition, primarily centered on indoor data obtained from sensing devices.
    Broadening the scope of data sources has the potential to enrich the range of
    applications within the Internet of Everything (IoE) [66]. Below is a summary
    in Table 7, and Figure 7 presents limitations of individual research works. The
    lines and circles in Figure 7 illustrate the limitations of the IoE, along with
    the total number of primary studies that have identified similar research gaps
    in this area. Figure 7. Limitation in IoE Innovations. Table 7. Limitation of
    IoE innovation based on the primary studies. 4.6. RQ6: What Are the Trends and
    Directions of the IoE in Each Innovation? In the dynamic domain of Internet of
    Everything (IoE) research, numerous researchers have made noteworthy contributions,
    each envisioning specific future avenues for advancing the field. These future
    research trends and directions, when clustered together based on common themes,
    provide a comprehensive roadmap for the IoE’s continued growth and evolution.
    Scalability and Adaptability: Researchers, such as [16], have laid the foundation
    for transformative IoE applications. Future endeavors involve exploring the scalability
    and adaptability of these applications to accommodate evolving digital landscapes
    and ensure their sustained impact. Component Performance: A common thread among
    papers is the focus on component-level performance [19]. Researchers plan to design,
    evaluate, and optimize individual components within IoE systems, ensuring a deeper
    understanding of their roles and contributions to system efficiency. Validation
    and Testing: The study described in [17] emphasizes the need for rigorous validation
    and testing. Researchers intend to evaluate IoE systems using practical toolkits
    and real cloud environments, providing empirical insights and validating the practical
    applicability of their findings. Integration and Efficiency: Several papers, including
    [55], emphasize the integration of various systems within IoE networks. Future

    Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Artificial intelligenceMachine
    learningDigital technologyDams and leveesRisk management 1. Introduction The assessment
    of risk and uncertainty is crucial for ensuring the safety of infrastructures
    and dams (Hariri-Ardebili, 2018, Kalinina et al., 2016). Collecting and quantifying
    data is essential for making informed decisions about design and safety, with
    the ultimate goal of protecting both people and property. However, the traditional
    approach of manual analysis of data in dam engineering can be improved by leveraging
    artificial intelligence (AI) to process and analyze large amounts of data (Chen
    et al., 2020c). With AI, patterns and anomalies (Himeur et al., 2021) that may
    not be apparent to human engineers can be automatically identified, making risk
    assessment and decision-making a more systematic and intelligent process. Developing
    the physical models to simulate the behavior of dams under different conditions
    is very difficult and, in most cases, impossible with traditional techniques,
    while AI can use machine learning (ML) algorithms to create more accurate predictive
    models (Emmert-Streib et al., 2020). Historically, the design and analysis of
    dams require extensive expertise and multiple experienced engineers to work on
    a project to optimize the design layout (BFHPSOeBD, 1997), while AI can use optimization
    algorithms to find the optimal design (Hamidian and Seyedpoor, 2010, Hariri-Ardebili
    and Pourkamali-Anaraki, 2022) including all the uncertainty sources (Abdollahi
    et al., 2022) which might be hidden for a human operator. While manual inspections
    are still essential to detect potential hazards, a network of sensors can facilitate
    real-time monitoring (Chelidze et al., 2013, Clarkson et al., 2021, Ren et al.,
    2022b). AI can also use decision-making algorithms to propose more accurate and
    efficient solutions compare to single human decisions (Yang et al., 2021b, Gomes
    et al., 2020, Chang et al., 2005). AI-based analysis can help in reducing the
    time and cost associated with manual analysis, making it more efficient, especially
    for large-scale structures such as dams. AI is becoming increasingly reliable
    in engineering, but it still requires human supervision to ensure that the results
    are accurate and that any potential biases or errors in the data are identified
    and corrected (Floridi et al., 2018, Pan and Zhang, 2021, Shneiderman, 2020).
    AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on, so it is important
    to ensure that the data used to train the model is accurate, unbiased, and representative
    of real-world conditions (Sambasivan et al., 2021). Additionally, AI models may
    be more efficient, but they also need to be validated and verified by human engineers
    (O’Keefe and O’Leary, 1993). Human supervision is also important in the interpretability
    of the results (Linardatos et al., 2020) generated by AI models. AI models can
    provide results and predictions that are difficult for humans to understand, so
    it is important for human engineers to be able to interpret and explain the results
    and predictions of the AI models. AI models can provide simpler models that are
    easier for humans to understand, but it depends on the problem being solved and
    the design choices made by the engineers building the model. In some cases, the
    complexity of the model is necessary to accurately capture the relationships and
    patterns in the data. Ultimately, the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability
    is a design decision that must be made by the engineers building the AI system.
    In the case of safety assessment of dams and hydropower projects, it is crucial
    for human engineers to validate the AI results and predictions, as the safety
    and well-being of people and properties depend on it. This can be done by taking
    the following steps: (i) model inspection: The engineers can inspect the model’s
    architecture and its internal workings to ensure that it makes logical sense and
    is aligned with expectations. (ii) testing on known data: The engineers can test
    the model on a dataset of known outcomes and compare the predictions made by the
    model against the actual results. This can help identify any errors or biases
    in the model. (iii) explanation methods: The engineers can use explanation methods,
    such as saliency maps or decision trees, to understand how the model arrived at
    its predictions and whether its reasoning is reasonable. (iv) human expert review:
    The engineers can also involve human experts in the field to review and validate
    the results produced by the AI model. This can provide a second opinion on the
    model’s performance and help identify any limitations or areas for improvement.
    (v) monitoring and continuous improvement: The engineers can set up monitoring
    systems to track the model’s performance over time and make continuous improvements
    to ensure that it remains accurate and relevant. Within this narrative review
    paper,1 we have made several original contributions: • Comprehensive Literature
    Review: We have conducted an extensive review of the existing literature on the
    use of AI and new technologies in dam engineering. This review covers a wide range

    AI and new technologies in dam engineering. We have highlighted the limitations
    and barriers, such as data availability, algorithmic transparency, and ethical
    considerations, that need to be addressed for successful implementation. Additionally,
    we have identified the potential benefits and opportunities these technologies
    offer, such as improved dam safety, efficiency, and sustainability. • Insights
    and Recommendations: Building on the literature review, we have provided valuable
    insights and recommendations for future research and practical applications. We
    have discussed the strengths and limitations of various technologies, including
    machine learning, digital twins, drone technology, and remote sensing. Our analysis

    The field is constantly evolving, and new methods, algorithms, and applications
    are emerging. Ensuring the inclusion of the most current and relevant research
    requires thorough and ongoing literature review.2 (iv) interdisciplinary nature:
    Dam engineering sits at the intersection of civil engineering, data science, and
    other related disciplines. Integrating knowledge from different fields, understanding
    complex technical concepts, and bridging gaps in terminology and methodologies
    pose challenges in effectively communicating the interdisciplinary nature of the
    research. This narrative review paper consists of three main parts. Section 2
    provides an overview of AI’s concept and history, along with its classifications.
    Additionally, it delves into ML as a subset of AI and provides a broad classification
    of various algorithms based on learning style. Section 3 focuses on the application
    of AI in dams, levees, and hydropower engineering. This part covers several topics,
    including dam safety monitoring and early warning systems, accelerated numerical
    simulations, hydropower generation optimization, hydrological and flood forecasting,
    water resource management, dam shape optimization, predictive maintenance, and
    decision-making and risk assessment. Section 4 explores the advanced and digital
    technologies that utilize artificial intelligence in some way and have been applied
    in dams and hydropower. This includes digital twins, the internet of things, drones,
    remote sensing and satellite monitoring, cloud virtual and augmented reality,
    robotics, 3D and 4D printing, and building information modeling. The paper concludes
    with general observations, challenges, and a series of recommendations for future
    directions, as presented in Section 5. 2. Artificial intelligence: A review The
    field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since the 1950s, but it
    has seen periods of increased popularity, followed by periods of reduced funding
    and interest also known as “AI winters” (Haenlein and Kaplan, 2019). The term
    AI winter was first coined by researcher and author Rodney Brooks in the early
    1990s to describe a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research. The
    first AI winter occurred in the 1970s, followed by another in the 1980s. AI experienced
    a resurgence of interest in the late 1990s and early 2000s, known as the “AI springs”,
    due to advances in ML, data availability, and computational power. The field of
    AI has continued to grow in popularity and receives significant investment from
    the government, industry, and academia. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence
    in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans (Hopgood, 2021).
    The goal of AI research is to develop systems that can perform tasks that typically
    require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making,
    and language understanding. There are several approaches to creating AI, including
    rule-based systems, expert systems, machine learning, and natural language processing.
    AI can be divided into two main categories: narrow or weak AI, which is designed
    to perform a specific task, and general or strong AI, which has the ability to
    perform any intellectual task that a human can. Another way to classify AI is
    based on the method of implementation, which includes but not limited to (i) Rule-based
    systems: They use a set of pre-defined rules and logical statements to make decisions,
    and they are useful for solving specific problems. (ii) Expert systems: These
    are a type of rule-based system that uses knowledge from one or more experts in
    a specific field to make decisions. (iii) Machine learning: They use algorithms
    that allow the system to learn from data and improve its performance over time.
    (iv) Natural language processing: They use algorithms to process and understand
    human language. (v) Computer vision: They use algorithms to interpret visual data
    such as images and videos. One possible classification of AI is demonstrated in

    Machine Learning (ML) is a sub-field of AI that focuses on the development of
    algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data and
    improve their performance on specific tasks over time (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015).
    In other words, while AI is a broad field that encompasses a range of approaches
    to creating intelligent machines, ML is a specific set of techniques for enabling
    machines to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. With the
    advent of big data and advances in computing power, ML has become increasingly
    popular in engineering applications, as it can help engineers make more informed
    decisions and optimize complex systems more efficiently. Many “review papers”
    have been published on the application of ML in various fields of science and
    engineering, including reliability and system safety (Afshari et al., 2022), risk
    assessment (Hegde and Rokseth, 2020), uncertainty quantification (Abdar et al.,
    2021), and civil engineering applications (Reich, 1997, Vadyala et al., 2021,
    Zhang et al., 2021c, Thai, 2022, Xie et al., 2020, Sun et al., 2021, Naser and
    Alavi, 2021, Flah et al., 2021, Ye et al., 2019, Salehi and Burgueño, 2018, McMillan
    and Varga, 2022). However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has not
    been a review paper published on the application of AI and ML in the realm of
    dams and levees engineering. Therefore, a review of the current literature on
    this topic could help to identify gaps in the research and facilitate the development
    of new studies. There are different ways to classify ML algorithms based on their
    learning approach, the type of data they work with, and the structure of the models
    they create. One of the most popular classifications is (i) Supervised learning
    where the algorithm learns from labeled data. The algorithm learns to recognize
    patterns and make predictions based on those patterns. (ii) Unsupervised learning
    where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. The algorithm identifies patterns
    in the data and groups them together based on similarities, but without any predefined
    categories. It typically is used for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.
    (iii) Semi-supervised learning that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to train
    the algorithm, and is useful when there is limited labeled data available, but
    a large amount of unlabeled data that can help to improve the model’s performance.
    (iv) Reinforcement learning where the algorithm learns by interacting with an
    environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The
    algorithm learns to take actions that maximize its reward and minimize its punishment.
    (v) Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers
    to learn complex patterns and relationships in data. (vi) Online learning where
    the algorithm learns from data as it arrives in a continuous stream, rather than
    in batches. It is useful when the data is constantly changing or evolving over
    time. The categories mentioned above are not an exhaustive list, and various other
    categorization schemes have been proposed for ML algorithms, including but not
    limited to instance-based learning versus model-based learning, homogeneous versus
    heterogeneous learning, shallow versus deep learning, black box versus transparent
    box, parametric versus nonparametric, generative versus discriminative, and lazy
    versus eager learning. However, this review paper will not delve into the specifics
    of these methods. The purpose of this review paper is not to offer a superficial
    overview of ML algorithms, as this has already been accomplished in numerous other
    review papers (some of which were cited previously). Rather, we aim to present
    a compilation of ML algorithms that enables easy comparison of their applications
    in dams and levees engineering. The classification in Fig. 2 organizes ML algorithms
    according to their functional similarity, based on how they operate. The main
    categories are (i) Regression algorithms are a type of statistical method used
    to model the relationship between variables. This modeling process involves iteratively
    refining the model using a measure of error in the predictions made by the model.
    (ii) Decision Tree algorithms create models that use the actual values of attributes
    in the data to make decisions. These methods construct tree structures where each
    decision forks into further decisions until a prediction is made for a given record.
    (iii) Dimensionality Reduction algorithms aim to summarize or describe data using
    less information in an unsupervised manner, exploiting the inherent structure
    in the data like clustering methods. They are useful for visualizing dimensional
    data or simplifying data for use in supervised learning methods. (iv) Instance-based
    learning uses a database of important training data to make predictions. New data
    is compared to the database using similarity measures to find the best match.
    (v) Association rule learning algorithms are used to identify frequently co-occurring
    items that can be used to optimize decisions. (vi) Clustering algorithms group
    data into clusters based on inherent structures using approaches such as centroid-based
    and hierarchical methods. They are useful for tasks such as anomaly detection.
    (vii) Regularization algorithms penalize complex models and promote simpler models
    that generalize well. They are often used as extensions to regression methods
    and are popular, powerful, and simple modifications. (viii) Bayesian algorithms
    are a family of methods that use Bayes’ Theorem to estimate the probability of
    an event based on prior knowledge or evidence. They are commonly used for classification
    and regression tasks, and can provide probabilistic predictions and uncertainty
    estimates. (ix) Neural Networks are a class of pattern matching that simulate
    the structure and/or function of biological neural networks. They are commonly
    used for regression and classification problems and consist of hundreds of algorithms
    and variations for various problem types. (x) Deep Learning techniques represent
    a recent advancement of neural networks that leverage the availability of affordable
    computing power. They aim at constructing larger and more sophisticated networks,
    often working on extensive datasets of labeled data. (xi) Ensemble methods refer
    to the practice of combining several models to create a stronger one, which results
    in more accurate predictions (Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2021, Adnan et al., 2023a).
    These models are trained independently and their outputs are combined in a way
    that produces a better prediction. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    learning style. 3. Artificial intelligence in dam engineering There are several
    types of applications of AI in hydropower, dams, and levees engineering. The following
    sub-sections review the most important ones. 3.1. Dam safety monitoring & early
    warning systems In dam safety monitoring, AI algorithms are used to analyze sensor
    data and detect potential safety hazards and structural issues in dams. This can
    include monitoring for signs of erosion, seepage, and changes in the dam’s structure.
    One common approach is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data,
    such as strain, displacement, and pressure readings, in order to detect patterns
    and anomalies that may indicate a potential safety hazard. This can include using
    supervised learning algorithms, such as decision trees or support vector machines,
    to classify sensor data into different categories, such as “normal” or “anomalous”
    behavior. Detailed studies related to AI in dam safety monitoring can be found
    in Cheng and Zheng, 2013, Su et al., 2016a, Salazar et al., 2015b, Salazar et
    al., 2021a, Chen et al., 2020a and Mata et al. (2021). Deep learning received
    lots of attention in the past few years in dam safety monitoring (Li et al., 2020b,
    Li et al., 2022a, Li et al., 2022c). Another approach is to use unsupervised learning
    algorithms, such as clustering or anomaly detection, to identify patterns, rates
    of changes, and outliers in sensor data that may indicate a potential safety hazard
    (Chen et al., 2019). For example, a clustering algorithm could be used to group
    sensor readings that are similar together, and then identify clusters that are
    significantly different from the norm, which may indicate a potential safety hazard.

    Fig. 3. Structural health monitoring of dams with four types of response prediction
    methods. Once potential hazards are detected, AI algorithms can then be used to
    predict the severity of the hazard and generate an alert to engineers. Examples
    of AI applications in early warning systems can be found in Su et al., 2011, Cheng
    et al., 2022, Jing and Gao, 2022 and Jehanzaib et al. (2022). Additionally, AI
    models can be used to model the structural response of the dam under different
    loading scenarios. This can help engineers to identify the critical points of
    the dam (Hariri-Ardebili et al., 2021) and to evaluate the stability of the dam
    under different scenarios (Pacheco et al., 2022, Qi and Tang, 2018, Tang et al.,
    2022). The utilization of sensor data for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is
    on the rise, as the fields of structural engineering and data science continue
    to merge. In order to predict structural behavior, traditional methods have relied
    heavily on statistical techniques, as evidenced by prior studies (Tonini, 1956,
    Leger and Leclerc, 2007, Mata et al., 2014). These methods typically involve using
    independent variables such as environmental factors (e.g., water level and temperature)
    and dependent variables (e.g., deformation, cracking, or seepage) to construct
    a regression model. Statistical models such as hydrostatic-seasonal-time (HST),
    hydrostatic-thermal-time (HTT), hydrostatic-seasonal-time-thermal (HSTT), and
    hydrostatic-hysteretic-seasonal-time (HHST) have been used for this purpose (Mata
    et al., 2013, Tatin et al., 2013, Tatin et al., 2015). These statistical models
    typically operate based on many types of input parameters. The most popular ones
    are (Salazar et al., 2015a) : upstream pool level, : season, : time, : time derivative
    (e.g.,  , ), : concrete temperature, air temperature, : water temperature, : impulse
    response function, : lagged variable (e.g.,  , ), : precipitation, : moving average,
    : downstream pool level, : snow melt, : probability density function of error.
    As shown in Fig. 3, the SHM of a dam involves various external and response variables,
    basic sensors, and multiple system behavior prediction methods. The statistical
    models rely on inputs such as water level, air temperature, and rainfall, and
    generate responses based on pendulum recordings, crack opening, seepage, and piezoelectric
    levels. Meanwhile, numerical simulations are employed to predict the responses.
    Before using a numerical model (e.g., finite element model) to forecast future
    responses, it is crucial to validate and verify the model first (Jeremic and Salamon,
    2022). Various types of numerical simulations might be needed during the response
    prediction such as stress analysis, transient thermal simulation, moisture transfer,
    etc. (Pereira et al., 2018, De Sortis and Paoliani, 2007). Table 1 presents a
    non-exhaustive collection of papers that have utilized machine learning (as well
    as a few statistical) methods for response prediction, classification, and clustering
    of dams, as discussed in Section 2. The papers are categorized based on their
    year of publication. In certain studies, optimization techniques are incorporated
    in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of the
    prediction. The table specifies the predicted output quantities and the type of
    dam considered in each study. Additionally, some studies employ a hybrid approach
    (Wang and He, 2007, Karimi et al., 2010, Sevieri et al., 2019, Shao et al., 2018)
    that includes the results of numerical simulations (they are specified in the
    last column of this table). It is important to acknowledge the uncertainties that
    come with the application of machine learning methods in dam response prediction.
    Two significant sources of uncertainty are (i) data uncertainty, also known as
    epistemic uncertainty, which stems from a lack of knowledge or understanding about
    the data used to train the machine learning models. This type of uncertainty can
    be minimized by collecting more data or enhancing data quality. (ii) model uncertainty,
    also known as aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from the inherent randomness
    and variability in the data, and cannot be eliminated by collecting more data
    or improving data quality. Choosing an appropriate model architecture and hyperparameters
    that can accurately capture the variability in the data can help reduce this type
    of uncertainty and lead to more accurate predictions. Table 1. A non-exhaustive
    list of papers that used machine learning (and a few statistical) methods in response
    prediction, classification, and clustering of dams. The data collected encompasses

    Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system Settlement No In 2022, ICOLD hosted
    a benchmark workshop focused on the behavior prediction of a concrete arch dam
    (Malm et al., 2022). Detailed information regarding the monitoring data of the
    case study dam, finite element model, and material properties was provided, and
    participants were asked to predict the short-term and long-term response of the
    dam. A total of 18 teams submitted results, using different methods discussed
    in Fig. 1 (Mata and Serra, 2022, Jellouli and Dufour, 2022, Pirker and Zenz, 2022,
    Farrokh et al., 2022, Lin et al., 2022a, Deka et al., 2022, Corbett et al., 2022,
    Monteiro Azevedo et al., 2022, Corigliano et al., 2022, Salazar et al., 2022,
    Alocen et al., 2022, Catalano and Stucchi, 2022, El Moataz Billah et al., 2022,
    Vitokhin and Ivanov, 2022, Mitovski et al., 2022, Simon, 2022, Gomes et al., 2022,
    Rosin-Corre and Noret, 2022). The organizing team provided a summary of the results,
    which showed significant variability in response prediction that can be attributed
    to aleatoric (or predictive model) uncertainty. Over half of the participants
    used ML methods or a combination of them with other techniques. The outcome revealed
    that none of the ML models provided the absolute best prediction for all response
    quantities and short/long-term behavior. For instance, the coefficient of variation
    (COV) of RMSE for short-term prediction of three pendulum recordings were 0.62,
    1.73, and 1.91. COV of RMSE among participants to predict two piezometric readings
    were 0.69 and 1.70, and finally, the COV of leakage was about 0.24. This requires
    extra effort to develop predictive models that are reliable. 3.2. Expedited numerical
    simulations AI is being increasingly utilized in dam engineering to enhance the
    speed and accuracy of numerical simulations. Among many applications, the ML methods
    are currently utilized in two main applications as discussed below. One specific
    application of AI and ML in dam engineering is in the optimization of the numerical
    simulations used to analyze the behavior of dam systems under different conditions.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to identify the most critical parameters that need
    to be considered in the simulations, thereby reducing the number of simulations
    required and the computational time. This capability is typically used for sensitivity
    analysis (Li, 2021, Amini et al., 2021, Mata et al., 2021, Hariri-Ardebili et
    al., 2021, Guo and Dias, 2020, Salazar and Hariri-Ardebili, 2022, Xiong et al.,
    2022a). ML algorithms can be used in conjunction with numerical simulations for
    uncertainty quantification and reduction purposes (Hariri-Ardebili and Sudret,
    2020). By utilizing ML algorithms, the computational burden of classical Monte
    Carlo methods can be reduced, allowing for more efficient and effective analysis
    of dam systems. The ML algorithms can be trained on a large dataset to predict
    the dam behavior under different conditions, reducing the need for time-intensive
    numerical simulations. ML models can be used for regression (Hariri-Ardebili and
    Salazar, 2020, Hariri-Ardebili et al., 2022, Hariri-Ardebili and Barak, 2020,
    Cheng et al., 2018b, Hariri-Ardebili and Pourkamali-Anaraki, 2018a), classification
    (Hariri-Ardebili and Pourkamali-Anaraki, 2018b, Al-Ruzouq et al., 2019, Salazar
    et al., 2021a, Kravits et al., 2021), and prediction (Lin et al., 2022b) of numerical
    results in dam engineering. Another application of ML in dam engineering is in
    the prediction of dam failures. ML algorithms can be trained on data from past
    dam failures to identify patterns and develop predictive models. These models
    can then be used to assess the risk of future dam failures, helping engineers
    to proactively address potential issues and prevent failures (Kalinina et al.,
    2020). 3.3. Hydropower generation optimization AI algorithms can be used to optimize
    the operation of hydropower plants, by predicting water flow and optimizing turbine
    operation (Bernardes et al., 2022). This is indeed essential for hydropower management
    and scheduling. Examples of ML and AI applications in hydropower plant operation
    optimization in the case of single and/or multiple reservoirs can be found in
    Ohana et al., 2012, Olofintoye et al., 2016, Shaw et al., 2017, Nascimento et
    al., 2021 and Naresh and Sharma (2001). For example, machine learning algorithms
    can be used to predict the water flow in the river, using historical data and
    real-time sensor data. This can include using time-series forecasting methods,
    such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to predict the water flow in the
    near future. These predictions can then be used to optimize the operation of the
    hydroelectric power plant by adjusting the turbine settings accordingly. Examples
    of rive flow forecasting can be found in Liu et al., 2015, de Melo et al., 2019,
    Ahmad and Hossain, 2019, Belotti et al., 2020, Shang et al., 2019, Hadiyan et
    al., 2020 and Li et al. (2021d) for regression problems, and Feng et al., 2020a,
    Maciel et al., 2020 and Liao et al. (2020) for classification problems. Examples
    of rainfall-runoff modeling can be found in Liong et al., 2002, Hsu et al., 1995
    and Chang et al. (2007), while the stream-flow prediction are presented in Ikram
    et al., 2023, Ikram et al., 2022 and Adnan et al. (2023b). Another approach is
    to use reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize the operation of the turbine.
    These algorithms work by learning from historical data and real-time sensor data
    to identify the optimal turbine settings for a given water flow (Bhandari et al.,
    2015, Twaha and Ramli, 2018). For example, a reinforcement learning algorithm
    could be trained to adjust the turbine’s time of use to maximize energy generation
    while minimizing wear and tear on the turbine and maximizing profits. 3.4. Hydrological
    & flood forecasting AI models can be trained on historical data to predict the
    likelihood of flooding and help with flood management (Dornpunya et al., 2021,
    Chang and Guo, 2020, Zarei et al., 2021). AI algorithms work by learning from
    historical data and real-time sensor data to identify patterns and anomalies that
    may indicate an impending flood (Munawar et al., 2022). For example, a supervised
    learning algorithm could be trained to classify sensor data into different categories,
    such as “normal” or “flood” conditions (Mosavi et al., 2018). Additionally, AI
    models can be used to simulate the impact of floods on a particular area (Ayalew
    et al., 2017). This can be useful for evaluating the potential risks and for disaster
    management planning (Ding et al., 2020). Applications of AI and ML in hydrological
    model (ASCE Task Committee on Application of Artificial Neural Networks in Hydrology,
    2000) and regionalization of model parameters (Heuvelmans et al., 2006) are also
    available. 3.5. Water resource management & reservoir operation AI can be used
    to optimize the allocation of water resources for irrigation, drinking water,
    and other uses (Sun and Scanlon, 2019). Machine learning algorithms can be used
    to predict water demand, using historical data and real-time sensor data. These
    predictions can then be used to optimize the allocation of water resources by
    adjusting the flow of water from different sources (Doorn, 2021, Poursaeid et
    al., 2022). Another application is to use optimization algorithms to find the
    best allocation of water resources for a given set of constraints (Eiger et al.,
    1994). This can include using mathematical optimization methods, such as linear
    programming or mixed-integer programming, to find the best allocation of water
    resources that meets the needs of different users while minimizing waste and maximizing
    efficiency (Kingston et al., 2008). Additionally, AI models can be used for water
    distribution system management, for example, to detect and predict leaks in the
    distribution system, and optimize the maintenance schedule (Mounce et al., 2010,
    Fan et al., 2021, Kammoun et al., 2022). AI is also used in environmental planning
    for sustainable water development (Xiang et al., 2021). AI-powered decision support
    system can be used for improved reservoir operation, it can optimize the water
    release from the dam. AI can be combined with optimization algorithms to find
    the best water release strategy for a given set of constraints. This can include
    using mathematical optimization methods, such as linear programming or mixed-integer
    programming, to find the best water release strategy that meets the needs of different
    users while minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency. Additionally, AI-powered
    decision support systems can be used to monitor the water level in the reservoir,
    predict the changes in water level and provide the best decision for the water
    release. This can include using rule-based systems, fuzzy logic, or even more
    advanced techniques such as deep learning. These predictions and optimization
    are used to improve the efficiency and sustainability of dam reservoir operation.
    Applications of ML and deep learning techniques in reservoir operation optimization
    can be found in Liu et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2018) for single reservoirs,
    Xu et al. (2020b) for cascaded reservoirs, and Dariane and Moradi (2016) for multiple
    reservoirs. 3.6. Dam design & optimal shape determination AI-based simulation
    tools can be used to optimize the design of new dams and their associated hydropower
    plants (Flah et al., 2021). Machine learning can be used in the design optimization
    of engineering structures like dams by creating models that can analyze large
    amounts of data and make predictions based on that data. This can help engineers
    to design structures that are more efficient and cost-effective. ML algorithms
    can be used to analyze data related to factors such as hydrology, geology, and
    structural materials to optimize the design of the dam. This can include using
    simulations to model the structural response of the dam under different loading
    scenarios, such as floods or earthquakes. The simulations can be powered by finite
    element analysis can be computationally expensive, and AI-based techniques such
    as surrogate modeling and optimization can be used to speed up the design process.
    Another approach is to use optimization algorithms to find the best dam design
    and shape that meets specific objectives such as minimizing stress levels, construction
    costs, or environmental impacts, or maximizing energy generation. This can include
    using optimization techniques such as evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm
    optimization, or gradient-based optimization methods. These algorithms can search
    through the design space of different dam designs and shapes to find the optimal
    design that meets the specific objectives. Fig. 4(a) showcases the use of particle
    swarm optimization to perform a multi-criteria shape optimization for an arch
    dam. The goal was to minimize both construction costs and tensile stresses simultaneously.
    Examples of application of ML and optimization in dam shape design can be found

    and Salajegheh, 2009 and Li and Wu (2022). AI-based techniques are used to handle
    uncertainties in dam design and shape optimization by using probabilistic modeling,
    robust optimization, uncertainty quantification, and ensemble-based methods (Abdollahi
    et al., 2022, Hariri-Ardebili and Pourkamali-Anaraki, 2022). These techniques
    allow for more accurate predictions and decisions in the face of uncertain input
    data and model parameters. Fig. 4(b) shows different dimension alternatives for

    and Ghaemian, 2017, Hariri-Ardebili and Pourkamali-Anaraki, 2022). 3.7. Predictive
    maintenance AI and ML algorithms can be used for predictive maintenance in dams
    and hydropower systems to help prevent equipment failures, reduce downtime, and
    increase operational efficiency (Kumar and Saini, 2022b). Predictive maintenance
    involves analyzing real-time data and historical performance data to predict when
    equipment is likely to fail and to schedule maintenance accordingly, rather than
    relying on a fixed schedule or waiting for equipment to fail (Serradilla et al.,
    2022). In the case of dams and hydropower, sensors and monitoring devices can
    be installed to gather data on various parameters such as water level, flow rate,
    and pressure. This data can then be analyzed using AI and ML algorithms to identify
    patterns and anomalies that may indicate potential issues (Vallim Filho et al.,
    2022, Fausing Olesen and Shaker, 2020). For example, machine learning algorithms
    can be trained on historical data to detect patterns that lead to specific types
    of equipment failures. These patterns can then be used to identify when similar
    failures are likely to occur in the future. This can include using supervised
    learning algorithms, such as decision trees or support vector machines, to classify
    sensor data into different categories, such as “normal”, “near-failure”, or “failure”
    behavior. By predicting equipment failures before they happen, maintenance can
    be scheduled proactively, reducing downtime and minimizing the risk of catastrophic
    failures (Hallaji et al., 2022). This can improve the overall efficiency of the
    dam or hydropower system, reduce maintenance costs, and extend the useful life
    of the equipment. In addition, AI and ML can be used to optimize maintenance schedules
    based on real-time data, which can further reduce downtime and increase operational
    efficiency (Afridi et al., 2022). Another example is to use condition-based monitoring
    techniques such as vibration analysis, temperature analysis, and others, to monitor
    the health of the equipment. The data collected from these techniques can then
    be analyzed using AI-based techniques such as clustering, anomaly detection, and
    deep learning to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate an impending
    failure. Once a potential failure is detected, the AI algorithms can then be used
    to predict the timing of the failure and generate an alert for maintenance. Additionally,
    AI-based techniques such as deep learning can be used to analyze the images of
    the equipment, such as turbine blades, to detect and predict potential damage,
    and schedule maintenance accordingly. 3.8. Decision-making & risk assessment AI
    can be used to support decision-making and risk analysis in the context of dam
    safety management by analyzing large amounts of data and identifying patterns
    that can inform decision-making (Lin and Hsu, 2017, Tabassi, 2023, Bagstad et
    al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2022b, Assaad and El-adaway, 2020, Allawi et al., 2018).
    Decision-making algorithms, such as decision trees or rule-based systems, can
    be used to model complex decision-making processes and identify the best course
    of action in response to potential risks or emergency situations. These algorithms
    can also be used to evaluate risk by identifying potential outcomes and the likelihood
    of each outcome occurring based on historical data and simulations. In addition,
    AI can be used to develop simulations that can be used to model different scenarios,
    such as extreme weather events or earthquakes, and evaluate their potential impact
    on dam safety. This allows organizations to test different mitigation strategies
    and identify potential risks before they occur. 4. Digital technologies in dam
    engineering In addition to the broad categorization outlined in Section 3, certain
    technologies can derive significant benefits from the use of artificial intelligence.
    Fig. 5 depicts a diagrammatic representation of these technologies. In this section,
    we will examine some of the most significant ones. Download : Download high-res

    technologies in hydropower and dam engineering. 4.1. Digital twins A digital twin
    is a virtual replica of a physical asset, such as a dam, that can be used to simulate
    and test various scenarios, monitor performance, and optimize operations (Haag
    and Anderl, 2018, Jones et al., 2020, Wagg et al., 2020, Singh et al., 2021, Juarez
    et al., 2021). It is typically created using a combination of sensor data, engineering
    models, and other information. To create a digital twin, it is necessary to have
    accurate and up-to-date information about the physical asset, such as its design,
    construction, and operational history. Digital twins have been extensively discussed
    in structural and infrastructural engineering (Naderi and Shojaei, 2023, Teng
    et al., 2021, Broo and Schooling, 2021, Alibrandi, 2022, Ketzler et al., 2020,
    Bado et al., 2022, Khajavi et al., 2019). The digital twin of a dam can be used
    to simulate how the dam will behave under different conditions, such as changes
    in water levels, weather patterns, and structural loads (Zhu et al., 2021, Conde
    López et al., 2022). This can help engineers identify potential issues before
    they occur, such as structural failure, erosion, or flooding. It also allows them
    to test different operational strategies and optimize the dam’s performance. The
    digital twin can also be used to monitor the dam in real-time, using sensor data
    to track key parameters such as water levels, structural integrity, and environmental
    conditions. In addition, digital twin can be used in hydropower projects to optimize
    power generation, by simulating how the dam’s operation affects the power output,
    and by adjusting the dam’s operation in real-time based on sensor data and weather
    forecasts. Applications of ML and AI in digital twins can be found in Stavroulakis
    et al. (2022) and Fahim et al. (2022). There are several examples of real-world
    digital twins in dams around the world: (i) The digital twin platform for health
    monitoring of Yuansuan Dam applies finite element numerical simulation technology
    to the daily operation and maintenance of dams, providing more than 100,000 virtual
    measurement points for dams. (ii) The digital twin of the Three Gorges Dam in
    China is used to monitor the dam’s performance in real-time and simulate how it
    will behave under different conditions. (iii) The Tarragona Dam in Spain is another
    example. The digital twin of the dam is used to optimize its operation and power
    generation by simulating how the dam’s operation affects the power output, and
    by adjusting the dam’s operation in real-time based on sensor data and weather
    forecasts. (iv) The Rance Tidal Power Station in France has a digital twin that
    simulates the power station’s behavior and performance under different conditions,
    such as changes in tide levels and weather patterns, in order to optimize its
    operation and identify potential issues before they occur. (v) An interactive
    geospatial model of Bluestone Dam has been developed from tabular, LiDAR, MicroStation,
    and other data sources (Geosyntec, 2008). The 3D model was developed to document
    the original dam construction, track the various modifications, record quality
    control of construction data, and demonstrate construction specifications for
    the dam. (vi) The digital twin model of Diablo Dam was developed with more than
    82 million data points and achieved 2 cm accuracy (Fig. 6). Machine learning is
    further used to identify the areas of concrete that contain certain anomalies
    (Femmer, 2020). In summary, the strengths of digital twins technology are: (i)
    accurate representation of the physical dam structure and its behavior, (ii) real-time
    monitoring and analysis for early detection of potential issues, and (iii) enhanced
    decision-making through simulation and what-if scenarios. On the other hand, its
    limitations can be summarized as: (i) requires a comprehensive and up-to-date
    digital model, which can be challenging to create and maintain, (ii) relies heavily
    on accurate and reliable data inputs, and (iii) limited availability of standardized
    protocols and frameworks for implementation. Download : Download high-res image

    (IoT) is a network of physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other objects
    embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity which enables these
    objects to connect and exchange data with each other, and with the external environment
    (Li et al., 2015, Rose et al., 2015, Atzori et al., 2010, Gershenfeld et al.,
    2004). IoT systems typically consist of three main components: sensors and actuators
    that collect data and interact with the physical world; gateways or edge devices
    that process and filter the data; and a cloud-based platform that stores, analyzes,
    and manages the data. IoT devices typically use a variety of communication protocols,
    such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks, to connect to the internet and
    to other devices. Embedded processors and micro-controllers are commonly utilized
    by IoT devices for data processing and control functions. IoT data is frequently
    managed and analyzed using big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark, as well
    as specialized IoT platforms like AWS IoT, Azure IoT, and Google IoT. IoT has
    a variety of applications in Civil Engineering (Mishra et al., 2022) including
    but not limited to (i) Smart buildings that use sensors and automation to optimize
    energy use, maintain temperature and humidity, monitor structural health, and
    more (Minoli et al., 2017, Jia et al., 2019, Daissaoui et al., 2020). (ii) Smart
    infrastructure: IoT can be used to monitor and maintain critical infrastructure,
    such as bridges, transportation, tunnels, healthcare system, and nuclear structures
    by embedding sensors to monitor structural health, detect cracks and corrosion,
    and measure traffic flow, among other things (Aleksic, 2019, Berglund et al.,
    2020). This can help prevent accidents and reduce maintenance costs. (iii) Smart
    cities that use data and automation to improve urban services and quality of life
    (Arasteh et al., 2016, Syed et al., 2021). In dam engineering, IoT can be implemented
    in a variety of ways to improve safety, reduce downtime, and increase efficiency.
    Some examples include (i) Sensor networks (Siddula et al., 2018a, Smys et al.,
    2020, Zhang et al., 2021b, Arshad et al., 2019): IoT sensors can be installed
    on a dam to collect data on water levels, structural integrity, and environmental
    conditions. This data can be used to monitor the dam in real-time and identify
    potential issues early. (ii) Remote monitoring (Youssef et al., 2019, Janet et
    al., 2019, Ganesh et al., 2022, Dong et al., 2017, Smith et al., 2022): IoT devices
    can be used to remotely monitor dams, providing engineers with real-time data.
    This can help reduce the need for on-site inspections and maintenance, which can
    be costly and time-consuming. (iii) Predictive maintenance (Bajare et al., 2018,
    Kumar and Saini, 2022a): IoT sensors can be used to collect data on equipment
    usage, wear and tear, and other factors. This data can be used to predict when
    maintenance is needed, reducing downtime and costs. (iv) Control systems (Sathya
    et al., 2019, Siddula et al., 2018b): IoT devices can be used to control and automate
    various aspects of a dam’s operation, such as water levels, power generation,
    and valves. (v) Risk assessment and early warning systems (Varghese et al., 2019,
    Sun et al., 2012, Mallisetty and Chandrasekhar, 2018): IoT devices can be used
    to monitor and analyze data on weather patterns, water levels, and other factors
    to identify potential hazards and provide early warning of potential problems.
    In summary, the strengths of Internet of Things are: (i) enables real-time monitoring
    of various dam parameters and environmental conditions, (ii) facilitates data-driven
    decision-making and predictive maintenance, and (iii) enhances communication and
    coordination between different dam components and systems. On the other hand,
    its limitations can be summarized as: (i) security and privacy concerns regarding
    data transmission and storage, (ii) requires a robust and reliable network infrastructure
    for seamless connectivity, and (iii) integration and compatibility issues with
    existing legacy systems. 4.3. Drone technology Drone technology, also known as
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are aircraft that can be flown without a human
    pilot on board (Irizarry et al., 2012, Gohari et al., 2022, Fan and Saadeghvaziri,
    2019). They are typically controlled remotely by a pilot on the ground or by an
    on-board computer. UAVs come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, from small
    drones to large military aircraft. They can be broadly categorized into two groups:
    fixed-wing and rotary-wing. UAVs typically use a variety of communication technologies
    to communicate with the ground station such as radio frequencies, cellular networks,
    and satellite links. UAVs are often equipped with a variety of sensors, including
    cameras, LiDAR, thermal imaging, and others, to collect data and perform tasks
    such as mapping, surveillance, inspection, and health monitoring (Greenwood et
    al., 2019, Jordan et al., 2018, Trubia et al., 2021, Sivakumar and TYJ, 2021,
    Otto et al., 2018). Drones backend via IoT, cloud computing, big data, and high-end
    security techniques is referred to Internet of Drone Things (IoDT) (Nayyar et
    al., 2020). Coupled application of UAV and machine learning has been reported
    in Bithas et al., 2019, Osco et al., 2021, Kang and Cha, 2018, Samaras et al.,
    2019, Rezwan and Choi, 2022 and McEnroe et al. (2022). The connection between
    UAV and IoT is further discussed in Lagkas et al., 2018, Fraga-Lamas et al., 2019
    and Rana and Singh (2021). Drone technology can be used for structural health
    monitoring in dam engineering (Zhao et al., 2021). Some examples of how drone
    technology is being used in dam engineering are (i) Inspection and Surveying (Henriques
    and Roque, 2015, Khaloo et al., 2018, Pinto et al., 2020, Martínez-Carricondo
    et al., 2021, Congress et al., 2022, Dreier et al., 2022, Antonielli et al., 2018):
    Drones can be used to inspect and survey dam structures, providing detailed images
    and data on the condition of the dam. This can help identify potential issues
    early, such as cracks, leaks, and erosion, and allow for preventative maintenance
    (Feng et al., 2020b, Zhao et al., 2022). Fig. 7 illustrates the crack mapping
    on an arch dam resulting from the alkali-silica reaction in concrete. Alternatives
    to visual inspection are (Freeman et al., 2021) (i-1) inspections using photographs
    and videos (Stewart et al., 2018, Ellenberg et al., 2015), (i-2) inspections using
    3D reconstructions and scanning (Reagan et al., 2017, Bolourian and Hammad, 2020),
    (i-3) inspections using thermal imaging (DeBell et al., 2015). (ii) 3D modeling
    (Angeli et al., 2019, Huang et al., 2019, Buffi et al., 2017, Buffi et al., 2018,
    Ridolfi et al., 2017): Drones can be used to create 3D models of dam structures,
    providing detailed information on the geometry of the dam and allowing for accurate
    simulations of its behavior under different conditions. Unmanned Underwater Vehicle
    (UVV) has been also used in 3D reconstruction of dams (Araújo Filho et al., 2022).
    (iii) Damage assessment (Yan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2022e, Zekkos et al.,
    2022, Jung and Kim, 2017, Nasategay, 2020, Wang et al., 2020c, Wang and Huang,
    2016, Giacomo et al., 2021, Li et al., 2012): Drones can be used to quickly assess
    damage after a natural disaster or other events. (iv) Hydrographic Surveying (Ridolfi
    and Manciola, 2018, Karamuz et al., 2020): Drones equipped with LiDAR sensors
    can be used to create detailed maps of the terrain and water levels, allowing
    for accurate monitoring of water levels and predicting potential flooding (Przyborski
    et al., 2015, Zeng et al., 2022). (v) Monitoring vegetation: Drones can be used
    to monitor the vegetation growth around the dam, which can impact the stability
    of the dam. (vi) Dam construction: UAV can be used to identify the topography
    for suitable site selection of dam construction (Ajayi et al., 2018), dam removal
    (Evans et al., 2022), or quality control of construction (Yin et al., 2023). Download

    of drone technology are: (i) provides high-resolution aerial imagery for efficient
    dam inspection and monitoring, (ii) allows access to remote and inaccessible areas,
    reducing the need for manual inspections, and (iii) enables rapid data collection
    and analysis, saving time and resources. On the other hand, its limitations can
    be summarized as: (i) limited flight duration and range, which may restrict coverage
    for large dam structures, (ii) regulations and airspace restrictions that may
    impact drone operations, (iii) requires skilled operators and specialized training
    for safe and effective drone use. 4.4. Remote sensing & satellite monitoring Satellite
    monitoring of infrastructures is a powerful and efficient way to monitor and manage
    large infrastructure projects such as dams, levees, bridges, and power plants
    (Adamo et al., 2021, Talledo et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2019a, Li et al., 2020a).
    The data obtained from satellite monitoring systems can be used to detect changes
    in the structural behavior and performance of the monitored structures, identify
    potential faults and failures, and assess the effectiveness of maintenance and
    repair operations (Özer et al., 2019a, Özer et al., 2019b). The collected data
    is then analyzed using various techniques, such as ML algorithms, statistical
    analysis, and signal processing, to identify trends and patterns that may indicate
    potential structural problems (Kuchi et al., 2021). This allows engineers and
    maintenance personnel to take timely corrective actions and prevent catastrophic
    failures. Satellite geodesy can be used to measure small movements and deformations
    of the dam structure, such as those caused by changes in water levels, temperature,
    or structural loads. It can be used to measure the volume and water level of the
    dam’s reservoir, which is important for managing water resources and minimizing
    the risk of flooding (Wu et al., 2012). The small surface displacements caused
    by the dam’s construction or by the subsurface movement of soil and rock can be
    measured by satellite to help identify potential stability problems. For example,
    Figure Fig. 8 illustrates the mean deformation velocities of a dam using remote
    sensing. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing
    technique that uses radar images to measure the surface displacement of the Earth’s
    crust. In the case of the dams and levees monitoring, InSAR can be used to measure
    the deformation over time (Sousa et al., 2014, Lv et al., 2013, Bennett et al.,
    2014, Fergason et al., 2015, Carlà et al., 2019, Milillo et al., 2016, Xiao et
    al., 2022, Du et al., 2020, Ullo et al., 2019, Grenerczy and Wegmüller, 2011,
    Tarchi et al., 1999, Othman et al., 2019, Bayaraa et al., 2022, Ruiz-Armenteros
    et al., 2021, Aminjafari, 2017, Ruiz-Armenteros et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2020a,
    Wang et al., 2022b). The InSAR technique involves the use of two or more radar
    images of the same area taken at different times. The radar signals bounce off
    the Earth’s surface and are recorded by the satellite. The images are then combined
    to create an interferogram, which is a map of the phase difference between the
    radar signals. The phase difference is related to the surface displacement of
    the area between the two radar acquisitions. InSAR has several advantages over
    traditional monitoring techniques. InSAR can cover large areas and provide continuous
    monitoring (Corsetti et al., 2015, Bayik et al., 2021). It can provide measurements
    over a long period of time, which is critical for understanding the long-term
    behavior of dams suffering from deterioration (e.g., alkali-silica reaction).
    Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) (Yu et al., 2020) can also be used
    to monitor the dams and levees by measuring the precise location of reference
    points on the structure over time (Barzaghi et al., 2018, Maltese et al., 2021,
    Acosta et al., 2018, Roque et al., 2021, Xiao et al., 2019, Pipitone et al., 2018,
    Yuwono and Prasetyo, 2019, Dardanelli et al., 2014, Reguzzoni et al., 2022). This
    is typically done by installing GNSS receivers at known points on the dam, such
    as survey markers or structural elements. These receivers track the signals from
    the GNSS satellites and calculate their position on the Earth’s surface. By comparing
    the position of the reference points over time, it is possible to detect any movements
    or deformations of the dam. This can be particularly useful for detecting slow,
    gradual movements that may not be immediately noticeable through visual inspections.
    GNSS can be combined with InSAR and ground-based surveys to provide a more comprehensive
    picture of the dam’s behavior over time. Download : Download high-res image (695KB)

    dam using remote sensing technology. Photo adopted from Anghel et al. (2016) with
    permission. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a technology that enables
    the capture, storage, analysis, and presentation of geospatial data. GIS can incorporate
    various types of spatial data such as satellite imagery, land-use records, demographic
    information, and transportation networks, to create maps and visualizations, analyze
    relationships, and make informed decisions (Al-Husseinawi et al., 2018, Hudnut
    and Behr, 1998, Vazquez-Ontiveros et al., 2022, Gökalp and Taşçı, 2009, Xi et
    al., 2018, He et al., 2004, Xi et al., 2022, Ehiorobo and Irughe-Ehigiator, 2011).
    Additionally, GIS technology can utilize AI and ML algorithms to automate various
    tasks, such as classification, feature extraction, and predictive modeling. In
    the field of dams and levees engineering and hydropower, GIS has numerous potential
    applications, including site selection and analysis, hydraulic modeling and analysis,
    risk assessment and emergency planning, and asset management and maintenance.
    For example, GIS can be used to conduct multi-criteria decision analysis to identify
    potential dam and levee sites by analyzing and weighting numerous factors such
    as topography, hydrology, land use, and environmental considerations. Furthermore,
    hydraulic models developed using GIS can simulate the behavior of water flow and
    water levels to predict flood risk and identify potential vulnerabilities in existing
    infrastructure. Finally, GIS can help to manage and maintain the physical infrastructure
    of dams and levees, including inventorying and tracking assets, scheduling maintenance
    and inspections, and monitoring performance and conditions to ensure their long-term
    stability and reliability. In summary, the strengths of remote sensing and satellite
    monitoring technology are: (i) provides wide-area coverage and frequent data acquisition
    for monitoring dam conditions, (ii) allows monitoring of parameters such as land
    deformation, water levels, and vegetation growth, and (iii) supports early warning
    systems for potential hazards and environmental changes. On the other hand, its
    limitations can be summarized as: (i) relies on satellite availability and suitable
    imaging conditions, which can be limited in certain regions, (ii) data processing
    and analysis may require expertise in remote sensing techniques, and (iii) accuracy
    and resolution of satellite imagery may vary depending on the sensor and orbit.
    4.5. Cloud virtual & augmented reality Cloud virtual reality (VR) and augmented
    reality (AR) refer to the use of cloud computing technology to deliver VR and
    AR experiences over the internet (Chi et al., 2013, Chang, 2018). In traditional
    VR and AR systems, the computing power and storage required to generate and display
    virtual and augmented content are located on the device itself. With cloud VR/AR,
    these resources are instead located on servers in remote data centers, and the
    device being used by the user only needs to have the ability to connect to the
    internet and receive the content. The performance of VR/AR can be improved combined
    by ML and deep learning methods (Wang et al., 2021d, Malek et al., 2022). VR and
    AR can be used in infrastructures (Mascarenas et al., 2021, Catbas et al., 2022,
    Sadhu et al., 2023) and dam engineering projects (Spero et al., 2022, Trindade
    et al., 2019, Verdelho et al., 2020, Goff et al., 2016) in a few ways such as
    (i) Site surveying and modeling by creating virtual models (Marques et al., 2014,
    Ros et al., 2018) of the dam site, allowing engineers and designers to explore
    the site and plan the construction process before any physical work is done (Janovskỳ
    et al., 2022, Mirauda et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2009). (ii) Training and simulation
    (Liu, 2021, Opriş et al., 2018): VR and AR can be used to train workers and operators
    on the safe and efficient operation of the dam, and to simulate different scenarios
    such as emergency procedures, maintenance activities, and even extreme weather
    events. (iii) Inspection and maintenance (Cote and Lavallee, 1995, Peres et al.,
    2018, Peres et al., 2016): AR can be used to superimpose digital information,
    such as instructions or repair procedures, on top of the real-world view of the
    dam, enabling workers to perform maintenance and inspections with greater precision
    and efficiency. (iv) Facilitating remote communication and collaboration among
    engineers, designers, and other stakeholders. Fig. 9 illustrates an augmented
    reality of a concrete arch dam with controlling visual elements and different
    network of sensors. It is noteworthy that VR is different from digital twins.
    VR is primarily used to create immersive, interactive experiences that allow users
    to “enter” and interact with a virtual world. Digital twins, on the other hand,
    are used to create digital replicas of physical systems or processes, such as
    dams and infrastructure, that can be used for simulation, analysis, and control.
    VR is inherently interactive, while digital twins may or may not be. VR is typically
    based on pre-designed, static environments, whereas digital twins are based on
    real-time (dynamic) data. Download : Download high-res image (534KB) Download

    Trindade et al. (2019). In summary, the strengths of cloud virtual and augmented
    reality technology are: (i) enables visualization and interaction with dam models
    in a virtual environment, (ii) facilitates collaborative design, planning, and
    stakeholder engagement, and (iii) provides access to centralized data storage
    and computational resources. On the other hand, its limitations can be summarized
    as: (i) dependence on a reliable internet connection for seamless access to cloud
    resources, (ii) challenges in integrating virtual and augmented reality technologies
    with existing workflows, and (iii) requires appropriate training and user adoption
    for effective utilization. 4.6. Smart robotics Smart robotics is a field of robotics
    that involves the integration of advanced technologies, such as AI, ML, computer
    vision, and sensor networks, to enable robots to perform complex tasks with a
    high degree of autonomy and intelligence (Kochovski and Stankovski, 2018, Myung
    et al., 2014, Attalla et al., 2023, Kim et al., 2015, Ahmed et al., 2020). Smart
    robotics has multiple applications in dam engineering and construction, including
    (i) Inspection and maintenance (Ridao et al., 2010, Hirai and Ishii, 2019, Sakagami
    et al., 2019, Palomeras et al., 2006): Robots can be used to inspect the dam for
    signs of wear and tear, cracks, or other issues. They can also be used for routine
    maintenance tasks, such as cleaning and painting, that are difficult or dangerous
    for humans to perform. (ii) Construction and earth-moving (Ha et al., 2019, Guan
    et al., 2022, Hazel et al., 2012): Robots can be used to assist with heavy construction
    tasks, such as excavating, grading, and moving large amounts of earth and rock.
    They can also be used to pour and place concrete, and to install steel reinforcement
    and other materials. (iii) Monitoring and control (Zhang et al., 2020, Zhou et
    al., 2021, Thomessen et al., 2001): Robots can be used to monitor the dam and
    its surrounding area, collecting data on water levels, weather conditions, and
    other factors that are important for the dam’s operation and safety. In summary,
    the strengths of smart robotics technology are: (i) enables automation of routine
    and repetitive tasks, enhancing efficiency and safety, (ii) supports inspections,
    maintenance, and repair activities in hazardous or challenging environments, and
    (iii) provides real-time data collection and analysis for decision-making. On
    the other hand, its limitations can be summarized as: (i) complex integration
    and programming requirements for customized robotic systems, (ii) limitations
    in handling complex or non-standard scenarios that may require human intervention,
    and (iii) high initial investment costs for implementing robotic systems. 4.7.
    3D & 4D printing 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process
    of creating three-dimensional objects by laying down successive layers of material
    (Oropallo and Piegl, 2016, Evans, 2012, Goh et al., 2021). In the context of civil
    and infrastructure engineering, 3D printing can be used to create physical models
    of structures, such as dams, for testing and analysis (Pacina et al., 2022). More
    specifically, 3D printing is widely used to construct small- and large-scale concrete
    structures (Xiao et al., 2021, Buswell et al., 2018, De Schutter et al., 2018).
    These models can be used to evaluate the structural integrity of a design and
    make adjustments as necessary before construction. 3D printing can also be used
    to create customized, complex components for construction projects, such as spillway
    gates (Yan et al., 2022) or turbine blades. These components can be designed using
    computer-aided design software and then fabricated using a 3D printer. Coupling
    this method with AI can reduce the cost and time required for traditional manufacturing
    methods and also allow for more efficient and effective designs. An example of
    small-scale 3D printing of a dam and surrounding rock is shown in Fig. 10. US
    army engineers use 3D printers to build a 1/240-scale model of the new spillway
    at Folsom Dam, designed to help reduce the risk of flooding throughout the Sacramento
    region. China plans to build a hydropower dam using AI, construction robots, and
    zero human labor. The Yangqu dam, 180 m tall, on the Tibetan plateau is set to
    be assembled layer by layer, like with 3D printing. A central AI system will be
    used to oversee a massive automated assembly line that starts with a fleet of
    unmanned trucks used to transport construction materials to parts of the worksite.
    Once the materials arrive, unmanned bulldozers and pavers (i.e., smart robotics)
    will turn them into a layer of the dam, and then rollers equipped with sensors
    will help to press each layer so that they become firm and durable. When a layer
    is complete, the robots will send information about the state of construction
    back to the AI system. Download : Download high-res image (224KB) Download : Download

    Italy. Photo adopted from https://www.prlog.org/. 4D printing refers to the use
    of 3D printing technology to create structures or objects that can change shape
    or function over time (Khoo et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2019b). In the context
    of dam construction, 4D printing could potentially be used to create components
    that can adapt to changing conditions, such as rising water levels or shifting
    soil. However, the technology is still in its early stages of development. In
    summary, the strengths of 3D printing technology are: (i) enables rapid and precise
    fabrication of complex dam components and structures, (ii) allows customization
    and optimization of design parameters, and (iii) reduces material waste and construction
    time. On the other hand, its limitations can be summarized as: (i) limited scalability
    for large-scale dam construction, (ii) challenges in ensuring material quality
    and structural integrity, and (iii) regulatory and code compliance considerations
    for additive manufacturing in construction. 4.8. Building Information Modeling
    Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of a building
    or infrastructure project that includes information about its geometry, properties,
    and relationships with other building components (Volk et al., 2014, Costin et
    al., 2018, Shou et al., 2015). BIM technology is new in dam engineering and there
    exist only a few applications (Heleno, 2021, Ji and Hu, 2019, Shi and Gu, 2020,
    Fernandes, 2015, Zhou et al., 2023, Baghalzadeh Shishehgarkhaneh et al., 2022,
    Giangiulio et al., 2022), including the combination of BIM and UAV (Buffi et al.,
    2018, Coetzee, 2018), or combination of BIM and Web GIS (Zhang and Jiang, 2021).
    The process for designing a dam using BIM technology is intricate and involves
    the following steps: (i) Creating a 3D model of the terrain and geology, (ii)
    Determining the elevation of the dam and selecting the appropriate dam type, (iii)
    Selecting the parameters for the dam’s cross-section, (iv) Creating 3D models
    for dam details, conducting seepage and stability analyses, and designing the
    foundation pit, (v) Designing a 3D measurement and monitoring system, and electromechanical
    systems (if necessary), as well as selecting a 3D solution for diverting water
    flow, (vi) Selecting 3D solutions and determining the construction sequence, (vii)
    Simulating 3D water compartment and drainage works, (viii) Exporting volumes and
    2D drawings, (ix) Setting 3D construction progress, arranging 3D construction
    sites, and estimating costs, and (x) Illustrating the project using films and
    3D images. The steps involved in applying BIM for spillway design consultancy
    are depicted in Fig. 11. These steps include (Tran et al., 2019) selecting the
    spillway type and calculating the threshold elevation, choosing parameters for
    the spillway cross section, creating 3D spillway details, analyzing seepage and
    stability, designing mechanical and electromechanical systems, determining the
    3D foundation pit, designing a monitoring system, determining the construction
    sequence, simulating the 3D water compartment and drainage works, exporting volumes
    and 2D drawings, setting construction progress, arranging 3D construction sites,
    and estimating costs. AI can improve the efficiency of BIM by automating certain
    tasks and providing advanced analysis capabilities. In the design phase, AI-powered
    BIM can be used to create detailed 3D models of dams, which can be used for simulations
    and performance analysis. AI algorithms can be used to optimize the design of
    the dam. During construction, AI-powered BIM can be used to manage and coordinate
    the construction process, by automating the detection of clashes and conflicts,
    identifying potential issues, and providing real-time updates on the progress
    of the construction. In the maintenance phase, AI-powered BIM can be used to monitor
    the condition of the dam, by analyzing sensor data. BIM is different from digital
    twins in the sense that the former is a digital representation of a structure
    to be built while the latter is a digital replica of an existing physical asset.

    consultancy. Photo adopted from Tran et al. (2019). In summary, the strengths
    of Building Information Modeling are: (i) provides a collaborative and data-rich
    platform for integrated dam design and construction, (ii) supports visualization,
    clash detection, and coordination among different disciplines, and (iii) facilitates
    efficient asset management and maintenance throughout the dam life-cycle. On the
    other hand, its limitations can be summarized as: (i) initial setup and implementation
    costs may be high for organizations transitioning to BIM, (ii) requires training
    and adoption by all project participants to maximize its benefits, (iii) integration
    with legacy systems and software interoperability can be challenging, and (iv)
    dependence on the availability of standardized BIM protocols and workflows. 5.
    Summary, challenges, and future directions This review paper presents an exploration
    of the various ways in which artificial intelligence is being utilized in the
    field of hydropower and dam engineering. The paper provides a thorough and up-to-date
    review of the applications, challenges, and potential future developments of AI
    in dam engineering, which will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners
    in the field. The paper reviews about 550 citations and includes a big table with
    about 200 papers that used machine learning (and few statistical) methods in response
    prediction, classification, and clustering of dams. This table includes the detailed
    ML algorithm, type of dam, and type of output parameter. It shows the sudden increase
    of ML applications in dam response prediction in the past three years, with deep
    learning gaining a lot of interest. Overall, the review finds that AI has the
    potential to revolutionize the field of dam engineering, providing engineers with
    new tools and techniques to improve dam safety, efficiency, and sustainability.
    However, several challenges need to be addressed before AI can be fully integrated
    into dam engineering, including data quality and availability, algorithmic transparency,
    and ethical considerations. AI and machine learning have the potential to significantly
    improve dam safety, efficiency, and sustainability by providing engineers with
    new tools and techniques to better predict dam behavior, optimize operations,
    and make informed decisions. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has
    gained significant interest in dam engineering in recent years, as evidenced by
    the growing number of research studies and applications that utilize ML techniques.
    5.1. Challenges Despite the potential benefits of AI, several challenges need
    to be addressed before it can be fully integrated into dam engineering. Data Availability:
    One of the significant challenges in implementing AI in dam engineering is the
    availability and quality of data. Dam engineering involves several complex processes
    and numerous variables, and obtaining reliable and comprehensive data can be challenging.
    The limited availability and sharing of data on dams can pose challenges to the
    effective utilization of modern technologies in dam engineering. Due to various
    reasons such as privacy concerns, proprietary data, and regulatory restrictions,
    sharing dam data can be difficult. This limited data accessibility can hinder
    the development and implementation of ML/AI solutions in the field. To address
    this challenge, collaborative efforts among dam owners, operators, and researchers
    are crucial. Establishing data-sharing protocols, frameworks, and platforms that
    ensure confidentiality and comply with regulations can facilitate the responsible
    and secure exchange of data. Additionally, fostering a culture of data sharing
    and incentivizing collaboration through partnerships, research initiatives, and
    funding programs can promote the effective use of modern technologies in dam engineering.
    It is important for the dam engineering community to recognize the value and benefits
    of data sharing and actively work towards overcoming the barriers associated with
    data accessibility. Model Interpretability: While machine learning models can
    be highly accurate, the lack of interpretability of the models can be a concern.
    Engineers and stakeholders need to understand how the AI system works to make
    informed decisions. Therefore, developing interpretable models is essential. Integration
    with existing systems: The integration of AI and ML technologies with existing
    systems in dam engineering can be challenging. Engineers must ensure that the
    new technology complements and improves the existing processes and systems and
    does not create new challenges. Ethical and Legal Issues: The use of AI in dam
    engineering can give rise to ethical and legal concerns, including issues of privacy,
    bias, and discrimination. Thorough examination and addressing of the ethical implications
    associated with the use of AI in this field are crucial. From a regulatory standpoint,
    it is essential for AI-based applications to conform to safety standards, environmental
    regulations, and other relevant guidelines specific to dam construction, operation,
    and maintenance. Ethically, the utilization of AI technologies involves data-driven
    decision-making, giving rise to concerns about data privacy, security, and fairness.
    Therefore, it is important to handle sensitive and confidential data securely
    and in a manner that preserves privacy. Additionally, ensuring transparency and
    accountability in AI systems is essential to mitigate potential biases and discriminatory
    outcomes. To effectively manage these regulatory and ethical considerations, establishing
    multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships among dam engineering professionals,
    AI experts, regulatory bodies, and stakeholders is a viable solution. Such collaborations
    can facilitate the development of guidelines and standards that specifically address
    the ethical use of AI in the field of dam engineering. Human Expertise and Involvement:
    While AI has the potential to improve dam engineering processes, it is not a substitute
    for human expertise. Engineers must be actively involved in the development and
    implementation of AI systems to ensure their effectiveness and safety. Cost and
    Accessibility: Implementing AI in dam engineering can be costly, and not all organizations
    or governments may have the resources to adopt the technology. Ensuring that AI
    is accessible to all organizations and governments is essential to ensure its
    widespread adoption and benefits. Download : Download high-res image (408KB) Download

    related to application of artificial intelligence in dam engineering. 5.2. Future
    research directions Here are some recommendations and future research directions
    that can help to improve the effectiveness and reliability of AI in dam engineering
    applications. Further research is needed to better understand the potential applications
    of AI in dam engineering and to develop new algorithms and techniques specifically
    tailored to the needs of this field. Efforts should be made to improve the quality
    and availability of data in dam engineering, including data on dam behavior, hydrological
    conditions, and environmental factors. Algorithmic transparency and ethical considerations
    should be a key priority when developing AI applications in dam engineering, with
    a particular focus on ensuring that AI systems are fair, unbiased, and transparent.
    Collaboration between civil engineers, data scientists, and other stakeholders
    should be encouraged to promote interdisciplinary research and knowledge sharing
    in the field of AI and dam engineering. Ongoing training and education programs
    should be developed to ensure that engineers and other stakeholders are equipped
    with the skills and knowledge needed to effectively utilize AI in dam engineering.
    Many machine learning models used in dam engineering do not account for uncertainties
    in the data or model parameters. To improve the accuracy and reliability of these
    models, future research should explore methods for incorporating uncertainty quantification
    into machine learning algorithms. As AI-powered systems become increasingly complex,
    it is crucial to ensure that the decision-making process is transparent and interpretable.
    Future research should focus on developing explainable AI models for dam engineering
    applications, which can help engineers understand how the models arrive at their
    predictions and recommendations. Machine learning models require large amounts
    of high-quality data to train effectively. However, dam engineering data is often
    limited, incomplete, and scattered across various sources. Future research should
    focus on improving data quality and accessibility, by developing standardized
    data collection methods and making data more easily available to researchers and
    practitioners. Edge computing refers to the processing and analysis of data on
    devices located near the data source, rather than in a centralized data center.
    This approach can offer faster processing times and improved data security, which
    may be particularly useful in dam engineering applications where real-time data
    analysis is critical. Successful integration of AI into dam engineering requires
    collaboration between data scientists and domain experts. Future research should
    focus on fostering interdisciplinary collaborations between AI experts and dam
    engineers, which can help ensure that AI models are developed and applied in ways
    that are most useful to the dam engineering community. Finally, it is note worthy
    that the limited annual growth in the number of dams compared to other structures
    has implications for the use of ML/AI in dam engineering. ML/AI techniques rely
    on large and diverse datasets, which can be challenging to obtain in a field with
    relatively stable dam numbers. However, despite this limitation, the complexity
    and criticality of dams necessitate ongoing advancements in monitoring, maintenance,
    and operational practices. ML/AI technologies offer opportunities to leverage
    existing data and enhance dam safety, efficiency, and sustainability. To address
    the challenge of limited data growth, strategies such as data augmentation, transfer
    learning, and collaborative data sharing can be explored. Additionally, the focus
    within the dam engineering community has shifted towards optimizing existing structures
    and developing innovative maintenance and monitoring techniques, where ML/AI can
    play a crucial role. By recognizing these challenges and emphasizing the opportunities
    for ML/AI, this review paper encourages further research and innovation in the
    field of dam engineering. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download :

    This scholarship provided a valuable opportunity to contribute to the research
    presented in this paper. Appendix. Research methodology To fulfill the objectives
    of this review study, academic publications pertaining to dam engineering and
    artificial intelligence were sourced from the online dataset. The “Web of Science
    Core Collection” served as our primary source for literature retrieval. To enhance
    the analysis, a science mapping approach was employed, which allowed for bibliometric
    analysis to be conducted. A.1. Bibliometric analysis To retrieve the required
    academic documents, a bibliometric search was conducted. The “Web of Science Core
    Collection” database was utilized for its comprehensive coverage, while other
    search engines, such as Google Scholar, were also employed to enhance the search
    and include additional sources. The initial search involved retrieving articles
    related to dam engineering and artificial intelligence, using the following keywords:
    “dam” AND (“artificial intelligence” OR “machine learning” OR “Digital twins”
    OR “internet of things” OR “Drone” OR “remote sensing” OR “satellite” OR “cloud
    virtual” OR “augmented reality” OR “robotics” OR “3D printing” OR “BIM”). The
    search was performed within the code of titles, abstracts, and keywords, and only
    English papers were considered for this review. The research query was conducted
    on 27 February 2023. To narrow down the selection, a screening process was conducted
    by reviewing the titles and abstracts of the identified documents. Initially,
    a total of 3363 documents were identified for potential inclusion in the review.
    A.2. Data extraction and synthesis Fig. A.12(a) provides a graphical representation
    of the distribution of collected papers across different fields. It is noteworthy
    that several papers in the dataset exhibit interdisciplinary characteristics,
    covering multiple fields simultaneously. Among the prominent fields represented,
    Environmental Sciences, Geosciences, and Water Resources emerge as the top three,
    indicating the interconnected nature of dam engineering and these domains. Additionally,
    Fig. A.12(b) presents the annual publication trend, demonstrating the number of
    documents published each year. The graph illustrates a clear upward trajectory,
    indicating a growing interest in the research topic and a burgeoning body of literature
    in the field. This observation aligns with the expanding significance of the intersection
    between artificial intelligence and dam engineering, as evidenced by the increasing
    number of publications over time. A.3. Keyword co-occurrence analysis In this
    study, keyword co-occurrence analysis was performed using the VOSviewer software
    (Van Eck and Waltman, 1984), which generates networks based on the provided database.
    The resulting map represents a distance-based network, where the proximity between
    nodes indicates the strength of the relationship between the keywords. Larger
    nodes correspond to keywords that appear in a higher number of documents, reflecting
    their significance in the field. To enhance clarity and reduce complexity, the
    clustering technique in VOSviewer was employed to group related keywords and assign
    them the same color. Only keywords with a high occurrence frequency (at least
    20 times in our case) were selected to construct the network, resulting in a more
    focused representation. To further streamline the visualization, a trimming process
    was applied, selecting only 50% of the keywords. Fig. A.13 displays the resulting
    keyword co-occurrence network, providing an insightful overview of the relationships
    among the selected keywords and their prominence within the studied domain. To
    ensure a focused analysis, additional manual research was conducted to extract
    a subset of documents that were most relevant to the intersection of dam engineering
    and artificial intelligence. From the initial pool of 3363 documents, only the
    top 17% that exhibited stronger connections to the research topic were selected
    for further examination. This refined set of documents serves as the foundation
    for the discussions presented in the body of the paper. A.4. Potential limitations
    In the case of the current narrative review paper, there might be several potential
    limitations in study: (i) limited scope: The review may not cover all possible
    aspects or subtopics within the field of dam engineering and AI. (ii) publication
    bias: The review may heavily rely on published studies, potentially excluding
    unpublished or gray literature. This could result in a biased representation of
    the available knowledge in the field. (iii) timeframe limitations: The review
    may be restricted to a specific time period (early 2023), which means it may not
    capture the most recent advancements or developments in the field of dam engineering
    and AI. (iv) subjectivity: As a narrative review paper involves interpretation
    and synthesis of existing literature, there is a potential for subjectivity in
    the selection and interpretation of studies. Different researchers may have different
    perspectives or interpretations (the current authorship is expert in structural
    engineering and water resources), which could impact the findings of the review.
    (v) quality assessment: Evaluating the quality and rigor of the included studies
    may be challenging in a narrative review. The reliability and validity of the
    research studies reviewed may vary, which could influence the overall conclusions
    and recommendations of the review. Data availability Data will be made available
    on request. References Abdar et al., 2021 Abdar M., Pourpanah F., Hussain S.,

    I. Introduction Agriculture is a vital pillar of human development and an important
    component of the global economy. However, with the current global climate deterioration
    and decreasing arable land and natural farming resources, the populations in underdeveloped
    regions are rapidly increasing [1], while the major agricultural countries, such
    as European countries, the United States, China, and Japan, have aging populations
    (i.e., reduced and aging farming workforce). What is more, under the influence
    of many factors such as the Russia–Ukraine war and the COVID-19 epidemic, the
    global food crisis has intensified, which poses new challenges to agricultural
    production, and it mainly affects food production, transportation, and the entire
    supply chain [2]. Therefore, an urgent need to improve agricultural systems to
    be highly resource-efficient systems that are both profitable, environmentally
    sustainable, and less manpower-dependent [3]. The development of biotechnology
    and the rapid integration of information technology and agriculture have given
    rise to the fields of smart agriculture. Among them, smart agriculture has become
    the most important new paradigm of modern agriculture. Smart agriculture relies
    on modern information technology and advanced equipment conditions, integrates
    computer technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, automation technology,
    3S (GIS, GPS, RS) technology, and so on [4], and integrates accurate sensing,
    intelligent control, and intelligent management in the production process to achieve
    higher resource utilization and labor productivity. Smart agriculture is based
    on information, with the IoT [5] being the key driving paradigm. Since the proposal
    of the concept of the IoT, it has undergone rapid development and gradually has
    been applied in many fields [6], [7], [8]. In the agricultural field, IoT monitoring
    through integration with traditional agricultural production technologies has
    been widely used in farm planting, livestock farms, aquaculture farms, orchards,
    or other agricultural practices [9]. Traditional agricultural IoT systems realize
    real-time collection and visual analysis of air temperature and humidity, soil
    moisture, light, related gas content, and other data through various sensors,
    thereby realizing agricultural applications such as precision irrigation [10],
    [11], soil nutrient management [12], pH measurement [13], [14], [15], and greenhouse
    temperature control [16], [17]. Recently, due to the further development of modern
    agriculture and the rapid rise of deep learning, RGB images and image processing
    techniques have begun to be heavily integrated into agricultural IoT, such as
    farmland environment analysis [18], target recognition [19], [20], [21], [22],
    pest control [23], crop growth analysis [24], [25], crop disease control [26],
    fruit detection [27], [28], [29], and livestock health analysis [30]. The introduction
    of image data into agricultural IoT applications not only allows the intuitive
    analysis of the growth status of animals and plants but also provides a more scientific
    decision-making theoretical basis for agricultural production management. Image
    data can be used to extract important information for smart agriculture applications,
    but the sensing, transmission, and processing of image data must rely on existing
    IoT frameworks and technologies. Although some effective results have been achieved
    in agricultural image IoT research [31], [32], [33], [34], image data have the
    features of a large amount of data, information density, and other factors, and
    traditional agricultural IoT technologies face many problems in sensing; data
    validation; the validity, flexibility, and efficiency of data [35]; transmission
    speed; storage cost; power consumption; and other aspects. To strengthen the role
    of IoT technologies in agricultural applications, in this article, a summary of
    the current situation of image research in the agricultural IoT is presented.
    A new agricultural IoT framework suitable for image processing and transmission
    is designed, and the driving technologies of image information collection, transmission,
    application, and so on are analyzed. A case study is presented to illustrate the
    application of agricultural image IoT based on recent research, and the problems
    and challenges of agricultural image IoT are discussed. This article is organized
    as follows. In Section II, an edge intelligence-based IoT framework for agricultural
    images is proposed. In Section III, the driving technologies of agricultural IoT
    are analyzed with the image as the core, and key issues, such as image sensors
    and image data transmission methods, are discussed. Some common image data compression
    techniques are introduced in Section IV, while a categorized overview of typical
    application scenarios of images in agricultural IoT is presented in Section V.
    In Section VI, an application case of agricultural image IoT based on edge intelligence
    is introduced based on previous work. The main challenges are analyzed in Section
    VII from different perspectives. Finally, this article is summarized in Section
    VIII. SECTION II. Agricultural Image IoT Framework Based on Cloud Edge Intelligence
    In this work, a new agricultural image IoT framework based on edge intelligence
    is proposed, which combines traditional agricultural IoT technologies, artificial
    intelligence, cloud computing, edge computing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),
    unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), and other components. The framework structure is
    shown in Fig. 1 and includes the physical, edge computing, network, cloud, and
    application layers. Fig. 1. New agricultural image IoT framework based on cloud
    edge intelligence. Show All A. Physical Layer The physical layer is a key component
    of information collection and the foundation of the entire agricultural IoT system.
    It uses sensor technology to obtain real-time agricultural environmental information
    and image data on crop growth or livestock conditions through various environmental
    monitoring sensors and camera systems. In particular, the camera system is the
    most important part for getting RGB images. In addition, mobile devices, such
    as UGVs and UAVs, are adopted as sensor platforms to solve the problem of the
    limited range of fixed sensors, making the IoT more flexible, mobility, and scalability
    [36]. B. Edge Computing Layer Relevant studies have confirmed that edge computing
    is an effective auxiliary means to the traditional IoT [37]. Edge computing devices
    are often deployed near sensors and can process and analyze data directly in the
    field. This proximity processing capability allows edge computing to quickly respond
    to and process large amounts of data, enabling real-time control of agricultural
    equipment. At the same time, edge computing can also be used to temporarily store
    data, avoid transferring large amounts of data to the cloud server center, reduce
    network transmission pressure and cloud server data load, and improve the efficiency
    of the entire system. In addition, multisensor data fusion at the edge computing
    layer enables more accurate agricultural support decisions. By integrating and
    analyzing data from multiple sensors, more comprehensive and accurate agricultural
    information can be obtained, which can be used for agricultural decision-making.
    C. Network Layer The network layer mainly includes the Internet, mobile communication
    networks, and wired/wireless LANs. Its role is to effectively connect each layer
    to achieve the transmission of data, results, and other information. Specifically,
    the network layer provides the carrier for agricultural image data communication,
    allowing the images and other data to be transmitted efficiently, reliably, and
    safely. This enables the fusion and interaction among the different layers and
    the devices [38]. D. Cloud Layer The cloud directly connects to the edge computing
    layer and application layer by network system and provides different offline services
    such as image data storage, processing, mining, building deep-learning model,
    and predictions. This enables centralized management, analysis, and operations
    for different applications. E. Application Layer The application layer is supported
    by the cloud providing functionality based on cloud data processing and computation
    of image and other agricultural data. Such functionality includes auxiliary decision-making
    expert systems, animal and plant health monitoring, disaster early warning, remote
    management, intelligent control, and cost and income forecasting. SECTION III.
    Agricultural Image-Centric IoT Technologies In this Section, the driving technologies
    of agricultural IoT are analyzed with the image as the core, and key issues such
    as image sensors, image signal processor and image data transmission methods are
    discussed, so as to improve readers’ understanding and application of image technology
    in agricultural IoT. A. Image-Sensing Node Framework Image-sensing node consists
    of an image sensor, ISPs, control processors, communication modules, power, and
    storage, as shown in Fig. 2. The image sensor captures optical signals and processes
    them into digital signals [39]. Users can define parameters such as exposure time
    and white balance through the control processer to the ISP. The ISP processes
    the raw image data from the image sensor to produce a natural color image that
    matches the perceived quality of human eyes. After a corresponding control processor
    command, the image is stored in memory or transmitted to edge computers through
    the communication module. Image-sensing nodes can be classified into static and
    mobile nodes based on their application scenario and deployment mode. Typically,
    static nodes are used in farms or breeding environments with low cost and no requirement
    for configuration flexibility. Mobile nodes are usually combined with unmanned
    vehicle technologies such as UAV and UGV, which have high mobility and can acquire
    images of specified targets. Fig. 2. Image-sensing node framework. Show All With
    the development of computer vision technology, IoT systems based on machine vision-based
    perception have emerged. However, the mainstream machine common algorithms [40]
    have extremely high-performance requirements and the vulgaris image-sensing nodes
    can no longer meet the use requirements. To solve this problem, many researchers
    use high-performance processors as the core of image-sensing nodes [41], [42],
    [43]. However, the improvement of processor performance is usually accompanied
    by increased power consumption requirements [34]. B. Image Sensor Types As shown
    in Table I, there are two types of image sensors currently used in agriculture
    for capturing RGB images: one is complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)
    image sensors and charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors [44]. Image sensors
    are the most important part of image-sensing nodes, but they can consume a significant
    amount of power when working for extended periods. Therefore, selecting appropriate
    image sensors for image IoT systems is an important task. TABLE I Comparison Between
    CMOS and CCD [45] Compared with CMOS sensors, CCD has the advantages of good image
    quality and high light sensitivity [46]. However, CMOS is more commonly used due
    to its lower manufacturing cost, leading to more research and optimization on
    sensors using this technology [47], [48]. Consequently, the imaging quality gap
    between CMOS and CCD is narrowing rapidly. Moreover, because of their advantages
    of low power consumption and small size [46], CMOS-based sensors are more suitable
    for agricultural IoT applications. Also, the models and performance of some CMOS
    image sensors are shown in Table II. TABLE II Comparison of Some CMOS Image Sensors
    C. Image Signal Processors In the process of camera imaging, ISP is responsible
    for processing the raw signal data from the image sensor [49]. Its main functions
    include linear correction, noise reduction, bad pixel removal, white balance,
    and automatic exposure control [50], restoring the details of the light field
    under different lighting conditions. In addition, the ISP has many other important
    functions. The first is the overall operating response speed of the camera, such
    as startup speed, focusing speed, and shooting interval. The efficient operation
    of the image processor is necessary to process a large amount of data quickly
    and accurately, thereby improving the camera’s operation response speed. The second
    is the camera’s battery life. Optimizing the workflow of the image processor can
    reduce power consumption and extend battery life. To a large extent, the performance
    of the ISP determines the image quality and processing speed of a camera. Table
    III shows some representative ISPs and compares their computing power and power
    consumption. TABLE III Comparison of Some Representative Integrated Circuits D.
    Digital Image Formats Digital image format refers to the format of digital image
    storage files. Digital images can be stored in different file formats, each with
    its own compression methods, storage capacities, color performance, image quality,
    and file size [77]. Each image format has its unique characteristics, some offer
    better image quality and contain more information but take up more storage space,
    and some have a higher compression rate and take up less space but sacrifice image
    quality. Choosing which format to use depends on the specific characteristics
    of the format in question. Table IV provides a comparison of some image formats’
    respective parameters. TABLE IV Comparison of Image Format E. Image Data Transmission
    Methods Common IoT image data transmission networks can be categorized into wired
    and wireless transmission networks. In wired networks, data transmission technologies
    mainly utilize physical media such as network cables and different buses to transmit
    information. In wireless networks, transmission technologies mainly include Wi-Fi,
    Zigbee, Bluetooth, cellular networks, and LoRa [83], [84], [85]. Table V shows
    the major wireless transmission modes and the performance, with the costs based
    on hardware prices obtained from major manufacturers. TABLE V Comparison of Different
    Wireless Communication Modes [83], [84], [85], [86] After comparing several common
    data transmission methods, it can be observed that wired transmission methods
    have advantages such as higher stability, strong robustness to interference, and
    high transmission rates. However, they also have higher requirements for terrain
    layout, climate conditions, power supply, construction and maintenance costs,
    as well as poor expandability. On the other hand, wireless transmission methods
    offer simple deployment, quick installation, low maintenance cost, and high scalability.
    Compared with wired methods, wireless transmission methods have lower stability
    and transmission rates and need to solve problems such as intercluster interference
    [87]. In addition, 3G/4G/5G have the advantage of wireless communication and high
    transmission rates, but their operation and maintenance costs are also relatively
    high. SECTION IV. Image Data Compression Technologies Image compression can reduce
    the size of image data, thereby decreasing the resource consumption of the IoT
    system in terms of bandwidth and energy required for image transmission. There
    are two types of image data compression methods: traditional coding compression
    and machine-/deep-learning compression methods. Some image compression algorithms
    are listed in Fig. 3. Depending on the compression rates, they can be further
    divided into lossless compression and lossy compression. Lossless compression,
    such as the one supported by the PNG file format, enables complete image restoration
    without any loss of information and can generally achieve compression ratios in
    the range of 2:1–5:1 [88]. In agricultural applications, lossy compression is
    the primary method used, which improves the compression ratio by eliminating redundant
    information without significantly affecting the subjective content of the image
    [80], [89]. Fig. 3. Commonly used image compression technologies. Show All A.
    Traditional Image Compression Methods The most commonly used lossy compression
    algorithms include JPEG [80], which uses discrete cosine transform (DCT) for image
    quantization and entropy coding. Due to the quantization and block processing
    of the DCT coefficients, blocky artifacts are often encountered in highly compressed
    JPEG images because of the lack of global multiscale consideration. To address
    these problems, researchers have introduced a new orthogonal transform in the
    form of the JPEG2000 [89] compression protocol. JPEG2000 expresses images using
    the wavelet transform, which converts the 2-D image into a 1-D vector that is
    then multiplied by a matrix of linear transformation coefficients and a vector
    of image expression coefficients (e.g., DCT or wavelet coefficients). JPEG2000
    uses 15% less space than the original JPEG algorithm. In 2010, Google released
    WebP, a superior image compression format that supports both lossy and lossless
    compression. In 2014, Bellard [90], a French programmer, created Better Portable
    Graphics (BPG), which uses techniques from image coding formats to achieve better
    compression ratios. Unlike JPEG, which sacrifices image quality for compression,
    BPG is based on high-efficiency video coding intracoding technology, which further
    eliminates spatial clutter using pixel spatial correlation. However, traditional
    image compression algorithms have some inherent defects. For example, they use
    inaccurate approximations in the coding process, which can lead to compression
    artifacts such as blur, block effects, and ringing effects [91]. In addition,
    traditional image compression methods tend to minimize the differences between
    pixels in the original image, without considering downstream perception tasks
    such as object detection. Therefore, these methods may be not suitable for image-based
    agricultural IoT applications, and there is a need for research on more practical
    image compression methods. B. Image Compression Based on Machine Learning and
    Deep Learning The use of machine learning presents various alternative techniques
    for image compression, including determining quantization coefficients, removing
    compression artifacts, and compressing color images. Paek and Ko [92] developed
    an image compression scheme using K-means, while Rufai et al. [93] combined singular
    value decomposition and wavelet difference reduction to achieve a high compression
    ratio while maintaining good image quality. Support vector machine (SVM) is one
    of the most representative algorithms in machine learning. In [94], a new image
    compression algorithm combining SVM and DCT was proposed, which achieved better
    image quality than JPEG when the compression ratio was greater than 20:1. Li et
    al. [95] proposed a compression algorithm based on SVM and the second-generation
    curvelet transform to reduce the block effect. Deep learning, as a new field of
    machine-learning research, is considered to have unique advantages for image compression,
    such as image feature extraction, expression ability, and high-dimensional data
    processing ability [96]. From the perspective of historical development, the application
    of deep learning to image compression can be roughly divided into three stages,
    as shown in Fig. 4, with the initial approaches emerging in the 1980s. Multilayer
    perceptron (MLP) and simple neural networks were the basis of such compression
    algorithms from the 1990s to the 2000s. In recent years, significant progress
    has been made in the research of image compression based on deep learning. From
    the perspective of algorithm classification, the field includes MLP, CNN [97],
    RNN [98], convolution autoencoder (CAE) [99], variational autoencoder (VAE) [100],
    generative adversarial network (GAN) [101], and others. These algorithms are gradually
    approaching or even exceeding the traditional codecs in compression performance.
    Fig. 4. Development of deep-learning image compression technology [103], [105],
    [106], [107]. Show All MLP can approximate any continuous function with a small
    enough error [102], which provides a basis for high-dimensional data reduction
    and compression. The main structure of the MLP consists of densely connected hidden
    layers, an input layer, and an output layer. Chua and Lin [103] proposed an image
    compression method based on MLP using the compact expression ability of MLP signals
    and their conduciveness to high-density parallel computing. Sonehara [104] used
    an MLP in the structure of an autoencoder, encapsulating transformation, quantization,
    and entropy coding into independent modules, and realized image compression with
    bottleneck layers whose dimensions were much smaller than those of the input and
    output layers. In the field of image compression, random neural networks are often
    combined with image compression frameworks based on MLP. For example, Gelenbe
    [108] proposed a feedforward neural network with a codec structure, which combined
    random neural networks. Based on this achievement, Cramer et al. [109] used block
    processing for parallel training in adaptive random neural networks with different
    compression ratios, to achieve image compression at multiple-bit rates. In recent
    years, CNNs have demonstrated their advantages in many fields, including image
    segmentation [110], [111], [112] and feature detection [113], [114]. Compared
    with MLP, CNN not only avoids overfitting to a certain extent but also requires
    fewer parameters through parameter sharing. Yu et al. [115] used a CNN to accelerate
    hierarchical decomposition and effectively reduce compression traces. Wang et
    al. [116] designed an efficient reconstruction framework by taking advantage of
    the powerful learning ability of CNN. However, in end-to-end coding, loss functions
    that use the gradient descent method require the objective function to be differentiable.
    The quantization module used in image compression is nondifferentiable, which
    makes training CNN-based image compression frameworks difficult. To solve this
    problem, Ballé et al. [117] used uniform noise to approximate the error in estimating
    quantization so that the entire image compression framework would be differentiable.
    This was the first work that combined end-to-end image compression and CNN, and
    the compression performance of this method was comparable to that of JPEG2000.
    In 2017, Theis et al. [118] designed an autoencoder based on the traditional CNN
    structure and improved the quantization and entropy rate estimation modules. This
    model was a pioneering attempt at image compression methods that utilized autoencoders.
    In 2018, Ballé et al. [119] added the scale hyperpriors to the original framework
    and modeled the probability distribution of the code more accurately. Different
    from CNN, RNNs have a memory ability. In 2016, Toderici et al. [98] used an RNN-variant
    based on a gated recurrent unit and a residual network, achieving compression
    performance comparable to that of JPEG. In 2017, the same team [120] proposed
    an iterative image compression method based on RNN, which led to compression performance
    at the same level as WebP. On this basis, Minnen et al. [121] added spatial prediction
    before the RNN, and the compression performance reached that of JPEG2000. In addition,
    some algorithms combining deep-learning methods with traditional image codecs
    have been proposed. For example, Jiang et al. [122] proposed a new image compression
    framework that combines CNN and JPEG codecs. This framework outperforms traditional
    codecs such as JEPG2000 in compression performance. With the increasing efficiency
    of GPUs, GANs have become a popular deep-learning model [123]. In the field of
    image compression, GANs have been used to improve the subjective quality of generated
    images. The seminal work was done by Rippel and Bourdev [124], who pioneered GAN-based
    image compression methods in 2017. This framework introduced the adversarial loss
    function into the rate–distortion function for end-to-end training. At low bit
    rates, the subjective evaluation of the reconstructed images greatly exceeded
    that of traditional compression methods such as JPEG2000, JPEG, and WebP. The
    main reason is that adversarial learning allows the texture details of the reconstructed
    images to be more realistic and reduces the blur phenomenon significantly. Over
    the past three years, innovative GAN-based methods, such as image compression
    at extreme bit rates [101] and image compression with semantic information [125],
    have emerged. In addition to the above image compression methods, image compression
    methods based on a region of interest have been adopted in some special fields
    [126], [127], which have particular significance for agricultural image compression.
    In practical applications, low compression ratios can be used for the interesting
    part of an image to obtain a better image effect, while high compression ratios
    can be used for the other parts to conserve storage space, to ensure that the
    important information is not lost, and the data are compressed effectively. Image
    compression based on deep learning comprises many different algorithms, each which
    its characteristics: CNNs are better than traditional image compression transformation
    in feature extraction and are often used for image feature extraction, while RNNs
    and GANs are used for image compression. As part of the RNN model family, long
    short-term memories can process and merge spatial information well and leverage
    convolution operations, making them more suitable for image compression. GANs
    perform well when the limits of image compression are reached, improving the quality
    of reconstructed images and the real-time compression of image data. The improvement
    of computer vision capabilities and the availability of large training datasets
    have caused great interest in the application of deep-learning neural networks
    in image recognition and processing, which is worthy of further exploration. SECTION
    V. Typical Applications of Agricultural Images IoT Agricultural IoT and image
    processing technology as a new technology has a wide range of application prospects
    and constantly promotes the development of agriculture. It can use cameras and
    other equipment to collect image data, to provide more information for agriculture.
    This Section will introduce typical applications of images in the agricultural
    IoT, as shown in Fig. 5, including soil analysis, plant disease detection, and
    pest detection. Fig. 5. Typical application of images in agricultural IoT. Show
    All A. Crop Phenotype Detection Crop phenotyping is a fundamental task in the
    field of agriculture, involving the use of image processing and machine-learning
    techniques to identify and describe the characteristics and manifestations of
    different crops. By accurately identifying and describing crop phenotypes, agricultural
    researchers can gain a better understanding of crop growth status and yield potential,
    enabling them to take appropriate measures to improve agricultural production.
    Lu et al. [128] proposed a mushroom detection system that utilizes YOLOv3, a popular
    object detection algorithm, to recognize mushrooms and calculate their size and
    growth rate. This system allows for estimating the harvest date of mushrooms.
    Wang et al. [129] improved the YOLOv5 network and developed an iMushroom detection
    framework that integrates monitoring systems and cloud services. This framework
    enables yield prediction and quality control of mushrooms. Dias et al. [130] introduced
    an automatic flower identification algorithm based on DeepLab, an advanced semantic
    segmentation model. The algorithm focuses on extracting flowers from fruit trees
    and estimating their quantity, which enables the estimation of fruit yield and
    weight. Kumar et al. [24] proposed a crop growth monitoring system that utilizes
    machine vision and machine-learning techniques to identify leaves and analyze
    their area and age. This system provides valuable information for farmers, offering
    recommendations for irrigation or fertilization based on the analyzed results.
    Li et al. [131] designed a bell pepper detection method based on YOLOv4, incorporating
    attention mechanisms and multiscale prediction. This method enhances the accuracy
    of identifying bell peppers, supporting the functionality of picking robots in
    agricultural settings. B. Soil Analysis Soil image analysis is one of the applications
    of the agricultural IoT, providing important information on soil health, optimizing
    agricultural production, and suggesting planting recommendations. Traditional
    methods, such as hand excavation and weight comparison, are prone to errors. Image
    processing technology offers a more reliable alternative. Several studies have
    proposed using image analysis to measure soil moisture content. For instance,
    Jagüey et al. [132] used an embedded camera to take images of soil and distinguished
    light and dark pixels through gray-level analysis to determine whether the soil
    was wet or not. Kabilan and Selvi [133] used transduction SVM to analyze the RGB
    images of soil and determine soil water content to optimize the irrigation system.
    Bolla et al. [134] used MATLAB for enhancing image contrast, adjusting image size,
    and transforming color space to determine R, G, and B values, which were then
    used to calculate soil pH index and water content with these values. Other scholars
    combined HSV, GLCM, and Gabor Wavelet to analyze soil image and distinguish types
    of soil [135]. Recently, Kalra et al. [136] developed a web application using
    color-based image processing to automatically analyze soil images and distinguish
    between soil type and water content. C. Plant Disease Detections Plant disease
    detection is a key application of images in the agricultural IoT, which can detect
    diseases that may affect plants in advance and enable effective preventive measures
    to be taken. Traditional methods of plant disease detection, such as leaf examination
    and pathogen diagnosis, require professional technicians and consume a lot of
    time and energy. Therefore, many researchers have proposed the use of image processing
    technology for plant disease detection. Some researchers used machine learning
    to detect plant diseases. In 2017, Thorat et al. [137] captured leaf images using
    a camera connected to a Raspberry PI, ran SVM on the device to classify common
    plant diseases, and sent the real-time status of leaf diseases to farmers. In
    2019, Devi et al. [138] introduced a disease detection system for bananas that
    used a camera sensor connected to a Raspberry PI to periodically capture plant
    images and classify banana sigatoka diseases based on GLCM characteristics using
    random forest classification technology. In 2021, Mishra et al. [139] proposed
    an image-based plant disease detection system and developed a sine cosine algorithm-based
    rider neural network for disease detection. Other scholars have added color space
    techniques to image processing. In 2017, Rau et al. [140] obtained rice leaf color
    using LAB color space technology and established a rice color database for comparison
    to analyze whether the nitrogen content of plants is normal. In 2018, Tran et
    al. [141] proposed an image transmission scheme based on sensor nodes and wireless
    networks. Plant images are collected and transmitted to the cloud, and image processing
    technology is used to convert the images into binary graphs to analyze the growth
    state of plants. In 2019, Pavel et al. [142] sent leaf images to a database built
    by Raspberry PI, transformed RGB images into LAB color space using K-means clustering,
    and finally used image processing and multiclass SVM to classify diseases. In
    2020, Sundari et al. [143] used a Raspberry PI camera to capture leaf images and
    transmit them to the cloud, where they processed the images with smoothing filters
    and set thresholds to filter green. The remaining pixels show the infected area
    of bacterial or fungal infection. Some scholars have combined detection technology
    with drone technology to detect plant diseases. In 2018, Kitpo and Inoue [144]
    proposed an IoT-based UAV system. Field images captured by the UAV are sent to
    the server, where SVM is used to detect and classify rice disease characteristics,
    and the UAV’s GPS sensor is used to locate infected rice in the field. Xenakis
    et al. [145] combined the IoT with robots and proposed a plant disease diagnosis
    support system. They integrate CNN into the robot system for plant disease diagnosis.
    To solve the problem of low precision and poor robustness of commonly used deep-learning
    models in the actual application environment, Zhao et al. [146] developed a multicontext
    fusion network deep-learning system that can extract highly discriminative and
    robust visual features from crop images and output the crop disease prediction.
    D. Fruit Detections Traditional detection of fruit methods relies on manual experience
    and operation, which can often be inefficient. Agricultural IoT offers a more
    accurate, automated, real-time, and data-driven approach to fruit detection, enabling
    quality detection, yield prediction, automatic picking, and other applications
    that help farmers improve production efficiency and yield, reduce costs, and increase
    agricultural and social benefits. Several researchers have conducted studies on
    fruit detection. In 2015, Rupanagudi et al. [147] developed a fully automated
    fruit detection method using wireless webcams and cloud computing to identify
    immature stage fruit and used Java to develop video processing applications. Behera
    et al. [148] and Anugraheni et al. [149] proposed methods to monitor fruit tree
    growth and fruit condition using IoT devices and image processing. Behera collected
    data through cameras and IoT nodes, transmitted it to Raspberry Pi, and identified
    fruit using color and morphology processing. Anugraheni distinguished mature and
    immature cherry tomatoes using color segmentation and counted them using the watershed
    algorithm. Song et al. [150] and Kumar et al. [151] focused on citrus disease
    detection and classification. Song used the YOLO to automatically detect citrus
    canker, while Kumar proposed a deep-learning model called DLVGG19-FSVM. The model
    captured citrus fruit images from farmland through IoT devices and accurately
    separated diseased areas and healthy areas using image preprocessing technology,
    feature extraction technology, and classification technology. Kitpo et al. [152]
    and Lee et al. [153] focused on tomato growth monitoring. The former used Faster
    RCNN and K-means to identify tomatoes and extract areas of interest and then used
    SVM to classify tomato growth after color extraction. The latter used multiple
    IoT cameras mounted on trusses inside the greenhouse to monitor the growth of
    tomato flowers and fruit through deep-learning-based flowering and unripe fruit
    detection. In addition, Jiang et al. [154] designed a neural network with three
    convolutional layers and two fully connected layers to detect infected apples
    in images. E. Pest Detections Pest detection plays an important role in the agricultural
    IoT, helping farmers find and deal with pest problems in a timely manner, and
    avoid crop losses caused by infestation. Compared to traditional inspection methods,
    agricultural IoT offers a more intelligent and efficient solution. In 2011, Tirelli
    et al. [155] developed an automated pest detection system that captures images
    of insect traps and transmits them to a remote host station for image processing
    and insect counting. However, this method has some problems, such as high power
    consumption and node signal attenuation, leading to some image transmission errors.
    In 2017, Rustia and Lin [156] designed a remote greenhouse pest monitoring system
    based on IoT, using wireless imaging and sensor nodes. Image data from the insect
    trap are uploaded to the server by the Raspberry Pi for real-time analysis and
    monitoring. The system successfully solved the problem of image loss caused by
    excessive transmission distance by automatically switching between Wi-Fi and 4G
    networks. Brunelli et al. [157] used a similar method to detect apple egg moth.
    In 2020, Ramalingam et al. [158] proposed a remote insect monitoring method, where
    the sensing layer sends insect trapping images to the processing layer through
    the transport layer. They also used the Faster RCNN ResNet object detection framework
    to automatically identify the insect class. To pinpoint the location of pests,
    Chen et al. [159] developed an image-based pest identification and location system,
    which used YOLOv3 to identify lychee stink bug. Stevanoska et al. [160] proposed
    a pest population detection system that collects image data from multiple cameras
    placed in the vineyard and uses target recognition technology to determine the
    number of pests. In addition, some scholars have proposed a pest removal system
    using the IoT and image processing technology [161]. The system captures image
    of pests using a camera, processes them to confirm their presence, and generates
    ultrasonic waves to drive them away from the farmland. F. Livestock Health Monitoring
    and Behavior Analysis Livestock health monitoring and behavior analysis plays
    a crucial role in the agricultural IoT, as it can predict and prevent disease
    outbreaks, reduce livestock losses, and prevent the spread of infectious diseases
    by monitoring livestock behavior, body temperature, diet, and other indicators.
    Compared with traditional monitoring methods, agricultural IoT technology can
    provide more accurate and real-time data to help farmers identify and deal with
    problems in a timely manner. Machine-learning techniques using poultry big data
    and camera sensing technology can be used to detect suspected disease symptoms.
    Carroll et al. [162] and Carpentier et al. [163] used a similar system that uses
    chicken recognition and abnormal motion detection algorithms to study areas related
    to chicken health, nutrition, stress levels, behavior, environment, and disease.
    In order to reduce human–poultry contact, Liu et al. [164] designed and built
    a new system for removing dead chickens from poultry farms. Cameras are used to
    remotely monitor the condition of chickens in poultry farms, and the dead chickens
    are identified and located using YOLOv4. Pork is one of the world’s leading meat
    sources and is vital to many countries’ economies and food supply chains. To ensure
    stable pork production, some scholars have carried out relevant research. In 2016,
    Shi et al. [165] proposed a method for estimating pig weight based on binocular
    vision system. The image acquisition system realizes the automatic identification
    and image acquisition of the pig and then generates the body contour and reconstructed
    image of the pig in the image analysis system to calculate the weight of the pig.
    In 2019, Lee et al. [166] proposed a deep-learning-based computer vision method
    for automatic monitoring of pig farms. Pigs are detected using TinyYOLOv3, and
    the size of the pig is calculated using the Gaussian mixture model, binarization
    with OTSU, and connected component. In addition, scholars have also studied the
    behavior of cattle and sheep. Rao et al. [167] proposed a goat monitoring system
    combining the IoT and machine learning and developed an automatic classification
    method of goat behavior based on Faster RCNN to automatically identify whether
    the goat is drinking or eating. Chen [168] analyzed cows’ estrus behavior by monitoring
    their body temperature and activity intensity, combining cameras and image recognition
    technology to monitor cows’ daily behavior, improving the system’s accuracy. SECTION
    VI. Intelligent Agricultural Image IoT Monitoring System: A Case Study In order
    to solve the problem of labor shortage in crop farming and improve the level of
    automation and intelligence, based on the novel agricultural image-based IoT framework
    with edge intelligence proposed in Section II, our team developed an intelligent
    agricultural IoT monitoring system. Next, the elements of this system are presented
    and this case will be introduced from the aspects of system composition, working
    principle, and system function, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6. Case study of the
    novel agricultural image IoT framework. Show All We conducted tests of the intelligent
    agricultural IoT monitoring system in an experimental field located in Baiyun
    District, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province (113.44884°E, 23.36374°N). The system
    comprises: 1) EZVIZ CS-C3W monitoring camera; 2) UAVs and UGVs with Inter RealSense
    435i depth camera; 3) TWOWIN T600 edge computer with NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier
    as its core; and 4) remote server fit with Intel Xeon Gold 5218 CPU and NVIDIA
    TITAN RTX GPU. The monitoring camera captures images of banana trees at regular
    intervals using the data acquisition framework [169]. To reduce the cost of image
    data transmission and storage, the monitoring camera sends images to the edge
    computer through the USB, bus for extracting the region of interest, only the
    fruit portion is extracted to compress the image size. We used the YOLOv4 object
    detection algorithm to extract banana fruit from the images and removed the unnecessary
    background information, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Comparison of image before
    and after processing in edge servers. Show All In the case study, the new IoT
    system significantly reduces the amount of space occupied by image data. After
    compressing the image data, the edge computer sends it to a remote server for
    analyzing the fruit, such as identifying maturity and detecting diseases. The
    results are then conveyed back to UAVs and UGVs, which drive to the infected plant
    and take images to further identification of the disease. Furthermore, the image
    data can be combined with temperature and humidity data obtained from the meteorological
    station, which is then used for intelligent analysis in the server, management,
    and planting advice to the user. This agricultural IoT system is flexible and
    lightweight due to the integration of UAVs and other technologies. Moreover, edge
    computing technology has been introduced to effectively reduce the network delay
    caused by the transmission of large amounts of image data, prevent network congestion,
    and improve system efficiency. SECTION VII. Challenges and Solutions Although
    agricultural IoT technology is gradually being adopted at scale, there are still
    some problems and challenges that need to be addressed, which are discussed in
    this section. A. Impact of Agricultural Images on IoT Systems On the one hand,
    the introduction of image nodes enhances the diversity and richness of the entire
    system’s data. However, on the other hand, image nodes pose challenges to traditional
    agricultural IoT systems, which have to spend additional energy, bandwidth, storage
    space, and so on to complete the image sensing, transmission, storage, and processing
    for different tasks. With the advancement of technologies and methods such as
    software-defined networks, image optimization sensing, collaborative sensing,
    and intelligent charging, optional solutions have been provided for this challenge.
    B. Diversity of Agricultural Image Demands Agricultural production involves many
    fields and links, which means different tasks, such as crop identification, pest
    and disease detection, and land use, among others. Different tasks require practical
    demands for agricultural image diversity. To complete different agricultural management
    tasks, different algorithms and models are needed to process and analyze image
    data. The practical demands mentioned above further cause diversity in agricultural
    image demands and corresponding algorithmic model datasets complexity. Therefore,
    standardizing the sensing, processing, and analysis of images for the same or
    similar agricultural tasks may be a possible way to solve this problem. C. Impact
    of Agricultural Heterogeneous and Changeable Environments on Image Quality In
    agricultural production scenarios, image quality and analysis results are easily
    affected by environmental changes, including background interference, crop density
    and height, seasonal changes, terrain, lighting, and differences in target objects.
    Especially under different lighting conditions, images exhibit different brightness,
    contrast, and color, while factors, such as crop variety and growth stage, can
    lead to differences in target object size, shape, and color. Algorithms and strategies
    for image restoration and repair based on specific agricultural environments and
    needs bring hope for addressing this challenge. D. Balance of Costs and Benefits
    Agricultural image applications provide data support for intelligent management
    and control of agricultural production, offering possibilities for increasing
    agricultural value. However, this can also bring about some cost challenges. On
    the one hand, equipment, such as image nodes and image servers, typically has
    higher prices than ordinary IoT devices. On the other hand, these devices are
    more susceptible to factors, including solar radiation, extreme temperatures,
    and dust in harsh environments such as farmland, which can damage electronic circuits
    and result in higher maintenance costs. Therefore, balancing the benefits and
    costs of introducing image into agricultural information systems is another challenge
    that needs to be considered. Building cheaper, more reliable, and reusable image
    equipment and algorithms is one possible solution to this challenge. In addition,
    agricultural environments, such as orchards and fields, often involve long-distance
    propagation, leading to problems such as signal attenuation and transmission delays.
    In order to overcome the challenges of large space, distributed wireless transmission
    systems can be adopted. Such a system uses multiple wireless access points or
    repeaters to extend the network range, and by installing multiple access points
    in the field, the transmission of wireless signals can be extended so that data
    and information can be transmitted more efficiently to distant places but also
    increases the cost. Therefore, considering the balance between costs and benefits,
    choosing the right location for sensors and network equipment is crucial. Also,
    select the appropriate network structure and topology to improve the transmission
    efficiency and stability. SECTION VIII. Conclusion Image-based IoT applications
    are becoming an important driving force of smart agriculture and a key component
    of a new agricultural paradigm. This article reviews related research with images
    as the core and the relevant agricultural IoT infrastructure, proposes a new agricultural
    image IoT framework based on cloud edge computing, and introduces image-driven
    agricultural IoT technology. This article discusses core issues related to image-based
    agricultural IoT applications, such as image sensors, image-sensing nodes and
    image transmission methods, and sketched image compression methods and technologies.
    In addition, this article summarized typical image-based agricultural IoT applications
    in animal husbandry and crop cultivation. Although image-based agricultural IoT
    applications have made considerable progress, there are still many challenges
    to be addressed, particularly in terms of equipment durability, image quality,
    data acquisition, and processing costs. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  description: The creation, distribution, and marketing of food and other goods within
    the boundaries of a metropolitan area are broadly referred to as urban agriculture.
    Urban smart farms use aeroponics to grow fresh and healthy food in a cleaner,
    easier, and more effective manner. With 90% less land and 98% less water needed,
    our cutting-edge technology is the ideal option for farming at home or in an urban
    environment. The importance of greenhouse farming is also discussed in the chapter.
    A system is developed for agricultural field monitoring in IoT-based smart farming
    with the aid of sensors like light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, etc.
    Farmers can keep an eye on the state of their fields from anywhere. Smart farming
    that is IoT-based is significantly extra effectual than traditional farming. MQTT
    and HTTP are used for the implementation of these models. Finally, supervising
    and scheduling the devices are discussed.

  description: A sensory transducer is a device that can convert environmental energy
    or event into a signal/energy that can be stored for further processing. For these
    conversions, small and low-cost devices are preferred by many engineers. Most
    of the devices used in such ubiquitous applications work in a hostile environment,
    where changing or replacing the power module is almost impossible. To overcome
    these problems, energy scavenging may be the solution. Researchers focus more
    on such devices because they regenerate power from the environment and can be
    used for a more extended period with less maintenance monitoring systems with
    the Internet of Things (IoT). This work summarizes an overview of the low-cost,
    self-powered sensory transducers used in different areas of applications. The
    research aims at the different ways to generate/recharge the power sources and
    their uses on different applications. It also focuses on recent challenges and
    the future scope of the device. Moreover, the work enlightens on the interrelation
    of self-powered devices to the evolution of Green IoT.

    Transducers A Way Toward Green Internet of Things Rajeev Ranjan Book Editor(s):Rathishchandra
    R. Gatti,  Chandra Singh,  Rajeev Agrawal,  Felcy Jyothi Serrao First published:
    20 September 2023 https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119842026.ch1 PDF TOOLS SHARE Summary
    A sensory transducer is a device that can convert environmental energy or event
    into a signal/energy that can be stored for further processing. For these conversions,
    small and low-cost devices are preferred by many engineers. Most of the devices
    used in such ubiquitous applications work in a hostile environment, where changing
    or replacing the power module is almost impossible. To overcome these problems,
    energy scavenging may be the solution. Researchers focus more on such devices
    because they regenerate power from the environment and can be used for a more
    extended period with less maintenance monitoring systems with the Internet of
    Things (IoT). This work summarizes an overview of the low-cost, self-powered sensory
    transducers used in different areas of applications. The research aims at the
    different ways to generate/recharge the power sources and their uses on different
    applications. It also focuses on recent challenges and the future scope of the
    device. Moreover, the work enlightens on the interrelation of self-powered devices
    to the evolution of Green IoT. References Self‐Powered Cyber Physical Systems

  description: The construction sector plays an essential role in the global economy,
    using many exhaustible natural resources, most of which are renewable in low percentages.
    Moving towards a circular economy is essential because optimizing the consumption
    of materials and energy contributes to the development of an economic system that
    is independent, more competitive, and more resilient in the face of economic and
    social crises and various environmental factors. The current "take, make, and
    dispose" model of the economy is unsustainable, so a shift in thinking towards
    a circular economy is necessary. This circular economy is an economic model that
    minimizes the use of natural resources by selecting them intelligently and minimizing
    the use of raw materials, favoring the use of recyclable materials wherever possible
    while managing the resources used and maintaining and reusing them in the economic
    system for as long as possible. Circular Economy Implementation for Sustainability
    in the Built Environment emphasizes the need to implement a circular economy model
    in the built environment and how to create a system that optimizes the use of
    resources and construction materials while preserving their properties and values.
    Covering topics such as automobile industries, lean manufacturing, and operation
    strategy, this premier reference source is an excellent resource for engineers,
    construction managers, business leaders, urban planners, students and educators
    of higher education, researchers, and academicians.

    Keywords: robotics; power converters; energy management; learning approaches;
    efficiency optimization 1. Introduction Industrial robots have a wide range of
    applications across various industries, including tasks like handling, painting,
    assembly, welding and more [1,2,3]. In fields like autonomous vehicles, machine-learning
    algorithms process sensor data to make real-time decisions, enabling vehicles
    to navigate and respond intelligently to complex environments [4,5,6]. In healthcare,
    robots equipped with AI can assist in surgeries, diagnose illnesses and even provide
    emotional support to patients [7,8,9]. Manufacturing processes are streamlined
    through AI-driven robotics that optimize production lines and adapt to changing
    demands [10,11]. Furthermore, in sectors like agriculture, AI-powered drones and
    robotic systems can monitor and tend to crops with precision, leading to enhanced
    yields and resource management. Search-and-rescue operations benefit from robots
    that can analyze disaster scenarios and navigate hazardous environments autonomously
    [12,13,14,15]. In the service industry, AI-driven robots are employed in customer
    interactions, from chatbots resolving inquiries to robots providing room service
    in hotels. Household robotics, such as smart vacuum cleaners, leverage machine
    learning to map and clean spaces effectively [16,17,18]. The integration of AI
    and machine learning with robotics also enhance the development of human–robot
    collaboration. Robots can understand and adapt to human behavior, making them
    safer and more intuitive to work alongside. The effectiveness and performance
    of the robot’s manipulative actions in any field of operation primarily depend
    on the dynamic response of its internal drive system [19,20]. This internal drive
    system has several impacts on the environment, depending on its design, efficiency
    and energy source. This concept encompasses the idea of robots being able to adapt,
    improve and learn from their interactions with their environment, tasks and humans.The
    control and conversion of electrical energy is responsible for highly efficient
    robotic systems such as when a robot performs a mix of high-energy and low-energy
    tasks; learning-based control can allocate energy resources dynamically [21,22,23].
    It can optimize power distribution to different actuators based on the priority
    of tasks. They aim to optimize the efficiency of energy transfer from the power
    source to the actuators. This is particularly important in robotics, where energy
    efficiency translates to longer battery life, reduced heat generation and overall
    better performance [24,25]. Some robots use regenerative braking to capture and
    store energy generated during deceleration or braking [26,27,28]. Power electronics
    systems facilitate this process by converting the captured energy into a form
    that can be stored or reused, thereby increasing energy efficiency. Actuators,
    like motors, may require different voltage levels and current intensities for
    different tasks. Power electronics components can regulate these parameters to
    match the requirements of the specific task the robot is performing [29,30,31].
    Another big advancement is use of wireless power transfer in unmanned aerial vehicles
    as it can transfer the transmission of electrical power from a source to the drone
    without the need for physical wires or connectors [32,33,34,35]. This technology
    has the potential to revolutionize the way UAVs are powered and operated, offering
    benefits such as extended flight times, improved convenience and reduced downtime
    for recharging. On the other side, irrespective of the nature of the mission,
    the primary complexities in the design of multirotor UAVs are shaped by the imperative
    to optimize payload capacity, maneuverability and flight duration. The capacity
    to carry payloads and the agility of these UAVs are intertwined with the proportions
    and mass of their propulsion elements, which directly relate to their power-to-weight
    ratio. Conversely, the duration of flight hinges on the energy stored and the
    effectiveness of the propulsion system, encompassing propellers and energy-storage
    mechanisms [36,37,38,39]. It is widely recognized that efficiency and power density
    are contrasting prerequisites. To solve this problem, a strong propulsion system
    has been developed which achieves the high-power density targets for UAVs, while
    at the same time demonstrating high efficiency and addressing the resiliency and
    reliability requirements. In light of all the above developments that are underway,
    this review addresses the emerging synergy between advanced power management and
    learning approaches in robotics, highlighting the potential to significantly enhance
    the capabilities of robotic systems. As industries increasingly rely on robotics,
    grasping the critical importance of this fusion becomes imperative. Further, with
    robotics no longer confined to a single industry but spanning across diverse sectors
    such as manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture and disaster response, this review
    highlights how these advancements have a far-reaching impact, making it highly
    relevant to a broad audience. Moreover, in an era of heightened sustainability
    and environmental consciousness, the optimization of energy utilization in robotics
    takes center stage. The paper identifies the role of advanced power converters
    and energy management in promoting energy efficiency—a pressing concern for organizations
    and governments alike. Lastly, the review explores technologies, including wireless
    power transfer for UAVs and regenerative braking, addressing how these developments
    have the potential to disrupt existing paradigms and introduce new possibilities
    for the field of robotics. In contrast to previous reviews in the field, this
    paper introduces a fresh perspective on energy harvesting for robotics, emphasizing
    emerging and innovative solutions that have received limited attention in existing
    literature. The novel aspects of this review article are as follows: The review
    discusses the integration of various machine-learning and AI methods, including
    reinforcement learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning and Bayesian
    techniques, showcasing the diverse approaches being used to enhance robotic innovation.
    It explores the use of state-of-the-art energy-harvesting technologies, highlighting
    the latest developments in solar energy for robotic applications. The review discusses
    supercapacitors as a fast-charging alternative to batteries, emphasizing their
    structural flexibility and the potential for integrating them into robotic systems.
    The review mentions the potential use of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells
    for higher energy density in large robots like UAVs, presenting hydrogen fuel
    as a promising and economical option for renewable energy in robotics. The major
    highlights of this article are as follows: Emerging synergy between advanced power

    technical advancements observed, emphasizing the influence of integration on robotic
    applications and highlighting emerging technologies. Finally, Section 6 provides
    conclusions drawn from the discussions in the paper. 2. Advanced Power Converters
    in Robotics Power converters play a pivotal role in robotics by facilitating efficient
    energy conversion and management [23,40]. In this section, the significance of
    power converters in robotics is discussed, as well as the various types utilized,
    recent technological advancements and case studies, highlighting their influence
    on robotic performance and energy efficiency. Figure 1 illustrates the schematic
    representation of the robotic system’s partitioning, shedding light on the essential
    components that collectively enable the robot’s operation. 2.1. Role of Power
    Converters in Robotics In the dynamic landscape of robotics, where energy-efficient
    operation is predominant, power converters serve as the bridge between energy
    sources and the electrical demands of robotic subsystems [21,41]. The role of
    power converters encompasses several key aspects: Voltage Regulation: Robotic
    systems incorporate components with diverse voltage requirements. Power converters
    provide efficient voltage regulation, ensuring that sensors, microcontrollers
    and other components receive the appropriate voltage levels. This not only prevents
    potential damage due to overvoltage but also maximizes the efficiency of these
    components [40,42]. Current Management: Motors and actuators, crucial for robotic
    motion and manipulation, often require varying current levels [43]. Power converters
    enable precise current control, allowing dynamic adjustment to match the specific
    demands of each task. This adaptability results in optimized motor performance
    and enhanced control accuracy [44]. Waveform Shaping: Certain robotic components
    require specific waveform characteristics, such as sinusoidal signals for AC motors.
    Power converters facilitate waveform shaping, converting DC power to AC with the
    desired frequency and amplitude, thereby enabling precise control over motor behavior
    [45,46]. Energy Efficiency: By minimizing energy losses during conversion and
    distribution, power converters contribute significantly to overall energy efficiency
    in robotic systems. Efficient power conversion reduces wasted energy as heat,
    leading to prolonged operational times and reduced battery replacements [21,40].
    Figure 1. Schematic Representation of Robotic System Partitioning, highlighting
    the integration of Power Supplies, Converters, Control Box and Sensing Systems
    for the Robot’s Operation. 2.2. Types of Power Converters in Robotics The complex
    landscape of robotic applications necessitates a spectrum of power-converter types
    tailored to specific demands. Figure 2 presents an overview of the power-converter
    technologies that find applications across various robotic systems. 2.2.1. DC–DC
    Converters DC–DC converters are pivotal in robotics, providing voltage step-up
    or step-down capabilities. For instance, in battery-powered robots, where the
    available voltage decreases as the battery discharges, DC–DC converters maintain
    stable voltage levels for critical components. Additionally, as robots integrate
    sensors and actuators with distinct voltage requirements, these converters ensure
    compatibility across the system [47]. 2.2.2. DC–AC Converters In robotics, DC–AC
    converters or inverters play a central role in converting DC power from batteries
    to AC power for motor-driven systems [48]. Advanced inverter technologies, including
    advanced modulation schemes like sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM), enable
    precise control over AC motor characteristics, such as torque, speed and position.
    This level of control enhances robotic locomotion, manipulation and even aerial
    operations [49]. 2.2.3. AC–DC Converters AC–DC converters or rectifiers are essential
    for robotic systems that require power input from alternating current (AC) sources
    [50]. These converters not only rectify AC power to DC for internal use but also
    allow robots to draw power directly from AC grids. Charging stations for electric
    robots, as well as industrial robots operating in environments with readily available
    AC power, benefit from AC–DC converters. Figure 2. Power Converters for Diverse
    Robotic Applications. 2.2.4. Resonant Converters Resonant converters utilize resonant
    components to achieve efficient power conversion with reduced switching losses.
    This feature makes them valuable for wireless power-transfer applications within
    robotics, enabling energy delivery without physical connections [51]. Resonant
    converters are employed in scenarios like charging robotic devices over short
    distances or even wirelessly powering sensors in remote locations [52,53]. 2.2.5.
    Multi-Level Converters Robotic systems often demand power converters that can
    handle high voltages while minimizing harmonic distortion. Multi-level converters
    achieve this by generating stepped voltage waveforms, reducing stress on components
    and improving overall system efficiency [54,55]. Applications include high-power
    robotic arms, where precise motion control requires efficient and high-voltage
    power conversion. 2.2.6. Soft-Switching Converters Soft-switching converters focus
    on reducing switching losses during power conversion. These converters utilize
    techniques like Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) and Zero Current Switching (ZCS)
    to minimize stress on semiconductor devices, leading to improved efficiency and
    reduced electromagnetic interference (EMI) [56]. In robotics, soft-switching converters
    find use in high-frequency motor drives and precision robotics that demand minimal
    energy loss and EMI [57]. 2.2.7. Matrix Converters Matrix converters perform direct
    AC–AC conversion without intermediate DC links [58]. This feature offers advantages
    in terms of efficiency, size and reduced components. In robotics, matrix converters
    can be applied to variable-speed motor drives and actuators [59], facilitating
    fine-tuned control and efficient power management. 2.2.8. Dual Active Bridge Converters
    Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converters provide bidirectional AC–DC conversion, enabling
    power flow in both directions. This characteristic suits applications where energy
    regeneration and grid connection are important, such as grid-tied robotics or
    robots operating in dynamic environments where power needs fluctuate [60]. By
    understanding and harnessing the capabilities of these advanced power converters,
    robotics can achieve higher levels of performance, efficiency and adaptability
    across a wide range of applications. Table 1 provides a comprehensive overview
    of the key advancements in power-converter technologies for robotics, highlighting
    the benefits they offer and the specific applications where they find utility.
    These advancements represent critical milestones in the evolution of robotic systems,
    enabling enhanced performance, efficiency and adaptability. Table 1. Key Advancements
    in Power-Converter Technologies for Robotics, along with their Benefits and Applications.
    2.3. Advancements in Power-Converter Technologies for Robotics Robotic systems
    are witnessing transformative impacts due to advancements in power-converter technologies.
    Table 2 highlights several significant advancements in power-converter technologies
    for robotics. These advancements are tailored to address the unique challenges
    and opportunities in robotics. 2.3.1. Integration of Wide-Bandgap Semiconductors
    Wide-bandgap materials, notably silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN),
    have revolutionized power-converter design. The unique material properties of
    SiC and GaN enable higher operating temperatures, reduced conduction and switching
    losses and faster switching speeds [64,65]. In robotics, this translates to increased
    power-converter efficiency, reduced cooling requirements and improved power density.
    These benefits are particularly relevant for robots operating in extreme environments,
    such as industrial automation, space exploration and search-and-rescue missions
    [66,67]. 2.3.2. Enhanced High-Frequency Operation Robotics often demands compactness
    and agility. Advancements in high-frequency operation have enabled power converters
    to operate at frequencies beyond conventional limits [68]. Higher switching frequencies
    allow for the miniaturization of passive components like inductors and capacitors,
    resulting in more compact converter designs. This is pivotal in creating lightweight
    robots that exhibit improved agility, responsiveness and energy efficiency [69,70].
    Table 2. Advancements in Power-Converter Technologies for Robotics. 3. Learning
    Approaches for Robotic Innovation In recent years, combining machine learning
    and artificial intelligence with robots has led to significant progress. This
    section explores the technical aspects of these learning methods, explaining how
    they contribute to improving different aspects of robot development [89,90]. 3.1.
    Machine Learning and AI Fundamentals in Robotics Machine-learning techniques in
    robotics involve the development of algorithms that enable robots to improve their
    performance based on data-driven experiences. Reinforcement learning (RL), supervised
    learning and unsupervised learning serve as the major aspects of these approaches
    [91,92,93]. RL involves training robots to take actions that maximize a cumulative
    reward signal. In RL, an agent interacts with an environment and learns to make
    optimal decisions through trial and error [94]. Techniques such as Q-learning,
    Deep Q Networks (DQN) [95] and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [96] enable
    robots to navigate intricate environments and accomplish tasks autonomously. RL
    algorithms, utilizing exploration and exploitation strategies, have demonstrated
    exceptional performance in domains like autonomous driving, robotic manipulation
    and game playing [97,98,99]. Figure 3 provides a visual representation of the
    profound impact of AI on robotic systems across diverse sectors. Figure 3. AI
    in robotic applications across various industries. Further, supervised learning
    equips robots with the ability to generalize from labeled datasets. Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven pivotal for tasks like object recognition and
    image segmentation. These networks automatically learn hierarchical features from
    visual data, enabling the identification of objects and scenes [100,101]. Recurrent
    Neural Networks (RNNs) extend the capabilities of robots to sequential data, enabling
    tasks like natural language processing and gesture recognition. The supervised
    learning paradigm, by leveraging large-scale annotated datasets, has led to substantial
    progress in enabling robots to perceive and interpret their surroundings accurately
    [102,103,104]. Furthermore, unsupervised learning encompasses diverse techniques
    that allow robots to uncover patterns and structures within data. Dimensionality-reduction
    methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [105,106] and t-SNE [107],
    aid in reducing the complexity of sensory data while preserving essential information.
    Clustering algorithms, like K-means [108,109,110] and Gaussian Mixture Models
    (GMM) [111,112], facilitate grouping similar data points together. Generative
    models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [113,114] and Generative Adversarial
    Networks (GANs) [115,116], enable robots to learn data distributions and generate
    novel samples. These unsupervised techniques empower robots to autonomously explore
    and understand their environments without the need for explicit labels. 3.2. Enhancing
    Robotic Perception Robotic perception heavily relies on machine-learning approaches,
    particularly in the domains of computer vision and sensor fusion. Supervised learning
    is pivotal for tasks like object recognition, where CNNs excel [117]. CNNs automatically
    learn hierarchical features from labeled images, enabling robots to detect and
    classify objects with remarkable accuracy [118,119,120]. Transfer learning, a
    technique within supervised learning, enables models trained on large datasets
    (e.g., ImageNet) to be fine-tuned for specific robotic tasks with limited labeled
    data [121,122,123]. In addition, unsupervised learning techniques play a crucial
    role in sensor fusion, where data from multiple sensors (such as cameras, LiDAR
    and IMUs) are combined to create a holistic understanding of the environment [124,125].
    By applying unsupervised methods like Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [126,127,128]
    or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) [129,130], robots can identify relationships
    between sensor modalities, enhancing their ability to perceive and interpret complex
    scenes. Figure 4 provides a brief overview of the essential technological clusters
    that support various aspects of modern robotics. Figure 4. Technological Clusters
    for Systems, Interaction, Machines and Awareness. 3.2.1. Object Recognition and
    Detection Supervised learning techniques, particularly CNNs, have revolutionized
    object recognition and detection in robotics. CNNs excel in learning hierarchical
    features directly from raw pixel data, enabling the extraction of intricate visual
    patterns [131]. Transfer learning is frequently employed wherein pre-trained CNN
    models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) on massive image datasets are fine-tuned for specific
    robotic tasks. This approach allows robots to discern objects even in scenarios
    with limited labeled data [132,133]. Furthermore, the fusion of object detection
    frameworks, like Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) [134,135,136] and You Only
    Look Once (YOLO) [137,138,139], with CNNs enables real-time object localization
    and tracking. These techniques, driven by machine learning, equip robots to interact
    with their surroundings intelligently by recognizing and localizing objects of
    interest. 3.2.2. Semantic Segmentation and Scene Understanding Semantic segmentation
    [140], a pixel-level labeling task, is pivotal for robots to understand scene
    semantics accurately. Deep-learning architectures, such as Fully Convolutional
    Networks (FCNs) [141,142] and U-Net [143,144], have proven indispensable for semantic
    segmentation tasks. These networks leverage encoder–decoder architectures with
    skip connections to capture both local and global contextual information, enabling
    accurate pixel-wise categorization of objects and regions within a scene. Scene
    understanding is further enhanced via unsupervised learning methods. By leveraging
    techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [145,146], robots can perform
    unsupervised domain adaptation. This enables the model to generalize its perception
    capabilities from a source domain to a target domain without requiring explicit
    annotations. Such adaptation ensures robust performance of perception systems
    in diverse and dynamic environments. 3.2.3. Sensor Fusion for Multi-Modal Perception
    Robotics often relies on data from multiple sensors, necessitating robust sensor
    fusion techniques [147]. Machine-learning approaches, specifically probabilistic
    methods like Bayesian filtering, play a pivotal role in combining information
    from various sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, IMUs) to generate a coherent representation
    of the environment [148,149,150]. Moreover, Kalman Filters and their variants
    (Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter) are extensively used for sensor
    fusion, enabling estimation of the robot’s state and the environment’s structure
    [151,152,153]. Additionally, Particle Filters provide a non-parametric approach
    to handle non-linear and non-Gaussian distributions [154,155]. Further, deep-learning
    techniques have also penetrated sensor fusion, where RNNs [151,156] process sequential
    sensor data effectively. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [151,157] networks, a type
    of RNN, are employed to model temporal dependencies in sensor streams, enhancing
    the robot’s ability to predict dynamic changes in the environment. 3.2.4. Anomaly
    Detection Unsupervised learning techniques are harnessed for anomaly detection,
    allowing robots to identify deviations from expected behavior [158]. One-Class
    SVMs (Support Vector Machines) [159], Autoencoders [160] and VAEs [161,162] are
    employed to learn the normal data distribution and subsequently detect anomalies.
    This is crucial for applications like fault detection in industrial robotics or
    identifying unfamiliar objects in a scene. 3.3. Elevating Decision-Making Processes
    The use of different learning methods, especially reinforcement learning (RL),
    has brought a big change in how robots make decisions. Reinforcement learning
    is about training robots to make a series of choices in order to obtain the best
    overall rewards in their environment. It involves complex algorithms that combine
    trying out new actions with choosing actions that have worked well before to learn
    the best ways to do things [163,164,165,166]. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
    has become popular for improving robot decision-making by using deep neural networks
    to handle complicated situations. This is particularly useful in tasks like robotic
    arm manipulation [92,93,167,168,169,170]. Algorithms like Trust Region Policy
    Optimization (TRPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) are good at fine-tuned actions
    for precise tasks [171,172,173,174,175]. Model Predictive Control (MPC) combined
    with RL helps robots adjust their actions to deal with unexpected changes in the
    environment, like in legged locomotion [176,177]. Exploration methods, like Monte
    Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), help robots make
    good decisions even in complex situations [178,179,180,181,182,183]. Hierarchical
    RL makes decision-making more efficient by breaking it down into smaller steps.
    Robots can also learn from human-like behavior and adapt using RL [184,185]. Lastly,
    handling uncertainty in the environment is important and Bayesian RL helps robots
    make decisions while considering potential risks [186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193].
    All of this has transformed how robots work in different fields, from manipulation
    to agile movement, making them smarter and more adaptable. Table 3 offers a concise
    overview of various learning methods that play a pivotal role in enhancing robot
    decision-making capabilities. These methods harness the power of AI and machine
    learning to enable robots to make informed choices and adapt to dynamic environments.
    Table 3. Summary of Learning Methods for Robot Decision-Making. 4. Energy Harvesting
    for Robotic Application Developments in robotic system over the years have made
    industrial robots more accessible and user-friendly. However one of the major
    limitations to the accessibility is related to the self-powered robots, energy
    storage and conservation between different operating stages [89]. The challenges
    related to the energy requirement for the operation of the robotics can be easily
    solved by the energy-harvesting methods. The harvesting can be easily done by
    generating the power from renewable-energy sources such as thermal, solar and
    kinetic. Using a renewable alternative to act as a power source for the robotics
    equipment can lead to a self-powered robotic operation. Hence, it is one of the
    most innovative research areas for the evolution of robotics [194]. Solar energy
    is one of the easiest available forms of energy as the global irradiance is somewhere
    near between 100 to 250 W/m2 throughout the year. There has been a lot of development
    in the solar harvesting as there are studies on thin films which are more convenient
    and efficient to put on a robotic installation. There are solar cells with dye-sensitized
    solar cells (DSSCs), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), perovskite solar
    cells (PSCs) and organic solar cell (OSCs) which are being used widely in the
    field of robotics [195]. The idea behind the development of different material-based
    solar cells is to improve the efficiency and reliability of the solar cell along
    with providing more flexibility to the cell so that it can be installed around
    the robot [196]. We have covered commercial thin film being placed on a robot
    to bendable, stretchable and wearable solar film. Thermoelectrical alternative
    is also one of the prominent energy-harvesting methods where the change in temperature
    is used to generates a certain amount of energy [197]. For the generation, p and
    n of a semiconductor are connected in series electrical and parallel for thermal
    operation. There are a lot of efforts being devoted to developing a wearable thermoelectrical
    generation material. The idea is to capture the heat generated during the operation
    and convert it into energy for further operation, creating a close loop. A wearable
    thermoelectric unit can generate up to 38 μWcm−2 from a human body [198]. Innovations
    have significantly reduced the power requirement by different drivers being implemented,
    but there still persists a challenge regarding the power sharing between the different
    drivers as many of the robotic operations are comprised of multiple degrees of
    freedom during the operation. Further, developments in battery technology have
    also impacted the application characteristics of the robots [199]. Previously,
    the robots needed to have access to power cords for long operational runs or the
    battery would usually run out faster when the motors operate at their maximum
    efficiency. There has been a lot of progress in battery technology in the past
    decade [200]. These changes have resulted in longer-lasting batteries with higher
    efficiency and robustness. Previously, the batteries used are usually rechargeable
    and primarily alkaline batteries. Later, for commercial application, batteries
    such as lead acid, lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride became popular as they
    were cheaper for commercial use and can be used in a wide range of operating temperatures
    [201]. Lead acid batteries presented some challenges with limited life span and
    low energy density for portable operation. However, few of the issues were overcome
    by nickel-metal hydride as such batteries have been widely used for autonomous
    vehicles. Nickel-metal hydride presents advantages with longer durability and
    faster charging speed. Further, on comparing the nickel-metal hydride battery
    to lithium-ion, it can be observed that operating temperature still remains an
    issue as it may cause trouble under extreme conditions. Other than that, issues
    related to lower specific power and higher operating cost are also present. This
    forces the modern electric vehicle to switch back to the lithium-ion alternative
    [202]. Apart from battery technology, there has been a significant development
    taking place in the field of super capacitors as they provide a fast-charging
    alternative to batteries [203]. In [204], the authors developed an approach to
    enhance the performance of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) through innovative power-conservation
    strategies. By employing plasmonics nano-antenna technology, the research had
    promising results, with a potential mission duration improvement of 16.30 min,
    offering an insight into the future of MAV capabilities. Predominantly, the supercapacitors
    can be characterized as either electrochemical pseudo-capacitors or electric double-layer
    capacitors. The property for charging on the electrical double-layer capacitor
    is similar to that of the conventional capacitor in which the charge is stored
    though rapid absorption and desorption of electrons. Because of its unique charge
    mechanism, the supercapacitors present faster charging and discharging rates [205].
    Along with all the advantages, the supercapacitors are deemed to be environmentally
    friendly when compared to the battery. More then that, because of their stretchability
    and structural properties, supercapacitors are a great alternative for a wearable
    robotic system. Table 4 presents a comprehensive overview of energy-harvesting
    techniques and the associated considerations that play a pivotal role in powering
    robotic systems. Table 4. Energy-Harvesting Methods and Considerations in Robotics.
    It can be deduced from the study that the renewable-energy sources do provide
    an attractive alternative to the power sources which also results in reduction
    of size, weight and increase in endurance. The integration of renewables with
    robot systems accounts for the storage and energy-generation unit. Energy requirements
    for larger robots such as UAVs or drones will need to have a high energy density
    power supply for longer operation [206]. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells
    are mostly preferred for delivering higher energy density performance along with
    higher energy gravimetrics. Fuel cells use the chemical properties to store the
    energy instead of wasting heat. Because of the higher efficiency and greater potential
    to upscale, the fuel cell technology holds the key to the future. The scope of
    hydrogen fuel is also very economical for the consumer as the green transition
    for energy generation and storage is promoted by such alternatives. 4.1. Classification
    of Robots by Power Supply Robots can be classified into different categories based
    on their power-supply methods. The choice of power supply is a critical consideration
    in the design and operation of robots, as it impacts their mobility, energy efficiency
    and adaptability to specific applications. Here, we categorize robots into four
    main groups based on their power-supply methods: 4.1.1. Galvanic Contact-Powered
    Robots Galvanic contact-powered robots are stationary or fixed in place, receiving
    power through direct electrical connections, typically via cords or cables. This
    method offers high energy efficiency as there is minimal energy loss during power
    transmission. They are commonly used in industrial settings, such as manufacturing
    lines and CNC machines, where tasks do not require mobility. The advantages of
    galvanic contact power include high energy efficiency, continuous operation and
    minimal downtime. However, these robots have limited mobility and range due to
    their fixed power sources. 4.1.2. Electromagnetic Wave-Powered Robots Electromagnetic
    wave-powered robots receive their energy through wireless transfer methods, often
    using electromagnetic waves like radio waves or microwaves. This approach provides
    more degrees of freedom for the robot, making it suitable for applications that
    require mobility, flexibility or remote operation. Drones and autonomous vehicles
    are examples of robots that often use electromagnetic wave power transfer. While
    offering enhanced mobility and adaptability to changing environments, this method
    may have lower energy efficiency compared to galvanic contact. Potential considerations
    include lower energy efficiency, the risk of interference and limitations in energy-transfer
    distance. 4.1.3. Battery-Powered Robots Battery-powered robots are equipped with
    onboard batteries that store and supply electrical energy. They are highly mobile
    and versatile, and suitable for a wide range of applications, including drones,
    robotic vacuum cleaners and autonomous rovers. The key advantages of battery power
    include mobility, autonomy and the ability to operate in diverse environments.
    However, they face considerations such as limited battery life, the need for recharging
    or battery replacement and challenges related to battery weight and size. 4.1.4.
    Hybrid Systems Hybrid systems combine multiple power-supply methods to leverage
    the strengths of each. For example, a robot may have a primary battery power source
    and employ energy-harvesting techniques or wireless charging to extend operational
    capabilities. These systems are found in various applications, including medical
    robots, solar-powered drones and remote environmental monitoring robots. Their
    advantages include enhanced flexibility, extended operational range and increased
    energy efficiency. However, they involve complex system integration, potential
    trade-offs and the need for advanced power management. 4.1.5. Efficiency Considerations
    Each power-supply method has its unique advantages and limitations and the choice
    of power source depends on the specific requirements of the robot’s application.
    Efficiency considerations play a vital role in this decision-making process. Here
    are some key efficiency factors to keep in mind: Energy Efficiency: Galvanic contact
    power supply is highly efficient, while electromagnetic wave power-transfer methods
    may have lower efficiency due to energy losses during wireless transmission. Mobility
    vs. Efficiency: Battery-powered robots offer mobility and autonomy but may have
    limited operational time between recharges or battery replacements. Electromagnetic
    wave-powered robots provide mobility but often at the expense of energy efficiency.
    Hybrid Approaches: Hybrid systems allow for a balance between mobility and energy
    efficiency by combining power-supply methods. For example, a drone with a primary
    battery source can use solar panels for energy harvesting during flight, extending
    its operational time. Application-Specific Considerations: The choice of power
    supply should align with the specific requirements of the robot’s intended application,
    considering factors such as mobility, energy demand and operational environment.

    integration plays a pivotal role in enhancing robotic capabilities for search-and-rescue
    operations. By efficiently managing power resources, robots can operate in disaster-stricken
    areas for extended durations, maximizing their chances of locating and aiding
    survivors [219,220]. Learning approaches enable these robots to adapt their search
    patterns based on evolving conditions and past experiences, significantly increasing
    their effectiveness in locating and assisting individuals in distress [221,222].

    to ensure safe and accurate procedures [226,227]. This integration has led to
    shorter surgery times and improved patient safety. Autonomous Agricultural Monitoring:
    In the context of agriculture, this case study features autonomous robots powered
    by renewable energy sources. These robots navigate vast fields, collecting data
    on crop health and soil conditions. Machine-learning algorithms allow the robots
    to identify areas requiring special attention and customize their treatment strategies,
    resulting in higher yields and resource-efficient farming [23,228,229]. Disaster
    Recovery with Aerial Robotics: This aspect focuses on the utilization of aerial
    drones equipped with advanced power systems and learning algorithms in disaster-stricken
    areas. These drones can fly longer missions, thanks to energy-efficient converters
    and employ machine learning to rapidly analyze vast amounts of visual and thermal
    data [230,231,232]. This integration has drastically reduced response times during
    disaster-recovery efforts. Table 5 offers an insight into developments at the
    intersection of advanced power converters and machine-learning approaches. By

    Optimal Control in Robotic Applications The economic aspect of optimal control
    in robotic applications is a critical consideration that can significantly impact
    the viability and adoption of robotic systems across various industries. The economic
    factors to be taken into account when implementing optimal control in robotic
    applications include initial costs, operational efficiency, maintenance and return
    on investment. Initial Costs: The choice of optimal control structures can have
    a substantial impact on initial costs. For instance, more complex control algorithms
    or hardware setups may require a larger upfront investment. However, it is essential
    to balance initial costs with long-term benefits, such as increased productivity,
    reduced labor costs and improved product quality. Operational Efficiency: Optimal
    control can enhance operational efficiency by improving accuracy, reducing cycle
    times and minimizing energy consumption. The economic benefit lies in increased
    productivity and reduced operating expenses over time. For example, in manufacturing,
    optimal control can lead to higher throughput, lower scrap rates and energy savings,
    all of which contribute to cost reduction. Maintenance: The choice of control
    structures can also impact maintenance costs. Complex control systems may require
    more frequent maintenance and specialized expertise, which can increase operating
    expenses. Simpler control systems with predictive maintenance capabilities can
    help reduce downtime and maintenance costs. Return on Investment (ROI): The economic
    feasibility of optimal control largely depends on the ROI it offers. While investing
    in advanced control structures may have a higher upfront cost, it is crucial to
    evaluate how quickly these investments will pay off through increased productivity
    and cost savings. Factors like the expected lifespan of the robotic system, industry-specific
    demands and potential market growth should be considered when calculating ROI.
    Recommendations on the most suitable control structures to be implemented should
    be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific requirements and constraints
    of the application. However, some general guidelines can be helpful: Customization:

    Customizing the control system to the unique demands of the task can lead to more
    efficient and cost-effective solutions. Scalability: Consider control structures
    that can be scaled as needed. This allows for flexibility in adapting to changes
    in production volume or complexity, ensuring that the investment remains economically
    viable over time. Energy Efficiency: Opt for control structures that prioritize
    energy efficiency, as this not only reduces operational costs but also aligns
    with sustainability goals. Integration: Ensure that the chosen control structure
    integrates seamlessly with existing systems and processes. Compatibility can minimize
    disruptions and reduce integration costs. Predictive Maintenance: Implement predictive
    maintenance capabilities to proactively address issues before they lead to costly
    downtime. This can extend the lifespan of the robotic system and reduce maintenance
    expenses. 7. Conclusions In conclusion, this paper has effectively highlighted

    of intelligent, adaptable and innovative robotic systems, revealing notable achievements
    and innovative research. One of the key aspects identified in the review is the
    successful implementation of various energy-harvesting methods, such as solar
    energy, thermoelectrical generation and supercapacitors, in powering robotic systems.
    These methods have demonstrated their potential to reduce reliance on conventional
    power sources and increase the endurance and adaptability of robots, making them
    well-suited for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, the review explored

    networks and big data in the future of precision crop production Keywords: precision
    crop production; ICT; IoT; sensors; big data; AI 1. Introduction The world population
    is undergoing continuous growth and is anticipated to reach 10 billion within
    the next 35 years. It is imperative to make significant advancements in agricultural
    production and disaster management to ensure adequate sustenance for the world’s
    population [1]. As the quantity of arable land remains static, the quality of
    the soil is not improving, and groundwater levels are dropping, there is an urgent
    need to responsibly enhance agricultural productivity [2]. Precision agriculture
    has transformed agricultural practices since its inception in the 1980s by utilizing
    technologies like remote sensing, the geographic information system (GIS), and
    the global positioning system (GPS). This integration has transformed crop production
    methods, resulting in a significant shift in agricultural mechanization thinking
    [3]. The combination of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and artificial intelligence
    (AI) enables precision crop production. This cutting-edge technology employs sensors
    and artificial intelligence to optimize crop growth and yield, allowing farmers
    to collect detailed data about their fields and use it to make informed decisions
    about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. Moreover, the greatest output
    benefit of precision agriculture is decreased temporal yield changes, which has
    increased yield stability and climate change tolerance [4]. The agricultural industry
    faces several significant challenges related to effectively utilizing new technologies,
    including discovering knowledge and correlations from historical records, processing
    large volumes of unstructured data in an appropriate format, managing extensive
    amounts of image and video data, monitoring crops using multiple sensors, and
    effectively communicating and integrating these data. Additionally, the adoption
    and accessibility of emerging technologies can be cost-prohibitive for individual
    farmers, while a lack of low-technology expertise requires extra training and
    better information and communication technology (ICT) management equipment. Ensuring
    the security of these systems is also a critical concern within the agricultural
    community [5,6]. Precision agriculture has undergone a transformation over the
    past three decades, advancing from strategic monitoring using satellite imaging
    for regional decision making to tactical monitoring and control allowed by low-altitude
    remotely sensed data for site-specific field-scale applications. The incorporation
    of data science and big data technology into precision agriculture strategies
    has led to a rapid analysis of data, facilitating timely decision making [7,8].
    Farming could move to a more effective, productive, and sustainable paradigm through
    the integration of technologies such ground IoT sensing and remote sensing, using
    both satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as well as utilizing data
    fusion and data analytics [9]. Wireless connection methods, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    and cellular networks, are utilized to transmit sensor data to a central hub,
    allowing farmers to monitor their farms in real time and make informed crop production
    decisions. The improvement of agricultural goods and services while reducing investment
    costs represents a critical objective for future farming. Big data can effectively
    support diverse precision agriculture functions and assist in the extraction of
    information and insights from data in order to process important farming decisions
    and difficulties. In the agricultural sector, ICT plays an important role in developing
    breakthrough data creation, transformation, and management technologies [10].
    Site-specific data collection, characterized by the acquisition of comprehensive
    information regarding events occurring during the vegetation period, offers a
    practical solution to this issue. This methodology enables the identification
    of underlying processes and their causes, leading to precise intervention that
    reduces adverse environmental effects. It creates a monitored and controlled environment
    in both spatial and temporal domains and sets the stage for a more advanced decision
    support system than is currently available. Previous studies have advocated for
    this approach [11,12]. This review offers an informed summary of the most recent
    approaches used in precision agricultural production. It meticulously investigates
    and highlights the cutting-edge technology and approaches that are currently transforming
    the agricultural practice scene. The study focuses on the application of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and big data in the agricultural industry and research. The review
    provides light on these technologies’ beneficial effects in enhancing crop yields,
    resource usage, and overall farm management by explaining their practical applications.
    Moreover, it addressed the challenges that come with integrating IoT and big data
    in agriculture. It discusses the challenges that have been encountered, such as
    data security concerns, technical difficulties, and the necessity for a strong
    infrastructure which are among many other limitations faces the integration of
    IoT in agricultural practices around the world. 2. Overview of Precision Agriculture
    Technology 2.1. ICT, IoT, Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Data Fusion Sustainable
    agricultural development presents a crucial solution to address rapid population
    growth, facilitated using ICT in precision agriculture. This approach has yielded
    innovative techniques that enhance agricultural productivity, efficiency, and
    regulation while concurrently preserving the environment [2]. To ensure long-term
    agricultural production, modern technologies must be used in the agricultural
    field, like blockchain [13,14], the IoT [15], and (AI) [16]. The most promising
    strategy for solving these problems is data-driven agriculture using these technologies.
    (IoT) assists in data collection at all stages of agricultural production and
    supply chain management [17]. The internet now plays a crucial role across many
    industries. Within the agricultural domain, a suggested approach that involves
    monitoring agricultural fields utilizing the IoT is utilized. This approach employs
    sensors that analyze diverse parameters within the agricultural domain, leveraging
    wireless sensor network technology [18]. “IoT” refers to the connection of devices
    and tools, such as sensors, to the internet, allowing them to transfer data. The
    IoT is a huge network with an enormous number of objects connected to a global
    information infrastructure. The number of connected devices has increased many
    folds, giving rise to the scalability issue in the IoT. For proper communication
    to take place, a unique sender and receiver must be recognized, along with the
    identification of an appropriate path or channel [19]. In agriculture, the use
    of IoT technology has the potential to revolutionize the way farms operate and
    increase the efficiency and productivity of the industry. Another application
    of IoT in agriculture is the use of precision farming techniques, which involve
    using sensors and other technologies to gather data and make precise and timely
    adjustments to various aspects of farming operations. For example, GPS-guided
    machinery can be used to precisely apply fertilizers and pesticides, reducing
    the number of resources used and minimizing waste. Even though, due to the necessity
    for skills in interacting with sensors, the internet cloud, and end-user apps,
    farmers face difficulties adopting smart farming and IoT technology [20]. The
    Internet of Things has numerous applications in the Digital Agriculture field,
    including detection of plant physiological status, nutrient replenishment recommendations,
    water requirements, and so on [18,21]. The (IoT) offers significant benefits for
    agriculture and sustainable crop production, including the ability to anticipate
    and prepare for potential disturbances that may originate from remote locations,
    such as insect pest invasions and monitoring soil nutrients, water dynamics, and
    pest management. The other advantages of using IoT technology in farming systems
    are that the ability of using in yield prediction, energy and cost savings, and
    the establishment of indoor vertical farming systems by utilizing the information
    from the established IoT station there [20]. Regarding ecological aspirations,
    the Internet of Everything (IoE) is receiving an increasing amount of attention
    [22]. This increases the effectiveness of protection and hence lowers costs. Big
    data can be utilized for different spatiotemporal applications, such as connecting
    remote IoT equipment to cloud-based computing capabilities [23,24]. The use of
    IoT with big data analysis techniques is the basis for new decision making tools.
    In agriculture, “big data” refers to the massive amount of data generated by agricultural
    activity and measurement. Processing and managing large amounts of data is a difficult
    undertaking when using standard approaches and systems [7]. Big data have a big
    chance in agriculture for solving various farming difficulties and, as a result,
    increasing agricultural production quality and quantity. Big data analytics can
    be used to anticipate agricultural harvesting time, soil quality, crop protection,
    and irrigation requirements. Furthermore, big data empowers agricultural practitioners
    and related industries to gain information about different factors that impede
    agricultural production and make efficient decisions in daily farming [2]. While
    it is unclear whether agriculture practitioners’ information will be replaced
    by algorithms, big data applications are likely to revolutionize how agriculture
    farms are managed and operated [25,26]. The collection of data from multiple sources
    is a critical component of achieving predictive decision making capabilities in
    precision agriculture. Weather conditions play a pivotal role in determining the
    productivity and management of agricultural systems, emphasizing the importance
    of accurate area-based weather forecasting for the future of precision crop production
    and with further data collection from various sources would allow to monitor and
    optimize crop growth conditions [27]. Precision agriculture datasets typically
    comprise a diverse range of data related to crops, soil, and nutrients, atmospheric
    data, technological data such as GIS data, GPS data, and data from trucks and
    the Variable Rate Fertilizer (VRT) system [7,28,29,30]. Big data analysis is a
    methodical strategy that applies cutting-edge analytic tools to big data sets.
    This entails the integration of two technical components, namely extensive data
    sets and an array of analytics tool categories such as data mining, statistics,
    AI, predictive analytics, and natural language processing (NLP), among others.
    The analysis of such data is accomplished through the utilization of big data
    mining techniques. In the realm of smart agriculture, the feasibility study is
    significantly improved by the application of IoT and big data analytics in the
    cloud [2,18]. In Figure 1, we can see the relationship between IoT and data analytics.
    Because of the volume, velocity, and variety of data generated by IoTs, they are
    classified as “big data systems”. These data are mined and processed in order
    to show the relationships between inputs and outputs [31]. Figure 1. The relationship
    between the Internet of Things and data analytics [32]. Cloud computing is a method
    that allows for the sharing of resources at a low cost. Cloud computing service
    providers make these services available at an economical cost. The storage of
    agricultural data has been facilitated through the utilization of cloud computing.
    In the agriculture sector, cloud computing is employed in conjunction with IoT
    technology [33]. According to Neményi et al., 2022 [34], the combination of artificial
    intelligence and cloud computing constitutes a comprehensive support system for
    the IoT. It requires combining data from intelligent wireless sensors, such as
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [35] and satellites, data acquisition systems
    on agricultural machinery and crop production equipment, and robots such as unmanned
    ground vehicles (UGVs), with precise positioning systems (such as navigation systems,
    real-time kinematics (RTK), and Lidar). The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a
    wireless network made up of geographically distributed sensor stations. Sensors
    → MCU → Nodes → Gateways → Clouds (server) [34]. Multisensor data fusion is a
    technology that facilitates the integration of data from multiple sources to create
    a comprehensive representation. Data fusion systems have found broad use in many
    different domains, including but not limited to sensor networks, robotics, video
    and image processing, and intelligent system design. The process of data fusion
    is described as a complex, multifaceted operation that involves automated detection,
    association, correlation, estimation, and gathering of data from multiple sources
    at various levels [36,37]. The practice of data fusion offers numerous benefits,
    primarily through improving the authenticity and availability of data. The utilization
    of data fusion strategies has been extensively applied in various sectors, including
    the food and chemical industries, with the aim of augmenting the analytical platforms’
    overall performance and robustness [38,39,40]. Munnaf et al., 2021 [41] recommend
    employing Site-Specific Seeding (SSS) for potato production using the proposed
    multi-sensor data-fusion technique to manage in-field soil and crop variabilities
    and improve productivity and profitability in their study. (SSS) was examined
    for potato production utilizing Management Zone (MZ) maps based on several soil
    and crop variables. Despite using more seeds, SSS increased tuber yields, and
    gross margins compared to Uniform Rate Seeding (URS). SSS profitability ranged
    from 2.34% to 27.21%, with the highest profitability in low-productivity fields.
    The study suggests using SSS for potato production, along with the proposed multi-sensor
    data-fusion approach, to manage in-field soil and crop variabilities and improve
    productivity and profitability. These studies have concentrated on how cloud computing,
    IoT, and multisensor data fusion are integrated in precision agriculture, while
    Neményi et al. (2022) [34] highlighted the complementary advantages of AI, cloud
    computing, and IoT for comprehensive data use, cloud computing offers cost-effective
    data storage. Fusion of data from multiple sensors is essential to enhance data
    availability and validity across sectors. Munnaf et al. [41] recommends Site-Specific
    Seeding (SSS) with multisensor data fusion in potato production because it outperforms
    Uniform Rate Seeding (URS) in terms of tuber yields and profitability, especially
    in low-productivity fields. These results highlight the need for data-driven approaches
    for enhanced crop productivity and optimized resource management. 2.2. AI, Real-Time
    Monitoring, and Big Data (Mining and Analyzing) In contemporary times, traditional
    yield modeling aimed at meeting the demands of sustainability and identifying
    yield drivers and factors restricting yield is increasingly being executed using
    AI. An expanding number of researchers are employing AI to model an extensive
    array of agricultural tasks. The technical literature sources reveal the application
    of diverse techniques for supporting precision agriculture decision making. AI
    presents a promising prospect for improving the world’s food security, including
    closing crop yield gaps, minimizing food waste, and mitigating resource utilization
    inefficiencies [42,43]. Counter propagation artificial neural network (CP-ANN),
    SKN, and XY-F models were used along with high-resolution soil and crop data such
    as spatial-temporal soil types and crop production effectiveness to predict classes
    of wheat yield productivity. The SKN network predicts the low category of yield
    output the best, with a proper classification percentage of 91.3% for both cross-
    and independent validation. Temperature and other climate effects have also been
    analyzed by AI [44,45,46]. These researches emphasize the importance of conventional
    yield modeling to be integrated with AI-driven methods in precision agriculture.
    Applications for (AI) like CP-ANN, SKN, and XY-F models show highly promising
    results, especially SKN with a 91.3% classification accuracy for low yield. Precision
    agriculture involves the collection of real-time and historically generated data,
    which is structured or unstructured in nature. With the increasing adoption of
    precision agriculture practices, the amount of unstructured data generated has
    grown significantly. Consequently, current research efforts have focused on extracting
    meaningful insights and knowledge from these unstructured datasets [30]. High-spatiotemporal-resolution
    automated monitoring of the soil, plants, and atmosphere is an important factor
    in converting labor-intensive, experience-based decision making in agricultural
    production to an autonomous, data-driven way. Real-time field data might help
    growers make better management decisions, and researchers could use this information
    to find answers to important scientific problems [47]. The implementation of fully
    automated decision making systems (ADMS) is essential in precision agriculture.
    These systems are designed to monitor multiple chemical or physical parameters
    of soil and plants while simultaneously regulating them to maintain optimal conditions
    for each specific plant or soil type. Despite the feasibility of developing such
    systems using existing technologies, the implementation of ADMS encounters significant
    challenges. ADMS generally consists of four main sections: the sensing technique,
    sensor interfaces, the information transmission platform, and the data processing
    and control unit; the crucial role of precision agriculture in utilizing both
    historical and real-time data for well-informed decision making is highlighted
    by both studies. Despite its feasibility, both studies agree that deploying ADMS
    is challenging. They develop a comprehensive view of the changing precision agricultural
    scene, combining data-driven insights with the complexities of implementing automated
    systems technologies. Figure 2 shows the general structure of automated decision-making
    systems [48]. Figure 2. The general structure of automated decision making systems
    ADMS [48]. There are now three fundamental approaches accessible for soil and
    plant sensing systems: satellite imaging, on-the-go sensors, and in situ soil
    and plant sensors. Satellite imaging is a way of monitoring soil and plant quality
    and fertility by acquiring and analyzing multi-spectral satellite images of the
    field of interest [49]. This technology is very costly and limited to particular
    countries. The second, more financially practical way is to attach sensors to
    agricultural machinery, other agricultural equipment, or even drones, known as
    on-the-go sensors. The last approach entails the placement of soil and plant sensors
    across the area, which can share data in real time [50,51]. This is the only approach
    capable of providing continuous, real-time data without the need for human intervention.
    These sensors do, however, have some drawbacks, such as the need for protection
    from wild animals and the need to occasionally remove them from the field during
    crop cultivation and harvest to prevent damage from agricultural machinery. Depending
    on the period of removal, this may result in gaps and data loss for several hours
    or days. Real-time soil nutrient sensing has a lot of potential for the future
    of agriculture because nitrogen leakage and groundwater pollution have developed
    into significant problems for society. Nitrate sensors can be used for a variety
    of purposes, such as monitoring nitrate concentrations in groundwater by mounting
    them to groundwater pumps or estimating nitrate leaching more precisely by installing
    them in leaching water collectors in fields [52]. The real-time measurement of
    soil nutrient content, particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, is critical
    for fertilization. These detectors are still in the experimental stage [53]. Utilizing
    in situ and on-the-go sensing systems that could record significant data and soil
    parameters in a short period of time is one of the needs of precision farming
    and crop production. This representative data collection results in average cost-effectiveness,
    but by analyzing the data and taking additional measurements, it could also improve
    our current knowledge. Vis-NIR spectroscopy can be used to measure the soil’s
    pH, organic matter concentration, and moisture content [54]. In general, the more
    complicated the problem to be solved, the more data are required [55]. The analysis
    of big data sets is a way to identify relationships, patterns, and trends in the
    data [7]. Incorporating observations from farms and in situ sensing systems with
    current databases presents an opportunity not only to predict yields using traditional
    statistical techniques or DSS Decision Support Systems but also to explore the
    potential of machine learning (ML). This provides an avenue for more advanced
    and sophisticated yield prediction models to be developed [43]. For both in situ
    and on-the-go sensing systems the diverse and unstructured nature of the data
    produced by these sensors presents a significant challenge and requires the use
    of advanced tools for analysis, and because of the enormous volume of data, traditional
    storage and processing systems must be scalable. When dealing with data from different
    sensor types and manufacturers, interoperability concerns may occur, making integration
    more difficult. Furthermore, protecting data privacy and security is essential
    considering the sensitivity of agricultural information. To enable efficient and
    secure big data use in precision agriculture, it is necessary to create strong
    data management strategies, implement standardized protocols, and give security
    measures top priority. The integration of microchips and broadband networks with
    farm equipment, crops, animals, machines, and products through an IoT platform
    is a technological advancement that offers real-time connectivity between devices
    [56]. The application of IoT is particularly relevant in sustainable agriculture,
    given the diversity of factors involved in the agricultural ecosystem, including
    biodiversity, stochastic weather patterns, and the interdependence of living and
    non-living systems. As a result, a comprehensive approach is necessary to address
    these complexities. In addition, IoT and AI can help reduce the effects of climate
    change and greenhouse gas emissions, further emphasizing the significance of these
    technologies in modern agriculture [57,58,59,60]. The research studies’ comparisons
    illustrate multiple approaches for soil and plant sensing systems in precision
    agriculture, each with unique benefits and limitations. Using multi-spectral images
    from satellite imaging to monitor soil and plant quality is highly expensive and
    limited to certain countries. Real-time data can be obtained through on-the-go
    sensors that are installed on machinery or drones, but these sensors must be protected
    from wildlife and occasionally removed during cultivation. Real-time soil nutrient
    sensing is currently in the experimental stage but is crucial for solving environmental
    challenges. With their diverse and unstructured data, in situ and on-the-go sensing
    systems provide a challenge that requires scalable storage and advanced analytical
    tools. For effective big data use in precision agriculture, both studies emphasize
    the value of robust data management, standardized protocols, and security measures.
    2.3. Sensor Development and Sensor Platforms Sensors are utilized at various stages
    of the farming process, from planting through the packaging of the final product.
    The farming process can be broadly classified into distinct categories, including
    planting, soil management, nutrient and water management, pest and disease management,
    yield harvesting, and post-harvest processing, all of which can benefit from the
    integration of advanced sensing technologies. Figure 3 shows sensing technologies
    and their applications in agriculture [61,62]. Figure 3. Sensing technologies
    and their applications in agriculture [62]. Sensors serve a vital function in
    enabling the conversion of real-world signals into their digital representations
    within Ag-IoT systems. The integration of sensors in machine components has become
    increasingly prevalent, providing producers with insights into the systems’ dynamic
    loading and repetitive biotic and abiotic stresses. By collecting and comparing
    data from sensors positioned in the soil, crops, and animals, it is possible to
    identify technical improvements that prioritize criteria of ecological and economic
    sustainability, ultimately enhancing the soil-, plant-, and animal-friendly nature
    of precision agriculture [63]. The appropriate choice of sensors for an application
    is crucial for both inventors and users of IoT systems to ensure optimal sensor
    utilization. Technological advancements in sensors have significantly influenced
    the proliferation of the IoT. Key factors that must be considered when selecting
    sensors for IoT system development include low power consumption, information
    transfer compatibility between the computers and the sensor, precision, sensibility,
    repeatability, and durability [47]. Table 1 gives sensor categories and sensor
    measurements, and examples from the literature are provided. Table 1. Sensor categories
    and measurements [47]. When deployed on UAVs (drones, airplanes), UGVs (tiny,
    intelligent robots), and satellites, cameras with the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) can be utilized to estimate yield and using hyperspectral cameras
    and NDRE (normalized difference red edge) cameras can improve the estimates’ accuracy.
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can
    be used to perform color-based crop (fruit) maturity checks. Gloves with various
    sensors integrated, including touch pressure sensors, imaging, inertia measurement,
    location, and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), are used to classify fruits
    and have been applied in fungal disease classification [77,78,79,80,81,82]. Sensors
    that move both vertically and horizontally within the soil or remain stationary
    in the ground have the potential to collect critical data. With the emergence
    of nanotechnology, the use of increasingly smaller sensors is becoming commonplace
    [83]. The implementation of such sensors, coupled with the resulting data collection,
    can significantly reduce losses during agricultural operations and increase their
    effectiveness. Furthermore, the data collected facilitates the establishment of
    clear classification conditions based on the inherent quality of the crop, thereby
    mitigating the risk of incorrect classification and associated losses [34]. The
    authors of [84] have provided comprehensive information on techniques for disease
    identification in plants, emphasizing the significance of remote sensing methods.
    In a similar vein, ref. [85] have described an automated system for detecting
    facial expressions of pain in sheep with the aim of identifying diseases. Many
    different parameters can be measured with chemical sensors, including soil pH,
    soil salinity, soil nutrients, oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
    the pH and conductivity of irrigation water, and photosynthesis. The pH of soil
    and water is a critical parameter to determine, as it affects the solubility of
    nutrients, which in turn has a significant impact on plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. The two main categories of chemical sensors are photochemical and electrochemical.
    Electrochemical sensors evaluate the electrical properties of chemical reactions
    or the presence of substances, whereas photochemical sensors monitor the spectral
    signature of chemicals or chemical [86]. Some researchers attempt to continuously
    determine grain quality characteristics (protein content, mass density, and moisture
    content) because these affect the market value of the harvested crop. Grain quality
    factors can additionally assist in clarifying grain yield variation [87]. Another
    type of sensors recently under study are soil-degradable sensors that have emerged
    as a specialized sensing technology designed for monitoring soil parameters, including
    moisture content, temperature, pH levels, and nutrient concentrations. These sensors
    possess the unique ability to naturally degrade over time within the soil environment.
    Soil-degradable sensors offer several potential advantages, such as eliminating
    the need for sensor retrieval, minimizing soil pollution risks, and providing
    insights into soil dynamics without disrupting the ecosystem [88]. Inexpensive
    and low-maintenance biodegradable soil moisture sensors could improve existing
    knowledge on the spatial and temporal variability of available soil water at the
    field scale [89]. In their study, Sui et al., 2021 [88] developed and evaluated
    a biodegradable soil moisture sensor using stencil-printing. The sensor was made
    of environmentally friendly materials and consisted of slowly degrading encapsulants
    and rapidly degrading electrodes and substrates. The chosen materials allowed
    the sensor to function reliably in the presence of soil microbes and then quickly
    failed after the encapsulant degraded. The sensor eventually decomposed completely,
    eliminating the need for retrieval. The sensor’s material selection did not hinder
    crop growth, as confirmed via ecotoxicity testing. Different thicknesses of encapsulants
    were used, and the sensor’s sensitivity to volumetric water content (VWC) was
    measured. Accelerated degradation tests under elevated temperature conditions
    assessed the sensor’s long-term stability. The breakdown of the sensor was characterized
    by showing stable performance during its functional lifetime and rapid degradation
    afterward. The encapsulation with a slowly degrading wax blend provided protection,
    reduced drift, and controlled degradation time. A linear capacitance response
    was observed for VWC, ranging from 0 to 72% in soil samples. Overall, these biodegradable
    sensors have the potential to enable maintenance-free, cost-effective, and real-time
    soil moisture measurement at high spatial density for precision irrigation control
    in agriculture. Figure 4 presents an illustration of the mechanism for moisture
    sensor degradation. Wax covers the sensor while it is functional, but after the
    encapsulation fails, it quickly degrades. The sensor’s encapsulant and other functional
    parts degrade in the soil. Figure 4. Illustration of the moisture sensor degradation
    mechanism [88]. These printed sensors have shown reliable performance in laboratory
    settings, but they still have some drawbacks, such as (1) the potential for fouling
    in soil over time, which could affect performance and signal drift; (2) the need
    for maintenance or the eventual removal of the sensors to prevent accumulation
    in the field; and (3) the potential toxicity of the conductive components to soil
    microbes and crops [90,91]. Previous papers have highlighted the changing landscape
    of sensor applications in precision agriculture, including yield estimation, disease
    diagnosis, animal health monitoring, and innovative soil parameter monitoring
    using biodegradable sensors. The incorporation of advanced technologies has the
    potential to revolutionize the collection of data in order to improve agricultural
    practices, which will enhance crop productivity. It has also identified challenges
    such as successfully integrating diverse technologies, processing huge amounts
    of data, ensuring standardization for connectivity, addressing high implementation
    costs, securing data privacy, evaluating environmental impacts, educating farmers
    for technology adoption, navigating regulatory constraints, ensuring sensor reliability
    in harsh conditions, and scaling solutions for widespread agricultural application.
    2.4. Data Transmission Technologies One of the most significant advancements in
    infield monitoring over the past 10 years has been the replacement of wired-based
    complex systems with wireless sensor networks (WSN), complemented by effective
    power management techniques [92]. Sensor networks are used in precision agriculture
    to monitor field environmental conditions and other parameters. These sensors
    connect with one another, producing a network that collects environmental data
    collaboratively. WSNs are naturally specialized and have a simpler infrastructure,
    allowing them to transfer data easily and efficiently from the field to a remote
    user [93]. For the real-time monitoring of critical parameters like soil moisture
    and crop health, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have become essential in agriculture.
    They enable the effective use of water, fertilizer, and pesticides through optimizing
    resource management. WSNs improve data accuracy by efficiently distributing frequencies
    to reduce interference. Precise monitoring over large agricultural landscapes
    is made possible by considering signal intensity, bandwidth usage, and adaptation
    to changing transmission ranges. Energy efficiency is a top priority for WSNs
    for long-term deployment. They are essential for implementing precision agriculture
    and promoting sustainable farming practices due to their scalability and strong
    system models that adapt to various farm sizes and changing conditions. Data transmission
    via wireless constitutes a crucial component of an IoT system, particularly in
    the agricultural domain. Designing an effective Ag-IoT system requires comprehending
    the contributing elements pertaining to radio frequency (RF) that impact signal
    strength, interference, system model, bandwidth, and transmission range. Moreover,
    a thorough understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different wireless
    communication technologies is important for optimal device selection. Wireless
    IoT sensors can track environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, luminosity,
    and soil moisture in real time [94,95,96,97,98,99]. Agricultural data collected
    with sensors will be delivered in a variety of forms based on the required level
    of precision and resolution, necessitating the use of appropriate interfaces to
    ensure compatibility. In the realm of IoT-based intelligent farming, communication
    protocols are essential for covering both short-range and long-range distances
    on the land [100]. ZigBee, Bluetooth, NB-IoT (Narrowband LPWAN technology which
    can coexist in LTE or GSM under licensed frequency bands) [101], and Wi-Fi are
    used for short ranges, while LoRaWAN, Sigfox, LTE m (Long-Term Evolution for Machines)
    [102] and LPWAN protocols in mobile communication networks are utilized for long
    ranges. The LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is designed to function with
    low power consumption and is capable of transmitting sensor signals to a central
    server from up to 30–40 km away on level terrain [103]. In terms of communication
    technologies employed for node and gateway/base station interactions, half of
    the reviewed literature utilized LoRa/LoRaWAN. The selection of an appropriate
    communication technology depends on the unique characteristics of the project,
    such as the required range and data rate, and thus a variety of options are available
    for consideration [104]. A WSN-based application was presented by [105,106], who
    discussed some of the scheme’s advantages, Fuzzy-based Clustering Scheme, for
    example, attempts to reduce the deployment cost, propagation delay, and energy
    consumption while enhancing the reliability of the network. It is particularly
    well suited for large-scale monitoring applications of WSNs with higher node density.
    Will, real-world performance evaluation, addressing hardware and software requirements,
    comparing comparison with existing schemes, responding to network dynamics, and
    ensuring scalability in large-scale WSNs are all potential challenges should be
    discussed. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS/3G/4G, ZigBee, LoRa, and SigFox were among the
    wireless technologies and protocol suites compared by the authors. Because of
    their suitable communication range and low power consumption, they demonstrated
    that LoRa and ZigBee wireless technologies are highly efficient for precision
    agriculture. It is mentioned that numerous strategies and algorithms linked to
    the energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks are classified. They also discussed
    the approaches that can be applied in PA. In the agricultural industry, 4G/3G
    wireless network technology is used to connect IoT-based smart devices for data
    sharing, precise assessment, accurate calculation, and so on. While the 3G/4G
    connectivity paradigm has shown great promise, there are some limitations that
    prevent the technology from reaching its full potential in the agricultural sector.
    One of the most significant limits is the operational area [107,108,109,110].
    The comparison of various protocols is shown in Table 2. Table 2. Communication
    technologies and their advantages [111]. Despite the high speed and good connectivity
    provided by the 4G network, it is not feasible to interconnect all the smart farming
    devices in remote locations at a low installation and maintenance cost. To conduct
    demanding computational operations and run loaded services, a growing number of
    devices and a vast amount of research on IoT devices for smart farming are required.
    These devices also require increased intelligence, speed, scalability, secure
    communication capabilities, and processing power. Ultra-low latency and high connectivity
    are required for IoT devices to achieve quick performance and low costs. The utilization
    of 4G and 3G communication technologies has proven inadequate for real-time precision
    practices, primarily due to issues such as bandwidth limitations, connectivity
    issues, and slow data transfer speeds. In contrast, the integration of 5G technology
    within the agricultural sector has had a significant impact on various aspects,
    including real-time monitoring, unmanned aerial vehicles, virtual consultation,
    predictive maintenance, artificially intelligent robotics, data analytics, and
    cloud repositories. Consequently, the incorporation of 5G structures has facilitated
    improved speed, connectivity, scalability, and processing power, thereby enabling
    the resolution of existing limitations [100,112,113,114]. The important areas
    in the agriculture sector where the development of a 5G mobile network could be
    beneficial are highlighted in Figure 5. Figure 5. Areas of 5G in the agricultural
    sector [100]. While 3G may have coverage limitation, the adoption of 4G in IoT-based
    smart farming ensures reliable connectivity. The anticipated release of 5G revolutionized
    data transport with its ultra-fast, low-latency communication. However, extensive
    infrastructure development is needed for 5G implementation. The decision between
    various technologies requires balancing elements like coverage, speed, and the
    infrastructure’s preparedness, reflecting the shifting connectivity environment
    in precision agriculture. 5G technology allows the increasing usage of IoT applications
    in digital agriculture and the advancement of precision farming technologies,
    allowing spot spraying and real-time image collecting without latency. As a result,
    overall agricultural efficiency, resource optimization, and sustainability improve.
    The use of 5G in agriculture represents a paradigm change, providing farmers with
    advanced technologies to handle the problems of modern farming while also contributing
    to global food security [100,114]. 6G provides better connectivity and faster,
    more reliable communication. It provides higher data rates for real-time transmission,
    lower latency for near-instantaneous responses, and supports massive IoT connectivity,
    which allows to increase the productivity of Agricultural applications. 6G also
    seeks to increase energy efficiency, optimize resource consumption, and extend
    device battery life [115]. The constraints and challenges of implementing 5G in
    precision crop production include low coverage in rural regions, reliability and
    latency-related issues, energy consumption challenges, and implementation costs
    that have not been highlighted. 6G, which is still in its early stages, may face
    hurdles in infrastructure deployment, moving from 5G, unclear adaptation to environmental
    conditions, and resolving data security and privacy concerns. The precise constraints
    in the expanding field of precision agriculture are dependent on ongoing improvements
    and the specifics of different implementations. The comparison of 3G, 4G, 5G,
    and 6G in precision agriculture discussed in the previous works reveals a changing
    landscape. While 4G promises a reliable connection in IoT-based smart farming,
    5G transforms real-time data transit with ultra-fast, low-latency communication,
    although at the expense of significant infrastructure construction. The widespread
    implementation of 5G in agriculture has a beneficial impact on sustainability,
    resource optimization, and efficiency. In order to increase productivity in agriculture,
    the expected 6G technology intends to provide better connectivity, faster and
    more dependable communication, higher data rates, lower latency, and extensive
    IoT support. Both 5G and the potential 6G network have challenges, such as coverage
    limitations, problems with reliability, latency concerns, energy consumption issues,
    infrastructure deployment difficulties, and data security and privacy issues in
    precision crop production. For agricultural sensor data to be presented in a variety
    of ways, communication protocols and interfaces are essential. Wu et al., 2023
    and Chen et al., 2015 [116,117] presented a cyber–physical infrastructure that
    enables the seamless integration of diverse sensors and transparently handles
    their physical differences throughout the World Wide Web (WWW). The infrastructure
    makes it possible to utilize sensor web accessibility and web processing services,
    which allow applications to access sensor data without knowing its physical details.
    IoT communication protocols (such as, MQTT, TLS, DTLS, and AES) are crucial for
    enabling secure communication between resource-constrained devices and services
    on fog, edge, and cloud nodes, as well as HTTP/HTTPS and WebSockets, make it possible
    to transmit data over the web [118]. A lot of Dashboards and standardized models
    improve the visualization of data. The selection depends on sensor types, network
    architecture, and the most appropriate data presentation style chosen to support
    decision making in precision agriculture. 3. Discussion 3.1. Amount of Needed
    Data for Precision Crop Production Precision crop production involves the use
    of advanced technologies to optimize crop yield and reduce waste. Among the key
    components of precision crop production is the collection of data from multiple
    sources (sensors, satellites, etc.). The amount of data needed from sensors in
    precision crop production is related to many aspects. On the one hand, collecting
    large amounts of data is essential for achieving the best possible results in
    precision crop production. Sensors should be used to collect data on a wide range
    of variables, including soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels, as well
    as plant health indicators such as leaf color, height, and growth rate [43]. One
    important principle is that the amount of data needed will depend on the specific
    crops being grown as well as the environmental conditions in which they are being
    grown. It also depends on the goals of the farmer. For example, crops that are
    more sensitive to changes in temperature or moisture levels may require more frequent
    data collection than crops that are more resilient. If the goal is to increase
    yield, then collecting a large amount of data may be necessary to identify the
    factors that are most important for achieving this goal. The authors of [119]
    examine in their article the use of affordable air pollution sensors for air quality
    monitoring and how machine learning techniques can increase the accuracy of the
    sensor data. The study shows data from two low-cost, self-built air pollution
    nodes that were installed at a Barcelona official reference station for four months
    and collected high-resolution data from five electrochemical sensors as well as
    temperature and humidity measurements. During the four months of testing, they
    gathered about 5.5 million samples of row data from each sensor. The Field Monitoring
    Laboratory in Mosonmagyaróvár has been operating in two experimental fields since
    April 2020. The primary goal is to build an IoT data collection technology based
    on site-specific precision crop production demand. The laboratory produces more
    than 100 sensed data points; the data are collected with the LoraWan communication
    protocol in 10–15 min intervals, depending on sensor type. A system structure
    was designed that can integrate the database from different sensors (from different
    producers). The server development is implemented in the .NET language. MS SQL
    databases are used to store sensor data. There were more than 2 million raw data
    collected in the maize vegetation season, and more than 3 million raw data were
    collected over the last three years [43]. The high-resolution data enables an
    analysis of signal processing, sensor sampling approaches, filtering, and calibration
    of low-cost sensors. In the same context, it would be clear how crucial it is
    to analyze and clarify the data acquired to determine how factors like atmospheric,
    soil, and plant characteristics affect the development of precision crop production.
    The development of big data and IoT has led to an explosion in the number of connected
    devices and sensors, generating vast amounts of data that can be analyzed for
    insights. While these technologies have numerous advantages, they also present
    some significant disadvantages that need to be addressed. 3.2. Advantages and
    Disadvantages of IoT Sensors and Big Data in Precision Crop Production The implementation
    of IoT and big data analytics in agriculture has yielded notable benefits. IoT
    sensors and stations facilitate the real-time tracking and monitoring of various
    processes, leading to improved operational efficiency and enhanced crop yield
    optimization. Decision makers can utilize big data analytics to make informed
    and data-driven decisions. Moreover, big data analytics can enhance accuracy by
    providing accurate predictions, trends, and insights. Cost savings are also achieved
    using IoT sensors, which minimize waste, improve asset utilization, and reduce
    energy consumption. These sensors generate data that can be utilized to adjust
    irrigation and fertilization schedules, ensuring that crops receive appropriate
    amounts of water and nutrients at the optimal time. It also has some notable drawbacks;
    one of the primary limitations is the high cost associated with implementing these
    technologies. Additionally, managing the vast amounts of data generated by these
    sensors can also be complex and challenging, requiring the necessary infrastructure
    and expertise to manage and analyze the data effectively. Moreover, the reliability
    of IoT sensors and stations is not always guaranteed, and they are prone to errors
    and failures, which can lead to incorrect data and flawed decision making. Another
    disadvantage is the potential for data overload, whereby the sheer volume of data
    collected can be overwhelming and challenging to process, resulting in difficulty
    filtering out irrelevant data and identifying critical data points. This can cause
    delays in decision making, leading to missed opportunities or increased costs
    this is consistent with [120,121,122]. Challenges with IoT integration in precision
    agriculture include knowledge gaps among farmers, a decrease in agricultural area,
    and the effects of climate change. Data privacy issues highlight the necessity
    for efficient approaches. Future prospects include developments in machine learning,
    AI, and sensing technologies aimed at enhanced proactive decision making. It is
    crucial to fill the knowledge gap and provide scalability for various farming
    needs. The agriculture industry, technology developers, and authorities may work
    together to promote an environment that encourages greater adoption. Opportunities
    will be opened for a sustainable and technologically advanced future in precision
    agricultural production by overcoming challenges and continued research. 4. Conclusions
    The collection of data on various crop-related variables provides farmers with
    a comprehensive understanding, allowing them to make informed decisions for optimized
    yields. However, caution is required, as a large amount of data can lead to information
    overload, requiring a focus on relevant information. The vast amount of raw data
    provides an excellent platform for in-depth research of crops such as maize vegetation
    seasons, providing significant insights into growth, development, and long-term
    performance. This dataset can be used for trend analysis, pattern recognition,
    and potential predictions to enhance maize cultivation practices. The amount of
    data needed for a field plot is determined by the research objectives, precision
    requirements, and available resources. While more data points improve the representativeness
    and accuracy, practical factors like plot size and study complexity also play
    a role. It is important for researchers to carefully plan their data collection
    strategy, taking into consideration the specific research goals and the trade-off
    between data quantity and quality. This ensures that an adequate amount of data
    are collected to provide meaningful insights and draw reliable conclusions while
    also considering practical constraints. Furthermore, the real-time monitoring
    of IoT sensors improves agricultural operating efficiency by giving valuable data
    for informed decisions. Despite the benefits, big data and IoT sensor adoption
    requires careful consideration due to associated challenges such as security,
    complexity, privacy concerns, and reliability issues, necessitating a thorough
    review of their benefits and drawbacks before implementation. Author Contributions

  description: The rapid growth of IoT and its applications in smart cities have brought
    about significant challenges for academic scholars. The increasing number of interconnected
    devices and the massive amounts of data they generate strain traditional networks,
    leading to inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the centralized
    control plane in Software Defined Networks (SDN) poses a single point of failure,
    hindering network performance. Moreover, IoT devices themselves are susceptible
    to attacks, compromising user data and privacy. Scholars in the field urgently
    need a comprehensive solution to address these pressing issues.

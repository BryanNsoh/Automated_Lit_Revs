    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    recommendation. Full size image A confusion matrix is an illustrative format that
    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Because there is more demand for freshwater around the world and the
    world’s population is growing at the same time, there is a severe lack of freshwater
    resources in the central part of the planet. The world’s current population of
    7.2 billion people is expected to grow to over 9 billion by the year 2050. The
    vast majority of freshwater is used for things like cooking, cleaning, and farming.

    billion by the year 2050. The vast majority of freshwater is used for things like

    system using IoT Article 05 January 2022 1 Introduction A particular volume of
    water is required to be provided to a crop at predetermined intervals throughout
    the period in which it is developing. Irrigation is critical to the accomplishment
    of any agricultural project. The process of supplying water to plants via the
    use of mechanical methods is referred to as irrigation. Particularly helpful in
    areas prone to drought or subject to unpredictable rainfall. It is impossible
    to overestimate the significance of water in the life of a plant. Because the
    principles of water management vary depending on the weather, it is essential
    to have a solid understanding of how the soil and plants interact with one another.
    The soil may be sandy, silty, clay, or any number of other textures. Every type
    of soil has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it was formed.
    Consider, for example, the high water absorption capacity of sand. However, the
    nutrients are immediately flushed down the drain. On the other hand, silty soil
    is made up of extremely small particles and has an exceptional capacity to store
    water for extended periods of time. Sadly, water has a difficult time draining
    through this soil because of its structure. The quality of the soil in all of
    its facets, including its ability to retain water and nutrients, is absolutely
    necessary for agricultural production. Therefore, in order to effectively manage
    the water requirements of the various types of soil, it is essential to have a
    solid understanding of the characteristics of the soil [1]. Even if there is sufficient
    precipitation in many agricultural places, there is not enough moisture for crop
    development for a number of different reasons. These causes include a lack of
    storage capacity and/or precipitation that falls at inconvenient times. It has
    been stated that the rainfall is insufficient if it is less than one hundred centimeters,
    as the irrigation system requires at least that much rain in order to function
    properly [2]. Irrigation is also necessary in regions that see fluctuating amounts
    of precipitation, such as the dry Sahel, which receives a lot of rain during the
    monsoon season but suffers from dryness during the winter months. In order to
    assist in the development of crops at times of the year when there is a deficiency
    in rainfall, water irrigation is necessary. The majority of the newest and highest-quality
    hybrid crop varieties need for a substantial amount of watering. As a consequence
    of this, it is very necessary to manage the flow of water in order to improve
    the yield and quality of the crops. Even the most common varieties of sugarcane
    and rice require a substantial amount of water to cultivate, which is demonstrated
    by the extensive and illustrious history of irrigation in the basin. This is something
    that has been well researched and written about. Each individual farmer is responsible
    for carrying out all aspects of agricultural labor, from sowing seeds and picking
    weeds to fertilizing, watering, and harvesting their crops. This process requires
    a significant investment of both time and water, in addition to a substantial
    amount of manual labor [3]. The method includes a number of decision-making phases
    that are spread out across the course of the agricultural cycle to enhance the
    productiveness of farming. Precision agriculture assists farmers in mitigating
    these issues while also increasing crop yields. This is accomplished by continuously
    measuring the soil’s temperature, humidity, temperature gradient, and pH. There
    are a number of industrialized countries in which precision farming is carried
    out exclusively through the use of the Internet of Things. The process of a computer
    being able to learn new abilities by itself through observation and repeated practice
    is referred to as machine learning [4]. In order for the algorithms to learn from
    the input datasets, gradually train the samples, and increase their performance,
    the equations need to be modified. Its foundation in real-world settings enables
    it to develop decision-making capabilities with relatively minimal input from
    humans. Machine learning-based algorithms are increasingly being used in every
    sector of the economy. On the other hand, the accuracy might be very different
    depending on the quality of the data that was utilized. As a consequence of this,
    the representations of the datasets and the variables that are being targeted
    are both essential components of the machine learning approaches [5]. The ability
    to predict the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level,
    together with other meteorological information, is vital for the irrigation action
    timing plan used in precision agriculture. When designing irrigation schedules,
    it is important to highlight the kind of water distribution and to take into account
    the buffer time of the system. Whether deciding when to water plants, the moisture
    level of the soil is an extremely important aspect. As soon as the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded. When it comes to the
    Internet of Things, new agricultural systems are beneficial because of the simplicity
    with which they make farm maintenance. The creation of such an automated system
    makes it possible to hydrate plants without the need for human involvement. Several
    different sectors have begun implementing IoT in order to increase their level
    of production. In today’s world, the Internet of Things is also being applied
    in farming in the form of smart farming. Devices connected to the internet of
    things have the ability to monitor the weather, find solutions to problems with
    irrigation, and assist farmers in increasing their crops in incremental steps.
    Innovative ideas are now necessary in the agriculture industry as a direct result
    of the growing population around the world and the accompanying rise in food consumption.
    Farmers can benefit from the Internet of Things in a number of ways, including
    increased crop productivity, improved harvesting yield, and proper field management;
    water monitoring; water usage limitation; crop monitoring; environmental impact
    prediction in advance; use of fewer people and fewer resources; prediction of
    environmental impact in advance; monitoring of water; and monitoring of crops.
    As a result of increased worldwide demand for freshwater and the concurrent expansion
    in global population, the central area of the planet is currently facing a severe
    lack of available freshwater resources. It is anticipated that by the year 2050,
    the current world population of 7.2 billion would have increased to over 9 billion.
    The vast majority of freshwater is consumed for uses related to household and
    agricultural production. The majority of industrialised countries are in dire
    need of intelligent irrigation systems since the rapid advancement of technology
    has rendered them indispensable [6]. The Smart Irrigation System is equipment
    that is considered to be at the cutting edge of technology when it comes to managing
    the flow of water in agricultural infrastructure. The SIS controller will automatically
    change the irrigation schedule so that it is optimal for the conditions of the
    soil, the current weather, and the prediction for the next week. The water-soil
    interaction as well as the crop water demand that goes along with it may both
    be established via the process of characterising the soil feature. Embedded system
    components, such as a microprocessor, together with the associated timers, sensors,
    and electrical valves, are responsible for regulating the flow of water in autonomous
    irrigation systems. As a result of this, the system is able to work in a more
    efficient manner. Controls for volume and timing, in addition to sensors that
    monitor the moisture content of the soil, are a few examples of automated irrigation.
    The controllers of the intelligent irrigation system each have their own embedded
    intelligence, which works in conjunction with the other integrated components
    of the system. These sophisticated controls keep an eye on the weather as well
    as other aspects of the surrounding environment. Based on their findings, they
    modify watering schedules and quantities so that water is neither wasted nor wasted
    too quickly. You have to be aware that the most recent generation of intelligent
    irrigation controllers set the watering schedule for the irrigation system based
    on weather forecasts. People’s confidence in the correctness of the data projected
    is essential to the operation of such a system since it relies on their input.
    This article presents IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity and soil sensors are used to collect
    soil related data. This data is stored in a centralized cloud. Features are selected
    by CFS algorithm. This will help in discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of
    data is performed by K means algorithm. This will help in keeping similar data
    together. Then classification model is build using the SVM, Random Forest and
    Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained, validated and tested using the acquired
    data. Historical soil and humidity related data is also used in training the model.
    Section 2 presents literature survey of existing work related to intelligent irrigation
    system. Section 3 depicts the methodology part. Section 4 presents result analysis
    and discussion. This section includes performance comparison on the basis of certain
    parameters. Section 5 contains conclusion. 2 Literature survey Weakly-Secured
    Networks, often known as WSNs, are an emerging technology that have the potential
    to completely transform the agricultural industry. Maurya and Jain were kind enough
    to supply details on how to make efficient use of fuzzy logic in agricultural
    precision farming [7]. They assert that the information collected by field sensors
    is transmitted to a base station, which is then delivered to a centralised location.
    Through the use of a threshold hybrid route, the information that has been received
    by the sensors is transmitted to the base station. The authors use fuzzy logic
    to select the best cluster head in order to bring down the total amount of energy
    consumed. Farmers are able to utilise the data received by the base station to
    figure out how much water should be used for irrigation in various parts of their
    property by using the information. Farmers need to implement practises of precision
    agriculture in order to enhance their productivity. If this is the case, implementing
    WSN may significantly help farmers and other players in the agricultural sector,
    notably government irrigation agencies, make great judgements that aid in the
    forecasting of irrigation demands and crop yields. This might be a significant
    benefit of adopting WSN. A method for autonomous precision farming was developed
    by Dong et al. [8], and it makes use of centre pivot irrigation systems. This
    technological advancement makes use of sensor networks that are placed in the
    ground in order to monitor environmental elements in a field, such as the temperature
    of the soil and the moisture levels. As a result, sensors are installed, initial
    power settings are defined, and the network is maintained on a consistent basis
    in order to guarantee the most efficient utilisation of energy. In the past, a
    number of different user applications have been developed to automate and make
    the task of managing and scheduling irrigation systems more straightforward. Vellidis
    and his colleagues came up with a system that allows for more effective watering
    of cotton crops [9]. In order to establish the soil water balance in their system,
    the researchers analysed data sets collected from a variety of cotton-growing
    locations. An android mobile application was developed by the author with the
    help of the datasets. In addition to that, they have designed their app in such
    a way that it can pull weather information from surrounding weather stations.
    In order to achieve optimal levels of cotton production, the software was designed
    to carry out automated planning of the irrigation systems on the basis of the
    calculated irrigation requirements arrived at by applying both local and downloaded
    meteorological data. Imam et al. [10] conducted a study of the challenges associated
    with the design of wireless sensor networks and intelligent humidity sensors for
    use in precision agriculture. This was done with the goal of maximising the benefits
    that could be obtained. In the context of precision farming, they compared the
    performance of several microcontroller families and sensor node units with one
    another. In addition to this, an inventory of relative humidity sensor requirements
    along with modelling and interface methodologies was produced by them. Chen et
    al. [11] suggested that precision farming would be impossible without the use
    of agricultural IoT systems. Several farmers have benefited greatly from the automated
    control and data monitoring systems. The agriculture industry is rapidly turning
    to the use of machine learning in response to the pressing need to enhance traditionally
    employed practises. The capabilities of the IoT to perform remote monitoring and
    data collecting help farmers save both time and effort thanks to the utilisation
    of preexisting internet infrastructure as well as mobile and web-based applications.
    The Internet of Things system used in agriculture incorporates a wide range of
    functions, one of the most important of which is irrigation. As a result of developments
    in technology that have rendered conventional farming methods archaic, people
    are more interested in modern irrigation methods than they are in traditional
    farming. Traditional agricultural methods are no longer viable. The Internet of
    Things would be of enormous use to farmers since it would save them the time and
    effort necessary for manual monitoring of their fields. This is a big deterrent
    for many people living in metropolitan areas, despite the abundance of farmland.
    Farmers would gain greatly from the IoT. Data from sensors stored in the cloud
    might potentially be combined with methods of machine learning in order to provide
    users with assistance in planning for future output. A novel Internet of Things
    (IoT) enabled smart system was presented by Akshay and Ramesh [12] to predict
    the quantity of irrigation that is required for the field by sensing characteristics
    such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature using a machine learning algorithm.
    This was accomplished by Akshay and Ramesh’s novel smart system. We resort to
    the K-closest neighbour strategy in order to circumvent the overfitting problem
    that occurs with the more traditional K-means and SVM methods. The outcomes of
    processing data using 3 weeks’ worth of predefined data are detailed, illustrating
    how the recommended method''s usage of the K-nearest neighbour algorithm may produce
    a completely automated irrigation system. The predictions made by the recommended
    system have a high degree of accuracy. The groundwater that is utilised for irrigation,
    home uses, and industrial reasons was analysed by Sarakutty et al. [13] in this
    particular paper. The writers also mention that in many extensive rural regions,
    irrigation is done with groundwater rather than surface water. Due to the fact
    that water is required for all forms of life on Earth, the problem of water conservation
    is an urgent one that has not yet been resolved. The global water system boosts
    the incomes and productivity of rural areas by providing assistance to farmers
    in reducing the impacts of drought and the variable nature of the weather. Irrigation
    is the most significant consumer of drinkable water but also contributes significantly
    to the depletion of ground water. The use of ground water is an unavoidable outcome
    brought about by the rising demand for agricultural goods. Because of this, it
    is very necessary to adopt cutting-edge technology in irrigation in order to make
    more efficient use of the water that is available. In a smart irrigation system
    enabled by the Internet of Things, in order to minimise the amount of water that
    is used for irrigation while yet being able to accurately estimate the rate at
    which soil moisture is being drained, Singh and others Data collected from field
    sensors and forecasts of the weather that may be available online are used to
    generate estimates of the amount of moisture in the soil. The GBRT has been demonstrated
    to be the most accurate of the several ML approaches that can be used to estimate
    the soil''s moisture content. The presented strategies have the potential to be
    a fruitful research avenue for reducing the amount of water required for irrigation.
    Pratyush Reddy and colleagues [14] have developed an intelligent irrigation system
    that is able to forecast the amount of water that a crop will require by making
    use of an algorithm that is designed for machine learning. The amount of water
    that is required for agricultural purposes may be approximated based on a number
    of different criteria, the moisture content, temperature, and humidity being the
    three most essential of these. The system’s sensors for measuring temperature,
    humidity, and wetness send data to a central CPU, which then links the device
    to the cloud. These sensors are placed in an agricultural field. The data gathered
    in the field is input into a decision tree algorithm, which is an effective tool
    for machine learning and enables efficient result prediction. Kirtana et al. [15]
    produced a work that combines the power of the internet of things (IoT) with an
    algorithm for machine learning in order to automate and speed up the process of
    developing new agricultural techniques. The planning and implementation of a smart
    irrigation system are described in depth in this article. This system makes use
    of machine learning techniques in order to fully and correctly automate the watering
    process. The sensor module is powered by solar energy, which results in a reduction
    in the system''s overall energy consumption and an improvement in the lifetime
    of the system. Singh and Sobti [16] investigated the potential applications of
    several ML algorithms in the field of agriculture as part of their research. In
    addition, the report shed light on the difficulties associated with merging IoT
    and WSN in order to achieve precision agriculture. It has come to light that the
    primary problems stem from a deficiency in intelligent infrastructure, accurate
    sensing technologies, careless water use, and an inability to predict important
    components that are required for irrigation. Therefore, according to the author,
    there is a significant demand for methods of machine learning that are both effective
    and efficient. 3 Methodology In this section, Fig. 1 presents IoT based Sensor
    integrated intelligent irrigation system for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity
    and soil sensors are used to collect soil related data. This data is stored in
    a centralized cloud. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. This will help in
    discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of data is performed by K means algorithm.
    This will help in keeping similar data together. Then classification model is
    build using the SVM, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained,
    validated and tested using the acquired data. Historical soil and humidity related
    data is also used in training the model. Fig. 1 IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent
    irrigation system for agriculture industry Full size image Important features
    are selected using CGS algorithm. K-Means Clustering [17] is one of the most common
    “Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques,” and if you want to evaluate the organisation
    of your data, you may make use of this technique, which gives you the opportunity
    to do so. It is a process that divides the dataset into a predetermined number
    of subsets in an iterative manner (clusters). In addition to making certain that
    the clusters do not intersect with one another, we checked to see that the data
    points contained within each cluster were as analogous to one another as was practically
    possible. The elements were grouped together into clusters according to their
    distances from the cluster''s centre, with the elements that were located the
    furthest away receiving the least amount of weight. The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
    was successful in explaining 86.6% of the variation in the data that was observed.
    K indicates that there is less variance inside a group but a greater degree of
    diversity between groups. A classifier known as a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    [18] can be utilised to accomplish the task of separating data into linear and
    nonlinear categories. If you have more than one different group, support vector
    machine analysis can guide you through the process of building a hyperplane that
    maximises the distances that separate them. The number of classes must be added
    to the number of features to arrive at the total number of hyperplanes. The precise
    positioning and orientation of the hyperplanes can be determined by examining
    the points that make up the supports vector. With the assistance of these support
    vectors, it is possible to expand the margins of the hyperplanes. Support vector
    machines, often known as SVMs, are comprised of mathematical functions known as
    kernels. These kernels accept data as input and output it in the appropriate format.
    SVM kernels are available in a wide variety of shapes, such as linear, radial
    basis function, polynomial, and sigmoidal, amongst others. These kernels are included
    in accordance with the manner in which the data is dispersed. During the course
    of this investigation, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) classification
    model by making use of radial basis functions. A random forest (RF) is a type
    of statistical analysis in which numerous individual decision trees are blended
    to generate a single forest. In the end, the ensemble forecast that was generated
    by many disparate models (tress) is superior to the prediction that was generated
    by any one prediction model. RF can be applied in classification in addition to
    its use in regression analysis, which is one of its more common applications.
    The research led to the development of the classification RF, which utilises three
    hundred trees. Out of bag error decreases with rising tree counts, but eventually
    levels off at 50 trees, which may be used to analyse the error rate by creating
    a plot. In other words, the error rate can be evaluated by drawing a plot [19].
    The Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning that is
    based on Bayes'' theorem as well as the concept that the features that are utilised
    as predictors are independent of one another within a particular class. The Naive
    Bayes model outperforms a large number of other sophisticated classifiers and
    is notably helpful for making multiclass predictions with enormous datasets. It
    is possible to calculate the posterior probability with the assistance of Bayes''
    Theorem. The posterior probability, denoted by the symbol P(W|Y), is computed
    using the formula P(Y|W) * P(W)/P(Y), where P(W) represents the prior probability
    of the predictor, P(Y|W) represents the probability of the predictor given class,
    and P(Y|W) represents the prior probability of the class. We were able to generate
    a density map for each of the seven predictor variables with the help of the Naive
    Bayes function [20]. 4 Result analysis and discussion We created a dataset of
    several environmental parameters such as soil moisture, Humidity, Temperature,
    Pressure, and Luminosity. To create comprehensive data set with all important
    parameters, we have used data sets available at [21]. Rice crop related data set
    has 42665 records. 35000 records used to train the classification model and 7665
    records used to test the classification model. IoT based soil and humidity sensors
    are used to acquire data. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. Results are
    represented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Amount of fresh water saved by proposed
    technique is presented in Fig. 7. Accuracy, precision, specificity, recall and

    the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level and other weather
    information. This is important for the irrigation timing plan. When making irrigation
    schedules, it''s important to pay attention to the type of water distribution
    and take the system''s buffer time into account. The level of moisture in the
    soil is a very important part of deciding when to water plants. When the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded.This article presented
    an Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for the agricultural sector. In order to collect data pertaining to the soil,
    humidity and soil sensors based on the internet of things are utilised. This information
    is kept in a centralised cloud storage system. The CFS algorithm is responsible
    for the selection of features. This will aid in removing irrelevant data. The
    K means approach is used to conduct the clustering of the data. This will assist
    in keeping related data together in one place. The SVM, Random Forest, and Naive
    Bayes algorithms are utilised next in the construction of the classification model.
    Using the data that was obtained, the model is then trained, verified, and tested.
    The training of the model additionally makes use of data relating to the soil''s
    history and the humidity. The K-means SVM hybrid classifier is producing superior
    results for classification, the forecast of water demand, and the conservation
    of fresh water through intelligent irrigation. Hybrid Kmeans SVM is saving fresh
    water up to 20 percent by intelligent irrigation. Data availability The data that

  description: Over the last few years, most of greenhouses have been managed traditionally
    based on manpower to monitor and maintain the plants, such as watering, fertilizing,
    and using their skill in detecting plant diseases. Thus, this study focuses on
    developing a greenhouse monitoring system by using IoT technology. It aims to
    assist the local farmers in monitoring their greenhouse, instead of applying the
    conventional methods that are tedious and required more labour works. For data
    collection, parameters for chilli plants are measured using temperature and humidity
    sensors, soil moisture sensor, and light dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The
    data are sent to microcontroller and transferred to the Ubidots cloud for the
    monitoring purpose. Watering pump and exhaust fan can be activated to control
    the plant parameters so that the plant remains in its normal condition. The sensor
    data are processed through classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
    analyse the plant condition, whether the proposed method is suitable or not for
    the chilli plant to grow. Overall, a mini greenhouse prototype for chilli plant
    has been successfully constructed with a system interface on Ubidots dashboard
    to monitor the condition of the greenhouse plant. Results show that the developed
    system can be an alternative in monitoring the greenhouse condition with accuracy
    of 94.5%.

    1. Introduction In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use
    of technology to improve agricultural practices and address the challenges facing
    the farming community. Monitoring and managing soil quality is an essential aspect
    of agriculture, as it directly influences soil yield, resource allocation, and
    environmental sustainability. For farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other management practices, accurate and timely soil condition
    data is essential. However, conventional soil analysis and monitoring methods
    are frequently time-consuming, labor-intensive, and require specialized knowledge
    sets (Fan et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2020, Toth et al., 2020). Tiny Machine Learning
    (TinyML), an emerging field, offers promising solutions to overcome these limitations.
    TinyML involves deploying machine learning models on Internet of Things (IoT)
    ecosystem devices with limited resources, such as microcontrollers. Real-time
    deployment of complex machine learning models is difficult on these devices due
    to their limited computational memory, and power. Due to the requirement for real-time
    decisions, energy efficiency, and low-latency operations, deploying TinyML models
    for the monitoring and management of soil quality in agriculture presents unique
    challenges. Conventional machine learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Q Learning, are often unsuitable
    for deployment on TinyML devices due to their high computational complexity and
    memory requirements via Information Theory Modelling (ITM) (Micheli et al., 2022,
    Wu et al., 2022, Wu et al., 1 Sept. 1, 2020,) process. In this paper, a power-aware
    and delay-aware TinyML deployment strategy is proposed for the monitoring and
    management of soil quality in agriculture. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling
    (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting,
    and Task Partitioning comprise proposed method reduce energy consumption, reduce
    delay, and maintain accuracy comparable to existing CNN, RNN, and Q Learning algorithms
    by employing these techniques. This research''s primary objective is to develop
    a practical and efficient solution for real-time monitoring and management of
    soil quality, which will enable farmers to optimize resource utilization, increase
    soil yield, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. By deploying TinyML
    models directly on the field using low-power microcontrollers and integrated sensors,
    farmers can continuously monitor key soil quality parameters, such as moisture
    content, pH level, and nutrient levels. This real-time data allows farmers to
    make decisions based on data, respond quickly to changing soil conditions, and
    implement targeted irrigation, fertilization, and pest control interventions.
    The proposed power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model has great potential for
    a variety of real-time agricultural scenarios. Its compatibility with advanced
    machine learning techniques such as CNNs, RNNs, and Q Learning enables the analysis
    of spatial and temporal soil data, thereby facilitating soil disease detection,
    weed identification, and yield prediction. Farmers can efficiently manage agricultural
    operations while minimizing chemical inputs and environmental impact sets by utilizing
    the model''s reduced energy consumption and low-latency capabilities. This paper
    concludes by addressing the need for a power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model
    for the monitoring and management of agricultural soil quality. Combining DVFS,
    Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting, and Task
    Partitioning, the proposed model reduces energy consumption, decreases delay,
    and maintains precision. By enabling real-time decision making, this model has
    the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices, increase soil productivity,
    and promote sustainable resource management. The following sections of this paper
    will describe the methodology, experimental setup, results, and implications of
    our proposed approach, thereby providing valuable insights into the application
    of TinyML for agricultural soil quality monitoring and management scenarios. 2.
    Review of existing methods for deploying efficient soil quality monitoring & management
    techniques Numerous models are proposed for deploying monitoring and management
    techniques for soil quality in real-time scenarios. These consist of: Conventional
    Soil Analysis Techniques Conventional soil analysis techniques involve laboratory-based
    techniques that require collecting soil samples, transporting them to a laboratory,
    and conducting various tests to evaluate soil quality parameters and scenarios.
    Although these methods are accurate, they have time, cost, and scalability limitations
    (Agarwal et al., 2021, Chen et al., 1 Sept. 1, 2021,, Hänsch et al., 2021). They
    are not suitable for monitoring and managing soil conditions in agricultural fields
    in real time (Gopalakrishnan et al., 1 March 1, 2021,, Leanza et al., 2022, Tang
    and Yan, 2022). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs): WSNs are widely used in agriculture
    for soil quality monitoring. These networks consist of sensor nodes that are spatially
    dispersed and collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and other relevant parameters.
    However, there are obstacles regarding energy consumption and scalability. High-power
    sensor nodes and frequent data transmission can rapidly deplete the network''s
    energy resources, resulting in limited deployment range and maintenance issues
    (Efremova, Seddik, & Erten, 2022; Yuan, 2020) through the use of CycleGAN (Generative
    Adversarial Networks) and similar modeling techniques. Remote Sensing: Techniques
    for remote sensing, such as satellite imagery and aerial surveys, provide valuable
    information on soil conditions on a large scale. These techniques can detect large-scale
    patterns of soil quality, plant health, and water stress. Nevertheless, they frequently
    lack the spatial resolution necessary for detailed site-specific monitoring applications.
    Moreover, delays in data acquisition and processing can impede real-time decision-making
    (Li et al., 2023, Ren et al., 2020). Cloud-based systems employ machine learning
    algorithms to analyze vast quantities of soil data gathered by distributed sensors.
    These systems provide a high level of computational power and storage capacity,
    allowing for advanced analytics and decision support. The dependency on cloud
    infrastructure for processing and analysis, however, introduces latency, rendering
    it unsuitable for real-time applications. In addition, it necessitates constant
    connectivity and may be subject to data security and privacy concerns (Lin and
    Hao, 15 April 15, 2021,, Luo et al., 2022). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
    CNNs have been implemented in soil image analysis for tasks such as identifying
    soil contaminants and classifying soil types. They are difficult to deploy on
    resource-constrained devices & sets (Cui, 2021, Wong, 2021) due to their high
    accuracy, which necessitates significant computational resources. RNNs have demonstrated
    promise in time-series analysis for soil moisture prediction and soil yield forecasting.
    Nevertheless, their computational complexity and memory requirements can limit
    their deployment on low-power devices and in low-power scenarios (Hong et al.,
    2022, Monsiváis-Huertero, 2022). Reinforcement Learning (RL): In precision agriculture,
    RL algorithms such as Q Learning have been used to optimize irrigation scheduling
    and nutrient management. Despite their efficacy, these methods frequently require
    substantial computational resources and extensive training of temporal instances
    with the Double Instrumental Variable Method (DIVM) for various scenarios (Bannari
    et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2022). To address the limitations of deep learning
    methods, lightweight machine learning algorithms have been investigated. Decision
    trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM) are examples
    of algorithms that are computationally efficient and suitable for resource-constrained
    devices and situations. (Carnier, de Abreu, & de Andrade, 2023) These algorithms
    can achieve acceptable levels of precision while minimizing computational complexity.
    Existing methods for deploying efficient monitoring and management techniques
    for soil quality encompass a variety of approaches. Traditional methods of soil
    analysis are precise, but time-consuming and therefore unsuitable for real-time
    applications. WSNs and remote sensing techniques provide valuable data, but energy
    consumption and scalability continue to be obstacles. The machine learning techniques
    CNNs, RNNs, and RL provide accurate predictions, but their use cases can be computationally
    intensive. Cloud-based systems provide a high level of computational power, but
    introduce latency and network connectivity dependency levels. Since crop production,
    resource optimization, and environmental sustainability are all directly influenced
    by soil quality, monitoring and maintaining soil quality in agriculture is an
    essential area of research and development. The accompanying literature review
    provides a synopsis of recent studies and innovations in the field, emphasizing
    the need for a fast, energy-efficient, and secure TinyML model for controlling
    and monitoring soil quality in real time scenarios. Quality control and management
    of soil: Soil quality has a major impact on crop yields, nutrient availability,
    water retention, and agricultural sustainability as a whole (Ren et al., 2022,
    Xu et al., 15 March 15, 2022,, Zhou et al., 1 June 1, 2022,). Efficient methods
    of soil monitoring and management are needed for resource allocation, irrigation,
    and fertilizer optimization in order to boost agricultural growth while minimizing
    environmental repercussions. Monitoring soil by methods like hand sampling and
    laboratory analysis may be laborious and time consuming, and it often fails to
    give real-time datasets & scenarios (Akrasi-Mensah, 2023, Qian et al., 2023, Saputhanthri
    et al., 2022, Wang et al., 15 June 15, 2023,). Therefore, there is a growing need
    for reliable soil monitoring devices that can collect data in real time scenarios.
    New opportunities for agricultural decision-making and real-time soil monitoring
    have emerged as a result of recent advancements in machine learning, data analytics,
    and sensor technologies (Alrubei et al., 2022, Bataineh et al., 2022, Ma et al.,
    2022). Tools like this facilitate the collection of detailed information and the
    development of prediction models for assessing soil quality levels. The deployment
    of machine learning models on resource-constrained devices, such as low-power
    microcontrollers, allows local data processing and real-time analytics at the
    network''s edge. This is known as TinyML. TinyML has attracted a lot of attention
    in the agricultural industry because of its potential for on-site analysis, less
    reliance on cloud computing, and increased battery life of deployed devices &
    scenarios. Several studies have investigated TinyML''s potential uses in agriculture,
    particularly in the areas of crop production prediction, disease detection, and
    irrigation management (Hao et al., 2022, Sadawi et al., 2022, Zheng et al., 2022).
    These studies demonstrate the viability and utility of using machine learning
    models for use in agricultural applications on low-power hardware. TinyML Models
    with Low Energy Consumption: Energy efficiency is crucial when deploying TinyML
    models in low-resource environments. A farm''s viability and battery life are
    both directly tied to how much energy is used. Numerous strategies for enhancing
    TinyML models'' power effectiveness have been proposed by the research community.
    Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) (Deebak et al., 2023, Kaur et al.,
    2022, Zhang et al., 2023) adjusts the processor''s voltage and frequency to suit
    the workload. As per (Goh et al., 2022, Wan et al., 2023) Sleep/arousal Energy
    consumption may be decreased by optimizing the device''s sleep and wake cycles
    using genetic algorithms. TinyML devices may be powered autonomously using energy
    collecting techniques like as solar or kinetic energy (Mishra et al., 2023, Zhang
    et al., 2022) levels. Algorithms for task partitioning distribute workloads over
    a network of computers to cut down on power usage levels. Combining TinyML and
    the IoT Internet Safety: Since they collect, analyze, and transfer sensitive data,
    TinyML and IoT networks need the highest level of security. Any vulnerability
    in a network raises the prospect of hostile assaults, unauthorized access, and
    compromised data. Validation attacks including Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and
    Man-in-the-Middle attacks are among the many IoT network security challenges that
    have been examined in (Ayub Khan et al., 2022, Li et al., 2022) for real-time
    scenarios. Attacks like this exploit holes in our current systems of identity
    verification, trust, and network infrastructure sets. Researchers have proposed
    using Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency (PoEE), a lightweight consensus mechanism, to
    reduce the energy requirements of blockchain-based systems and, in turn, improve
    their security (Alshehri et al., 2023, Li et al., 2022) levels. Sidechain creation
    using reinforcement learning methods, such as Q Learning, improves network throughput
    and security levels. Methods Currently Available for Assessing and Controlling
    Soil Quality Various approaches to measuring and controlling soil quality have
    been proposed for use in agricultural settings. Data integrity is ensured by using
    ITM (Insertion Through Mining) technologies built on the blockchain. CycleGAN
    (Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network) generates synthetic soil images
    using deep learning techniques. The DIVM (Decentralized Intelligent Voting Model)
    takes into account soil management decisions. Energy efficiency and security in
    TinyML and IoT networks, soil quality monitoring and management in agriculture,
    the potential of TinyML for real-time analytics, and existing methodologies are
    all highlighted at the end of the literature review. Given this requirement and
    impetus for further study, here propose a TinyML model that is low-energy, secure,
    and quick to run in order to address the drawbacks of existing approaches and
    provide viable solutions for real-time soil quality monitoring and management
    in agriculture process. Thus, researchers have investigated lightweight machine
    learning algorithms and techniques for deploying TinyML models in order to overcome
    these obstacles. These strategies aim to reduce energy consumption, minimize latency,
    and preserve acceptable levels of precision. Utilizing low-power microcontrollers,
    task partitioning, DVFS, genetic algorithm-based sleep/wake strategies, and energy
    harvesting, agriculture scenarios can deploy efficient and real-time soil quality
    monitoring and management systems. 3. Discussion on deploying an efficient power-aware
    & delay-aware TinyML for soil quality monitoring and management in agriculture
    This section discusses the design of a power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model
    for soil quality monitoring and management in agricultural scenarios. As shown
    in Fig. 1, the proposed method combines an enhanced fusion of Dynamic Voltage
    and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms,
    Energy Harvesting, and Task Partitioning processes. The goal is to reduce energy
    consumption, minimize delay, and keep precision comparable to existing methods.

    operations. Download : Download high-res image (277KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Crop disease samples used for the training process. Dynamic Voltage
    and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a power management technique that dynamically
    adjusts the processor''s operating voltage and clock frequency based on the load.
    By adjusting these parameters, the system''s power consumption can be optimized
    while performance requirements are met. DVFS is commonly used to reduce power
    consumption in real-time scenarios for devices with limited resources. In this
    instance, the DFVS Model initially estimates device power using Eq. (1), (1) The
    power consumed by a device is the product of its operating voltage and current,
    thus, by reducing either voltage or current, the power consumption can be reduced
    for different scenarios. Similarly, the energy is estimated via Eq. (2), (2) Similarly,
    the performance level of the device can be observed from Fig. 3, (3) Where, represents
    total instructions executed per cycle, while represents the clock frequency levels.
    Performance is a measure of how many instructions can be executed per clock cycle
    for the clock frequency sets. Download : Download high-res image (413KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Soil Yield Levels used for training the model
    under real-time scenarios. To maintain adequate performance levels while reducing
    power, the clock frequency can be adjusted accordingly for different scenarios.
    Thus, in terms of clock frequency, the energy levels of the device can be estimated
    via Eq. (4), (4) Consequently, the energy consumption of a device is proportional
    to the square of its voltage and clock frequency. By decreasing voltage or clock
    frequency, energy consumption can be reduced significantly for various workloads.
    Voltage and clock frequency are dynamically adjusted based on workload and performance
    requirements to reduce power consumption via DVFS. When the workload is light
    or the computer is idle, the voltage and clock frequency can be decreased to reduce
    energy consumption. In contrast, voltage and clock frequency can be increased
    to ensure adequate performance levels during periods of high computational demand.
    Eq. (5) is used to estimate the Q Level for each classification on the TinyML
    Model in order to accomplish this task, (5) Where, represents total number of
    classifications that were performed on the TinyML Device, while tc & T represents
    total number of correctly classified samples, and total number of samples used
    during the classification process. Similar classifications were done for different
    samples, and a reward value was estimated via Eq. (6), (6) Where, represents a
    discounting factor for the learning process. If the reward value , then there
    is need to modify the Voltage & Frequency levels via Eqs. (7), (8), otherwise
    the Voltage & Frequency is modified via Eqs. (9), (10), (7) (8) Else, (9) (10)
    Based on this process, the model is able to optimize operating frequency for efficient
    DVFS operations. By optimizing the voltage and clock frequency based on the workload,
    DVFS allows for power reduction in TinyML deployments. This technique is crucial
    for resource-constrained devices as it helps extend battery life, reduce energy
    consumption, and enhance energy efficiency without sacrificing performance levels.
    Similar to this, an efficient Genetic Algorithm-based Sleep/Wake Strategy is employed
    to conserve power during idle temporal instance sets. Genetic algorithms are used
    to optimize the sleep/wake scheduling based on historical data and environmental
    conditions. The genetic algorithm iteratively evolves a population of potential
    solutions and selects the fittest individuals for the next generations. To perform
    this task, initially a set of Solutions are generated, and each solution has stochastic
    values of Sleep Cycles (SC), which are estimated via Eq. (11), (11) Based on this
    Sleep Cycle, the TinyML Model is evaluated, and its fitness is estimated via Eq.
    (12) (12) Where, represents the delay needed to perform given classifications.
    Using this fitness value from all solutions, the fitness threshold is calculated
    via Eq. (13), (13) Solutions with are ‘mutated’ and regenerated via Eqs. (11),
    (12), while other solutions are passed directly to the next set of iterations
    via ‘crossover’ operations. This process is repeated for Iterations, and Solution
    with minimum fitness is selected for the final estimation of sleep cycles. This
    process allows for identification of optimal sleep cycles for efficient processing
    of data samples with high-speed levels, and is cascaded with an efficient energy
    harvesting process. Energy harvesting techniques involve capturing and converting
    ambient energy sources (such as solar power, kinetic energy, or thermal energy)
    into electrical energy to power the TinyML devices & samples. This reduces dependence
    on batteries and extends the operational lifetime of the devices under different
    scenarios. Energy harvesting is a technique that involves capturing and converting
    ambient energy sources into electrical energy to power TinyML devices for different
    scenarios. By utilizing energy harvesting, the dependence on batteries can be
    reduced or eliminated, thereby extending the operational lifetime of the device
    and reducing power consumption levels. The power harvested ( ) is initially calculated
    via Eq. (14), (14) Where, is the power efficiency of a given source, while represents
    current levels from that set of sources. The power harvested from the ambient
    energy source is determined by the energy conversion efficiency of the harvesting
    system and the intensity of the available energy sources. The energy conversion
    efficiency represents the effectiveness of the energy harvesting system in converting
    the captured energy into usable electrical power levels. Based on this, the energy
    stored (ES) on the device is estimated via Eq. (15), (15) The harvested energy
    is stored for future calculations. Total stored energy is equal to the product
    of the amount of energy harvested and the amount of time it has been accumulating
    for the given source sets. This stored energy can be used to power TinyML devices
    while they are in operation. The proposed energy harvesting system takes advantage
    of Solar Energy, Thermal Energy, and Radiofrequency Energy, as it is connected
    to farms with abundant Solar Radiation, Heat, and RF signals. Rechargeable batteries
    store the harvested energy. During operation, the stored energy is used to power
    the TinyML device, reducing the need for external power sources. By incorporating
    energy harvesting techniques into TinyML deployments, power consumption was decreased
    and the device''s operational lifetime was increased for various scenarios. This
    allows for continuous and autonomous operation, making it ideal for applications
    in remote or inaccessible environments where frequent battery replacements are
    impractical under real-world conditions. Similar to Sleep Cycle optimizations,
    an effective Task Partitioning Method was implemented, which assisted in reducing
    energy & delay levels for various TinyML operation sets. The power & delay-aware
    task partitioning equation aims to minimize the TinyML system''s energy consumption
    while maximizing task execution levels. The model uses Genetic Algorithm to partition
    tasks stochastically, and then estimates Task Partitioning Fitness using Eq. (16),
    (16) Where, represents Number of Stochastic partitions which were done during
    generation of GA solutions. Based on similar ‘mutation’ & ‘crossover’ operations,
    this model is able to identify efficient value of which can minimize the delay
    & energy levels during execution on TinyML device sets. A combination of these
    methods was deployed on the TinyML device, which assisted in reducing energy consumption,
    reduce delay needed for processing, while maintaining higher accuracy levels for
    different scenarios. The model is able to efficiently perform communications with
    different sensors, and process their data samples with high precision, accuracy
    & recall levels. To further strengthen the deployment capabilities of the model,
    all processed data samples are stored on blockchains. To maintain better energy
    performance, an effective Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency (PoEE) based consensus is
    used while addition of new blocks. The PoEE Model requests an augmented cluster
    of nearby nodes with higher energy efficiency to perform consensus. This is facilitated
    via Eq. (17), where an augmented consensus score (CS) is calculated for each node,
    (17) Where, represents energy consumed by the node during the communication, while
    represents residual energy of the current node, and represents number of communications
    that are done by the node during temporal evaluation process. Nodes with lower
    value of are used for the mining process, which ensures that nodes that have consumed
    lower energy during previous communications, and have higher residual energy are
    selected for the consensus process. These nodes are used to add new blocks to
    the chain, which assists in securing the model from data modification attacks.
    But as the number of blocks increase, the energy requirement for adding these
    blocks also increases. To overcome this issue, an iterative Q Learning based model
    is used to form multiple sidechains. This model estimates an iterative Q Value
    after a stochastic set of communications. The number of stochastic communications
    is evaluated via Eq. (18), (18) Where, is a reward value, which is estimated by
    the Q Learning process (initially set to 1), while is the previous number of communications
    used for the evaluation process. After each set of communications, a Q Value is
    estimated via Eq. (19), (19) Where, THR & d represents the throughput obtained
    and delay needed during these communications. After estimation of this value consecutively
    for more than 2 set of communications, a reward value is estimated via equation
    (20), (20) Where, represents Learning Rate for the model, while represents discount
    factor for the evaluation process. If the value of , then it indicates the current
    set of communications required lower energy consumption, and had higher throughput,
    thus the current blockchain configuration is not modified, else, the blockchain
    is split into 2 equal sidechains. New blocks are added to any of the sidechains.
    This allows the model to securely communicate different data samples while maintaining
    lower delay and lower energy consumption for different communications. Evaluation
    of this model was done in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, delay and energy
    levels in the next section of this text. 4. Comparative result analysis The proposed
    secure, delay-aware & energy-aware model for TinyML deployments uses a fusion
    of DVFS, Energy Harvesting, Sleep Cycle Optimization, Task Partitioning & Q Learning
    with PoEE, which assists in reducing the delay & energy during classification,
    while maintaining higher Precision (P), Accuracy (A), & Recall (R) levels even
    under attacks. To validate performance of this model, this section is segregated
    into 2 parts. Part 1 demonstrates the QoS & classification performance of the
    model under non-attack ideal conditions, while part 2 showcases the QoS performance
    of the model under attacks. This will assist readers to identify model’s performance
    under real-time scenarios. 4.1. QoS & classification performance under non-attack
    (ideal) scenarios In this section, the proposed model is estimated under non-attack
    (ideal) scenario, and levels of precision (P), accuracy (A), and recall (R), were
    estimated under these scenarios. These levels were estimated via Eqs. (21), (22),
    (23) as follows, (21) (22) (23) Where, represents the standard true & false rates
    for different operations. Similar to this, the delay & energy levels were estimated
    via Eqs. (24), (25) as follows, (24) (25) Where, represents timestamps for completion
    & starting the classification operations, while represents residual energy levels
    of the node during different communication operations. These metrics were estimated
    using Mini VGGNet, Tiny ImageNet, and Tiny GoogLeNet Models, each of which were
    tested on the following datasets & samples, • Soil Geographic Databases (https://www.isric.org/explore/soil-geographic-databases).
    • European Soil Datasets (https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resource-type/datasets).
    • NLDAS Soils Datasets and Illustration (https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/soils).
    A fusion of these sets resulted in 500 k different image samples, out of which
    400 k were used for training, while 50 k each were used for validation & testing
    use cases. A sample of these images can be observed from Fig. 2, Fig. 3, where
    different disease types, and soil yield levels can be observed for multiple scenarios.
    The model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi Board, and the ensemble techniques were
    integrated in it for multiple classification scenarios. Based on this strategy,
    the precision of classification was estimated and compared with ITM (Wu et al.,
    2022); CycleGAN (Efremova, Seddik, Erten, & Using, 2022), & DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022), which can be observed from Fig. 4 as follows, Download : Download high-res
    image (128KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Precision levels obtained
    during the classification process. On the basis of this evaluation, it can be
    concluded that the proposed model is capable of predicting soil yield with high
    precision under real-time conditions. Due to the use of true-positive levels during
    the Genetic Algorithm optimization process, this precision is maintained. Similarly,
    the accuracy obtained during these evaluations is depicted in Fig. 5 as follows,
    Download : Download high-res image (155KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 5. Accuracy levels obtained during the classification process. Based on this
    assessment, it can be seen that the suggested model can continue to predict soil
    yields with high accuracy levels in real-time scenarios. Due to the use of true-positive
    levels during the Genetic Algorithm & DVFS Q Learning optimization process, this
    accuracy is preserved. Similar to that, Fig. 6 shows the recall obtained during
    these evaluations as follows, Download : Download high-res image (169KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Recall levels obtained during the classification
    process. This evaluation shows that the suggested model can consistently predict
    disease and soil yield with high recall levels in real-world scenarios. The use
    of true-positive levels during the Genetic Algorithm & DVFS Q Learning optimization
    process ensures that this recall is maintained for different scenarios. Similar
    to Fig. 6, the following can be seen from Fig. 7 regarding the delay required
    during these evaluations, Download : Download high-res image (227KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Delay needed during the classification process.
    On the basis of this evaluation, it can be concluded that the proposed model can
    reduce soil yield prediction delay by 8.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022),
    10.0 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 15.4 % compared to DIVM
    (Yang et al., 2022) under real-time conditions. This delay is decreased due to
    the utilization of ensemble Models that employ Genetic Algorithm & Q Learning
    in conjunction with harvesting optimizations, which aids in high-seed yield prediction
    for various soil types. Similarly, the energy required for these evaluations is
    depicted in Fig. 8 as follows, Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Energy needed during the classification process.
    On the basis of this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can reduce
    the energy required for soil yield prediction by 15.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et
    al., 2022), 18.3 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 16.5 % compared
    to DIVM (Yang et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios. Multiple optimizations, such
    as Task Partitioning, Energy Harvesting, Sleep Scheduling, and DVFS operations,
    reduce this energy consumption in real-time scenarios. Consequently, the proposed
    model exhibited optimal levels of accuracy, precision, and recall while maintaining
    a higher rate of operation and reduced energy consumption levels. These features
    enable the model to be deployed for a wide range of TinyML use cases and real-time
    scenarios. 4.2. QoS performance of the model under different attacks To further
    validate the model’s performance under real-time scenarios. It was evaluated under
    Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. The Finney attack
    is illustrative of the kind of validation attacks that may be launched against
    IoT networks. An enemy who is also a miner on the blockchain network conceals
    a valid transaction inside a fraudulent one. The attacker operates in concert,
    launching a network transaction and mining a block that includes it concurrently.
    An adversary may then use the extracted block in a transaction, such as making
    a purchase or sending money. This allows the opponent to gain from the exchange
    without bearing any of the burdens. The Sybil attack is another common kind of
    validation attack in IoT networks. A bad actor creates a network of fake nodes,
    each of which is an identity. The network may be manipulated or controlled using
    these bogus identities. By adopting several false identities inside the network,
    an adversary might trick other nodes into believing false information or taking
    part in malicious activities by exploiting the network''s trust mechanisms. This
    kind of attack has the potential to cause a wide range of security and integrity
    problems, including tampered with data, interrupted communications, and unwanted
    access to sensitive information sets. Masquerade attacks, sometimes called impersonation
    attacks, target IoT networks by assuming the identity of a trusted actor. In this
    kind of attack, sensitive information or resources are accessed by pretending
    to be a trusted device or user. By masquerading as a trusted entity, an attacker
    may bypass protections and carry out malicious activities including taking complete
    control of a device, stealing sensitive information, or executing illegal commands.
    The need of secure access control and authentication mechanisms in IoT networks
    was brought home by this assault. MitM refers to a “man-in-the-middle” assault.
    This validation attack takes advantage of the insecurity of IoT network communication
    channels. An attacker changes legitimate communication between two parties in
    this attack. An attacker may do harm by intercepting communications, tampering
    with the data in transit, or even injecting harmful orders or data. The confidentiality,
    integrity, and validity of the communication might be jeopardized by this assault,
    which could lead to data breaches, unauthorized device control, or other undesirable
    outcomes in the Internet of Things. Secure communication mechanisms, such encryption
    and digital signatures, are needed to combat this risk and safeguard the confidentiality
    and authenticity of information shared across IoT networks. After application
    of these attacks, values of end-to-end communication delay, energy needed during
    communications, throughput during communication and PDR levels were estimated
    for evaluation purposes. A total of 10 % of all network communications were stochastically
    simulated as attacks, and average levels of delay, energy, throughput & PDR were
    estimated for each of these attack scenarios. Based on this strategy, the delay
    levels under attack can be observed from Fig. 9, Download : Download high-res
    image (136KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Average level of delay
    under different attacks. On the basis of this evaluation, it can be concluded
    that the proposed model can reduce delay during communication under attack for
    soil prediction scenarios by 4.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 12.4 % compared
    to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 8.3 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022) under real-time conditions. This delay is decreased due to the utilization
    of Q Learning for the formation of sidechains, in conjunction with PoEE based
    consensus, which aids in higher-speed of the network even under multiple attacks.
    Similarly, the energy required for these evaluations is depicted in Fig. 10 as
    follows, Download : Download high-res image (235KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. Average level of energy under different attacks. On the basis of
    this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can reduce the energy required
    for communication by 4.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 16.4 % compared
    to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 18.5 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022) in real-time scenarios. Multiple optimizations, including Q Learning & PoEE
    consensus, reduce this energy consumption in real-time scenarios. Similarly, the
    throughput levels can be observed from Fig. 11 as follows, Download : Download
    high-res image (181KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Throughput
    levels for different communication scenarios. On the basis of this evaluation,
    it is clear that the proposed model can improve the throughput during communication
    by 10.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 12.5 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova
    et al., 2022), and 18.3 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios.
    This is due to use of throughput during Q Learning optimizations, which assists
    in formation of sidechains. Similarly, the PDR levels can be observed from Fig.
    12 as follows, Download : Download high-res image (153KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. PDR levels for different communication scenarios. On
    the basis of this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can improve
    the PDR during communication by 1.9 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 2.4 %
    compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 2.5 % compared to DIVM (Yang
    et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios. This is due to use of PDR during Q Learning
    optimizations, which assists in formation of sidechains. Due to these optimizations,
    the proposed model is capable of deployment for an augmented & wide variety of
    real-time scenarios. 5. Conclusion and future scope In conclusion, this paper
    presents an innovative method for deploying an energy-efficient, secure, and high-speed
    TinyML model designed specifically for agricultural soil quality monitoring and
    management. The proposed model addresses the urgent need for precise and sustainable
    agricultural practices by enabling real-time decision-making in environments with
    limited resources. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies
    based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting, and Task Partitioning are among
    the optimization techniques incorporated into the model. In comparison to cutting-edge
    techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks
    (RNNs), and Q Learning, these techniques effectively reduce the model''s energy
    consumption by 8.5 % and delay by 10.4 % without compromising accuracy. To ensure
    the security and integrity of the model, a consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency
    (PoEE) is utilized. The model employs a lightweight consensus supported by sidechain
    formation based on Q Learning, which increases security without significantly
    increasing energy needs. The performance of the model is rigorously evaluated
    under multiple attack scenarios, such as Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and Man-in-the-Middle
    attacks, demonstrating its resilience and efficacy in real-time scenarios. Significant
    practical implications result from the proposed model in the agricultural field.
    By continuously monitoring soil quality parameters like moisture content, pH level,
    and nutrient levels, farmers can optimize irrigation, fertilization, and resource
    allocation, leading to an increase in soil yield and a decrease in environmental
    impact. Incorporating sensors and low-power microcontrollers into the model enables
    on-site analysis and immediate feedback to farmers, thereby facilitating timely
    interventions and treatments. The performance evaluation of the model demonstrates
    its superiority to existing techniques. The proposed model reduces communication
    delay by 4.5 % relative to ITM, 12.4 % relative to CycleGAN, and 8.0 % relative
    to DIVM under real-time conditions. Furthermore, its energy consumption is reduced
    by 4.5 % compared to ITM, 16.4 % compared to CycleGAN, and 18.0 % compared to
    DIVM. The model also demonstrates an increase in throughput of 10.5 % versus ITM,
    12.5 % versus CycleGAN, and 18.3 % versus DIVM, as well as an increase in Packet
    Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 1.9 % versus ITM, 2.4 % versus CycleGAN, and 2.5 % versus
    DIVM. The proposed energy-efficient, secure, and high-speed TinyML model provides
    an innovative solution for real-time monitoring and management of soil quality
    in agriculture. By reducing energy consumption, minimizing communication delay,
    and increasing throughput and PDR levels, the model enables farmers to make timely
    decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and practice sustainable agriculture.
    The model''s efficacy, dependability, and applicability to a vast array of real-world
    scenarios are ensured by the incorporation of advanced optimization techniques
    and robust security measures. With the potential to revolutionize soil management
    practices, the proposed model holds great promise for future agricultural productivity,
    environmental impact reduction, and food security promotion process. CRediT authorship

    Irrigation decision support systems evolving in the domestic temperate tree fruit
    production industry incorporate measures of soil moisture status, which diverges
    from classic physiological indicators of edaphic stress. This study used an autonomous
    sensor-based irrigation system to impose a water deficit (soil matric potential
    targets of –25, –40, –60, and –80 kPa) on ‘Autumn Gala’, ‘CrimsonCrisp’, and ‘Golden
    Delicious’ apple (Malus domestica) cultivars grafted to ‘Budagovsky 9’ rootstock
    in the greenhouse (n = 60). It was hypothesized that relationships between physiological
    plant function, assessed via infrared gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence,
    and the soil matric potential may be used to advance emerging irrigation decision
    support systems. Complications arising from defoliation by day 11 at –60 and –80
    kPa indicate the generation of substrate-specific soil–water relationships in
    research applications of autonomous sensor-based irrigation systems. ‘Autumn Gala’
    carbon assimilation rates at –80 kPa declined from day 0 to day 8 (9.93 and 5.86
    μmol⋅m–2⋅s–1 carbon dioxide), whereas the transpiration rate was maintained, potentially
    reducing observed defoliation as other cultivars increased transpiration to maintain
    carbon assimilation. Correlation matrices revealed Pearson’s r ≤ |0.43| for all
    physiological metrics considered with soil matric potential. Nevertheless, exploratory
    regression analysis on predawn leaf water potential, carbon assimilation, transpiration,
    stomatal conductance, and nonphotochemical quenching exposed speculatively useful
    data and data shapes that warrant additional study. Nonlinear piecewise regression
    suggested soil matric potential may useful as a predictor for the rate of change
    in predawn leaf water potential upon exposure to a water deficit. The critical
    point bridging the linear spans, –30.6 kPa, could be useful for incorporating
    in emerging irrigation decision support systems. Keywords: gas exchange; leaf

    stress Irrigation management choices in commercial temperate fruit production
    systems vary by region, yet are dominated simply by grower experience or, in fewer
    cases, by following regional evapotranspiration estimates. Nevertheless, the use
    of agricultural technology providers and concomitant popularity of decision support
    platforms is hypothesized to increase as autonomous monitoring technologies mature
    and the cost barrier to entry declines. Principally, irrigation monitoring technologies
    can be separated by those using soil-based indicators, weather-based indicators,
    plant-based indicators, and some combination of the preceding (Osroosh et al.
    2016). Currently, numerous decision support platforms incorporate soil moisture
    indicators into irrigation recommendations. Equipment, however, is varied, from
    applications of remote sensing such as the North American Space Administration’s
    Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite network, unmanned aerial vehicles incorporating
    agricultural imaging systems (i.e., drones), and ground-based measures consisting
    of multiple environmental sensor types. Soil moisture sensors can be divided into
    those that measure volumetric water content and those that measure the tension
    (i.e., pressure) of water held in the soil. The volumetric sensor type includes
    capacitance-based sensors determinant on the capability of the soil to store electric
    charge, time domain reflectometry sensors measuring the dielectric constant of
    the soil, and radioactive neutron probes measuring the scattering of neutrons
    dependent on soil hydrogen content. Tension-type soil moisture sensors include
    tensiometers that measure pressure directly and granular matrix sensors that function
    as a rheostat, a variable resistor dependent on water ingress into the granular
    matrix. For a more comprehensive discussion of soil moisture sensing, we direct
    readers to a description by the University of Minnesota Extension (2019). Soil
    moisture is a commonly used sensing technology for irrigation support systems
    because of its lower cost of entry, ease of measurement, and interpretation relative
    to techniques focusing directly on plant physiology. Some real-time plant physiological
    monitoring platforms are currently in an early adopter phase, yet the classic
    measures of plant physiological response to drought stress are point-based handmade
    measures. Leaf and stem water potential indicate the internal water status of
    plants and are used routinely as one of the metrics for quantifying drought responses
    in woody species including apple (Davies and Lakso 1979; Tworkoski et al. 2016).
    It has also been established that as leaf water potential declines, stoma closure
    occurs to prevent water loss via transpiration, thereby limiting atmospheric CO2
    intake and inhibiting photosynthesis (Lakso and Seeley 1978). Therefore, photosynthesis
    parameters with respect to gas exchange, including photosynthetic carbon assimilation
    (A), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs), intrinsic water-use efficiency
    (WUE) (A-to-gs ratio, indicating a trade-off between photosynthesis and transpiration),
    and chlorophyll fluoresce, such as quantum yield for photosystem II photochemistry
    (Sooriyapathirana et al. 2021), are identified as standard indicators for plant
    physiological changes under a water deficit. The prior physiological metrics,
    despite being commonly used in research settings, have a limited commercial adoption
    as a result of costly equipment requirements, technical proficiencies inconsonant
    with workforce composition, and 3 lack of autonomy (Rodriguez-Dominguez et al.
    2022). These concerns, coupled with the need for continual measurement for the
    detection of the onset of water deficit stress, have led to commercial movement
    toward autonomous decision support systems referred to earlier (Jiang and He 2021;
    Osroosh et al. 2016). In an academic setting, horticultural drought stress research
    is typically conducted in one of three ways. First and most commonly, water supply
    is removed entirely or modified as a percentage of a “typical” event volume (Bhusal
    et al. 2023). Second, lysimeters can be used to determine precisely the plant
    water demand using a mass-balance approach for watering, but may be best suited
    to studies of short duration, which limits the biomass accumulation to avoid entanglement
    with the inferred water mass balance (Granier et al. 2006; McCauely and Nackley
    2022). Third, researchers may derive or measure evapotranspiration dynamics and
    modify irrigation events conforming to a percentage of total evapotranspiration
    (Osroosh et al. 2015, 2016). Attempts to study the efficacy of using soil tension
    sensors for informing irrigation decisions in apple have relied on the “refill”
    methodology. Herein, two thresholds of soil matric potential are selected for
    representing wet and dry soil conditions. Irrigation is initiated manually upon
    sensor readings surpassing the dry threshold and is ceased when the wet threshold
    is reached, thereby refilling the media’s pore space. In prior investigations,
    both adequate and underirrigation of field-planted apple trees were observed using
    this methodology compared with competing decision support systems incorporating
    weather-based and conventional intuition-based approaches (Jiang and He 2021;
    Osroosh et al. 2016). Additional efforts to maintain soil matric potential in
    between wet and dry conditions are needed for a more complete understanding of
    the potential of tension-based soil moisture sensors for irrigation decision support
    systems. Furthermore, measurement of plant physiological response to drought stress
    conducted concomitantly with autonomous soil moisture monitoring and control systems
    can provide practical insights for increasing the utility of soil moisture sensory
    platforms and decision support systems. One example, in a regression of predawn
    leaf water potential of potted apple trees by soil water content reported by Tworkoski
    et al. (2016), suggested the probability of encountering substantially stressful
    plant water potentials may be deduced from the ratio of the soil water mass to
    the substrate mass. Recently, a platform for soil matric potential measurement
    and sensor-based irrigation automation, Open_Irr (USDA-ARS, Kearneysville, WV,
    USA), was designed for use in horticultural research studies of edaphic stresses
    (Bierer 2023). The Open_Irr system was designed to use granular matrix Watermark®
    sensors (Irrometer Co. Inc., Riverside, CA, USA) because they have a lower cost
    compared with several other soil-based sensor types; as an analog sensor, they
    are well suited for low-cost data-logging solutions; and tension-based sensors
    have a direct tie to plant water availability over volumetric-based sensors. Some
    disadvantages of the granular matrix Watermark® sensors are that the response
    time to changes in soil water is on a minutes-scale delay; sensor-to-soil contact
    is critical for proper readings, which leads to a lesser reliability in sandy
    soils; and soil salinity and temperature can affect readings. Notably, the Open_Irr
    system allows for long-term horticultural study (i.e., scenarios encountering
    substantial biomass accumulation or dynamic plant water needs by triggering irrigation
    events directly and autonomously using Watermark® sensor readings). In this way,
    the water deficit imposition is fully autonomous and can be studied at various
    extremities between the typical wet and dry threshold system previously explored
    for soil tension sensors. Furthermore, research emphasis can be placed on plant
    physiological response rather than water administration. Therefore, it is of particular
    interest to examine relationships between the soil matric potential and the scientific
    standard physiological responses to a water deficit with the ambition of improving
    emerging decision support systems incorporating soil-based sensing technologies.
    This study details the first research trial of the Open_Irr platform for autonomous
    imposition of drought stress in three apple cultivars—Autumn Gala, CrimsonCrisp,
    and Golden Delicious—grafted to a common ‘Budagovsky 9’ rootstock. Despite varying
    in their fruit quality and disease resistance, these three midseason cultivars
    are similar in vigor (moderate to moderately high) and economically important
    apples in the mid-Atlantic region of study, and thus were selected for this research.
    The objectives of this study were to identify plant physiological responses to
    water deficit levels imposed by the Open_Irr system, to determine any influence
    of scion cultivar grafted on a common rootstock on physiological responses of
    the trees to a water deficit, and to determine whether useful relationships exist
    between plant physiological responses and soil moisture status (i.e., the matric
    potential) that may support emerging decision support systems. Materials and Methods
    Two factors, scion cultivar (Autumn Gala, CrimsonCrisp, and Golden Delicious)
    and the targeted soil matric potential (–25, –40, –60, and –80 kPa), were considered
    in a randomized complete block design, with five blocks arranged in north–south
    rows in a climate-controlled greenhouse. In this arrangement, all cultivar-by-matric
    potential combinations (n = 12) were present in each block (N = 60). Three pots
    in each block were assigned the same matric potential target and were considered
    as a group for the trigger of irrigation events based on the mean soil matric
    potential. In our study, drought conditions were imposed based on limiting watering
    events to occur based on a soil matric potential target using the Open_Irr platform
    (Bierer 2023). Briefly, a municipal water source was routed to distribution manifolds
    connected to solenoid valves and a 1.9-cm-diameter irrigation dripline with a
    single emitter installed per pot. Resistive granular matrix type Watermark® sensors
    were installed in each pot and the sensor readings were used to trigger irrigation
    events following an algorithm to identify potential outlier sensors and calculate
    a mean for each three-pot group. The irrigation event duration was 6 s, corresponding
    to a mean discharge volume of 10.2 mL per event. After an event was triggered,
    additional events were prohibited for 15 min to allow for a granular matrix sensor
    response time. For additional information on the irrigation automation setup or
    the outlier algorithm, a more comprehensive explanation is given in the Open_Irr
    hardware publication (Bierer 2023). The potting substrate was specified as a mineral
    soil to optimize the contact between the Watermark® sensors and substrate because
    commercial potting media is less effective for resistive-based soil moisture monitoring.
    Soil was collected from the top 20 cm of a soil profile in Jefferson county, WV,
    USA, and was classified as a Funkstown silt loam (fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic,
    Oxyaquic Hapludalfs) based on latitude and longitude by web soil survey (Soil
    Survey Staff 2021). The soil was collected from a field in perennial hay production
    with primary constituents of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), johnsongrass (Sorghum
    halepense L.), and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.). Soil was field-screened
    to 1 cm then dried at 60 °C before further use. High-drainage 3150-cm3-square
    tree pots (with a height of 30.5 cm and a taper of 13 × 13 mm–7.6 × 7.6 mm) were
    selected to allow additional height for sensor deployment, enhanced drainage properties,
    and compatibility with a grid-based support frame constructed in the greenhouse.
    Cheese cloth was placed over the bottom of each pot to prevent soil passthrough.
    Two-year-old bare-rooted nursery trees were potted in the following stages to
    allow proper deployment of soil moisture and temperature sensors within the rooting
    zone. First, 725 g of air-dried soil was placed into each pot. Soil moisture and
    temperature sensors were then held in place as a 2:1 soil-to-water mixture was
    poured to surround and support the Watermark® and calibration-related temperature
    sensors. The mixture was prepared by mass as 800 g of air-dried soil; the water
    counterpart was from a municipal source. Pots were left to rest for 5 d to attain
    partial drying and support the sensors firmly. During this time, 30-cm cotton-fiber
    wicking cords were installed in each pot by folding one edge of a cord around
    a flat-head screwdriver and inserting it, through the cheese cloth cover, 5 cm
    into the bottom of each pot. After 5 d had elapsed, trees were removed from cold
    storage and pruned to a 10-cm rooting depth and a 70-cm height above the graft
    union for approximate standardization. On 3 Feb 2022, trees were held in place
    as 1335 g air-dried soil was poured into the pot around the root tissues. The
    soil in each pot was pressed gently to ensure stability of the potted trees. Then,
    800 mL of municipal water was added to each pot to wet the media thoroughly. The
    tree diameter 15 cm above the graft union was recorded immediately after planting
    as the average of north–south and east–west measures using digital calipers. All
    trees were hand-watered twice per week to saturation while breaking dormancy and
    accumulating foliage before the period of study. None of the experimental trees
    produced flowers during the period of study. On 25 Mar 2022, hand-watering ceased
    and the water management system of the Open_Irr device was enabled and set to
    maintain a soil matric potential of all pots at –25 kPa to equilibrate. The Open_Irr
    device recorded the soil matric potential of each pot on a 15-min interval and
    opened solenoid valves automatically in between the pressurized municipal water
    line and dripline leading to respective emitters for 6 s at a time for intended
    maintenance of the soil matric potential targets. On 16 May 2022, the soil matric
    potential targets (–25, –40, –60, and –80 kPa) were specified in the Open_Irr
    device and the water deficit study commenced. The soil matric potential targets
    were chosen to reflect a generalized soil–water retention curve for the silt loam
    soil texture (Leong and Rahardjo 1997) and existing literature regarding soil
    matric potential thresholds for irrigation in apple. Note that substantial desiccation,
    leading to defoliation, occurred during pot dry-down in the –60- and –80-kPa treatments,
    which restricted the number of measurements made with either fluorometer or infrared
    gas analyzer (IRGA) devices on later dates starting 27 May (day 11). A fluorometer
    (MultispeQ; PhotosynQ Inc., East Lansing, MI, USA) was used to measure aspects
    of photosynthetic quenching based on leaf chlorophyll fluorescence on 16, 18,
    19, 20, 23, 25, 31 May 2022 and 2, 6, 8, 10, 13 Jun 2022 on two fully expanded
    leaves per tree. Inadvertently, on 31 May, only a single leaf per tree was measured
    by the fluorometer. Similarly, a CO2/H2O differential (CIRAS-3; PP Systems, Amesbury,
    MA, USA) was used to measure leaf gas exchange on 17, 18, 20, 23, 25, 31 May and
    2, 6, 8, 10, 13 Jun also on two fully expanded leaves per tree. Measurements were
    acquired at solar noon (∼11:30 AM–1:30 PM) to ensure stable environmental conditions
    (mean air temperature, 29.6 ± 2.9 °C; intensity of photosynthetically active radiation,
    471 ± 338 μmol⋅s–1⋅m–2). Note that incoming radiation was partially reduced by
    a conventional greenhouse shading agent (manufacturer unknown) during the period
    of study. A Scholander pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Santa
    Barbara, CA, USA) was used to observe predawn leaf water potential on 16, 18,
    21, 23, 25, 27, 31 May and 2, 6, 8, 10, 13 Jun 2022 on a single leaf from each
    tree. Leaves were bagged with plastic bags (Whirl-Pak; Filtration Group, Oak Brook,
    IL, USA) directly before petiole excision at the branch, after which the bag was
    transferred to the Scholander pressure chamber for pressurization using 99% N2
    gas. Statistical analysis. All analyses were completed using the R programing
    language (R ver. 4.1.1; Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
    with support of the tidyverse package [tidyverse ver. 1.3.2 (Wickham et al. 2019)]
    and associated dependencies. Tree diameters were assessed via one-way analysis
    of variance (ANOVA) by cultivar to determine potential differences in vigor at
    the beginning of the study. Scholander pressure chamber measurements were limited
    by the presence of viable leaves for assessment beginning on 2 Jun 2022. When
    fluorometer and IRGA measurements were available for two leaves, parameter means
    were determined and used thereafter. A subset of fluorescence-based parameters:
    nonphotochemical quenching (NPQt), quantum yield of photosystem II (φ2), relative
    fluorescence during or after illumination (Fm’), initial fluorescence during or
    after illumination (Fo’), maximum quantum efficiency, proton conductivity (gH+),
    leaf temperature, leaf temperature differential, photosystem I active centers,
    photosystem I open centers, photosystem I over-reduced centers, photosystem I
    oxidized centers, and soil plant analysis development relative chlorophyll content
    (SPAD), and gas exchange parameters—gs, sub-stomatal CO2 concentration (Ci), leaf
    temperature, A, E, and WUE—were selected for analysis. It was of interest to identify
    physiological responses that were correlated with the soil matric potential. Therefore,
    Pearson’s correlation matrices were generated between plant physiological measures
    and the soil matric potential using the Hmisc [Hmisc ver. 4.8-0 (Harrell Frank
    and Charles 2021)] and corrplot [corrplot ver. 0.92 (Wei et al. 2021)] packages.
    To coalesce data sets, soil matric potential data were filtered for observations
    within time intervals of physiological measurements using the lubridate package
    [lubridate ver. 1.9.2 (Spinu et al. 2023)]. The mean soil matric potential occurring
    within the time interval of physiological measurements was determined for each
    pot and used thereafter. Before generation of the correlation matrix, data were
    screened for outliers using the Hampel Filter method, in which observations above
    or below three median absolute deviations were omitted from the Pearson’s correlation.
    All tests were considered significant at a P < 0.05, excluding additional exploratory
    regression analysis conducted when qualified by Pearson correlation coefficients
    > |0.2| between the soil matric potential and photosynthesis-related measures
    derived from chlorophyll fluorometer and IRGA devices. The photosynthesis-related
    physiological parameters are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Photosynthesis-related
    parameters considered in fluorometer and infrared gas analyzer monitoring equipment.
    View Table To determine the effects of scion cultivar and water deficit extremity
    (i.e., treatment), the lme4 and lmerTest packages [lme4 ver. 1.1-31 and lmerTest
    ver. 3.1-3 (Bates et al. 2015; Kuznetsova et al. 2017)] were used to develop linear
    mixed-effects models by dependent variable, and days after water deficit imposition
    using fixed effects of cultivar, the soil matric potential setting, and their
    interaction, whereas block was considered a random effect. The Satterthwaite method
    was used for denominator df and all ANOVAs considered significance at P < 0.05.
    Because the intention was to provide an overview of relationships between plant
    physiological parameters and the soil matric potential, ANOVA output is presented
    whereas summary statistics and post-hoc mean separation have been provided as
    Supplemental Tables 1–5 for additional consideration. Results One-way ANOVA indicated,
    before the start of the study, no significant difference (P = 0.275) in scion
    diameter by cultivar. Scion diameters ranged from 6.7 to 9.6 mm, with a mean of
    8.4 mm. At the onset of water deficit imposition, the fully autonomous Open_Irr
    irrigation system was observed to induce irrigation events corresponding to predetermined
    soil matric potential thresholds, which continued until study completion (Bierer
    2023) (Fig. 1). View Full Size Fig. 1. Daily means and one standard deviation
    of the mean soil matric potential as observed during the period of study. Four
    matric potential points (–25, –40, –60, and –80 kPa) were used as irrigation thresholds
    (i.e., trigger points) for a singular irrigation event in the Open_Irr automation
    firmware. Citation: HortScience 59, 4; 10.21273/HORTSCI17520-23 Download Figure
    Core functionality of the platform to trigger irrigation events was deemed successful;
    however, mean deviation from the matric potential targets after the first drying
    curve was common and exacerbated at the –60- and –80-kPa targets as a result of
    rewetting events and the logarithmic nature of soil water retention. In consequence,
    results presented hereafter may be focused within the context of time-matched
    observations. Pearson’s correlation matrices between the soil matric potential
    and plant physiological parameters suggested no significant correlations; nevertheless,
    correlation coefficients ranged from –0.16 to 0.43 under gas exchange parameters
    Ci and A, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). Four gas exchange parameters had correlation
    coefficients with a soil matric potential > |0.2|, prompting additional exploratory

    a significant effect of treatment on predawn leaf water potential beginning 2
    d after water deficit imposition, which largely persisted throughout the study
    (Table 2). There was not substantial evidence to suggest a significant effect
    of cultivar on predawn leaf water potential outside of irregular occurrence on
    days 23 and 25 of deficit imposition. We suggest these two observations originated
    from a shortage of suitable leaves for measurement as a result of defoliation
    during later stages of deficit imposition. Table 2. Type III analysis of variance

    by scion cultivar outside of days 14 and 16 of deficit, when the WUE of ‘Autumn
    Gala’ declined, respectively, by a factor of 0.52 and 0.64 under –80 kPa relative
    to ‘CrimsonCrisp’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ cultivars. ‘CrimsonCrisp’ observed an
    increase in A of 4.9 μmol CO2⋅m–2⋅s–1 over ‘Autumn Gala’ and ‘Golden Delicious’
    cultivars at –80 kPa when pooling days after deficit imposition. ‘Autumn Gala’
    was observed to be the least-efficient assimilator under the driest conditions
    at –80 kPa, yet outperformed ‘CrimsonCrisp’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ at –60 and
    –40 kPa. Transpiration rates at –80 kPa followed suit; ‘Autumn Gala’ E was less
    than that of ‘CrimsonCrisp’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ by a factor of 0.59. Predictably,
    pooled gs at –80 kPa was less for ‘Autumn Gala’ (53.9 mmol CO2⋅mol–1 H2O) than
    ‘CrimsonCrisp’ (122.5 mmol CO2⋅mol–1 H2O) or ‘Golden Delicious’ (95.3 mmol CO2⋅mol–1
    H2O). A significant cultivar-by-treatment interaction was indicated on 8 of 10
    d for IRGA-measured leaf temperature observations. On a macroscale, leaf temperature
    shadowed weekly temperature patterns as minor incremental changes occurred within
    the greenhouse. The first to third quartile range of observed temperature was
    32.7 to 34.9 °C during the period of deficit imposition. Infrared gas analyzer–measured
    leaf temperature was 0.65 °C less on average for ‘CrimsonCrisp’ trees relative
    to ‘Autumn Gala’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ cultivars during the period of deficit
    imposition. A significant interaction effect for IRGA-measured leaf temperature
    on individual days likely originates from the variance in cultivar E rates. Analysis
    of variance conducted on chlorophyll fluorescence parameter measures generally
    suggest the effects of cultivar and/or treatment were intermittent (Table 4).

    On day 0, mean NPQt of ‘CrimsonCrisp’ (0.262) was significantly less than that
    of ‘Autumn Gala’ (0.462). When pooling all observations, ‘Autumn Gala’ held a
    +19% differential in NPQt over ‘CrimsonCrisp’ and ‘Golden Delicious’. Only by
    day 7 was NPQt observed to increase clearly, according to deficit extremity, spanning
    from 0.583 at –25 kPa to 1.56 at –80 kPa. From days 8 to 10, watering events triggered
    in the –60- and –80-kPa treatments rewetted planting containers, which presumably
    led to declines in NPQt on day 15 relative to day 7 (Fig. 1). From 21 to 28 d
    after deficit imposition, NPQt resumed the trend of increasing with edaphic drought
    stress level. Nevertheless, this did not manifest in the Pearson’s correlation
    matrix (Fig. 2). Day 0 φ2 measurements suggested minor differences between ‘Autumn
    Gala’ (0.594) ‘CrimsonCrisp’ (0.626), and ‘Golden Delicious’ (0.599), which did
    not persist for the remainder of the study (Table 4). On day 7, a significant
    effect of treatment was suggested, as the mean φ2 value at –25 kPa (0.505) was
    greater than the φ2 value at –80 kPa (0.410). Albeit at a lesser differential,
    similar differences produced the significant treatment effect noted on days 9
    and 21 (Table 4). Relative fluorescence yield was largely unresponsive to cultivar
    and water deficit extremity. On day 7, a significant treatment effect was observed,
    as mean Fm’ value at –25 kPa (4544) was significantly greater than Fm’ at –80
    kPa (3270). Similarly, on day 23, the mean Fm’ value at –25 kPa (5099) was significantly
    different from the mean Fm’ value at –60 kPa (4497). For the related parameter
    Fo’, there was no evidence of a significant cultivar-by-treatment interaction.
    On days 2, 3, 17, and 23, a significant effect of cultivar was suggested; Fo’
    tended to be greatest for ‘Autumn Gala’. Pooling all days, mean Fo’ was, respectively,
    1066, 998, and 1002 for ‘Autumn Gala’, ‘Crimson Crisp’, and ‘Golden Delicious’.
    A significant treatment effect on Fo’ was indicated on days 17 and 23. Model-estimated
    marginal means suggested Fo’ was significantly greater at –60 kPa relative to
    all other treatments. There was no evidence of an effect of cultivar on gH+, despite
    a cultivar-by-treatment interaction suggested on days 2 and 3, when gH+ of ‘CrimsonCrisp’
    was greater than either ‘Autumn Gala’ or ‘CrimsonCrisp’ at –25 kPa. Proton conductivity
    was responsive to treatment on days 2 through 7, 21, and 25; after pooling all
    days, mean gH+ at –25 kPa (157) was numerically greater than at –40 kPa (142)
    and –60 or –80 kPa (both equal to 128). Unlike the IRGA apparatus, leaf temperature
    recorded by the fluorometer did not suggest differences by cultivar; however,
    a significant effect of water deficit (i.e., treatment) was still suggested on
    days 2 through 9, 23, and 25. Temperature means in the –25-, –40-, –60-, and –80-kPa
    treatments pooled across all days were, respectively, 25.6, 25.9, 26.3, and 26.6
    °C. The largest numerical difference between treatments occurred on day 7, when
    the mean leaf temperature at –25 kPa (23.4 °C) was considerably less than that
    at –80 kPa (25.6 °C). The leaf temperature differential was less responsive to
    either cultivar or treatment. The presence of a significant effect of treatment
    was indicated only on day 4 of deficit imposition, when the delta from ambient
    values for the –25-, –40-, –60-, and –80-kPa treatments were –4.0, –3.7, –2.3,
    and –1.9 °C, respectively. Chlorophyl fluorescence parameters describing aspects
    of reaction centers within photosystem I complexes were not equivalently responsive
    to effects of cultivar or treatment. Photosystem I active centers were most responsive
    whereas open centers, over-reduced centers, and oxidized centers suggested a less
    frequent occurrence of any effect, despite happening concurrently on days 3, 4,
    17, and 21. The photosystem I active center parameter responded to both cultivar
    and treatment. Pooling scion cultivars at –25 kPa resulted in a positive linear
    relationship of photosystem I active center measures with time, with a slope of
    0.025. Conversely, at –40 kPa, photosystem I active centers were stable, but declined
    across time at –60 and –80 kPa. Pooling days in the –25-kPa treatment, mean photosystem
    I active centers were, respectively, 2.55, 3.45, and 2.80 for ‘Autumn Gala’, ‘CrimsonCrisp’,
    and ‘Golden Delicious’. This variance by cultivar did not persist at –60 or –80
    kPa. At –60 kPa, the pooled mean photosystem I active centers were 2.63, 2.42,
    and 2.82 for ‘Autumn Gala’, ‘CrimsonCrisp’, and ‘Golden Delicious’, respectively.
    Relative chlorophyll content was able to differentiate between scion cultivars
    on 7 of 12 d of measure, including day 0 before imposition of water deficit. Mean
    SPAD of ‘Autumn Gala’, ‘CrimsonCrisp’, and ‘Golden Delicious’ cultivars on day
    0 was, respectively, 53.7, 61.2, and 57.3, which declined to 46.4, 52.6, and 49.8
    by day 7 of water deficit imposition (i.e., the primary drying curve). A significant
    treatment effect was indicated on days 2, 17, 21, 25, and 28; however, the Pearson’s
    correlation matrix did not identify separately a practical relationship between
    SPAD and the soil matric potential (Fig. 2). Upon exhumation of rooting systems,
    ANOVA suggested no difference in rooting depth among scion cultivar or soil matric
    potential targets, as 40 of 60 trees had rooted to the maximum depth permitted
    by the pots (30.0 cm), whereas the remainder had rooted to depths ≥ 28.0 cm. Consider,
    though, that rooting systems developed before the onset of the study after planting
    occurred on 3 Feb 2022, and the available pot volume was limited to 3150 cm3.
    Discussion Irrigation events were occurring regularly at the –25- and –40-kPa
    thresholds 2 d after the onset of the trial; however, events were not triggered
    until 23 and 24 May at –60 and –80 kPa, respectively (Fig. 1). Substantive desiccation
    of tree foliage had occurred by this time in the –60- and –80-kPa treatments,
    suggesting that the related reduction in plant water requirements thereafter,
    at least in part, contributed to the soil matric potential dynamics observed.
    In effect, the wet–dry-like cyclic nature of the soil matric potential encountered
    during these treatments is expected to be a function of the irrigation parameters
    in Open_Irr, along with the plant water demands during drying and the recovery
    wetting curves. Elsewhere, –80 kPa has been used as a threshold for irrigation
    events to refill the soil profile in field-planted apple (Bhusal et al. 2019;
    Jiang and He 2021; Osroosh et al. 2016), with reporting varying from minor or
    moderate underirrigation to satisfactory. These preceding studies were implemented
    in field-grown apple trees where access to greater soil depth, and therefore volume,
    in addition to unlimited rooting systems may be less detrimental to tree health.
    Our study supplements existing literature specifically by examining potted apple
    trees using a soil matric potential–driven irrigation practice. Pearson’s correlation
    matrix of fluorometer measures failed to identify relationships between physiological
    photosynthesis measures and the soil matric potential (Fig. 2). As subsequent
    ANOVAs suggested, select parameters (NPQt, φ2, Fo’, gH+) responded to deficit
    treatments primarily during the first and last week of the study. It may be that
    drying cycle dynamics, at least in part, obfuscated the nature of this relationship.
    For example, Fo’ was greater on average in the –60-kPa treatment on days 17 and
    21 relative to all other treatments. Likewise, the soil water content was numerically
    greater in the –60-kPa treatment relative to the –80-kPa treatment, which manifested
    from a combination of a lag period between the Open_Irr system triggering brief,
    6-s irrigation events and substantive refill of the container pore space to reach
    the soil matric potential sensors; and a sharp decline in plant water demand in
    the –80-kPa treatment after desiccation and defoliation (Fig. 1). This pattern
    also presented itself with gH+ (Fig. 2); elsewhere, gH+ in wheat (Triticum aestivum)
    was unresponsive only during moderate drought conditions (Zivcak et al. 2014).
    Differences in chlorophyll florescence-based NPQt and φ2 of scion cultivars on
    day 0 indicate the inherent (genetic) differences related to the photosynthetic
    apparatus, which may contribute to varied stomatal control among the cultivars
    and therefore differences in gas exchange readings, including A, E, gs, during
    the first week of water deficit imposition. Nevertheless, plant water status,
    as indicated by the leaf water potential of scion cultivars, was not significantly
    different on any data collection day at any soil moisture level. It is of interest
    that the leaf water potential of ‘Autumn Gala’ was numerically greater (less negative)
    than that of ‘CrimsonCrisp’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ on day 2 of the –60- and –80-kPa
    treatments, respectively, with no readings less than –1.5 MPa. During both treatment
    conditions, the leaf water potential of all varieties decreased drastically to
    severe levels (<–3.0 MPa) on day 5. It is therefore possible that the difference
    by cultivar in plant water status took place between the two sampling days and
    may not have been captured by our study. Gas exchange rate measures A and E suggest
    different survival strategies among the cultivars studied. Carbon assimilation
    of ‘Autumn Gala’ in the –80-kPa treatment was observed to decline from day 0 (9.93
    μmol CO2⋅m–2⋅s–1) to day 8 (5.86 μmol CO2⋅m–2⋅s–1), whereas both ‘CrimsonCrisp’
    and ‘Golden Delicious’ maintained A while increasing E by an average of 47% over
    the same period. This downregulation of photochemistry is known to be an important
    defense mechanism against the onset of water deficit conditions (Chaves et al.
    2002). A similar observation to our study was made previously in a comparison
    of ‘Fuji’ and ‘Gala’ apples. Upon withholding water completely for 4 d, it was
    reported that ‘Gala’ decreased A rates by nearly 90%, whereas during the same
    period ‘Fuji’ declined by only 47% (Tworkoski et al. 2016). Thus, it appears that
    ‘Gala’ has a greater proclivity for stomatal regulation as a defense mechanism
    against water deficit. Likewise, perhaps ‘CrimsonCrisp’ and ‘Golden Delicious’
    exhibit nonstomatal factors that contribute to decreased A under water stress,
    as explained by Wang et al. (2018). The most extreme drought treatment of this
    study (the soil matric potential at –80 kPa) resulted in leaf water potential
    values less than –1.5 MPa, the threshold value for reportedly significant drought
    stress in apple (Tworkoski et al. 2016), within 7 d for the three apple cultivars
    tested. Trees in this treatment also experienced desiccation progressing to defoliation
    during the primary drying curve after the onset of the trial (Fig. 1). Measurement
    of the leaf water potential therefore became limited, progressing to impossible,
    in some replicates staring at day 11 for ‘CrimsonCrisp’ and ‘Golden Delicious’,
    and at day 15 for ‘Autumn Gala’, even though photosynthesis-related data were
    still recorded with the remaining leaves throughout the experiment in all trees.
    Notably, irrigation events prompted by the Open_Irr system in response to a soil
    water deficit subsequently promoted the growth of new flushes in defoliating trees
    (Fig. 1). Thus, the physiological data collected in trees at –80 kPa on later
    days may either still demonstrate drought-triggered responses (as in ‘Autumn Gala’,
    which had relatively moderate leaf abscission) or may reflect a postdrought recovery
    process (as in ‘CrimsonCrisp’, with new foliage after all five individual-tree
    replicates lost viable leaves for water potential quantification on day 17). This
    possibility could support, in part, the greater gs and A in actively growing leaves
    of ‘CrimsonCrisp’ than that of stress-induced senescing leaves of ‘Autumn Gala’
    at –80 kPa when pooling days after deficit imposition. The inference is consistent
    with the increase in both gs and A from the drought stress period to rehydration
    (recovery) in potted ‘Gamhong’ apple on ‘M.9’ rootstock (Bhusal et al. 2023).
    Our results demonstrate that the soil matric potential, when < –30.6 kPa, explained
    29% of the variation in the leaf water potential in apple trees. This critical
    point of soil water content corresponded to the leaf water potential of –0.73
    MPa, within the range of water status for nonstressed plants [i.e., < –1.5 MPa
    for apple (Tworkoski et al. 2016)], suggesting the applicability of this model
    in predicting plant water status, to a certain extent, before significant water
    deficit stress. The critical point corresponding to a leaf water potential of
    –0.73 MPa as a potentially useful management threshold is comparable to a similar
    report of –0.55 MPa in mandarin (Citrus reticulata) trees (Maotani and Machida
    1980). It is interesting, though, that the threshold indicated by our study pertains
    to the soil matric potential and is within the range of field capacities (–10
    to –33 kPa) for various soil textures. One possible explanation is the transition
    from plant use of gravimetric to capillary water stores for maintenance of turgor.
    Regardless of rationale, we hesitate to recommend the –30.6-kPa soil matric potential
    threshold for use as a singular indicator for irrigation needs because, conceptually,
    this corresponds with a known adequate water supply for the majority of soils.
    Several “extreme” observations of predawn leaf water potential occurred concomitantly
    with a soil matric potential ≥ –25 kPa. We suggest this is an artifact of the
    timing and nature of the automated watering system and/or a recovery period after
    an irrigation event. Irrigation water could have followed preferential flow paths
    in the drying soil (e.g., voids surrounding sensor wires or roots), rapidly reaching
    the Watermark® sensors before sufficient rewetting of the surrounding soil matrix.
    In addition, a day-scale delay between the cessation of drought stress and hydraulic
    recovery has been reported in field-planted ‘Gamhong’ apple (Bhusal et al. 2023),
    which could also explain the several counterintuitive observation points. Conversely,
    potted apple trees have been reported to respond rapidly to rewetting with attempts
    to maintain the water potential at target levels (Tang and Lovatt 2022). Regardless,
    we recommend future endeavors using automated watering equipment to implement
    stresses more gradually at the onset of study and to fine-tune irrigation events
    to avoid obfuscating responses upon water additions, because they are not as useful
    for developing management thresholds. For instance, predawn leaf water potential
    and photosynthesis readings obtained after day 15 in the –60-kPa and –80-kPa treatments
    used primarily newly produced leaves following rewetting after respective thresholds
    were crossed. To this end, future experimental design should focus on mild to
    moderate drought treatments by considering soil substrate and media-specific water
    relations, which, in a commercial setting, may also be more common than extreme
    or abrupt drought, as fruit growers typically strive to avoid detrimental effects
    on yield or quality, as when practicing deficit irrigation for size or bitter
    pit control (Reid and Kalcsits 2020). Anecdotally, it was confirmed that derivation
    of a soil-specific soil water retention curve improved implementation of edaphic
    stress during subsequent investigations during Summer 2023 (Bierer, unpublished
    data). Therefore, we emphasize the utility of generating a water retention curve
    before the use of the Open_Irr system, especially for academic purposes. The exploratory
    regression analysis conducted on IRGA gas exchange parameters (A, E, gs, and WUE)
    produced a generally poor fit with the soil matric potential (all r2 < 0.25),
    yet offered curious data shapes, similar to the piecewise regression encountered
    with the leaf water potential. Although much data obtained in our study could
    not be used statistically in the same way, we believe the possibility itself warrants
    further exploration. For example, similar correlation and regression approaches
    have been applied to measurements of maximum daily trunk shrinkage on stem water
    potential and xylem sap flow in the pursuit of identifying apple irrigation thresholds
    (De Swaef et al. 2009). If consistent linkages between cost-effective scalable
    metrics and plant physiological function can be identified, they stand to improve
    developing decision support platforms. Conclusion A new, autonomous sensor-based
    irrigation platform was used to impose four levels of drought stress in greenhouse
    containerized ‘Budagovsky 9’ rootstocks grafted with three apple cultivars in
    effort to identify valuable associations between the soil matric potential and
    plant physiological indicators of drought stress. All scion cultivars encountered
    substantive desiccation and defoliation at –60 and –80 kPa beginning 7 to 10 d
    after the imposition of deficit. We recommend using media-specific soil–water
    relationships in future research endeavors using autonomous sensor-based irrigation
    platforms to avoid premature decline of tree function. Analysis of variance suggested
    scion cultivar and deficit extremity significantly influence A and E rates, gs,
    and NPQt significantly. Pearson’s correlation matrices indicated all physiological
    parameters had an r vale ≤ |0.43|. Nevertheless, supplemental nonlinear regression
    suggested potentially useful data shapes that, if refined, may prove valuable
    for irrigation decision support systems. The soil matric potential considered
    with predawn leaf water potential converged on a piecewise regression identifying
    a critical point of –30.6 kPa, below which the slope of leaf water potential is
    increased when subjected to additional decreases in the soil matric potential.
    Therefore, additional efforts to describe the relationship between arduous measurements
    of physiological function with scalable and autonomous monitoring technologies
    appears beneficial and is advised. References Cited Bates D, Mächler M, Bolker

  description: The Upper Floridan aquifer underlying the Suwannee River Basin in Florida
    has experienced increased groundwater pumping and nitrate leaching over the last
    half century resulting in violation of water quantity and quality standards, largely
    due to row crop production. Increasingly carrot is being added as a winter cash
    crop to the traditional corn-peanut rotation in the region which may further increase
    pumping and nitrogen leaching. Establishing carrot nitrogen and irrigation best
    management practices is therefore critical to help growers meet yield goals while
    minimizing groundwater quantity and quality impacts. In this study, a carrot cultivation
    field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of a range of irrigation
    and nitrogen fertilizer practices on irrigation demand, nitrogen uptake and carrot
    crop growth and yield. Results showed that soil moisture sensor-based irrigation
    reduced the amount of water used for carrot cultivation by approximately 30% over
    the calendar-based irrigation without statistically significant reductions in
    yield, and fertilization rates above 224 kg ha−1 showed no statistically significant
    increase in yield. A field-scale SWAT carrot model was calibrated using the field
    experiment data and validated using previously published experimental results.
    The carrot parameters were then incorporated into a watershed-scale SWAT model
    of the Santa Fe River Basin, a tributary of the Suwannee River, and used to assess
    groundwater recharge and nitrate leaching impacts of adding carrot into corn-peanut
    rotations across all row crop lands in the watershed. Modeling results showed
    that adding carrot cultivation to the rotation will increase irrigation by 32–43%
    and decrease net groundwater recharge from row crop land by 9–28%. Moreover, it
    will increase nitrate leaching from row crop land by 60–100%. These results indicate
    that adding carrot cultivation to the conventional corn-peanut rotation will make
    water quantity and quality standards in the region more difficult to achieve.

    Global groundwater demand has increased significantly over the last century due
    to increasing human population and associated agricultural and industrial development
    (Scanlon et al., 2023). In the United States (US), groundwater withdrawals increased
    from 128,700,000 m3 day−1 to more than 310,400,000 m3 day−1 between 1950 and 2015,
    an increase of approximately 140% (Dieter et al., 2018). This rapid increase in
    abstraction has caused groundwater decline and depletion in many US aquifers,
    including the Ogallalla, Atlantic Coastal Plain, West-Central Florida, and Gulf
    Coastal Plain aquifers, among others (Bartolino and Cunningham, 2003, Bierkens
    and Wada, 2019, Konikow, 2013, Konikow and Kendy, 2005, Scanlon et al., 2012).
    Negative societal effects of groundwater depletion include reduced or eliminated
    well yields, reduced groundwater flows to surface water bodies, irreversible land
    subsidence, damage to aquatic ecosystems, and desiccation of wetlands (Alley et
    al., 1999, Bartolino and Cunningham, 2003, Harrington et al., 2007, Konikow, 2015).
    Contemporaneous with groundwater depletion, aquifer contamination from human activities
    such as urbanization, industrial activity, and intensive agriculture production
    further threatens groundwater sustainability. Along with other land uses, agricultural
    systems are a major source of nutrients leaching to groundwater (Burkart and Stoner,
    2002; Fowler et al., 2013; Lemaire and Gastal, 1997; Pratt, 1984). For example,
    it was estimated that more than 70% of nitrogen delivered to the Gulf of Mexico
    originates from agriculture (Alexander et al., 2008), and approximately 96% of
    groundwater nitrate in the Tulare Lake Basin and Salinas Valley originates from
    crop lands (Viers et al., 2012). Nitrate entering surface water bodies can cause
    eutrophication that may lead to mass morality of fish and algae blooms (Cameron
    et al., 2013). Furthermore, nitrate can easily leach into groundwater due to its
    high solubility in water, and this can cause critical health issues such as methemoglobinemia
    where the groundwater is the major source of drinking water (National Birth Defects
    Prevention Study, 2013, Bryan et al., 2012, Fewtrell, 2004, Ward et al., 2010).
    The Floridan aquifer (FA) underlying the southeastern US is one of the most productive
    aquifers in the world (Miller, 1990). The Upper Floridan aquifer (UFA) provides
    drinking water for nearly 10 million people and supports an agricultural economy
    valued at $7.5 billion (Martin, 2017). Total groundwater withdrawals from the
    FA increased by more than 5 times between 1950 and 2015 (Marella, 2020). Increased
    groundwater withdrawals in Florida have caused reduced flows or water levels in
    many groundwater-fed aquatic ecosystems, requiring the implementation of recovery
    plans under the state-mandated Minimum Flows and Levels (MFL) program (FS 373.042/FAC
    62–40.473; Munson et al., 2005). At the same time, pollutant loads to the aquifer
    from human activities have increased nutrient concentrations both in the FA and
    in the freshwater springs it feeds. As a result, in some springs nitrate (NO3)
    concentrations have increased by as much as 250% in the past few decades (The
    Howard T. Odum Florida Springs Institute, 2017). Twenty-four out of 30 Outstanding
    Florida Springs fed by the FA do not meet the Florida Department of Environmental
    Regulation (FDEP) Numeric Nutrient Criteria (NNC) of 0.35 mg NO3-N L−1 set for
    Florida springs (FDEP, 2018a). Increasing aquifer withdrawals and nutrient contamination
    are linked with agricultural production in northern Florida, which is economically
    vital to the region and state. In 2014, agricultural sales from Florida counties
    within the Suwannee River Basin (SRB; Fig. 1) totaled over $1.1 billion. In Suwannee
    County alone, agriculture was responsible for supporting 45% of all employment
    and producing $350 million in farm receipts (BEA, 2014). Agricultural land uses
    in the Florida portion of the SRB consist mostly of row crops (typically corn
    and peanut in rotation; Marella et al., 2016), with smaller areas of fruit crops,
    field crops, plant nurseries, and sod farms. Approximately 18% of these crop lands
    are irrigated (almost exclusively via groundwater), representing a 100% increase
    over the last 20 years. The percentage of irrigated crop land is expected to increase
    by an additional 40% by 2040 (FDACS, 2019). Agricultural production systems have
    been identified as the primary source of nitrogen loading to the FA in the region
    (FDEP, 2018a, FDEP, 2018b). It is estimated that meeting the mandated NNC will
    require a load reduction of nearly 2 million kg N year−1, largely from agricultural
    lands (Division of Environmental Assessment and Restoration, 2018b). Download

    High fertilization treatments, respectively (bottom). Increasing water and fertilizer
    use to support agricultural production makes it more difficult to meet regulations
    intended to protect groundwater and surface water quantity and quality (i.e.,
    MFL and NNC regulations). Nevertheless, with recent drought and expanded groundwater
    regulations in the western United States, and the availability of new processing
    infrastructure in Florida, carrot production is gaining popularity as a winter
    cash crop among row crop producers in north Florida (Treadwell, 2017, Hochmuth
    et al., 2021, Rusnak, 2021). The region’s deep, sandy soils and moderate winter
    temperatures are well suited to carrot production, and many producers already
    have center pivot irrigation systems that can be used to irrigate carrots incorporated
    into a corn-peanut rotation. The conventional corn-peanut rotation, which is the
    most common row crop rotation in the SRB, consists of planting corn in March and
    harvesting it in August one year, followed by planting peanut in May and harvesting
    it in September of the next year, sometimes with a cover crop between the two
    (Rath et al., 2021). Increasingly, farmers are adding carrot cultivation between
    corn and peanut, planting in November and harvesting in April (Hochmuth et al.,
    2021). While the addition of this winter cash crop benefits farmers’ revenue,
    it has the potential to increase groundwater pumping and nitrogen leaching to
    the FA. Establishing carrot best management practices (BMPs) with respect to nitrogen
    and irrigation management is therefore critical for helping growers meet yield
    goals while minimizing the water quantity and quality impacts of adding an additional
    crop to the traditional corn-peanut rotation. Establishing carrot BMPs for the
    region requires new field research and modeling efforts to quantify the impacts
    of water and nutrient management practices on carrot yields, irrigation requirements,
    net recharge and nitrate leaching to the UFA. In this study a BMP experiment was
    conducted at the North Florida Research and Education Center-Suwannee Valley (NFREC-SV)
    to evaluate the effects of range of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer practices
    on carrot irrigation requirements, crop growth, nitrogen uptake, and yield. In
    turn, these observations were used to calibrate carrot growth parameters for a
    field-scale Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, which was used to estimate
    crop yields and water and nutrient budgets for experimental irrigation and nitrogen
    management practices. After calibration and validation of the field-scale carrot
    model, a previously calibrated watershed-scale SWAT model (Rath, 2021) was used
    to estimate nitrate leaching and groundwater recharge impacts of incorporating
    carrot into the traditional corn-peanut rotation across all row crop lands in
    the Santa Fe River Basin, a spring-fed tributary of the Suwannee River. The study
    had two primary objectives: quantify the impacts of alternative water and nutrient
    practices on carrot yield, nitrate leaching and groundwater recharge using field
    experiments and a field-scale SWAT model and; assess the regional nitrate load
    and groundwater recharge impacts of adding a winter carrot crop to the corn-peanut
    rotation throughout all row crop lands in the Santa Fe River basin using a watershed-scale
    SWAT model. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Field experiment The carrot BMP field
    experiment was conducted at the North Florida Research and Education Center –
    Suwannee Valley (NFREC), located near Live Oak, Florida (30˚18′22″ N, 82˚54′00″
    W). Carrot was planted in November 2018 and harvested in May 2019, between a corn
    crop cultivated from March to August 2018 and a peanut crop cultivated from May
    through September 2019. Whole-plot treatments were four carrot irrigation scheduling
    methods and subplots were six carrot fertilization rates, each with four replicates
    (one in each of four blocks). The experiment used a randomized complete block
    design with split, 1.5-ha plots (Fig. 1). Each plot was 12 m long and 6 m wide
    with 6 m lanes separating the plots and 12 m lanes separating the blocks. For
    this study, we focused on a subset of seven treatments with the most available
    field data: two irrigation scheduling methods, each with three fertilization rates,
    and one non-irrigated (rainfed) control treatment, described in detail below.
    2.1.1. Irrigation Irrigation was applied by a Valley linear end feed 8000 (Valley,
    NE) with two spans, a variable rate controller, and ten banks of sprinklers controlled
    by separate solenoids. Irrigation was supplied by a dedicated well installed into
    the UFA. The three irrigation treatments included in this study were Calendar,
    Soil Moisture Sensor (SMS), and Rainfed. The calendar-based irrigation treatment
    represented regional grower irrigation practices and was scheduled by the NFREC
    farm manager. The general strategy was to add 0.75 cm every three days, in the
    absence of precipitation, from day of planting until the plants were established
    and no longer in danger of being injured by blowing sand. From 90 days after planting
    (DAP) to maturity, 1.25 cm of irrigation was applied every three days in the absence
    of precipitation over 0.65 cm. In the Soil Moisture Sensor (SMS) based irrigation
    treatment, soil water was monitored with 26 Sentek, TriScan “drill&drop” soil
    moisture sensors (Stepney South, Australia). These instruments contain nine capacitance-type
    sensors spaced 5 cm apart down to 1 m, each of which integrates soil moisture,
    volumetric ion content (a proxy for EC), and soil temperature over 10 cm (5 cm
    above and below the sensor). Irrigation was applied at a maximum allowable depletion
    (MAD) of 50% of plant available water (PAW) for the duration of the growing season.
    Sensors were monitored via a web portal daily. When the 25th percentile of the
    aggregated sensor readings in the SMS treatment was below the MAD, 10 mm of water
    was applied to all plots in that treatment. The rainfed treatment was a non-irrigated
    control treatment and irrigation was only applied as necessary to establish the
    plants and incorporate any applied fertilizers into the soil. 2.1.2. Fertilization
    Three nitrogen fertilization treatments were selected to bracket the University

    fertilizer was applied in nine separate applications starting at 30 DAP, with
    subsequent applications approximately every two weeks. A preplant application
    of 0–15–0 (P2O5) was applied prior to forming beds. Fertilizer application dates,
    amounts, and types are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Fertilizer application

    practices A previous corn crop was harvested on 8/23/18 and fields were disced
    twice with a Landoll harrow, once on 8/29/18 then again on 9/26/18 to prepare
    for bottom plowing the following day. Telone II was applied on 10/3/18 at a rate
    of 131 liters/ha. Treflan herbicide and Diazinon insecticide were applied and
    incorporated on 11/5/18. A John Deere leveling disc was used the following day
    to smooth the field and prepare for forming beds. All preplant fertilizers were
    incorporated into the plots with a KMC rototiller on 11/8/18. After rototilling,
    1-m wide beds were formed in an East-West direction with a spacing of 1.8 m. This
    spacing was required due to equipment limitations on the research farm, however
    the amount of fertilizer and seed placed on the bed-top was calculated based on
    a standard bed spacing of 1.3 m. On 11/19/18, a Seed Spider (sponge type 1) high-density
    planter outfitted with two metering units with four lines per unit was used to
    plant Maverick variety carrots at a density of 12,350,000 seeds ha−1. The beds
    were then sprayed with Ridomil, Quadris, and Macho fungicides. Harvest occurred
    on 4/30/19. A 12-m length of the center plant bed was machine harvested with a
    Nobels 3.15 bed-lifter type harvester. Average carrot weight, diameter, and length
    was recorded from a sub-sample of 20 representative carrots from each bag. 2.1.4.
    Soil and Tissue Sampling The site is comprised of Hurricane, Chipley, and Blanton
    soils that all consist of more than 90% of sand (USDA, 2019), with clay contents
    of 2% or less. Field capacity, permanent wilting point, available water content
    and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the fields ranged from 1.8% − 15.1%, 0.1%− 8.7%,
    0.03 cm cm−1-0.13 cm cm−1, and 15 cm hr−1-51 cm hr−1, respectively (USDA, 2013).
    Soil moisture was measured with soil moisture sensors installed in blocks 2, 3,
    and 4 of each treatment. Soil moisture sensors collected soil moisture data at
    10-cm intervals up to 90 cm below the soil surface every 30 min. Daily soil moisture
    data was aggregated by summing soil moisture of the active root zone in the soil
    profile by each time step and averaging them daily. Soil nitrate samples were
    collected at 0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–60 cm, and 60–90 cm for each sampling location,
    stored in plastic sample bags, and placed on ice until they were transported to
    the lab. In the lab, soil samples were divided into two 100-g samples. The first
    was placed in the drying oven at 105 ℃ for 48 h then re-weighed to calculate gravimetric
    water content. The second was allowed to air dry for 48 h, sieved to 2 mm, bagged,
    and sent to the University of Florida/IFAS Analytic Research Laboratory (ARL)
    on the UF campus for Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) analysis. A potassium chloride
    extractant was used to recover ammonium and nitrate, quantified using colorimetry
    in accordance with EPA Method 351.2 (USA EPA, 1993). Tissue samples were collected
    in Medium N sub-plots within the Calendar, SMS and Rainfed irrigation treatments
    three times during the growing season and once just prior to harvest. The final
    sampling event was scheduled during the same week as harvest, when all plots were
    sampled. A row length of 1 m in one of the non-harvest rows was sampled and individual
    carrots were counted and separated from the above ground biomass. Samples were
    placed in a forced-air drying room for 48 h or until completely dry. As carrots
    matured it became necessary to cut them into smaller pieces and allow up to 72 h
    for drying. Carrot samples were then ground in a Wiley mill with a 1-mm mesh screen,
    placed in in plastic bags, and sent to the IFAS Forage Evaluation Support Laboratory
    where TKN content (reported as elemental N as a percentage of total dry matter),
    was measured using a modified version of the TKN method. Samples were digested
    using a modified, aluminum block digestion procedure as outlined by (Gallaher
    et al., 1975). A catalyst of 1.5 g of 9:1 K2SO4:CuSO4 was added to a 0.25 g sample.
    Digestion occurred for at least 4 h at 375 ℃ using 6 ml of H2SO4 and 2 ml of H2O2.
    Nitrogen content of the digestate was determined by semiautomated colorimetry
    (Hambleton, 1977). Statistical analysis of experimental yields across treatments
    was completed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test (Bland and Altman,
    1995) to evaluate potential interactions among irrigation treatments and fertilization
    treatments and post-hoc Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) method of
    multi-comparisons (Tukey, 1949) to evaluate differences among treatments. A confidence
    interval of 95% was utilized for all comparisons. 2.2. Field-scale Model The Soil
    and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) (Arnold et al., 1998) is a continuous, semi-distributed,
    physically based model which is widely used throughout the world to simulate surface
    and subsurface water, crop growth, and nutrients and sediment transport. SWAT
    has operations that can represent many water and nutrient management practices,
    so it is often used to evaluate the impacts of alternative agricultural practices
    on water, nutrients, and crop yield (Arabi et al., 2008, Karki et al., 2020, Khalid
    et al., 2016). In SWAT, a watershed is delineated into sub-basins based on a Digital
    Elevation Model (DEM), and each sub-basin is delineated into a number of Hydrologic
    Response Units (HRUs), which are unique combinations of soil, slope, and land
    use (Arnold et al., 2012, Neitsch et al., 2011). Overall hydrologic and nutrients
    balances are simulated for each HRU, and thus each HRU can be used to simulate
    the effects of alternative crop, water and nutrient management practices on groundwater
    recharge, evapotranspiration, nitrate leaching and crop yield at the field scale
    (Arnold et al., 2012, Gassman et al., 2007, Gitau et al., 2004). The plant growth
    algorithm in SWAT uses a simplified version of Environmental Impact Policy Climate
    (EPIC) plant growth model (Williams et al., 1984). Phenological plant development
    is based on daily accumulated heat units, and plant growth can be hindered by
    water, temperature, nitrogen, or phosphorus stresses. Once the accumulated heat
    unit reaches potential heat unit of the plant, the plant attains maturity and
    stops growing (Neitsch et al., 2011). In this study, a field-scale SWAT model
    was built to calibrate the crop growth parameters for carrot using observed carrot
    biomass over time, nitrogen content in biomass over time, and final yield from
    the field experiment. The field-scale model was set up with seven HRUs, one for
    each treatment. Management information such as planting and harvest dates, fertilizer
    application and irrigation schedules used in the experiment was directly used
    to set up the SWAT model. The irrigation source for the model was set to an unlimited
    source outside of the simulation domain since the irrigation source for the experiment
    was the UFA located approximately 3 m below the land surface, with no interaction
    between root zone and the aquifer (Hunn and Slack, 1983). Daily weather data (precipitation,
    maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average wind speed, and solar radiation)
    were acquired from the Florida Automated Weather Network (FAWN) Live Oak station,
    which is located at the experimental site. Soil characteristics such as soil bulk
    density, soil texture and organic carbon content were taken from measurements
    made by Zamora-Re et al. (2018) for a corn-peanut BMP field experiment previously
    conducted at the same site from 2015 to 2017. Rath et al. (2021) developed a field-scale
    corn-peanut rotation SWAT model using the data from the Zamora-Re et al. (2018)
    experiment. The soil parameters calibrated by Rath et al. (2021) were adopted
    for the field-scale carrot SWAT model developed in this study since the Zamora-Re
    et al. (2020) field experiment was conducted at the same site where the carrot
    experiment reported in this study was performed. The calibrated soil parameters
    were further evaluated by comparing predicted soil moisture and soil nitrate concentrations
    to the experimental data obtained in the carrot experiment. Critically, two bugs
    were identified in SWAT2012 ver. 664 when simulating the carrot experiment and
    long-term scenarios. First, in SWAT, accumulated heat units are reinitialized
    on the first day of a year even for cool season crops that are planted before
    and harvested after this date. This reinitialization affected carrot growth substantially
    and resulted in inaccurate nitrate leaching and yield estimates. The second bug
    identified was that root vegetables, which typically have a HVSTI (harvest index
    for optimal growing conditions) parameter greater than 1.0, can result in a large
    amount of residue after harvest, which can cause unrealistically high mineralization
    (i.e., the amount of residue can be greater than final biomass). This bug can
    result not only in high nitrate leaching but also in higher biomass and yield
    of peanut in the following season. We thus modified the SWAT2012 rev. 664 source
    code to address these issues (code modification included in Appendix A). Calibration
    of carrot plant parameters was conducted with the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting
    (SUFI-2) algorithm (Abbaspour et al., 2004) in the SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty
    Procedures (SWAT-CUP) software (Abbaspour, 2011) using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency
    (NSE) as the objective function. Calibrated carrot parameters were then validated
    using carrot yields from a previous experiment conducted at the same location,
    which compared carrot yields under eight fertilizer rates ranging from 56 to 448 kg N
    ha−1. (Hochmuth et al., 2021). The model was also validated using soil moisture
    and soil nitrate data from the field experiment. Three statistical indices were
    used to assess model results in the context of variability and uncertainty in
    observed values: the modified Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSEM; Harmel et al.,
    2010; Harmel and Smith, 2007), modified Root Mean Squared Error (RMSEM), and percent
    bias (PBIAS). Statistical analysis was conducted using FITEVAL (Ritter and Muñoz-Carpena,
    2013), and evaluation criteria suggested by Moriasi et al., 1995, Moriasi et al.,
    2007 were used to describe model performance. 2.3. Watershed-scale Model Rath
    (2021) developed a watershed-scale SWAT model for the Sante Fe River Basin, a
    tributary of the SRB, and used the model to assess the impacts of land use and
    land management practices on streamflow and stream nitrate in the Santa Fe River.
    Rath (2021) used the USGS National Elevation Dataset DEM, USDA Soil Survey Geographic
    Database (SSURGO) soils data, National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA NASS)
    2017 Cropland Data Layer land cover data, North American Land Data Assimilation
    System (NLDAS) weather data, and crop and forest growth parameters from previous
    experimental and modeling research studies to develop the model. The model was
    calibrated and validated using available streamflow and stream nitrate measurements
    in the Santa Fe River, as well as USGS SEEBop actual evapotranspiration estimates
    from remote sensing measurements (Senay et al., 2013). In this study, this previously
    calibrated Santa Fe River Basin SWAT model was used to assess nitrate leaching
    and groundwater recharge impacts of incorporating carrot into the traditional
    corn-peanut rotation on all row crop land in the watershed (Fig. 1). Three corn-peanut
    and corn-carrot-peanut rotation Management Systems (MSs) were developed to span
    the range of current cultivation practices in the region (Table 2). MSs were co-developed
    in consultation with agricultural stakeholders and Extension professionals through
    a participatory modeling process (Bartels and Furman, 2023). Fixed planting dates,
    harvest dates and fertilizer application dates were adopted through all 39 years
    of simulation period for ease of simulation. Ammonium nitrate fertilizers were
    applied using a split application method, and the amount of fertilizer per application
    and application dates used in the Zamora-Re et al. (2018) corn-peanut field experiment
    and the carrot field experiment reported here were adopted for the long-term simulations.

    in MS 1 and MS 2 was simulated using the auto-irrigation operation in SWAT based
    on plant water demand. Based on the SMS-based irrigation treatments in the field
    experiment, the threshold plant demand used to trigger carrot irrigation was estimated
    to be 0.60, and irrigation volumes of 10 mm per application were used. Based on
    Rath et al. (2021), a threshold plant demand of 0.65 was used for both corn and
    peanut, and irrigation volumes per application were 12.70 mm for corn and 10.16 mm
    for peanut. Calendar-based irrigation schedule rules for corn, carrot and peanut
    were developed in consultation with University of Florida Extension Specialists.
    The Santa Fe River Basin SWAT model was used to simulate corn-peanut and corn-carrot-peanut
    rotations on all 2017 mapped row-crop land uses, using weather data from 1980
    to 2018. A three-year warmup period from 1977 to 1979 was utilized incorporating
    weather data from the SWAT weather generator (Neitsch et al., 2011). Each of the
    three management systems was simulated for each rotation and crop yields, nitrate
    leaching, and net recharge to groundwater (percolation minus irrigation water
    pumped) were compared. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey’s HSD test and a confidence
    interval of 95% was utilized for all comparisons. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Field Experiment Results Cumulative precipitation during the 2018–2019 carrot
    cultivation period was 522.0 mm, and the depth of irrigation water applied was
    248.9 mm, 170.2 mm, and 58.4 mm in the calendar, SMS, and rainfed treatments,
    respectively (Fig. 2). There was no interaction effect between irrigation treatments
    and fertilization treatments according to the results of the Bonferroni post hoc
    test. Therefore in Fig. 3 irrigation treatments were lumped, including all fertilization
    levels within each irrigation treatment, and fertilizer treatments were lumped,
    including calendar- and SMS-based irrigation treatments within each fertilization
    level (the rainfed treatment was excluded since it only incorporated the Medium-N
    treatment). There was no significant difference in harvested yield dry weight
    (hereafter referred to as “yield”) between the Calendar and SMS treatments based
    on Tukey’s HSD test (Fig. 3a). SMS-based irrigation scheduling thus used 32% less
    water than calendar scheduling with no statistical difference in final yield.
    The Low-N treatment had significantly lower average yields (6488 kg ha−1) than
    the Medium- and High-N treatments (8348 and 8359 kg ha−1, respectively, Fig. 3b)
    which were found to be statistically similar. Average yields by N fertilization
    treatment showed less than 5% difference compared to the empirical equation for
    carrot yield response to N application developed in Hochmuth et al. (2021). Download

    Fig. 3. Measured carrot dry biomass yield by treatments (left: measured carrot
    yield by irrigation treatments, right: measured carrot yield by fertilizer treatments;
    different letters indicate significant differences; numbers under the letters
    represent average yield). These results indicate that the lowest experimental
    nitrogen fertilization rate (112 kg N ha−1) was not sufficient to produce optimal
    carrot yield at the study site, but that application of nitrogen fertilizer beyond
    the medium fertilization rate (224 kg N ha−1) did not lead to a statistically
    significant increase in yield under the conditions tested. These results are consistent
    with carrot experiments previously conducted in the region, which reported total
    nitrate uptake of 213.6 kg N ha−1 (Hamilton and Bernier, 1975) and optimal N fertilizer
    application rate of 206 kg N ha−1 (Hochmuth et al., 2021). It should be noted
    that optimal N fertilizer application rates vary depending on soil mineral N content,
    soil characteristics, and the occurrence of large rainfall events that may leach
    N from the soil. The study site described here is composed of sandy soil prone
    to nitrate leaching, thus N applications exceeding the potential N uptake over
    time may be lost to groundwater causing environmental harm (Zamora-Re et al.,
    2020, Gholamhoseini et al., 2013). 3.2. Field-scale model calibration and validation
    results 3.2.1. Calibration The most sensitive carrot crop growth parameters in
    SWAT were biomass-energy ratio (BIO_E), maximum potential leaf area index (BLAI),
    two parameters related to the optimal leaf area development curve (LAIMX2 and
    FRGRW2), and the base temperature for plant growth (T_BASE) (Table 3). Nitrogen
    uptake (calculated as the product of sample weight and tissue nitrogen content)
    and biomass were both predicted well, with NSEM> 0.95 in all treatments (Table
    4, Fig. 4). While the model slightly underpredicts the final observed mean biomass
    and nitrate uptake in the calendar-based irrigation treatment, and slightly overpredicts
    final observed mean biomass in the rainfed treatment, simulated values fell within
    the range of observed data. Using calibrated crop parameters, the model predicted
    carrot yield with R2 = 0.80, RMSEM = 597.0 kg ha−1, and PBIAS = −1% across treatments
    (Fig. 5), indicating good performance, although as with total biomass, yields
    for the rainfed treatment were slightly overpredicted. Table 3. Calibrated carrot

    by treatments (box plots: observed yield; alphabets: Tukey’s HSD test results
    of observed carrot yields). Like the field experiment, the model predicted substantially
    lower yields for the Low-N treatment than the Medium- or High-N treatments, which
    were very similar, and comparable yields between the calendar and SMS irrigation
    treatments. Based on the yield data illustrated in Fig. 5, it is apparent that
    carrot yield for the calendar-based irrigation – High-N treatment exhibited slightly
    (but not statistically significantly) higher yield compared to the SMS-based irrigation
    – High-N treatment, and higher yield than reported by other researchers conducting
    similar N rate experiments for carrots in the region (Hochmuth et al., 2021, Westerveld
    et al., 2006). This unexpected result could be the result of local-scale variation
    in soil characteristics across the experimental field that led to the calendar-based
    irrigation High-N treatment producing higher yields in some experimental plots
    but was not reproduced by the best-fit calibrated SWAT carrot parameters which
    assumed the same soil across the experimental field. Also, as six out of seven
    treatments were irrigated treatments, the calibration may have insufficiently
    accounted for water stress, leading to an overprediction of biomass in the rainfed
    treatment. 3.2.2. Validation To validate the calibrated carrot parameters, the
    calibrated model was used to simulate yields from the Hochmuth et al. (2021) field
    experiment (Fig. 6). The NSEM, RMSEM and PBIAS values for the two-year average
    yield predictions were 0.99, 44.63 and − 4.3%, respectively, indicating good model
    performance. Of note, neither the field experiment nor simulations showed a significant
    increase in yield at fertilizer application rates above 168 kg N ha−1. Download

    Carrot yield (dry weight) from Hochmuth et al. (2021) experiment (box plots: observed
    yield; letters: Tukey’s HSD test results of observed carrot yields). Next, the
    calibrated model was compared to soil moisture and soil nitrogen concentration
    data from the field experiment presented here. Simulated soil moisture time series
    showed the same overall temporal trends as observed values, however, model performance
    varied widely by treatment (Table 5, Fig. B.1 Supplemental Material). The Calendar-Low,
    Calendar-High, and Rainfed-Medium treatments simulations all showed large, negative
    bias during the early portion of the season (Fig. B.1 Supplemental Material),
    however the remaining treatments (Calendar-Medium and all SMS treatments) had
    daily NSEM values ranging from 0.42 (acceptable) to 0.87 (very good). Similar
    to results shown by Rath et al. (2021) for a corn-peanut rotation at the same
    site, SWAT was unable to capture large peaks in soil moisture (e.g., March 2019),
    likely due to limitations of the simplified infiltration simulation processes
    in SWAT (Rajib et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). Table 5.

    were good, with NSEM ranging from 0.08 to 0.96 (Table 5), however the model underpredicted
    soil nitrate for the low-N treatment during the mid- to late-season (Fig. B.2
    Supplemental Material). The rainfed treatment showed higher simulated soil nitrate
    concentration than other irrigated treatments in the latter part of the carrot
    growing period, presumably due to less percolation leading to less nitrate leaching
    during the cropping season. 3.3. Watershed-scale Scenarios 3.3.1. Yield Differences
    in simulated carrot yields among management systems were small (∼6%), but statistically
    significant (Table 6, Fig. B.3 Supplemental Material), with highest yields for
    MS 3 (calendar irrigation, 336 kg N ha−1), followed by MS 2 (SMS irrigation, 280 kg N
    ha−1), and MS 1 (SMS irrigation, 247 kg N ha−1). This result differs from the
    carrot field experiment, which found no significant yield difference between treatments
    that used 224 and 336 kg N ha−1. However, it should be noted that watershed-scale
    simulation results represent the means of 19 carrot seasons across 1066 row crop
    HRUs, yielding more than 20,000 replicates, substantially more than the 4 experimental
    replicates in the field study. As such, it is likely that the large number of
    replicates in the watershed-scale simulation caused small differences in carrot
    yield across management systems to be statistically significant using Tukey’s
    HSD test. To further explore this finding, Tukey’s HSD test for differences in
    yield among MS was conducted individually for each HRU in the watershed, using
    each of the 19 carrot rotations as replicates. From this analysis, 986 HRUs (92.5%)
    showed no statistical difference in carrot yield among MS, while 80 HRUs (7.5%)
    showed small but significant differences. Table 6. Simulated average dry weight

    system Corn yields showed no significant differences between rotations (Table
    6). However, as with carrot, there were small (∼6%) but statistically significant
    corn yield differences between management systems, with the yield highest for
    MS 3 and lowest for MS 1. This result differs from the Zamora-Re et al. (2020)
    field experiment and the Rath et al. (2021) long-term simulation of that field
    experiment, which found no significant differences in corn yield across management
    systems over the range of N application rates and irrigation management practices
    analyzed here. Again, the statistical differences found in our watershed-scale
    simulations are likely mainly due to the large number of replicates and more variation
    in soil type. Peanut yields showed very small (∼2%), but statistically significant
    differences between rotations. For the corn-peanut rotation, there were small
    but statistically significant peanut yield differences between all management
    systems, while peanut yields in the corn-carrot-peanut rotation were only found
    to be statistically significantly different (higher) for MS 3. 3.3.2. Irrigation,
    Net Recharge and Nitrate Leaching Among the three crops, corn required more irrigation
    than carrot or peanut (Table 7, Fig. B.4 Supplemental Material). Soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation (MS 1 and MS 2) used statistically significantly less
    irrigation water than the calendar-based method for all crops (40% less for corn
    and carrot and 60% less for peanut). Adding carrots increased the amount of irrigation
    applied by 32% for MS 1 and MS 2% and 43% for MS 3, compared to the conventional
    corn-peanut rotation. Table 7. The amount of water applied for irrigation by crops
    and management systems. Crops Irrigation (mm) MS 1 MS 2a MS 3 Corn 184.9b 186.3b

    significant differences at a p-value of 0.05; Statistical analysis was conducted
    within each crop group. MS: management system a Due to the difference in irrigation
    efficiency MS 2 irrigation is ∼1% higher than MS 1 Tukey’s HSD test results showed
    that net groundwater recharge was statistically significantly different between
    all management systems and cropping systems except corn-carrot-peanut MS 1 and
    MS2. For the corn-peanut rotation, net recharge was approximately 14% lower for
    MS 3 (calendar-based irrigation) compared to MS 1 (SMS-based irrigation), while
    for the corn-carrot-peanut rotation, this difference was about 33% (Table 8, Fig.
    B.5 Supplemental Material). Due to increased total irrigation pumping, net recharge
    was also significantly lower for corn-carrot-peanut rotation compared to the corn-peanut
    rotation (9%, 11%, and 28% lower for MS 1, MS 2, and MS 3, respectively). Excess
    irrigation applied on the sandy soils where crops are grown in the study region
    directly recharges the unconfined FA. Nevertheless, due to evaporation and irrigation
    system losses, MS 3 had lower groundwater net recharge relative to MS 1 or MS
    2. Table 8. Estimated annual groundwater net recharge and nitrate leaching by

    test results showed that nitrate leaching was statistically significantly different
    between all management systems and cropping systems (Table 8, Fig. B.5 Supplemental
    Material). For the corn-peanut rotation, annual nitrate leaching was about 156%
    higher for MS 3 which used higher fertilization rates and calendar irrigation
    compared to MS 1 which used lower fertilization rates and SMS irrigation. For
    the corn-carrot-peanut rotation annual nitrate leaching was about 103% higher
    for MS 3 compared to MS 1. Annual nitrate leaching from the corn-carrot-peanut
    rotation increased substantially compared to the corn-peanut rotation for all
    management systems (MS 1 100%, MS 2 70%, MS 3 58%). Although the corn-carrot-peanut
    rotation produces less net recharge and more nitrogen leaching than the corn-peanut
    within a particular management system, results show that the low input management
    system (MS 1) for corn-carrot-peanut produces more net recharge and less nitrate
    leaching than the high input management system (MS 3) for corn-peanut. This implies
    that if growers move from conventional practices to best management practices
    when adding carrots to their corn-peanut rotations, they have the potential to
    increase their incomes while also reducing environmental impacts. 4. Conclusions
    As carrot cultivation is gaining popularity in North Florida, assessing crop production
    and its environmental impacts on the UFA is important to stakeholders in the region.
    In this work the impacts of alternative water and nutrient practices on carrot
    yield, nitrate leaching, and groundwater recharge were quantified using field
    experiments, a field-scale SWAT model calibrated to the experimental data, and
    a watershed-scale SWAT model. The field experiment demonstrated that soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation reduced irrigation demand by 32% over conventional calendar-based
    irrigation with no significant difference in carrot yield. Moreover, it revealed
    that low N fertilization (112 kg N ha−1) resulted in significantly lower carrot
    yields, but there were no statistical differences between yields for medium (224 kg N
    ha−1) and high (336 kg N ha−1) fertilization rates. Long-term watershed-scale
    SWAT simulations across the Santa Fe River Basin overlying the UFA estimated that
    integrating winter carrot crops into the conventional corn-peanut rotation on
    all row crop land in the watershed would increase irrigation demand (32–43%),
    decrease net groundwater recharge (9–28%), and increase nitrate leaching (60–100%)
    across low-, medium- and high-input management systems. Thus, although beneficial
    to growers’ revenue, incorporating carrot into the corn-peanut rotation will make
    achieving environmental regulations in the region more difficult. Nevertheless,
    this study showed that if growers who have been using conventional management
    practices for corn-peanut cultivation adopt soil moisture sensor irrigation and
    reduced N fertilization when adding carrot to their rotation, they can increase
    their revenue while increasing net groundwater recharge and reducing nitrate leaching.
    Key findings of this study underscore the effectiveness of soil moisture sensors
    for reducing carrot irrigation, the validity of the UF/IFAS recommendation of
    224 kg N ha−1 for carrots grown in the region, and the economic-environmental
    trade-offs associated with adding carrots to the corn-peanut rotation in the SRB
    overlying the UFA in North Florida. These insights offer valuable guidance for
    crop growers and environmental regulators seeking to promote both a robust regional
    agricultural economy and environmental protection of the UFA. CRediT authorship

    Introduction Soil moisture content (SMC) serves as a critical metric for evaluating
    kiwifruit growth status, with respect to root development, nutrient and water
    uptake, particularly for managing field irrigation and forecasting fruit yield
    (Chen et al., 2022, Cheng et al., 2023). Given that approximately 90% of kiwifruit
    root systems are concentrated within the 0–60 cm soil layer (Zhu et al., 2023),
    accurate mapping of root zone SMC is essential for efficient irrigation water
    resource management and optimizing crop water productivity within a kiwifruit
    orchard (Cheng et al., 2023, Deng et al., 2023). The utilization of remote sensing
    (RS) technology has gained widespread acceptance for both qualitative and quantitative
    analysis of large-scale plant water and nutrient status in a non-destructive manner
    (Cheng et al., 2022, Jin et al., 2020, Muro et al., 2022). However, the current
    availability of free RS data, including MODIS series (Zhang et al., 2017), Landsat
    series, Sentinel-2 (Wang et al., 2020), etc., is limited by their coarse spatial
    resolution, which poses challenges for conducting precise field-scale research
    in agriculture. In response to these limitations, the use of unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) platform, equipped with multiple sensors, including RGB, thermal infared
    (TIR), and multispectral (MS), has attracted significant attention from agronomists
    due to their high temporal and spatial resolution, as well as their ability to
    capture multi-source images (Lu et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2023).
    Several research have successfully utilized UAV multi-sensor platforms for tasks
    such as crop leaf area index (LAI) (Zhang et al., 2022), biomass (Li et al., 2022),
    and chlorophyll content inversion (Wang et al., 2021),to nitrogen status (Fan
    et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2021), water status (Cheng et al., 2023), and yield
    estimation (Peng et al., 2019) under different field conditions (Maes and Steppe,
    2019). A variety of RS-based indices are calculated using data collected from
    satellites, UAVs, and in-site platforms equipped with multi-sensors, encompassing
    Vegetation Index (VI), Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) (Gerhards et al., 2019),
    Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) (Bian et al., 2023, Nie et al., 2020,
    Xu et al., 2022), and Three-Dimensional Drought Index (TDDI) (Cheng et al., 2023).
    Several VIs, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the Enhance
    Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), for SMC
    estimation are the mathematical combination of the reflectance of visible and
    NIR (Babaeian et al., 2021, Knadel et al., 2022). Additionally, CWSI and TVDI,
    which are derived from temperature information obtained from TIR sensors and the
    simple temperature-vegetation index space constructed from TIR and MS sensors,
    respectively, have been extensively employed as classical drought indicators (DI)
    for characterizing plant water status (Bian et al., 2023, Nie et al., 2020, Tao
    et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2022). Another index, TDDI, is proposed based on MS and
    TIR sensors integrated into UAVs with in-situ temperature to assess the crop water
    conditions of maize, yielding a certain level of accuracy (Cheng et al., 2023).
    These indices, derived from various sensor data, offer valuable insights into
    plant water status and serve as classical drought indicators for characterizing
    plant water status (Jiao et al., 2021, Song et al., 2019). Despite the extensive
    of research in this domain, there has been a predominant focus on the application
    of specific band combinations and temperature data in conventional field crops,
    neglecting research on the unique band combination of kiwifruit SMC (Deng et al.,
    2023, Krishnan and Indu, 2023, Yu et al., 2022). Consequently, conventional VI
    band combinations may not be suitable for accurately estimating SMC under variable
    conditions, especially at high vegetation coverage orchard (Soltanikazemi et al.,
    2022). Therefore, a more nuanced approach that incorporates relevant features
    from UAV-Ground multi-sensor data is likely to yield more precise predictions,
    better reflecting changes in root zone SMC (Zhang et al., 2022). By leveraging
    the optimal band combination method, the accuracy of monitoring kiwifruit SMC
    estimation in dynamic field environments can be significantly improved, providing
    crucial data support for real-time irrigation treatments in orchard fields. Recently,
    RS image analysis has been integrated with machine learning (ML) models, such
    as partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine regression
    (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). These features include, but are not
    limited to, chlorophyll content (Wang et al., 2023), nitrogen content (Chlingaryan
    et al., 2018), and canopy water stress (Katimbo et al., 2023). Ensemble learning
    (EL) algorithms, as a subset of ML techniques, have garnered attention for their
    ability to amalgamate multiple individual models to achieve superior predictive
    performance (Bentéjac et al., 2021). Compared to single models, EL models are
    capable of mitigating over-fitting, enhancing prediction accuracy, and bolstering
    robustness. Bagging models, such as RFR (Breiman, 2001), have gained prominence
    in RS inversion owing to their capacity to handle high-dimensional data and nonlinear
    relationships. Another widely utilized EL model is Boosting, which aims to sequentially
    train individual models to rectify the errors made by preceding models (Pappalardo
    et al., 2023, Soltanikazemi et al., 2022). In boosting, each model concentrates
    on the instances that were misclassified by previous models, thereby ameliorating
    the overall predictive performance. Boosting models, including gradient boosting
    (GBDT) (Friedman, 2001), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) (Chen and Guestrin,
    2016), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) (Ke et al., 2017), and Categorical
    Boosting (Catboost) (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018), have exhibited considerable
    success in the inversion of crop growth parameters (Tao et al., 2023, Yu et al.,
    2022). These models possess the capability to handle small training sets and capture
    intricate nonlinear relationships between input variables and the target variable
    (Chlingaryan et al., 2018). In summary, RFR, XGBoost, GBDT, LGBM, and Catboost
    have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the accuracy and robustness
    of SMC prediction. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance
    of multi-dimensional (n-D) index set, which calculated by UAV-based TIR and MS
    information with six in-situ temperature data (kiwifruit canopy temperature [Tc],
    soil temperature [Ts], air temperature [Ta], Ta-Tc, Ta-Ts, Tc-Ts), used to simulate
    the kiwifruit SMC at six different soil depths (0–10 cm [SMC10], 0–20 cm [SMC20],
    0–30 cm [SMC30], 0–40 cm [SMC40], 0–50 cm [SMC50], 0–60 cm [SMC60]) during fruit
    growth periods (May to Sep, 2022). This research aims to achieve the following
    main objectives: (1) to conduct correlation analysis of the n-D indicators (NDVI,
    EVI, CWSI, TVDI and TDDI) and SMC under the multi-sensor feature combination;
    (2) to compare the performance of the EL models (RFR, GBDT, XGBoost, LGBM, and
    Catboost) in estimating root zones SMC based on the optimal n-D indices; (3) to
    explore the accuracy of the planted-by-planted-grid mapping approach for estimating
    root zone SMC under different growth periods and various irrigation treatments
    in a high vegetation coverage orchard. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study site
    and setup Field experiments were carried out in a 9-year-old ''Xuxiang'' kiwifruit
    orchard situated in Xianyang, Shaanxi, China (34.241°N 108.164°E, Fig. 1). The
    orchard is located at an average elevation of 400 m within a warm temperate zone
    featuring a sub-humid climate. Considering the growth characteristics of the kiwifruit
    canopy in the experimental orchard, the growth periods were categorized into five
    distinct phases: the budding and leaf-developing period (Period I, from 1st April
    to 2nd May, 2022), the flowering and fruit setting period (Period II, from 3rd
    May to 22nd May, 2022), the rapid expansion period of the fruit (Period III, from
    23rd May to 6th Jul, 2022), the slow expansive period of the fruit (Period IV,

    22nd Aug to 25th Sep, 2022). Fig. 2 depicts the meteorological data and sampling
    dates across the kiwifruit growth periods. The average temperature (T_ave) recorded

    the analysis of soil texture, it has been ascertained that the soil in the study
    area exhibits medium loam characteristics within the 0–40 cm depth, transitioning
    to heavy loam below 40 cm. This soil type is characterized by high water retention
    and limited permeability. Within the 0–60 cm soil layer, the kiwifruit trees exhibited
    a soil bulk density of 1.65 ± 0.05 g/cm3 and a field water capacity (θfc) of 34.70 ± 0.15%
    (Zhu et al., 2023). The copious irrigation (CK) treatment was defined with an
    upper limit of 90–95% × θfc and a lower limit of 72–75% × θfc across Period I
    to IV (refer to Table 1 for specific details). The experiment implemented four
    distinct gradient irrigation treatments, corresponding to the CK treatment: 100%
    (full irrigation [100 S]: T1, T6, and T11), 85% (mild deficit [85 S]: T4, T7,
    and T9), 70% (moderate deficit [70 S]: T2, T5, and T12) and 55% (severe deficit
    [55 S]: T3, T8, and T10) across Period II to IV. Each treatment consisted of 18
    kiwifruit trees, and there were three replicate treatment plots for each treatment,
    resulting in a total of 12 treatment plots. Overall,the experiment involved a
    total of 234 trees with the same planting unit (2.0 ×4.0 m2), but with varying
    treatment plots (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, the CK irrigation amount applied during
    Period I-IV was 26.72 mm/hm2 (1 time), 32.61 mm/hm2 (1 time), 125.96 mm/hm2 (4
    times), and 100.73 mm/hm2 (4 times), respectively. No irrigation was conducted
    in Period V due to adequate precipitation in 2022 (see Fig. 2). Table 1. Scheme

    vehicle A DJI M600 pro UAV (DJI Technology Co., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) platform
    was used in this study, which equipped with a ten-channel Red-Edge MX dual camera
    (Mica Sense, Seattle, WA, USA) and a TIR-RGB integrated Zenmuse XT2 camera (DJI
    Technology Co., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) for UAV-based MS and TIR image acquisition
    (Fig. 3). As shown in Table 2, nine UAV campaigns were conducted in clear skies
    (between 11:30 and 14:00) during the kiwifruit growth period, with the flight
    height, speed and overlap were 25–30 m, 1.7–2.1 m/s, and 85–90%, respectively.
    As well as that, ground control points on the test site were measured using real-time
    kinematics (RTK) systems (Fig. 3). During the calibration of the UAV MS and TIR
    images, 10 targets were evaluated for their reflectance values (calibrated reflectance
    panel, Mica Sense, Seattle, WA, USA) and the temperature of white calibration
    cloth were measured during each flight (Fig. 3). Generally, we conducted follow-up
    studies based on UAV MS and TIR images after mosaic procedures, georeferencing,
    calibration, clip and resampling (all images are resampled to 4 cm resolution)
    by softwares ENVI5.3 (Esri Inc., Redlands, USA) and ArcGIS10.8 (ESRI, Redlands,
    USA). Download : Download high-res image (405KB) Download : Download full-size

    a total of 575 SMC data points were collected from 64 fixed-point monitoring locations,
    as indicated by the red boxes in Fig. 1. Similarly, Tc and Ts were derived from
    temperature sensors operating at half-hour intervals and positioned 10 cm below
    the canopy and at the surface soil within the center of the 12 treatment plots.
    These temperature data, including Ta, Tc, Ts, Ta-Tc, Ta-Ts and Tc-Ts, were utilized
    to calculate the TDDI, as outlined in Table 3. Given the distribution and water
    absorption patterns of kiwifruit roots within the 0–60 cm range, it is advisable
    to conduct root sampling at depths within this range. To facilitate this, three
    pre-buried tubes were strategically placed within a horizontal range of 60–90 cm
    around the sample tree. SMC data were then measured at each layer using a FDR-TRIME
    (IMKO micromodtechnik GmbH, Leeds, Germany) and the average of three samples was
    recorded (refer to Fig. 3). In order to optimize irrigation practices, six sets
    of SMC data were obtained at various root depths (from SMC10 to SMC60). This was
    achieved by calculating the mean value of the measured SMC within each layer corresponding
    to the depth intervals of the respective root zones. Table 3. Temperature dataset

    to mitigate the impact of intricate background factors, we conducted the extraction
    of kiwifruit canopy information and subsequently generated matrices of representative
    mean values. This process entailed using TIR and MS data collected from an UAV
    on 20th May, 2022, as illustrated in Fig. 4 for reference (Savian et al., 2020).
    The extraction of TIR and MS data from the pure kiwifruit canopy was achieved
    through the application of threshold segmentation and support vector machine (SVM)
    classification algorithms by ENVI 5.3 (Esri Inc., Redlands, USA). Additionally,
    the delineation of the the grid plot of the study region''s grid plot, planted
    on a per-plant basis, was performed using the ''Create Fishnet'' tool in ArcGIS
    10.8 (ESRI, Redlands, USA), with careful consideration given to a planting unit
    size of 2 × 4 m. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    Schematic of the overall workflow in this study. In (a) Step I, details of the
    sensitive 2-D (3-D) VIs calculation (the MS information extraction of kiwifruit
    canopy); in (b) Step II, details of TVDI and TDDI calculation; and then in (c)
    Step III, the EL inversion model building and the root zones SMC mapping of planting
    unit grid. Step 1. Collecting the 2-D and 3-D VIs calculation datasets: in order
    to improve the accuracy of SMC estimation, we have developed two new indices,
    namely NDVIi,j and EVIi,j,w, by leveraging the formulas of the widely-used NDVI
    and EVI. These indices were calculated using a UAV-based 10-band combination (for
    NDVIi,j: X (i) from B7 to B10 and Y (j) from B1 to B6; for EVIi,j,w: X (i) from
    B7 to B10, Y (j) from B3 to B6, and Z (w) from B1 to B4), incorporating in-sites
    SMC data and Pearson''s correlation analysis. Our objective in employing this
    approach is to enhance the precision and reliability of vegetation assessment.
    Through the 2-D (3-D) optimal band combination method, we selected optimal NDVI7,3
    and EVI10,3,1 and the original NDVI10,6 and EVI10,6,2 as the VIi dataset for subsequent
    drought index (DI) calculation. Step 2. Collecting the TVDI and TDDI calculation
    datasets: Using the VIi - CWSI feature space method, we conducted calculations
    to generate four TVDI input n-D index datasets as feature variables. Subsequently,
    employing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm in conjunction with Ti (Ta, Ts, Tc,
    Ta-Ts, Ta-Tc, Tc-Ts)-VIi-CWSI feature space, we calculated 24 TDDIs input n-D
    index datasets as feature variables. Step 3. Model construction & validation and
    SMC estimation mapping datasets: To validate the accuracy of the model, 70% of
    samples were used to train the model, and 30% of samples were used to validate
    the model. 1) Analyzing the inversion accuracy of five EL models (RFR, GBDT, XGBoost,
    LGBM, and CatBoost) after parameter optimization through ''GridSearch'' method
    with 10-fold cross-validation; 2) collecting the planted-by-planted-grid SMC inversion
    mapping datasets based on the optimal TDDI and EL model. 2.5. The n-D index datasets
    2.5.1. Vegetation index (VI) We analyzed the sensitive VIs of SMC, calculated
    by 10 bands from UAV MS data, including NDVIi,j and EVIi,j,w. Among all the SMC
    sensitive VIs at different depths (Fig. S1), we screened out NDVI7,3 and EVI10,3,1,
    as contrast with the original NDVI10,6 and EVI10,6,2 for subsequent studies. The
    formula of VIs band combination was calculated as following: (1) (2) where Ri
    , Rj and Rw are the reflectance of MS data (the detail of bands refer to Table
    2), respectively. 2.5.2. Crop water stress index (CWSI) The calculation of the
    CWSI involved the utilization of three key parameters, namely the actual surface
    temperature (Tsi) of each pixel, the highest surface temperature (Tsmax), and
    the lowest surface temperature (Tsmin) across all pixels within the field trial.These
    parameters were derived from the TIR image (refer to Fig. 4 C-D, using the image
    of 20th May as an illustrative example). To minimize the impact of outliers, the
    top 5% and bottom 5% of surface temperature values were excluded from the analysis.
    Consequently, Tsmax and Tsmin were determined based on the remaining 90% of pixels.
    Subsequently, the CWSI for the kiwifruit canopy was computed using the following
    formula: (3) where Tsi is the surface temperature of pixel i, and all temperature
    values are expressed in degrees Celsius ℃. 2.5.3. Temperature vegetation drought
    index (TVDI) The calculation of the TVDI in our study based on the simplified
    VIi-CWSI space (Fig. S2, using the image of 20th May as an example). There are
    two upper and lower boundaries on the VIi-CWSI parameter space, called the \"dry
    edge\" and \"wet edge\", and they are derived from a linear function that relates
    the maximum and minimum CWSI to the four VIs (optimal NDVI7,3 and EVI10,3,1 and
    the original NDVI10,6 and EVI10,6,2), respectively (in Section 2.5.1): (4) (5)
    where a1, a2 and b1, b2 are the fitting parameters. TVDI is calculated based on
    CWSIi_max and CWSIi_min, which are the maximum and minimum CWSI for a given VI
    respectively. Following is the formula for calculating TVDI: (6) Table S1 shows
    the results for fitting to dry edges and wet edges for the NDVI10,6-CWSI space
    of the TVDI in Fig. S2a. Then, a total four TVDIs have been calculated into n-D
    indexes, including NDVI10,6-CWSI, NDVI7,3-CWSI, EVI10,6,2-CWSI and EVI10,3,1-CWSI.
    As shown in Fig. S2b, TVDI for different treatment plots is plotted versus the
    NDVI10,6-CWSI space. 2.5.4. Three-dimension drought index (TDDI) TDDI was proposed
    by Cheng et al. (2023), as a new index established by Ta-NDVI-CWSI 3-D parameter
    space, with a good potential to assess crop water conditions of maize. For more
    details on the principles of TDDI construction, please refer to the study of Cheng
    et al. (2023). Kiwifruit canopy structure is complex and susceptible to the surrounding
    environment. In order to better explore the SMC estimation ability under different
    environment condition, our team tried to establish various TDDI based on Ti-VIi-CWSI
    space (Fig. S3a), by using six temperature factors (Ta, Tc, Ts, Ta-Tc, Ta-Ts and
    Tc-Ts, standardized), four VIs (optimal NDVI7,3 and EVI10,3,1 and original NDVI10,6
    and EVI10,6,2) and standardized CWSI. The detailed calculation procedure is performed
    as follows: 1) The temperature (Ti) data were calculated by: (7) (8) (9) (10)
    (11) where i_max, i, i_min are the maximum, average, minimum of each temperature
    factor during UAV flight time (11:30–14:00), respectively, and all temperatures
    are in ℃. 2) Using Ti-VIi-CWSI space, we can use the relation between Ti, VIi,
    and CWSI to fit the upper and lower limits of the SMC, respectively. All samples
    were used in this study for model training in 3-D parameter space, and TDDI was
    calculated using the RF, which has excellent nonlinear fitting capabilities. The
    TDDI were calculated by： (12) (13) (14) where fi_max and fi_min are the functions
    between CWSImax and CWSImin with VIi and Ti, i.e., fitting dry and wet curved
    surface in the Fig. S3b, respectively. Table S2 shows the performances of the
    fitting dry and wet surfaces for 24 sensitive TDDIs. In order to investigate the
    common impact the UAV-Ground multi-model sensors on kiwifruit SMC estimation,
    n-D indices datasets (detailed in Section 2.5), including 10 MS bands, CWSI, 6
    Ti (Ta,Tc,Ts,Ta-Tc,Ta-Ts,Tc-Ts), 4 VIs (NDVI10,6, EVI10,6,2, NDVI7,3, EVI10,3,1),
    4 TVDIs based on VIi-CWSI space, and 24 TDDIs based on Ti-VIi-CWSIspace, were
    constructed. Moreover, we evaluated the performance of the indexes by calculating
    the correlation coefficient (R) between the n-D index and the in-situ SMC measurements.
    According to the correlation coefficient, the following formula is used: (15)
    where Cov (Index, SMC) represents the n-D index and SMC covariance, and Var (Index)
    and Var (SMC) represent the n-D indices'' variances and SMCs'' in situ variance.
    2.6. Model construction The RFR, XGBoost, GBDT, LGBM, and Catboost algorithms
    were selected as suitable models for the inversion of SMC at different root depths,
    as well as their high performance in previous studies or applications (Bentéjac
    et al., 2021, Yu et al., 2022, Zhai et al., 2023). Understanding the strengths
    and limitations of each algorithm will help us to achieve accurate and reliable
    prediction of orchard water status in combination with different production requirements
    Fig. 6). To investigate the most resilient EL model for monitoring SMC, specifically
    for the entire kiwifruit growth period, we conducted a screening process to identify
    the optimal TDDI22 ((Tc-Ts)-EVI10,6,2-CWSI) and TDDI7 (Tc-NDVI7,3-CWSI), which
    was constructed using the Ti-VIi-CWSI 3-D space. Subsequently, we compared the
    accuracy of five EL estimation models (RFR, GBDT, XGBoost, LGBM, and Catboost)
    using all SMC data. Of the 575 SMC samples, 70% were randomly selected for training
    and construction of the models, while 30% were used to assess the generalization
    ability of the models. The model construction was implemented using the Python
    ''scikit-learn'' library (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html#citing-scikit-learn),
    and the optimal parameters of the five EL models were determined through ''GridSearchCV''
    method with 10-fold cross-validation. Download : Download high-res image (873KB)

    model for monitoring SMC. 2.7. Model performance evaluation To evaluate the performance
    of the EL model predictions, four statistical measures were used, namely the determination
    coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and
    global performance indicator (GPI). The evaluation index is calculated as follows:
    (16) (17) (18) (19) where , and are the measured values and predicted values of
    SMC, respectively; ̅ represents the average value of the measured values, n indicates
    the number of samples. CImedian represents the median of the corresponding parameter,
    while m denotes the number of statistical indicators; αj it is equal to − 1 for
    RMSE and MAE, and equal to 1 for R2. 3. Results 3.1. The analysis of the relationship
    between n-D indices and SMC As depicted in Fig. 7, a correlation heat map was
    employed to investigate the relationship between various n-D indices and SMC at
    six different depths of the kiwifruit root zone. This analysis encompassed the
    entire fruit growth period as well as four specific single fruit growth periods
    (Period II to V). During Period II, it was observed that, except for B1 (Blue),
    B7 (Red-edge705), Ts, Ta-Tc, Ta-Ts, and Tc-Ts, the remaining n-D indicators exhibited
    significant correlations with SMC. Notably, these correlations demonstrated a
    notable decrease with increasing soil depth. Moving on to Period III, it was found
    that only certain n-D indices, including B3-B10 (Green531 to NIR), Ta and Tc,
    VI2 (EVI10,6,2), VI4 (EVI10,3,1), were significantly correlated with SMC at each
    depth. Other indices such as CWSI, TVDI, and TDDI exhibited significant correlations
    with SMC10 and SMC20. Additionally, during Period IV, CWSI, Ta, Ts, TVDI, and
    TDDI displayed significant correlations with SMC, with the correlations showing
    a slight increase with soil depth, and SMC10 exhibiting the lowest correlation.
    During Period V, only CWSI, TVDI, and TDDI were significantly correlated with
    SMC, with the correlations decreasing notably with increasing soil depth, particularly
    with SMC40-SMC60. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    *** represents p < 0.001, respectively. From left to right, the blue solid boxes
    are the full fruit growing period data, and the blue virtual boxes are from Period
    II to Period V. Overall, it was observed that single MS-bands, Ta, Tc, EVI10,6,2,
    and EVI10,3,1 are more suitable for monitoring SMC in each soil layer during Period
    II and III, while CWSI, TVDI and TDDI are specifically suitable for SMC10-SMC30
    during Period IV and V. Furthermore, the optimal indices (p < 0.001) for the entire
    growth period, were identified using the RF method, including TDDI22 ((Tc-Ts)-EVI10,6,2-CWSI)
    and TDDI7 (Tc-NDVI7,3-CWSI), respectively. It is important to note that the correlation
    between the n-D indices and the SMC, as measured in the field, varies significantly
    based on the growth period of the kiwifruit and the depth of the soil layer. Therefore,
    the development of n-D indices datasets is essential for enhancing the accuracy
    of SMC inversion in kiwifruit orchards under varying field environmental conditions.
    3.2. The performance of EL models in estimating SMC In this section, we present
    the results of our study on the performance of EL models in estimating SMC in
    kiwifruit orchards. We first optimized the EL model parameters based on the optimal
    TDDI in Section 2.6. Our results indicate that the accuracy of each EL model varies
    significantly between soil layers, with the best score ranging between 0.937–0.979

    for estimating kiwifruit SMC10 to SMC60. We used the GPI as a comprehensive model
    evaluation index, where a higher value indicates better performance. Our results
    show that the Catboost models exhibit respectable accuracy levels in all SMC estimation
    of each soil layer, followed by RFR, LGBM, GBDT and XGBoost, with the average
    GPI values of 1.24, 1.00, 0.99, 0.96, and 0.81, respectively. Among all the Catboost
    models, the performance of the SMC model under different soil layer ranked as
    SMC40 to SMC60 > SMC10 > SMC30 > SWC20, with GPI value of 1.27, 1.23, 1.22, and
    1.17, respectively. Each EL model has a significant performance in SMC inversion
    of each layer (R2 > 0.70, MAE < 0.20%, RMSE < 0.15%), demonstrating its effectiveness
    in improving kiwifruit SMC estimation accuracy based on the TDDI7 and TDD22 indices.
    Moreover, the combination of Ti-VIi-CWSI space derived from UAV-Ground multi-model
    sensors and parameter-optimized EL model has great application potential in SMC

    of the SMC estimation mapping under different conditions In this section, we evaluate
    the robustness of the SMC inversion map under different field conditions. Fig.
    9 shows that SMC increases with soil depth, and SMC50 and SMC60 reach maximum
    values and then tend to be stable. However, there are significant differences
    in the treatment plots at T1 (100 S), T2 (70 S), T3 (55 S), T9 (85 S), and T10
    (55 S) in each period. According to field research, this plot is more likely to
    have more fruit trees suffering from kiwifruit decline syndrome, which in turn
    worsens the drought stress of water deficit (Savian et al., 2020). Additionally,
    the long-term and contagious nature of the decline syndrome causes its SMC to
    be greatly influenced by field conditions and fruit tree health. Download : Download

    field settings, we conducted a Pearson''s correlation analysis, incorporating
    a 1:1 line to illustrate the association between the true and predicted values
    of SMC at different depths. This analysis took into consideration different sampling
    periods (refer to Fig. 9) and distinct irrigation treatments (as indicated in
    Fig. 10). Our results indicate a strong correlation between the true and predicted
    values of SMC10 to SMC60 during each sampling period, with correlation coefficient
    (R) of 0.957 ± 0.026, 0.946 ± 0.056, 0.916 ± 0.098, 0.906 ± 0.127, 0.906 ± 0.108,
    and 0.919 ± 0.073 (p < 0.001), respectively. It is noteworthy that SMC inversion
    performed the worst (with R of 0.733 ± 0.126) during Period II with lower canopy
    cover (4th May, 2022), where the values of R for SMC10 to SMC60 are 0.930, 0.800,
    0.680, 0.580, 0.640, and 0.770, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate a significant
    correlation between the true and predicted SMC values under different water treatments
    (Fig. 11). The strength of correlation followed the order: 100 S > 55 S > 70 S
    > 85 S, with R of 0.973 ± 0.005, 0.970 ± 0.013, 0.965 ± 0.005, and 0.948 ± 0.021,
    respectively. The findings of this study suggest that the SMC inversion map derived
    from this research demonstrates strong robustness. Download : Download high-res

    information extraction for SMC estimation The utilization of UAV-based MS and
    TIR platforms has revolutionized the acquisition of detailed imagery of kiwifruit
    orchards. However, the intricate and dynamic canopy structure and underlying surface
    conditions of kiwifruit present challenges for conventional soil background removal
    methods based on canopy indexes. Previous research have underscored the efficacy
    of intelligent learning algorithms in extracting vegetation canopy and improving
    model accuracy (Meiyan et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2023). In this study, we leveraged
    the SVM algorithm and adaptive threshold segmentation algorithm to extract pure
    kiwifruit canopy MS and TIR images. Our investigation also revealed the substantial
    impact of the kiwifruit canopy sampling window size on model accuracy (Bai et
    al., 2021, Deng et al., 2023). To facilitate long-term monitoring of kiwifruit
    plant growth, we partitioned the kiwifruit area in the orchard into grids based
    on the size of each planting unit and standardized the extracted kiwifruit canopy
    information to minimize pixel discrepancies. The extraction of accurate kiwifruit
    canopy information from UAV imagery holds great potential for enhancing the estimation
    of SMC in the root zone of kiwifruit orchards. Furthermore, the detailed and standardized
    canopy information obtained from UAV imagery allows for a more comprehensive understanding
    of the spatial variability of SMC within the orchard, enabling targeted irrigation
    and management strategies to optimize kiwifruit growth and yield. 4.2. The performance
    of the n-D indices for SMC estimation The objective of this study is to establish
    a comprehensive n-D set of SMC sensitive indices using cost-effective UAV-Ground
    multi-sensor information, incorporating data pre-processing and optimal band combination
    screening methods. Sensitivity analysis revealed significant variations in the
    sensitivity of six depths of root zone SMC during the fruit growth period. Notably,
    the kiwifruit canopy displayed high vitality, high water transport demand, and
    low underlying surface complexity during Period II, influencing the correlation
    with SMC. Consequently, each index, except for Ts-based indices, exhibited the
    highest correlation with SMC40 in each period. Period III represents the peak
    period of kiwifruit water demand, but the vitality of the canopy is vulnerable
    to high-temperature weather, drought stress, and pest infection. Furthermore,
    strong mixed pixels in the canopy structure and the underlying surface of the
    orchard in this period impacted the accuracy of pure canopy information extraction.
    Therefore, except for Ta and Tc, TVDI and TDDI did not exhibit significant associations
    with SMC50 and SMC60. During Period IV, despite the field environment and canopy
    structure becoming more stable, long-term drought stress and pests lead to a low
    correlation between spectral indices and SMC. However, temperature-related indicators
    demonstrated a strong correlation with SMC20 to SMC60, except for SMC10. In Period
    V, CWSI, TVDI, and TDDI exhibited a strong correlation with SMC30, while only
    NDVI7,3 calculated by Red-edge705 and Green531 bands has a correlation with SMC.
    CWSI, TVDI, and TDDI displayed similar correlation, with vegetation humidity determined
    by Tc, canopy temperature-vegetation index, and field temperature-vegetation index-canopy
    surface temperature, respectively. TVDI effectively integrates vegetation index
    with CWSI, exhibiting a slight advantage over CWSI in performance. However, it
    still demonstrates relatively poor performance in time series analysis. TDDI,
    as proposed by Cheng et al. (2023), incorporates time series attributes through
    the Ta parameter, resulting in a vegetation drought index with time series characteristics.
    In this study, we further enhance TDDI by exploring the optimal feature combination
    of indicators, including MS-bands, six temperature parameters (Ta, Ts, Tc, Ta-Ts,
    Ta-Tc, and Tc-Ts), and CWSI, for kiwifruit root zones SMC inversion. Despite TDDI
    not providing more information compared to TVDI and CWSI, it shows promise in
    addressing orchards in diverse environmental conditions in future research and
    applications. Moreover, previous research has indicated that indicators such as
    ET0, SAVI, Soil Moisture Monitoring Index (SMMI), and canopy coverage exhibit
    superior performance in assessing plant water status (Das et al., 2021, Meiyan
    et al., 2022, Zhao et al., 2022). Therefore, it is recommended to include additional
    meteorological parameters and vegetation indices to provide data support for the
    comprehensive exploration of suitable orchard indicators under diverse environmental
    circumstances (Liu and Yang, 2023, Tao et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2022). Overall,
    the study highlights the potential of UAV-Ground multi-sensor data in estimating
    root zone SMC in kiwifruit orchards, providing valuable insights for future research
    and applications in agricultural water management. 4.3. The comparative analysis
    of classical ensemble learning models for SMC estimation The utilization of EL
    algorithms has garnered significant attention from agronomy experts in recent
    years (Teshome et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2022, Zhai et al., 2023). This heightened
    interest can be attributed to the remarkable advantages associated with EL algorithms,
    including high precision, fast calculation speed, and their applicability to small
    sample data (Bentéjac et al., 2021). In the context of this study, five classical
    EL models (RFR, GBDT, XGBoost, LGBM, Catboost) were selected, and their respective
    merits and drawbacks are elucidated in Fig. 6b. Among these models, the RFR algorithm
    emerges as the most fundamental and effective regression model, a conclusion supported
    by numerous research reports (Ning et al., 2023, Teshome et al., 2023, Wigmore
    et al., 2019). Moreover, we found that the Boosting models exhibited superior
    accuracy compared to Bagging (RFR) models in SMC estimation models, consistent
    with diverse studies such as SMC (Yu et al., 2022), yield (Chlingaryan et al.,
    2018, He et al., 2022, Maes and Steppe, 2019, Zhang et al., 2023), and drought
    conditions (Wang et al., 2023). This superiority can be attributed to the iterative
    nature of Boosting algorithms, which sequentially build multiple weak learners
    to correct the errors of previous models. This iterative process enables Boosting
    models to focus on instances that are misclassified or have high residuals, thereby
    improving the overall predictive performance. However, it is important to note
    that Boosting models may be more susceptible to overfitting and can be computationally
    intensive. Therefore, in the context of practical application in precision agriculture
    monitoring, it is essential to consider the appropriate combination of Boosting
    and Bagging models (such as stacking model) to leverage their respective strengths
    and mitigate their weaknesses. Additionally, researchers have observed substantial
    variations in the accuracy of different algorithms across various fields and time
    periods (Fan et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2017), which aligns
    with the findings of this comparative study. Hence, future investigations should
    consider distinct management modes, environmental conditions, meteorological parameters,
    and growth periods of orchards when selecting appropriate indexes and models that
    cater to specific requirements, while continuously adjusting parameters. 4.4.
    Outlook and future research In order to assess the influence of diverse field
    conditions, growth periods, irrigation treatments, and weather conditions on the
    water absorption capacity of kiwifruit roots at varying soil depths and the resultant
    alterations in SMC across kiwifruit cultivation regions, a systematic planted-by-planted
    grid mapping of SMC framework was conducted. The SMC10 to SMC60 mapping across
    different growth periods and irrigation treatments was employed as distinct datasets
    to appraise the reliability of the root zone SMC estimation model. Additionally,
    the optimization of n-D indices and the development of suitable EL model in this
    study present a cost-effective and efficient method for achieving high-resolution
    mapping of root zone SMC at the individual kiwifruit plant level. This technological
    advancement carries significant implications for improving irrigation management,
    augmenting kiwifruit yield, and enhancing water productivity. Further research
    is warranted to delve into the integration of other environmental variables and
    to devise real-time monitoring systems for kiwifruit cultivation. Moreover, the
    ten-band MS sensor and TIR sensor utilized in this study bear resemblance to the
    red-edge band specific to the Sentinel-2 satellite and the TIR band unique to
    Landsat-8. Furthermore, the meteorological and field temperature sensors employed
    are non-invasive, enabling continuous monitoring at a low cost. Consequently,
    future research can delve deeper into the experimental design of this study, integrating
    multi-source satellite fusion data, and through meticulous testing and refinement,
    aim to achieve the monitoring of SMC in the root zone of expansive orchards integrated
    with multi-source satellite and field sensor equipment. This integrated approach
    can furnish data support for precise management of farmland water status at the
    scale of irrigation areas. 5. Conclusion This study presents evidence of the significant
    potential of various n-D indices, such as kiwifruit canopy MS and TIR bands, NDVI10,6,
    NDVI7,3, EVI10,6,2, EVI10,3,1, CWSI, 4 TVDIs, and 24 TDDIs, for estimating kiwifruit
    root zone SMC during the fruit expansion period. Furthermore, TDDI, TVDI, and
    CWSI exhibited notably superior temporal characteristics compared to other n-D
    indices. Particularly, the Catboost models utilizing two optimal TDDIs (TDDI22:
    (Tc-Ts)-EVI10,6,2-CWSI and TDDI7: Tc-NDVI7,3-CWSI for SMC estimation demonstrated
    exceptional performance, with R2 and RMSE values were 0.966 ± 0.010 and 0.046 ± 0.003%,
    respectively. Additionally, the planted-by-planted mapping approach displayed
    strong performance in estimating root zone SMC during various fruit growth periods
    and under various irrigation treatments, as indicated by R value for SMC10 to
    SMC60 of 0.962 ± 0.024, 0.955 ± 0.049, 0.929 ± 0.083, 0.924 ± 0.108, 0.921 ± 0.092,
    and 0.929 ± 0.062, respectively. These findings offer valuable insights into the
    optimization of n-D indices and contribute to a deeper understanding of SMC estimation
    in kiwifruit orchards using multi-sensors and EL models. Nevertheless, it is important
    to acknowledge the existence of several limitations in this study. The per-plant
    grid SMC estimation mapping framework requires further refinement to be effectively
    utilized in precision irrigation management at the orchard scale. CRediT authorship

    consider distinct contexts. Federated learning support fog-based IoT systems to

    Intelligent edgeFederated learningFog computingInternet of ThingsUnsupervised
    learning 1. Introduction Fog computing can reduce the volume of data transferred
    to the cloud and decrease the IoT system response time [1,2] as it is physically
    located near the end devices, like sensors and actuators [3]. Besides these advantages,
    fog nodes are vulnerable to attacks and anomalous behaviors [4], which is not
    feasible to monitor manually [5], due to their massive numbers and distinct performance
    behaviors during execution. Cook et al. [6] ratify that detecting anomalies using
    supervised learning algorithms may cause adversities because the system cannot
    perceive new unknown behaviors on the fly. The heterogeneity of fog nodes considers
    the diversity of hardware resources, security policies, data analysis duration,
    and demands CPU and RAM usage [28]. Therefore, each fog node may have different
    expected performance behaviors. Let us consider, for example, two fog nodes with
    the same hardware configurations, where the expected behavior of the first one
    is receiving 200 packets per minute and 60 % CPU usage, but the second one expects
    1000 packets per minute and 20 % CPU usage. Therefore, each fog node can have
    distinct and unlabeled anomalous behaviors, which makes it appropriate to use
    unsupervised learning [14] to detect new behaviors. Knowing every fog behavior
    is essential because the expected behavior can vary according to context features.
    For example, in a smart hospital, a fog node can demand more or less hardware
    and network resources to store and analyze data because the data analysis frequency
    and duration depend on attributes like the number of patients, seasonality, and
    specific sickness endemic peaks. The same happens in a smart irrigation system,
    where some fog nodes use more or fewer computing resources to analyze the data
    according to sensor location, soil moisture, plant species, or annual seasons.
    This paper proposes the FL-Means system that uses unsupervised federated learning
    [7] to streamline the detection of fog node performance behavior (where one behavior
    is a single data cluster). FL-Means addresses the fog node''s veracity challenge
    (detection of expected and unexpected performance behaviors), preliminarily introduced
    by the TW-IoT framework [9]. However, TW-IoT focuses on general concepts without
    proposing or evaluating fog behavior veracity. Here, we consider that the same
    IoT system can have many fog nodes demanding different levels of computing resources
    (behaving differently). Our system can detect every fog node''s expected and anomalous
    performance behaviors, regardless of context variations. Also, it perceives these
    behaviors faster because it uses federated learning. Our system executes an unsupervised
    learning K-Means algorithm [8,31] in every fog node to recognize its performance
    behaviors individually. It also transmits these behaviors as local cluster centroids
    to the cloud side, and the cloud calculates global centroids, sending them to
    all fog nodes. Therefore, all fog nodes use global centroids to identify behaviors
    that occurred previously in other fog nodes and can make accurate predictions.
    Our system also preserves data privacy among fog nodes and the cloud because it
    only transmits data centroids [10], improving the IoT data trustworthiness [9].
    We assess FL-Means in three scenarios, using simulated sensors: (1) agility: evaluate
    FL-Means against a non-federated baseline approach, simulating several behaviors
    in two fog nodes, (2) scalability: explore the system scalability by varying the
    number of fog nodes sending local centroids to the cloud, and (3) heterogeneity:
    analyze the heterogeneity using different fog node hardware to verify the sample
    prediction time, the time to compute local centroids, and the time to receive
    the global centroids. In Scenario 1, we observe two situations where FL-Means
    predicts the fog node behaviors from 1710 to 8043 times faster than the baseline
    approach. Our approach also shows that FL-Means presents higher prediction accuracy
    for these cases but has similar accuracy to the baseline for other situations.
    In Scenario 2, we perceive that the number of behaviors and fog nodes affects
    the CPU usage and time to compute global centroids. When we test 100 local centroids
    for 12 cluster centers, the cloud calculates the global centroids in 1.02 ± 0.01
    s, and for 1000 fog nodes, this computation took less than seven seconds. Finally,
    in Scenario 3, we observe that even in the worst case, using Jetson Nano CPU computation,
    the fog node obtains the local centroids in 2.46 ± 0.02 s, it receives the global
    centroids in 3.18 ± 0.15 s (considering 100 fog nodes), and executes sample predictions
    in 46.77 ± 0.41 ms. We also have evidence that the FL-Means system may support
    the cloud in monitoring all fog node behaviors because the cloud receives the
    behaviors'' centroids from every fog node, decreasing IoT management costs. This
    paper unfolds the sections as follows: Section 2 details the background, Section
    3 covers the related work, Section 4 explains our unsupervised federated learning
    system, Section 5 reports the used methodology, Section 6 reveals our results,
    Section 7 presents the discussion, and finally Section 8 presents the conclusions
    and future work. 2. Background This section clarifies concepts about IoT Stages,
    clustering (unsupervised learning), and federated learning. 2.1. IoT stages This
    paper considers a fog-based IoT system unfolding four computing stages, three
    (thing, mist, and fog) at the edge and a fourth stage at the cloud side. The thing
    stage [11] perceives a context by sensors and executes the system''s decisions
    using actuators. The mist stage [12] can pre-process data before transmitting
    it to the fog stage [3], which can perform system decisions, and may reduce network
    traffic between the edge and the cloud. The cloud stage [13] has more computing
    power than fog and can analyze historical data to improve and make robust decisions.
    2.2. Clustering Unsupervised machine learning, also known as clustering, can cluster
    data samples without prior knowledge of any data category [14,35]. Clustering
    algorithms identify similarities between data samples to generate clusters through
    different strategies, like data density or distance between samples. Consequently,
    these algorithms use the data to create a data model that represents the found
    clusters. Some clustering algorithms only group data samples but do not predict
    which group a new data sample belongs. The algorithms K-Means, Mean-Shift, and
    BIRCH do not have this prediction limitation, also, it is well-known that K-Means
    compute predictions faster than Mean-Shift and BIRCH [14,31,36]. K-Means also
    is faster than other algorithms, according to the results in [36], which evaluated
    data reduction based on machine learning algorithms for fog computing in agriculture.
    The K-Means algorithm begins by randomly defining values for K clusters centroids.
    After that, K-Means iteratively calculates the arithmetic mean distance between
    the centroid and the cluster data points, assigning the computed mean values to
    each K centroid until the data points stay in the same cluster. The Mean-Shift
    algorithm uses the density-based clustering strategy to iteratively search the
    centroids of regions with the highest data points density. Then, Mean-Shift assigns
    these regions as the final clusters. BIRCH is a hierarchical algorithm that builds
    a data tree with leaves corresponding to subclusters and has a threshold value
    that limits each subcluster radius. BIRCH also groups subclusters at the ending
    of execution to obtain a K number of clusters. For K-Means, we mandatory need
    to determine the number of K clusters to generate a data model. However, it is
    impossible to speculate the number of K that obtains the best model. Therefore,
    we can evaluate it by calculating a validation index like Calinski–Harabasz [15].
    The Calinski–Harabasz index can decide the optimal number of clusters, revealing
    the best clustering when the index reaches the highest possible value. 2.3. Federated
    learning Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
    enables a computing system to train models from decentralized data sources [7].
    In other words, the federated learning approach supports an IoT system to collaboratively
    join different information from distinct edge nodes, enhancing the system''s decisions.
    In IoT, for example, the cloud can create a global model by aggregating individual
    local models of edge nodes. Imteaj et al. [16] and Hosseinalipour et al. [17]
    describe an FL approach in which the edge nodes collect data, generate a local
    model, and send the local gradients to the cloud. When the cloud receives these
    gradients, it runs a federated averaging algorithm to create a global model and
    transmit the global model gradient to edge nodes [7,10]. In IoT, using federated
    learning can also preserve local data privacy because it does not require exposing
    raw data records through the network [10]. 3. Related work Cook et al. [6] expose
    the challenge of detecting anomalies in IoT systems, considering contextual information,
    prior knowledge, scalability, and resource constraints. They also suggest that
    using a classifier for anomaly detection may pose difficulties in perceiving unexplored
    anomalies. Li et al. [18] present a literature review for federated learning,
    and they mention that “existing FL frameworks construct based on supervised learning
    method.” Moreover, they mention federated training for unsupervised machine learning
    as a new research frontier. Sater and Hamza [19] present a federated learning
    approach called FSLSTM to detect sensor energy consumption anomalies in smart
    buildings. They tested the FSLSTM against deep learning models with three types
    of sensors and observed that their proposal presented higher accuracy for detecting
    these anomalies. Yadav et al. [20] propose a federated unsupervised deep learning
    approach. Their approach uses autoencoders to learn unlabeled data and generate
    its own feature set. They evaluate their proposal using a dataset named CICIDS
    without the data labels, obtaining an accuracy of 97.75 % after 100 training rounds.
    Servetnyk, Fung, and Han [21] present an unsupervised federated learning approach
    for unbalanced data that combines the weight computation strategy with an algorithm
    like K-Means. They artificially generate a dataset with 16 clusters and 50 data
    points per cluster. In experiments, they observed that their proposal clustered
    the data better than centralized K-Means, and their results only focused on measuring
    clustering performance metrics. Ahmad et al. [32] proposed a streaming anomaly
    detection algorithm named HTM and evaluated their approach against other techniques
    using a benchmark called NAB. In the evaluation, they mainly measured latency
    and the NAB score. The study considered sensor temporal noise anomalies but did
    not concern a fog-based scenario. Sivanathan et al. [33] categorized the behavior
    of different IoT devices and developed an unsupervised clustering method to identify
    each device''s normal network traffic behavior. The authors also considered retraining
    models for detecting behavior changes due to a firmware upgrade of devices and
    obtained 94.7 % accuracy. Kumar, Karthik, and Nair [22] present a federated K-Means
    clustering that uses K-Means models as local models and calculates the cluster''s
    centroids average in the cloud. The authors assessed their proposal using well-known
    MNIST and EMNIST datasets. However, the study only focused on measuring the model''s
    accuracy. They also do not consider the continuous changeability of the optimal
    number of clusters for every single edge node. Examining the related work, the
    authors do not consider an IoT scenario containing thousands of fog nodes with
    distinct expected behaviors that can individually change according to the seasonality
    (such as the period of the day, month, or season of the year). Therefore, the
    main contribution of this paper is to present a system that can iteratively identify
    new behaviors of fog nodes using a clustering approach to predict the expected
    behavior of individual nodes, also considering the temporal features for distinct
    contexts, like in a smart irrigation system, where some fog nodes use more or
    fewer computing resources to analyze the data according to sensor location, soil
    moisture, plant species, or annual seasons, for example. Our system can also select
    the best model and identify all the fog node behaviors, which may favor diagnosing
    future faults of each node behavior. 4. FL-means system In this paper, we propose
    a system named FL-Means [34] that uses unsupervised federated learning to discover
    new unlabeled fog node behaviors during system execution, also enabling a fog
    node to identify the other fog nodes’ behaviors. FL-Means has a component executing
    on fog nodes and another on the cloud side, respectively named Fog-FL and Cloud-FL
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Fog-FL and Cloud-FL only transmit clusters centroids
    between fog nodes and the cloud side. In other words, these components do not
    transfer raw data; thus, our system enhances data privacy because it does not
    expose any collected information. Download : Download high-res image (375KB) Download

    cloud-FL component. Fog-FL collects a dataset named workingDB (Figs. 1 and 2),
    which has data samples such as CPU and RAM usage (%), packet delay among sensors
    and fog node (in milliseconds), throughput (Kbps), and the number of packets arriving
    in fog node by every T seconds. Before loop1 execution (Fig. 1), we feed the WorkingDB
    with a few data samples to obtain the known behaviors. During loop1 running, the
    Fog-FL continues to collect these data samples, inserting them in another dataset
    named samplesDB. On the fog side (Fig. 1), the FL-Means system executes five steps
    iteratively: (i) it uses WorkingDB as input to train different K-Means data models
    by varying K values, and it utilizes the Calinski–Harabasz index to decide the
    best model to select (ii) it extracts the clusters centroids of the selected model
    and sends it to the cloud, (iii) it receives new global centroids from the cloud,
    (iv) predicts each sample behavior (cluster) calculating the Euclidean distance
    of these samples from the global centroids and decide if the sample behavior is
    anomalous or not (we consider the expected behavior as the cluster that has more
    data points occurrences in workingDB), and (v) it updates workingDB by inserting
    the data samples of samplesDB in workingDB, because, during Fog-FL execution,
    samplesDB may have new behaviors that are not already stored in workingDB. Additionally,
    the FL-Means system normalizes every input data sample before generating a model
    or predicting its clusters. The Fig. 2 example details the steps presented in
    Fig. 1 and the interaction between the model generated from workingDB and the
    samplesDB. In the Fig. 2 example, the system contains a model from workingDB with
    two known behaviors (A0 and A1). Initially, the system generates a local model
    from workingDB and receives the global model from the cloud. During loop2 execution
    (step 4), it predicts every sample (line) of samplesDB as A0 or A1 behavior. After
    round 1 (all steps''s first execution), the system creates a new workingDB (by
    joining it with samplesDB). In rounds 2 and 3, the system uses the new workingDB
    formed after rounds and repeats the steps mentioned in Fig. 1. However, after
    round 3, the new workingDB model learns a new behavior A2, and now the system
    can detect it when it occurs in any fog node. Therefore, the system joins the
    initial workingDB with the subsequents samplesDB because it can generate models
    from data that appeared during execution time. The system receives each fog''s
    local centroids on the cloud side (Fig. 3). It computes the Euclidean distance
    between every local centroid to verify if it is lower than a threshold value and,
    in turn, marks the centroids that obey this condition. After that, the cloud merges
    the marked centroids by calculating these centroids’ arithmetic mean, and then
    we obtain new centroids values, which refer to combining similar fog node clusters
    centroids. Then, FL-Mean obtains the global centroids being: all the centroids
    of the fog node clusters that Cloud-FL did not merge and the merged fog node centroids.
    Finally, it sends global centroids to all fog nodes. In Fig. 3, the word pass
    means that there is no action for the algorithm execute. 5. Methodology We explore
    three Scenarios: (1) FL-Means against a baseline approach (without global centroids),
    (2) system scalability with thousand local centroids, and (3) FL-Means heterogeneity,
    using different fog node hardware configurations. In the experiments, we use CrateDB
    [23] to support workingDB and samplesDB and run the SenSE simulator [24] to generate
    a dataflow of thousands of packets (which contains the timestamp of the packet
    creation time). We also employ a naïve Linux stress-ng tool to overload the fog
    node CPU and RAM. For Fog-FL (Fig. 1), we configure T = 5 s and i = 48, and for
    Cloud-FL (Fig. 3), we set the threshold value = 0.2. In the experiments, we also
    use the dataset collected by Fog-FL in reference [25]. In the experimental environment
    (Fig. 4), we include the four IoT stages (Section 2.1): SenSE represents the thing
    and mist stages, while Fog-FL and Cloud-FL play the role of the fog and cloud
    stages, respectively. For every scenario, we assess all the distinct time metrics
    with 30 replications, from which we calculate the arithmetic mean, the standard
    deviation, and the 95 % asymptotic confidence intervals. Download : Download high-res
    image (270KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Experimental environment
    (for scenario 3, the fog runs SQLite3 [27] instead of CrateDB). Our simulated
    environment data flow (Fig. 4) is based on the real scenario developed for the
    SWAMP project [29,30], which developed an IoT smart water management system focused
    in high-precision smart irrigation. The project had four pilots: (i) MATOPIBA
    Pilot, in Luís Eduardo Magalhães - Brazil, (ii) Guaspari Pilot, in Espírito Santo
    do Pinhal - Brazil, (iii) Intercrop Pilot, Cartagena - Spain, and (iv) CBEC Pilot,
    San Michele/Fosdondo - Italy. In our experiment, we use time-driven sensors because
    we considered the environment for smart irrigation, as shown in [11]. Zyrianoff
    et al. [11] presented and evaluated a 5-layer IoT architecture with different
    configurations for smart agriculture and smart cities applications. In the investigation,
    the authors explained that real smart cities applications can use more event-driven
    sensors, in contrast to real smart agriculture applications that focus on time-driven
    sensors. 5.1. Scenario 1: accuracy and prediction time We use the Mosquitto MQTT
    Broker [26] to intercommunicate all IoT stages, and every stage runs on the Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. In Scenario 1, we compare our FL-Means system against a baseline
    approach, which is a system that only relies on the fog side. Therefore, the baseline
    does not include steps 2 and 3, mentioned in Fig. 1, without any federation learning
    technique. It also predicts samples (see step 4 of Fig. 1) using the naïve prediction
    method of the K-Means algorithm. 5.1.1. Performance behaviors for fog A We first
    simulate behavior A0 for 10 min and A1 for 20 min, and in subsequent rounds, execute
    behaviors A2 and A3 [25]. • A0: Null packet load (no network traffic). • A1: 1000
    packets per minute and CPU load by 70 %. • A2: 1500 packets per minute, CPU load
    by 100 %, and RAM by 50 %. • A3: 200 packets per minute and CPU load by 40 %.
    5.1.2. Performance behaviors for fog B We initially run behavior B0 for 10 min,
    B1 for 20 min, and B2 for 10 min. In subsequent rounds, execute behaviors B3,
    B4, and B5 [25]. • B0: similar to behavior A0. • B1: 500 packets per minute. •
    B2: 500 packets per minute and CPU load by 80 %. • B3: similar to behavior A1.
    • B4: similar to behavior A2. • B5: similar to behavior A3. 5.1.3. Timeline of
    behavior simulation We execute the experiments in 7 rounds (4 min each), using
    two fog nodes, Fog A and Fog B. As mentioned in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, before
    starting the experiments, the workingDB of Fog A has data records of behaviors
    A0 and A1, and the workingDB of Fog B has samples of behaviors B0, B1, and B2.
    Fig. 5 shows the occurrence of behaviors during the seven rounds and highlights
    the behaviors B3, B4, and B5 with a red outline when they appear for the first
    time in Fog B. Note that we run B3, B4, and B5 in Fog B after executing them in
    Fog A (as A1, A2, and A3). Download : Download high-res image (231KB) Download

    2: scalability We explore Cloud-FL scalability considering Fog A and Fog B with
    the local centroids of rounds 1 and 7 (see Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and Fig. 4).
    We also evaluate both fog nodes with 12 local centroids. Our experiments simulate
    fog nodes sending 2, 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000
    local centroids to the cloud (half Fog A and half Fog B). The cloud runs on Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations: • Conf.1: Fog A uses two local
    centroids from round 1 (Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.3), and Fog B uses three centroids
    from round 7 (Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3). • Conf.2: Fog A uses five local centroids,
    and Fog B uses six centroids from round 7. • Conf.3: Fog A uses 12 distinct clusters,
    and Fog B uses the same 12 centroids. 5.3. Scenario 3: heterogeneity We explore
    the FL-Means heterogeneity executing the Fog-FL component using different hardware
    devices. We assess Fog-FL in a Raspberry Pi 4, a Jetson Nano developer kit, and
    a personal computer (PC) with an Intel Core i7 processor. The cloud runs on the
    Linux Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4
    GHz and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations for the fog node hardware:
    • Raspberry: Raspberry Pi 4 Computer Model B running Linux 20.04 operating system
    with Quad-core ARM A72, 1.5 GHz, and 4GB memory. • Jetson: Jetson Nano Developer
    Kit running Linux 20.04 operating system with a Quad-core ARM A57, 1.43 GHz, and
    4 GB memory. • PC: A physical personal computer using an Intel Core i7-5500U processor
    with 2.4 GHz, 8GB RAM, and running Linux 20.04 operating system. 5.4. Metrics
    In scenario 1, we analyze the following metrics: (i) the Calinski–Harabasz index
    for every round; (ii) the number of clusters (it suggests the number of groups
    that fit better according to the Calinski–Harabasz validation index); (iii) the
    confusion matrix (assesses the K-Means data model accuracy); (iv) Accuracy of
    predictions (we evaluate the FL-Means system against baseline); (v) Euclidean
    distance between centroids of Fog A and B behaviors to identify which behaviors
    are similar; (vi) Time BDF, as the time that a fog node needs to correctly predict
    behaviors already learned by other fog nodes (FL-Means against baseline); (vii)
    Time to predict a known behavior in a single sample, where we assess FL-Means
    against a baseline. In scenario 2, we analyze the following metrics: (i) time
    to compute the global centroids and (ii) CPU usage of the Cloud-FL component.
    In scenario 3, we evaluate the (i) Time-Local as the time to compute the local
    centroids, (ii) Time-Global as the time to compute local centers and receive the
    global centroids, considering that a fog node is the first of 100 fog nodes to
    send the local centroids and the last to receive, (iii) Time-Pred-Fog as the time
    to K-Means sample prediction in a fog node (without federated learning) and (iv)
    Time-Pred-FL as the time of sample prediction using the global centroids. 6. Results
    In this section, we reveal our experiment results. 6.1. Results of scenario 1
    Scenario 1 presents the results for individual fog nodes (A and B), and we report
    the results for the FL-Means system against the baseline approach (see Section
    5.1). 6.1.1. Results for each fog node individual behaviors Before each round,
    the Fog-FL component (Fig. 1) runs the Calinski–Harabasz validation to select
    the best clustering model, varying the number of clusters by two up to 10, where
    we obtained the results shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7. After Fog-FL decides the number
    of clusters, we observe that it corresponds to the number of simulated behaviors
    for Fog A and B (as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5), except for rounds 6 and 7 of
    Fog A. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download : Download full-size

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A 2 2 2 3 3 5 5 B 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 In Table 1, we verify that the system
    finds the exact number of simulated behaviors for all rounds of Fog B. For rounds
    6 and 7 of Fog A, the Calinski–Harabasz validation suggests four clusters (Section
    5.1.1) but also identifies one more behavior (A4). After analyzing the A4 data
    points, we perceive that the system correctly identifies this new behavior because
    the delay of its samples is twice the value of behavior A1 records. Therefore,
    considering 5 clusters for the models in the last two rounds of Fog A is valid.
    Then, in these rounds, Fog A correctly perceives behaviors A0, A1, A2, A3, and
    A4. We generate a confusion matrix for the last selected models of Fog A and Fog
    B (Fig. 8). The confusion matrix presents the main diagonal tending to approximately
    98 % accuracy for Fog A and 100 % accuracy for Fog B (on a scale of 0.0–1.0),
    where rows and columns symbolize the simulated behaviors and the found clusters.
    Therefore, we perceive that the models are appropriate when comparing the clusters
    with the simulated behaviors (including found behavior A4). Download : Download

    the baseline We observe that during single sample predictions in Fog A (Fig. 9),
    the FL-Means system and the baseline approach present an accuracy lower than 80
    % for round 3 and equal to 0 % for round 5. The system generates these results
    because it does not immediately recognize the new behaviors A2 during round 3
    and A3 during round 5 (see timeline in Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image
    (261KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Accuracy of predictions for
    fog A. We can observe that behavior A3 never happened before round 5, for Fog
    A or Fog B (see Fig. 5). Therefore, the both systems (federated and non-federated)
    cannot perceive A3 until round 5 finishes, when will be generated a model created
    by a new workingDB with characteristics of behavior A3 (as mentioned in explanation
    of Fig. 2). In Fog A, the correct prediction of these new behaviors will only
    happen when the next round starts; in other words when Fog A generates a new k-means
    model that includes these behaviors as new clusters (see Table 1). During round
    3, for example, Fog A only knows the behaviors A0 and A1 (and behaviors B0, B1,
    B2, and B3 of Fog B if using the FL-Means system). However, no fog node has identified
    A2 yet (see Fig. 5), and it needs to wait until the next round to recognize this
    behavior because A2 is unprecedented for the entire system. In round 5, for example,
    the accuracy is 0 % (Fig. 9) because A3 is the only simulated in this round (see
    Fig. 5). However, the system can identify this behavior in the subsequent round
    6 because, after round 5, Fog A generates new models containing the most recent
    samples and identifies new clusters. In rounds 1, 2, 6, and 7, we observe an accuracy
    of 100 % for both approaches. In round 4, the FL-Means system presented an accuracy
    of 93.8 % against 100 % for baseline. In Fog B, we observe that the baseline does
    not correctly predict the behaviors B4 during round 4 and B5 during round 6 but
    that the FL-Means system detects these behaviors correctly and reveals the most
    accurate prediction values for all assessed rounds (Fig. 10). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system is most advantageous than the baseline because, in rounds 4 and 6, it detects
    the behaviors B4 (identical to A2) and B5 (like A3) without the Fog B needing
    to wait for the next round (to generate a new data model). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system identified B4 and B5 correctly in Fog B because the system previously learned
    them as Fog A behaviors (see timeline in Fig. 5 and Table 1). Download : Download

    predictions for fog B. During round 4, the Fog B individually only knows 4 clusters:
    B0, B1, B2, and B3 (see Table 1), but using the FL-Means system, it also knows
    that the behavior B4 is similar to A2 because Fog A model already knows the three
    clusters: A0, A1, and A2 (see Table 1 and Fig. 5). Analyzing Table 2, we also
    observe that the FL-Means system merged the behaviors B4 and A2 because the Euclidean
    distance between their centroids is lower than 0.2 (our threshold value). Table

    value = 0.2). FCa Rounds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A0 and B0 0.068 0.054 0.068 0.022 0.023

    the non-federated baseline approach presents a 0 % accuracy prediction during
    round 6 (Fig. 10) because we only simulate behavior B5 during this round. During
    round 2, even when Fog B uses FL-Means, it cannot identify the behavior B3 (identical
    to A1) because the Euclidean distance between B3 and A1 is higher than 0.2 (see
    Table 2). Therefore, in this case, FL-Means has an accuracy near the baseline
    approach (Fig. 10). The FL-Means system computes the Euclidean distances between
    similar behaviors above the threshold value for A1 and B3 until round 3 (Table
    2). However, in the following rounds, the distances of A1 and B3 decrease, and
    the system recognizes these behaviors as similar (Table 2). We also verify that
    FL-Means correctly recognizes and merges all other identical behaviors A0 and
    B0, A2 and B4, and A3 and B5 since their first occurrences because the distances
    between their centroids are lower than the threshold value (Table 2). The FL-Means
    system reveals an enormous gain considering the time BDF metric (Fig. 11) because
    it was 1710 times faster in round 4 and 8043 times faster in round 6 than the
    baseline approach, which needs to wait for the next round to identify the new
    behavior correctly. However, FL-Means and baseline are statistically tied in round
    2 because the distance between the behaviors A1 and B3 is not lower than 0.2 at
    this moment (see Table 2), and it needs to wait for the next round to detect the
    behavior B3 individually (see Table 1). In typical situations, we verify that
    both approaches present similar time costs to predict a known behavior in a single
    sample, around 30 ± 2 ms. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download

    of scenario 2 In Scenario 2, we analyze the system scalability, where we send
    two up to 40,000 local centroids to the Cloud-FL component. In our experiment,
    each local centroid refer to the number of fog nodes that send cluster centroids
    to Cloud-FL to generate global centroids (see Section 5.2). Fig. 12 shows that
    the time to compute global centroids for 100 fog nodes is, on average, 0.19 ±
    0.01, 0.35 ± 0.03, and 1.02 ± 0.01 s for Conf.1, Conf.2, and Conf.3, respectively.
    We also note that Conf.3 takes 6.82 ± 0.02 s for 1000 fog nodes, and Conf.3 takes
    31.08 ± 0.02 s with 5000 fog nodes to compute global centroids. Besides, these
    times present a correlation coefficient of 0.99996, 0.99991, and 0.99989 for Conf.1,
    Conf.2, and Conf.3, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (219KB) Download

    proportional to the number of clusters and fog nodes sending local cluster centers
    to the cloud. We also observe that cloud CPU usage increases when the number of
    fog nodes expands (Fig. 13), with a correlation coefficient of 0.92724. Download

    explores the heterogeneity of fog nodes by using three different hardware configurations:
    Jetson, Raspberry, and PC (see Section 5.3). In this scenario, the fog node generates
    and selects one data model to extract the local centroids (Fig. 1.). For the Time-Local
    metric, we observe that the PC configuration takes 5.85 times lower than Jetson
    and 2.28 times lower than Raspberry (Fig. 14). Download : Download high-res image

    generate local centroids (Time-Local) and for the fog node to obtain global centroids
    with 100 fog nodes (Time-Global). We also measure the Time-Global metric, which
    consists of a fog node calculating local centroids, sending them to the cloud,
    and receiving the cloud centroids (after the cloud sends the same global centroids
    to another 99 fog nodes). Therefore, the time to obtain the global centroids (Time-Global)
    is formed by the time to compute local fog node centroids, the time for the cloud
    to calculate the global centroids, and the time to receive the centroids from
    the cloud. For the Time-Global, we perceive that PC presents the lowest values
    and that Raspberry takes 1.81 times lower than Jetson for this metric (Fig. 14).
    In Fig. 14, we also discovered that Raspberry demands less time to process local
    centroids than Jetson because the FL-Means code runs on a CPU of 1.43 GHz against
    1.5 GHz of Raspberry Pi 4. In Fig. 15, we note that Time-Pred-FL elapses faster
    for every hardware configuration than Time-Pred-Fog. For Time-Pred-Fog, we observe
    that the PC configuration demands, on average, 7.27 less time to predict a sample
    against the Jetson and 3.76 times less than the Raspberry. We also perceive that
    even using the Jetson configuration, the Time-Pred-FL takes less than 47 ms to
    decide a sample cluster. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download :

    7. Discussion Based on the results, we observed that FL-Means presents accuracy
    and time gains for predicting unknown fog node behaviors. In an IoT scenario where
    at least one fog node has already learned a new behavior, the FL-Means system
    saves other fog nodes time to predict the same behavior when it appears to them
    for the first time. We also highlight that our system can detect new fog node
    behaviors by continuously training local models with the appropriate number of
    behaviors because it uses Calinski–Harabasz validation every round. Scenario 1
    shows that FL-Means does not merge the behaviors A1 and B3 when B3 appears in
    round 2 because the distance between them is higher than 0.2. In round 3, Fog
    B already learns B3 but does not recognize B3 as the same as A1. The distances
    between B3 and A1 only reduce when the behavior B4 appears at the end of round
    4 because B4 has data samples with the highest RAM and CPU usage, changing the
    cluster centroid of B3. We observe that the threshold for behaviors A1 and B3
    is higher than 0.2 in rounds 1 and 2, delaying the system to perceive that behaviors
    A1 and B3 are similar. Also, supposing we set the threshold to 0.1, the FL-Means
    will not detect that behaviors A2 and B4 are similar. Therefore, it is essential
    to report that the threshold value impacts the prediction time and accuracy results.
    Scenario 2 evidences that the cloud side demands more CPU usage and time to compute
    global centroids when the number of fog nodes increases. Scenario 3 shows that
    FL-Means executed correctly for the three different fog node hardware tested.
    We advise using a cloud component to compute the global centroids for fog nodes
    with the same hardware. For example, one Cloud-FL should calculate data from Raspberry
    fog nodes, and the other should receive data from Jetson fog nodes. The FL-Means
    system enhances IoT trustworthiness by enabling every fog node to learn all other
    fog node behaviors faster without sending any local raw data, only transmitting
    the centroids of the clusters, preserving privacy. Also, the FL-Means system supports
    the cloud in monitoring all expected and anomalous fog node behaviors because
    the cloud always receives the behaviors'' centroids from fog nodes. 8. Conclusion
    This paper presents an unsupervised federated learning system (FL-Means). The
    FL-Means system enables a fog-based IoT application to recognize fog node behaviors
    faster when they have already occurred in different fog nodes. It can also detect
    new behaviors by grouping them in clusters using the K-Means algorithm. We assess
    the FL-Means in three Scenarios: (1) when it identifies each fog node behavior
    individually and against a baseline approach (without the federated learning technique),
    (2) testing scalability, and (3) exploring heterogeneity. In Scenario 1, we execute
    the experiments in seven rounds of four minutes each, using a cloud server and
    two fog nodes that we call A and B. The FL-Means system correctly clustered all
    simulated behaviors for both fog nodes individually. In Scenario 1, we evidence
    that using FL-Means, Fog B adequately predicts the unknown behaviors only Fog
    A previously knew. FL-Means reveal 95.8 % accuracy against 79.2 % of the baseline
    in round 4 and 100 % against 0 % of the baseline in round 6. In the same situation,
    the FL-Means system predicts the behaviors in Fog B faster in rounds 4 and 6 than
    in the baseline approach. Examining Scenarios 2 and 3, with 100 fog nodes, we
    observe that the fog node needs to generate the local model and that our federated
    system only requires milliseconds or at least one second more to calculate a global
    model. We also have evidence that predicting a sample behavior using federated
    learning is faster than not using it. Therefore, our approach shows promising
    results for time-critical IoT applications. A complete system to detect anomalies
    and network attacks can be built on top of FL-Means, but we focused on detecting
    performance anomalies related to context. In future work, we intend to reduce
    FL-Means time response and explore fog nodes with distinct kinds of datasets,
    including network attacks. CRediT authorship contribution statement Franklin Magalhães

    I. Introduction Soil is a complex mixture of components in different states of
    matter (solid, liquid, and gaseous), and their proportion defines its quality
    [1]. Liquid–solid interactions are the main factor responsible for the physical
    properties of soil, which is affected by water fluxes of the land surface, precipitation,
    temperature, and evapotranspiration, which all play a significant role in agricultural
    practices and irrigation management [2]. Quantitatively, the liquid component
    is mainly represented by the amount of water in the pore spaces of unsaturated
    soil and can be expressed as gravimetric moisture content (ratio between the mass
    of moisture present in the sample to the dried mass) or volumetric moisture content
    (ratio between the volume of moisture present in the soil and the total volume
    of the soil). Thus, measurement of soil moisture content is fundamental, and according
    to the standard method, can be calculated by the difference in weight after drying
    the sample in an oven [3]. The traditional thermo-gravimetric method, performed
    in a laboratory environment, is time-consuming, laborious, and unsuitable for
    real-time monitoring of soil moisture [4]. Given the importance, many alternative
    sensing techniques have been developed to estimate soil moisture content for agricultural
    purposes [5]. These include remote sensing tools, which are suitable for large-scale
    estimations, and in situ devices for in-field assessments [6]. In situ sensing
    methods are point-based solutions that can require, or not, physical contact with
    the soil. In recent years, together with the advancements in sensor technology
    and modern industrial communication protocols [e.g., Internet of Things (IoTs)],
    several soil moisture sensors have been developed with various measurement methods,
    including tensiometers [7], radioactive techniques based on neutron scattering
    probes [8], heat pulse probes [9], γ -ray projection or gamma ray attenuation
    theory [10], infrared spectroscopy [11], electromagnetic induction techniques
    [12], and dielectric methods [4]. However, for continuous monitoring, these techniques
    have several disadvantages. For example, a tensiometer is limited in spatial variability
    and has high maintenance costs, while gamma-ray and neutron probes are expensive
    and cannot be widely adopted because of radiation hazards [4]. Infrared remote
    sensing and dielectric spectroscopy [13], [14], [15] appear to be the most suitable
    alternatives. The interaction of the radio frequency electromagnetic waves with
    matter is described by dielectric permittivity ( ε ∗ = ε ′ - jε ′ ′ ), a complex
    number containing both real ( ε ′ related to the amount of energy stored) and
    imaginary ( ε ′ ′ or loss factor, related to the loss of energy) components. Water
    molecules show a relative dielectric permittivity of about 80 °C at 20 °C (at
    a frequency up to 3 GHz), a value which is higher than that of the air (1.00059
    at 101325 Pa) and other soil constituents (from 4.5 to 10) [16] such as minerals,
    salts, and organic matter. Even if not comparable to the role of the moisture
    content, texture, and bulk density can influence dielectric properties [17], [18].
    Several commercial sensing techniques are based on an assessment of moisture content
    through soil dielectric permittivity and subsequent use of specific calibration
    models [19], [20]. These solutions include both point measurement techniques,
    such as time domain reflectometry (TDR) and frequency domain reflectometry (FDR),
    and remote measurement techniques such as ground penetrating radar (GPR). However,
    considering the complexity of the material and its relation with electromagnetic
    waves, the success of these measurement solutions is related to the ability of
    the calibration models to estimate the moisture content of soil and the interaction
    between its components, taking into account the frequency of measurements and
    temperature [14], [20]. More recently, to set up a reliable noncontact system,
    attention was dedicated to a technique based on an open-ended waveguide positioned
    in contact with the soil surface combined with multivariate tools (PLS regression)
    [21], [22]. The resulting spectra were influenced by differences in levels of
    soil moisture in both controlled laboratory conditions [22] and in a real environment
    experiment conducted using a portable device with the coefficients of the PLS
    predictive model embedded in the system [21]. PLS appeared to be able to model
    the variability as testified by the external validation conducted on spectra acquired
    on a range of soil types (silty–clay–loam soil characterized by moisture content
    ranging between 9% and 32%), showing an R 2 value of 0.892 and a root mean square
    error (RMSE) of 1.0%. Considering the needs of the primary sector need, cost is
    another crucial aspect of sensor development. As is known, instruments with high
    prices are not widely desired. Many sensors for estimation of soil moisture based
    on dielectric properties have been proposed in previous studies [4]. However,
    some of these are expensive [23], [24], [25], while others are characterized by
    a low-cost probe and expensive instrumental chain [26], [27], [28], [29], [30],
    becoming incompatible for the designated purpose. A selection of applicable soil
    moisture techniques based on dielectric properties and characterized by low cost
    is reported in Table I. The present work was also added to the table for easy
    comparison. TABLE I Low-Cost Techniques for Measurement of Soil Moisture Based
    on Dielectric Properties As can be seen, experiments conducted ON resistance [31],
    [32] have possible sources of error affecting the accuracy of measurements, mainly
    due to the variability introduced by irrigation procedures, which continuously
    change the ionic concentration of soil. In addition, several studies have been
    conducted in laboratories with homogenous soil samples [33], [34], [35] or in
    a controlled environment [36] with added water, which is far from the actual hydration
    behavior in the field and renders samples more homogeneous. Only two studies measure
    the sensor’s performance in the field [37], [38]; moreover, the proposed solutions
    must be inserted into the soil, and relative performances have been shown by only
    exploring calibration procedures. Probe insertion in soil does not preserve the
    physical characteristics of the field and can lead to possible errors [37]. Considering
    statistical aspects, not all studies have reported predictive indexes that define
    the robustness of the calibration models developed. The present work aims to be
    as follows. Explore the potential of an inexpensive and rapid instrumental tool
    for the estimation of the gravimetric moisture content (%) in a real agricultural
    environment. Select and set up an instrumental chain composed of a miniaturized
    commercial nano-vector network analyzer (VNA) and a cavity antenna as a probe
    that is not to be inserted into the soil but just placed in contact with it. Develop
    a multivariate statistical model; both real and imaginary parts of the scattering
    parameter S11 are combined with PLS regression models to estimate the target physical
    parameter. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Soil Characteristics Two fields
    with two different crops (rocket salad for seed, Eruca Sativa, and salad, Lactuca
    Sativa) were selected. The fields, characterized by the same texture and chemical
    composition, are located in Italy, in the northeastern Emilia Romagna region.
    The Emilia Romagna regional institute constantly monitors the composition of agricultural
    soils, and an interactive site (https://agri.regione.emilia-romagna.it/Suoli/)
    allows consultation of the cartography of soils and maps of the natural foundation
    with all the relative characteristics are reported and available for all users.
    Accordingly, the land sites are precisely identified, and the characteristics
    are further reported. Loamy loam soil is very deep with a moderate, fine texture.
    The soil is scarcely calcareous and slightly alkaline in the upper part, while
    moderately alkaline and very calcareous in the lower part. The substratum is alternated
    by silty and sandy alluvium. The chemical–physical analysis of the soil revealed
    the following composition: 21.7% sand, 35.5% clay, pH 8%, and total calcium 4.8%.
    The organic matter is 1.8%, total nitrogen 1.3%, and P2O5 34 mg/kg with K2O 158
    mg/kg. Both fields were irrigated by the flooding method. Water was released twice
    during the season, from May to August 2022, and fields were leveled and milled.
    Traditional flood irrigation is still in use, and it involves simply letting water
    flow over the ground. Water is released in intervals; soil is leveled to be more
    efficient and limit evaporation, infiltration by capillarity, and loss by transpiration.
    Sensors can help the management of irrigation, especially the flooding method,
    by paying attention to the in-depth strategic placement of the probe. B. Device
    Design: Principle of Detection In electrical engineering, losses caused by the
    line, antenna, and standing waves are undesirable, and signal analysis helps to
    control correct wave propagation along a cable, minimizing distortions [40]. In
    the present work, the reflection of the wave becomes an opportunity to study soil
    behavior. The response regarding dipole rotation of molecules and energy storage
    producing loss can be used to characterize the chemical–physical properties of
    the material being tested. Considering constant composition and field milled treatment
    to be in very similar geometry of the ground analyzed, the moisture content could
    be considered the main parameter affecting electromagnetic wave interaction in
    the microwave range. In a radio frequency incident signal on one port, part of
    this signal is sent to the probe and reflected back to the port, while the loss
    of the signal power is dissipated and absorbed. S- parameters represent the response
    obtained when the electromagnetic wave encounters a discontinuity, in our case
    soil, causing the scattering of the signal. The reflection coefficient ( Γ ) is
    related to the load impedance and the real and imaginary parts of S11 , according
    to the following equations: Γ Z ln = Z ln −1 Z ln +1 = ( S11 2 re + S11 2 im )
    − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ = Z l R 0 View Source where Z ln is the load impedance
    normalized to R 0 , the system reference impedance, and S 11 re and S 11 im are
    the real (resistive) and imaginary parts (reactive) of S11 , respectively. Accordingly,
    real and imaginary parts of S11 can be used as signal parameters to correlate
    with soil properties. C. Layout of the Instrumentation The instrumental chain
    is characterized by a rectangular cavity antenna connected via port CH0 with a
    semi-rigid coaxial cable ( 50 Ω ) to a NanoVNA, V2 (HCXQS in collaboration with
    OwOComm, China) and interface via USB with a PC (Fig. 1). These elements have
    been described, even if separately, in previous works [41], [42], [43]. Working
    as a probe, the dimensions of the internal Section of the cavity antenna are 96
    to 46 mm. The NanoVNA was fastened to the cavity antenna with a specific support.
    Fig. 1. Instrumentation layout comprises a rectangular cavity antenna, a NanoVNA,
    and a personal computer. Show All An antenna usually operates at or near its resonant
    frequencies, where its reactance equals zero [40]. The reactance ( X ) of the
    self-manufactured cavity antenna of the probe was measured using R-140 VNA (Copper
    Mountains) interfaced via USB to a computer with appropriate software. For the
    cavity antenna, according to Fig. 2 showing the reactance ( X ) against frequency
    (Hz), the resonant frequencies are 1.56 and 2.46 GHz (in air). Fig. 2. Reactance
    ( X) of the cavity antenna (in air) in the 1.5–3.0 GHz frequency range. Show All
    Its producer kit (HCXQS in collaboration with OwOComm, China) calibrated the device,
    accounting for open, short, and load correction. The VNA has already been used
    by other authors [42], [43], and is a very affordable instrument. In addition,
    the NanoVNA is also very promising for in-field applications as it is portable
    and has an internal rechargeable battery. Data were acquired using the NanoVNA-saver
    software (GNU, General Public License, version 0.3.8, Rune Broberg), averaging
    ten consecutive acquisitions. Each was composed of 301 spectral points acquired
    in about 30 s. The NanoVNA acquisitions were set from one port in the frequency
    range from 1.5 to 3 GHz and provided the real and imaginary parts of the scattering
    parameters ( S11 ). Furthermore, the device penetration depth (the depth to which
    the instrumentation can detect a reflection) was empirically estimated to evaluate
    the feasibility of self-manufactured probes. In the microwave range, the penetration
    depth varies as a function of moisture content; the lower the percentage of water,
    the greater the thickness probed. Measurements were conducted on soil hydrated
    at 5% humidity (dry basis), representing a low moisture value. A metal plate was
    put into the material at different heights (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 28 cm) to directly
    measure the signal influence at different depths. D. Experimental Setup The experimental
    plan included 315 in-field acquisitions, conducted by performing three probe rotations
    for each sampling area (with a step of about 45°). Measures of the three probe
    rotations were averaged. Accordingly, 105 samples were then used for model building.
    At the same time, soil samples were collected in correspondence with the probe
    position for assessment of moisture content (%). Measurements were conducted ten
    times from May to August 2022, early in the morning, to limit the large oscillation
    in temperature. Soil temperatures between 17.5 °C and 29.0 °C (±0.2 °C) were detected.
    Although within a closer temperature range, as Franceschelli et al. (2020) observed,
    the moisture content significantly influenced spectral waveforms more than the
    temperature in the frequency range explored. The target parameter (moisture content,
    %) used for the statistical inference was obtained by the traditional destructive
    oven method by drying soil samples at 105 °C for 24 h [21]. The thermogravimetric
    method was selected for its recognized accuracy. In detail, the moisture content
    was assessed on the first 5 cm of soil depth and ranged between 1.3% and 45.9%.
    E. Statistical Analysis A multivariate method was selected to build the regression
    models from real and imaginary signals (the spectral variables). These signals
    were used as independent variables ( X ) to build predictive models for the estimation
    of moisture content ( Y ) using a bilinear regression tool, i.e., partial least
    squares regression (PLSR) analysis. PLS projects X and Y in a new orthogonal space
    X= TP T andY=U Q T View Source where T is the latent vector called the score matrix
    of X , P is the loading matrix of X , U is the score of Y matrix, and Q is the
    loading of Y matrix [44], [45]. Starting from the simultaneous calculation of
    the projections of the X and Y matrices and maximizing the correlation of the
    two new spaces, β coefficients and weights of the X matrix are obtained [44],
    [45] Y=Xβ+ β 0 . View Source Data were organized in two matrices composed of 105
    samples and 301 spectral variables (for both real and imaginary parts). Spectral
    sample outliers were detected before the model-building procedure on the entire
    dataset. Segmented and test set validations were then considered to understand
    how the models performed with unknown samples. Twenty segments, with five samples
    each, were randomly selected for segmented validation. Assuming the test set validation,
    20% of the samples were randomly extracted from the calibration dataset (80% of
    the samples) and used to validate the model. The procedure was repeated ten times,
    and the results were averaged. The model’s ability to estimate soil moisture (%)
    was considered in terms of coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), RMSE, and significative
    PLS components (LVs) for both calibration and validations. The bias, known as
    the systematic difference between measured and predicted values, was also computed
    as the average of the residuals. Regression coefficient beta ( β ) and X -loading
    weights were exploited to show which part of the spectral range mainly contributes
    to sample variability in terms of moisture content. All statistical processes
    were carried out using Unscrambler1 (Unscrambler software, version 9.7, CAMO,
    Oslo, Norway). SECTION III. Results and Discussion The instrumental chain described
    above was first tested in the laboratory to estimate the depth of penetration
    in the soil of the radio frequency device, as described in the Materials and Methods.
    As an example, the real part of S11 of the soil analyzed with and without a metal
    plate placed at a depth of 28 cm is shown in Fig. 3. As observed, at this depth,
    the antenna is still sensitive to the metal plate. Accordingly, even if empirical,
    the penetration depth of the device can reach at least 28 cm, considering soil
    characterized by a low moisture content (5%). Fig. 3. Real part of S11 of soil
    (5% moisture) with and without a metal plate at a depth of 28 cm. Show All In
    Fig. 4, the real, imaginary parts, and magnitude of the S11 for the in-field soil
    measurements, colored to distinguish differences in moisture content, are shown
    in the frequency range of 1.5–3.0 GHz. Fig. 4. Real and imaginary parts and magnitude
    of S11 highlight differences in spectra due to moisture content. Show All As observed,
    variations in moisture produce spectral modifications in terms of peak intensity
    and slope. The largest differences can be appreciated in the first part, between
    1.5 and 1.9 GHz, of the frequency range, considering real, imaginary, and magnitude.
    In particular, magnitude does not show an apparent, univocal behavior according
    to variations in the moisture content. Thus, a different effect of water in terms
    of absorption or reflection can be observed within the spectral range. The phenomenon
    could be related to the complexity of the characteristics of the device-soil system
    (e.g., the cavity antenna’s geometry, soil’s cloudiness, and radiation mode close
    to near-field conditions). As observed in previous research, for different types
    of soils changes in the moisture content led to appreciable differences in the
    spectral waveforms in the 1.5–2.7 GHz frequency range in terms of gain and phase,
    especially in the 1.5–1.9 GHz and 2.5–2.7 portions [21], [22]. Water is the main
    physical substance in the microwave range that produces electromagnetic wave interaction,
    and the above-cited ranges seem promising for their indirect estimation of water
    in different soil types [40]. It is known that soil texture can affect measurements
    and related regression models; however, tailored sensor calibrations with several
    soil textures and dedicated regression models could be a means of overcoming this.
    Results in terms of R 2 , RMSE, LVs, and bias of calibrated and validated PLS
    regression models obtained from averaged real and imaginary parts of S11 spectra
    are summarized in Table II. TABLE II Results of PLS Regression for S11 Real and
    Imaginary Part Considering Different Validation Methods Considering the real part
    of S11 , PLS-validated models demonstrated a good prediction ability in terms
    of R 2 values ranging from 0.854 (Segmented) to 0.825 (Test set) and RMSE values
    (between 4.4% and 4.9%). The imaginary part reaches slightly higher results with
    R 2 values ranging from 0.872 (Segmented) to 0.862 (Test set), and RMSE values
    ranging from 4.1% to 4.3%. Another parameter confirming the good performance of
    the model is the low values of bias or the error linked to the prediction. Considering
    the variability of soil samples measured in the field, the wide range of the moisture
    content, and the influence of temperature, PLS regression models seem to accurately
    estimate the moisture content (%). Better prediction appeared to be related to
    the imaginary part of S11 , while the magnitude of S11 did not improve the predictive
    performance of the model. Predicted versus observed values of moisture content
    (%) for segmented validation and calibration of PLS models (see Table II) for
    both real and imaginary parts are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Predicted versus observed
    moisture content (%) for segmented validation and calibration of PLS models for
    the real (left) and imaginary (right) parts of S11 . Show All The regression model
    of the real and imaginary parts of S11 yields an equation in which the regression
    β -coefficient and X -loading weights express a linear combination between observed
    and predicted values. Accordingly, which part of the signal contributes mainly
    to explaining data variability by plotting the β -coefficient (Fig. 6) and X -loading
    weights (Fig. 7) against frequency can be observed. Fig. 6. Regression coefficient
    ( β) for S11 (real and imaginary parts). Show All Fig. 7. X -loadings of LV1,
    LV2, and LV3 for S11 (real and imaginary parts). Show All For both real and imaginary
    parts of S11 , the maximum variation of the β -coefficient and X -loading weights
    of the first three LVs are around 1.6 and 2.6 GHz. These two-frequency sub-ranges
    are the most sensitive for the cavity antenna, as shown in Fig. 8, which describes
    the soil reactance ( X ) versus frequency (Hz) (moisture content of 45%). Fig.
    8. Reactance ( X) for soil with a moisture content of 45% versus frequency (Hz).
    Show All The values of the maximum sensitivity of the cavity antenna are represented
    by the points in which the reactance ( X ) (45% of soil moisture content) is zero,
    and it behaves as a resonator. These two sub-ranges, around 1.6 and 2.6 GHz, correspond
    to the frequency with the highest spectral variability. In addition, several studies
    have previously identified the frequency range 1.6–2.6 GHz as one of the promising
    for estimation of moisture content. Accordingly, the β regression coefficient
    and X -loading weights of the models show the highest variability in these frequency
    ranges and contribute to the highest prediction of moisture content (%). SECTION
    IV. Conclusion A rapid, simple, and nondestructive technique based on a cavity
    antenna coupled with a VNA was established to assess moisture content directly
    in the field on silty–clay–loam soil. The device’s accuracy, as far as the device
    penetration depth, was examined by providing a considerably mature base for commercial
    needs. At present, the economic aspect is important for large-scale implementation,
    and the device presented meets this requirement, with a current estimated cost
    of $200 USD. Real and imaginary parts of S11 were used to build PLS multivariate
    models. The best results in terms of coefficient of determination R 2 values were
    0.854 (RMSE 4.4%) for the S11 real part and 0.872 (RMSE 4.1%) for the S11 imaginary
    part (segmented validation). The best external validation results regarding R
    2 values were 0.825 (RMSE 4.9%) and 0.862 (RMSE 4.3%) for the real and imaginary
    parts, respectively. The optimal operating bandwidth was determined to be from
    1.5 to 2.6 GHz. The limited bandwidth could give further strength to the affordability
    of the device. The cost-effective and easy-to-use device that can monitor in real-time
    and regulate moisture levels in the field appears promising and worthy of being
    further improved to meet the needs of agricultural farmers in an increasingly
    digitized world. SECTION V. Future Work Future studies should be carried out to
    validate the feasibility of the device for soil moisture estimation in soil characterized
    by different granulometry and cloudiness. For this purpose, the development of
    calibration models that are specific to a certain soil type may be required. One
    possibility, already implemented on other instruments, could be to perform and
    test different predictive models (e.g., based on nonlinear PLS or artificial neural
    network) on the same samples or samples with similar characteristics. Moreover,
    some attempts could be made to implement a single model for a cluster of soil
    typologies considering only the three main types: silty, loam, and clay. NOTE

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Comprehensive architecture of the proposed method. The
    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res
    image (352KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Circuit diagram of the
    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res
    image (244KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Workflow of the smart
    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    Increase temperature, Increase humidity, Maintain motion, Increase light intensity

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    on distinct aspects. The detailed discussion on features is categorized into groups,
    such as the sensors used, the implemented technology communication model, and
    user-feedback applications on the job. Table 6. Features comparison between the

    the availability of user-feedback applications. The proposed research employs
    various sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and
    motion detection. To facilitate user feedback, we utilize two serially connected
    microcontrollers through a digital platform named ThingerIO. 4.3.2. Results comparison
    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.
    Method Number of managed vital parameters Number of actuating tools Ability to
    monitor in real-time basis [38] 2 3 Yes [12] 3 0 No [45] 2 3 Yes Proposed method
    5 6 Yes Furthermore, the proposed method distinguishes itself by employing a notable
    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

    I. Introduction Crops and plants are prone to attack by various diseases and pests.
    These attacks are detrimental to the quality of crops produced and, subsequently,
    to the livelihood of the farmers. According to the literature, diseases, pests,
    and weeds contribute to 36% loss of crops [1]. The foremost cause of frequent
    plant diseases is a lack of supervision and monitoring. To overcome this challenge,
    advanced sensors based technology could be employed to install a supervision system
    in place. Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor technology is one of the leading
    solutions to monitor and keep track of the plant growth environment. Sensor signals
    along with machine learning algorithms have been shown to create robust disease
    detection and prediction systems [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. To abate crop loss due
    to diseases, researchers have proposed various disease warning systems. A few
    essential parameters for these models are leaf wetness duration (LWD), ambient
    temperature, and relative humidity [7], [8], [9]. The presence of water molecules
    on the surface of the leaves, paired with suitable ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, enables the germination of fungal diseases on the leaf canopy [10].
    Therefore, consistent measurement of LWD plays a crucial role in developing a
    sound disease prediction model. Researchers have explored various types of leaf
    wetness sensors (LWSs) out of which electronic LWS is deemed suitable for in situ
    measurements [10]. A lack of standard measurement practices has affected the in
    situ estimation of LWD values. In this work, an in-house affordable, temperature-compensated
    LWS has been used, which has been reported in our earlier works [11]. It highlights
    the key features of the novel LWS. The IoT-based sensor system enables remote
    sensing of the field parameters; thus, the system would work autonomously. The
    source of leaf wetness could be a valuable insight for predicting diseases. It
    would help farmers identify the cause of leaf wetness and enable them to take
    instant preventive measures. In a remote setting, the output from LWS can be used
    to determine the cause of moisture on the surface of the leaves. As suggested
    in [44], dew, rainfall, or irrigation are the plausible sources of wetness on
    the leaf canopy. In this work, these three causes of leaf wetness have been accounted
    for dew, rainfall, and irrigation. The LWS used in this work generates a frequency
    output corresponding to the presence of water on the leaf surface [44]. If water
    is present on the surface, the frequency declines from the baseline level and
    ascends again once the surface is dry [11]. As mentioned, each event produces
    a different frequency output when subjected to dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Therefore, the pattern generated through the frequency output of the LWS provides
    critical insight for detecting the source of wetness on the surface of leaves.
    Pattern recognition is a famous classification and detection technique. It is
    a process wherein the machine tries to classify the data according to the information
    gained from the regu- varieties observed in different types of data. There are
    several applications of pattern recognition like speech recognition, object identification,
    and classification of medical and explosive signals [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],
    [18]. In this work, pattern recognition has been explored for LWS data wherein
    the data points correspond to either dew, rainfall, or irrigation. Syntactic,
    template matching, and statistical models are used for pattern recognition [19].
    The rising popularity of neural networks (NNs) for feature extraction has driven
    researchers to explore NNs for pattern recognition [20]. NN is capable of feature
    extraction from numerical, image, and text-based datasets. Multilayer perceptrons
    (MLPs) are fully connected NN used for pattern recognition [21], [22], [23]. A
    class of NN called convolutional NN (CNN) is widely used for image classification
    [24], [25], [26], [27]. Networks like VGGNet [28], AlexNet [29], and GoogLeNet
    [30] are famous CNN structures used for pattern recognition from image datasets.
    In this work, an ensemble model is proposed, which takes the numerical and image
    data for classifying the source of wetness (dew, rainfall, or irrigation) on the
    plant. Based on the sensor data, this article aims to classify the leaf wetness
    events in one of the three categories: dew, rainfall, or irrigation. LWS data
    plays a crucial role in determining the source of leaf wetness. While the sensor
    produces time-series data, significant information can be extracted from the patterns
    observed in the frequency domain. Therefore, the time-series data has been converted
    to image form using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and spectrogram representation.
    In addition to LWS, the disease prediction system uses other sensors like ambient
    temperature and relative humidity sensors [11]. These sensors monitor the environmental
    conditions. Rainfall and dew are natural phenomena and are characterized by distinct
    environmental conditions. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Sensors System
    and Field Deployment In this work, the LWS and IoT-enabled system have been used,
    which is reported in [11]. Fabricated LWS produces frequency output when subjected
    to the water molecule on its sensing surface. Further, for the temperature and
    humidity measurements, commercial sensors MCP 9710 and HIH 5030 are used, respectively.
    Subsequently, these sensors are interfaced with the in-house developed signal
    conditioning and processing circuits. The data collected from these sensors are
    uploaded to the ThingspeakTM server every 30 min. For the field measurement, fabricated
    LWS was deployed on the Mango tree at 45° angles, as shown in Fig. 1. Further,
    the field measurements are carried out for four months where approximately 5000
    data points are collected. Fig. 1. Deployment of the sensor on the leaves. Show
    All SECTION III. Data Preprocessing The primary focus is to prepare the data for
    classifying the source of wetness on the leaf, which can arise mainly due to dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. This involves feature extraction to identify leaf wetness
    events caused by dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Further, data labeling is done
    for both numerical and image data. Numerical attributes are standardized and fed
    into the MLP model and subsequently image data is transformed into spectrograms,
    which are fed into the CNN model. Data augmentation techniques are applied to
    enhance dataset size and diversity. These processes collectively aim to facilitate
    the accurate classification of leaf wetness events in a dataset comprising 392
    instances of dew, rainfall, and irrigation events, which helps reduce overfitting
    and improve model accuracy. A. Feature Extraction The main objective of this work
    is to determine the cause of leaf wetness by analyzing the patterns generated
    by an LWS. Three distinct events, namely dew, irrigation, and rainfall, can make
    leaves wet. To apply a classification algorithm effectively, it’s crucial to isolate
    and extract these individual wetness events and create training and testing datasets.
    This is achieved by identifying specific points at the start and end of each event
    using the find_peaks function from the sciPy library. This function detects the
    highest values in a 1-D signal within a specified height range. Fig. 2 represents
    the signal with starting and ending points marked using orange and green colors.
    The resulting signal is then divided into separate events, leading to the creation
    of a dataset comprising 98 leaf wetness events, each marked by distinct starting
    and ending points. Fig. 2. Leaf wetness events marked with points. Show All B.
    Data Labeling 1) Tabular Data: In this work, a hybrid model is trained using both
    numerical and image data. Numerical data comprise data from sensors like ambient
    temperature sensors, relative humidity sensors, and LWS. Each wetness event is
    numerically characterized by four features, namely, LWD value, average ambient
    temperature, average relative humidity, and maximum magnitude of frequency. Average
    temperature and humidity values are calculated for the duration of each event,
    and the maximum magnitude of frequency is obtained from the output of LWS. LWD
    values are extracted from the frequency response of LWS after smoothening the
    signal. The procedure followed for calculating LWD values has been reported in
    our previous work [11]. The numerical features corresponding to a single-leaf
    wetness event vary broadly in magnitude. To avoid bias due to differences in the
    range of magnitude during the training process, the features are normalized using
    Minmaxscaler function available in scikit-learn library [33]. After normalization,
    all features would lie within a range of 0–1, eliminating any bias due to their
    magnitude. 2) Image Data: The dataset comprise individual frequency output responses
    corresponding to a particular event. To make it suitable for training a machine
    learning model, it has to be classified appropriately with the cause of the wetness.
    Three possible events are responsible for wetness on the leaves’ surface: dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. For ease of classification, the signal is inverted about
    the y-axis, such that a rise in the magnitude of frequency above baseline frequency
    marks the events. This is denoted by ( ΔF ) as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Isolated
    events from the frequency response of leaf wetness sensor corresponding to (a)
    dew, (b) rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All In this work, the time-series
    numerical data from LWS is transformed into image format to leverage the 2-D CNN
    model. CNN is one of the most popular NNs for image classification due to its
    high accuracy [34]. The signal is converted into the frequency domain from the
    time domain using an STFT to convert the numerical data for LWS into image form.
    STFT captures the signal’s frequency components over a small window length of
    256, which is the function’s default size, and tracks them across the duration
    of the signal. STFT of the frequency output of LWS has been computed using the
    scipy library [32]. In doing so, an attempt is made to capture the salient features
    of the patterns observed in the sensor output. These patterns are observed when
    the sensor detects the presence of water on the surface. Fig. 4 represents the
    spectrograms of STFT of the LWS sensor signals. It is evident from the spectrograms,
    as depicted in Fig. 4 that the intensity of frequency components differs for the
    different categories of events viz., dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Therefore,
    these spectrograms could be used for training a CNN-based classification model.
    The images are resized and converted to binary to assist the edge-detection capacity
    of CNN. Fig. 4. STFT spectrograms of leaf wetness sensor data for (a) dew, (b)
    rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All The frequency magnitude is the first indicator
    of the possible event that could have caused leaf wetness [44]. Leaf wetness due
    to dew is characterized by a frequency output response with a maximum magnitude
    less than or equal to 4 kHz. Therefore, all events for which the rise in frequency
    ( ΔF ) is less than or equal to 4 kHz are labeled “Dew.” Out of 98 leaf wetness
    events and 13 events for Dew have been obtained. Apart from considering the magnitude
    of the frequency output of LWS, to differentiate between the events due to irrigation
    and rain, a second parameter, LWD has been used. The events with a maximum magnitude
    of frequency greater than 10 kHz or LWD more than 19 h have been labeled as “Rain.”
    Subsequently, the rest of the events were labeled as “Irrigation.” From the given
    signal, 48 events due to rain and 37 events due to irrigation has been observed.
    Fig. 3 shows five signals, each corresponding to the three natural phenomena discussed
    above. The magnitude on the y -axis is under the criteria used to classify the
    events in the appropriate categories. C. Data Augmentation Data augmentation is
    a crucial strategy to prevent overfitting in NNs due to limited data. This study
    is critical because leaf wetness events are uncontrollable. Techniques like horizontal
    flipping and adding random Gaussian noise are applied to image data while preserving
    original patterns. Numerical data are also augmented with Gaussian noise. After
    using these techniques, the dataset grows from 98 to 392 leaf wetness events,
    enhancing the dataset’s size and robustness for machine learning purposes. SECTION
    IV. Proposed Model for Classification In this work, artificial neural network
    (ANN) is an attractive choice because it ensembles NNs that can be built to deal
    with different types of data at the same time. In this work, NN is devolved that
    is capable of learning both numerical data and image data simultaneously. The
    sub-model trained to learn numerical data is an MLP and that trained using the
    image data is a CNN. The model proposed in this work, has been implemented using
    the tensorflow library [36]. A. Multilayer Perceptron MLP is a class of feed-forward
    NNs with fully connected layers. It comprises input and output layers connected
    between multiple hidden layers. In this work, the MLP is supplied by four input
    features—LWD values, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity, and
    maximum magnitude of frequency observed for the event. As mentioned, the three
    types of layers in MLP have neurons responsible for propagating the information
    to the following layer. Fig. 5 shows a descriptive diagram of an MLP (sub-model
    1). The input features are supplied to the input layer. In this work, four features
    are used namely, LWD value, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity,
    and maximum magnitude of frequency. Let the input vector be represented by X i
    for i∈[1,4] . The input is passed on to the hidden layer. The output of the ith
    neuron in the lth hidden layer of MLP, y m [l]i , is the weighted summation of
    its input provided from the preceding hidden layer. The process is called forward
    propagation, accomplished by the following equation [23]: y m [l])i =F( ∑ i=1
    n−1 w m [l]i . a m [l−1]i + b m [l]i ) (1) View Source where w m (l)i and b m
    (l)i are the weight and bias of the neuron, respectively, and a m (l−1)i is the
    activated neuron from the previous layer. The function F(x) is the activation
    function assigned to each layer. For the hidden layers, it is a linear function
    called rectified linear unit (ReLu). This function maximizes the speed of training
    due to less computation and avoids the vanishing gradient problem [37]. In case
    of the input layer a m [l−1]i is replaced with X i . The output vector of MLP
    (sub-model 1) is denoted by Y m . Fig. 5. Proposed model for leaf wetness events
    classification. Show All B. Convolutional Neural Network A CNN was implemented
    for training the image data due to its superior image classification performance.
    CNN models learn by identifying the edges of the images during the training process.
    The convolutional layer is composed of 2-D filters, i.e., kernels, traverse over
    the entire image depending on the size of the kernel. The kernel is a 2-D weight
    matrix. The layer performs convolution of the filter and overlapping input and
    extracts the features of the given image. CNN follows the same process of forward
    propagation, as described in MLP, to transfer the information through the network
    layers. However, in this case, the input images of spectrograms are convolved
    with the filters. It is a multiplication operation on the 2-D input matrices,
    i.e., image and kernel. The following equation defines the convolutional process
    [45]: y c [l]u,v =F( ∑ i=0 p−1 ∑ j=0 q−1 w c [l]i,j . a c (l−1)(u+i),(v+j) + b
    c [l]u,v ). (2) View Source y c (l)u,v is the output of the lth convolutional
    layer at the (u,v) position. The variables w c [l]i,j and a c [l−1](u+i),(v+j)
    are the kernel and input image, respectively. Here, the dimension of the kernel
    is (p×q) . The activation function, F(x) , for intermediate layers is ReLu [37].
    Furthermore, a max-pooling layer is used to prevent over-fitting. The data is
    down-sampled by replacing the output of the convolutional layer with the maximum
    value observed in a particular neighborhood. The MaxPooling2D layer from tensorflow
    implements the max-pooling function [36]. A window of size 3×3 with a stride of
    2 is employed. This operation reduces the dimensions of the data and makes the
    computation much more efficient. An additional layer was added to ensure an effective
    learning process called batchnormalization. The principal objective of this method
    is to normalize the input to the following layer. The batch normalization layer
    from the tensorflow library is added to the model to ensure that the inputs are
    normalized and smooth and that the learning does not suffer due to bias toward
    a specific input owing to nonuniform distribution. Y c denotes the output vector
    of CNN (sub-model 2). C. Training the Hybrid Model The main advantage of the dataset
    collected in this work is data availability from various sensors. While the pattern
    observed in the frequency output of LWS directly corresponds to identifying the
    event that caused wetness on the leaves, the other sensors measuring ambient temperature
    and relative humidity offer critical insights into the environmental conditions
    when the leaf wetness event occurred. These environmental factors could assist
    the model in making a decision. As discussed in Section III-A, the sensor data
    is preprocessed and organized in tabular format. The patterns observed in the
    LWS data are converted to images, as discussed in Section III-B. Fig. 5 illustrates
    the model used to predict the leaf wetness event. The tabular and image data are
    processed parallelly using the first two sub-models. Sub-model 1 is a multilayer
    perceptron described in Section IV-A. It has three hidden layers, each activated
    using a ReLu function. Sub-model 2 is a CNN, as Section IV-B describes, with two
    convolutional and max-pooling layers and a final batch-normalization layer. The
    convolutional layers are activated using the ReLu activation function. The output
    of the two sub-models is concatenated and provided as to the standard NN. The
    connected outcomes can be represented as C=[ Y m , Y c ] T . (3) View Source The
    input passes through the model via forward propagation as described in (1) and
    (2), depending on the sub-model. The two sub-models are responsible for feature
    extraction from the original data received from the sensors. The NNs are adept
    at feature extraction because of their densely connected structure [22]. The sub-model
    outputs are concatenated into a single vector and used further for training. The
    final sub-model denoted in Fig. 5 is responsible for the predictions. The outcome
    of the NN ensemble is obtained from the last layer of the final sub-model. It
    has three neurons corresponding to each leaf wetness event—dew, rainfall, and
    irrigation. The output is the probability of occurrence of the event based on
    the input features. This output is achieved by applying “softmax” as the activation
    function to the output layer [38]. The process finds the normalized exponential
    value for each class σ( c o )= e c o ∑ N j=1 e c j . (4) View Source In the above
    equation, c o is the output value of a neuron for a particular class. The exponential
    divided by the exponential of every neuron in the output layer. Thus, (4) calculates
    the probability of occurrence of one of the events. The model is trained by back-propagation.
    The method aims to minimize the cost function of the prediction by reassigning
    weights. The cost function chosen for training this model is “categorical cross-entropy”
    which is suitable for multiclass classification [38]. In the multiclass category,
    the events belong to only one of the possible classes. The following equation
    represents the loss function: Loss=− ∑ o=1 3 t o log( y o ) (5) View Source where
    t o is the class’s true value, and y o is the predicted probability from the output
    layer, which uses the softmax function. The model has been trained for 200 epochs
    with a batch size of 32 because of the small size of the dataset. This combination
    would converge to a loss value faster. The optimizer used is Adam because of its
    superior performance [39]. Fig. 5 shows the complete ensemble model used in this
    work. SECTION V. Result and Discussion A. Exploratory Data Analysis This section
    uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize data trends. A pie chart in
    Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of leaf wetness causes, showing that rainfall
    is the most common (about half of the events), followed by irrigation (37.8%)
    and dew (13.3%). The June to October 2021 study aligns with the monsoon season,
    explaining the prevalence of rain-induced leaf wetness. Fig. 6. Pie chart distribution
    of leaf wetness events. Show All B. Model Performance The experiments are conducted
    for various hidden layers and neurons, and it has been found that the best accuracy
    achieved is around 96.13% for the ensemble model. Both model sub-model 1 (MLP)
    and sub-model 2 (CNN) were combined with another NN (final sub-model). As a result,
    the hidden layers are changed and neurons in sub-model 1, sub-model 2, and the
    final sub-model. It has been found that the best layers and neurons are three
    layers and 30-24-16 neurons for sub-model 1, four layers, and 128-64-24-12 neurons
    for sub-model 2 and four layers and 30-24-16 neurons for the final sub-model.
    Table I displays a comparison of many models. The recommended model outperformed
    several techniques in Table I, with an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE I Comparison
    of Different Models As mentioned in Section IV-C, the ensemble model is trained
    for 200 epochs with a batch size of 32. Fig. 7(a) and (b) shows the training and
    validation accuracy and loss for the proposed model. In this work, the proposed
    model architecture learns from a combination of numerical data and image data.
    The MLP is responsible for learning the numerical tabular data, while the CNN
    learns the image data, as described in Section IV. Fig. 7(b) demonstrates the
    characteristic decline of the loss curve, which validates the learning process.
    The steady decline of the loss curve for validation data indicates learning and
    the absence of overfitting by the model. From Fig. 7(b), it can be observed that
    the ensemble model converges the fastest to the lowest loss value. Fig. 7. (a)
    Model accuracy, (b) cross-entropy loss, and (c) ROCs for dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Show All Fig. 7(c) shows the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). This curve
    gives information about the classification capability of the trained model. The
    45° reference line shown in Fig. 7(c) denotes a model incapable of differentiating
    between positive and negative outputs. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) graph
    is a point where the true positive rate (TPR) is 1 and the false positive rate
    (FPR) is 0. A good ROC curve is closer to the top left corner and away from the
    45° line. Fig. 7(c) shows three ROC curves, one for each of the classes- dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. The AUC is an insightful indicator of the model performance.
    AUC measures the model’s capability to differentiate between the classes. In this
    work, the AUC for dew, rainfall, and irrigation is 0.99, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively.
    The output layer of the NN ensemble described in Section IV uses softmax activation
    function which produces a probability of each possible outcome. These probabilities
    are converted to absolute values of 0 or 1, where 0 indicates negative output
    and 1 indicates a positive output. Further, the precision and recall have been
    calculated as tabulated in Table II. Precision is the fraction of predicted positive
    values, which are actually positive the following equation. On the other hand,
    recall is the fraction of actually positive values that have been correctly predicted
    the following equation [43]: Precision Recall = (True Positive) (True Positive+False
    Positive) = (True Positive) (True Positive+False Negative) . (6) (7) View Source
    TABLE II Evaluation Metrics for Classification of Dew, Rainfall, and Irrigation
    Table II gives the precision and recall values for all the events, along with
    the F1 score. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It measures
    the model’s performance, accounting for the trade-off between precision and recall.
    From Table III, it can be observed that the version of the model is suitable for
    all the events. Slightly less memory is observed for dew. However, it is due to
    the limited number of samples. The average value of the F1 score is 0.8396, which
    signifies a good balance between precision and recall. The significance of a high
    F1 score is that the model can correctly identify the positive data samples. Table
    III presents a comparison of various ensemble models across different applications.
    Researchers have employed the CNN-LSTM model for applications in medical, robotics,
    pedestrian navigation, and e-commerce, while the Darknet19-CNN-LSTM model has
    been utilized for computer vision tasks. In this work, the MLP-CNN model has been
    adopted for agricultural applications and achieved an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE
    III Comparison of Different Ensemble Models for Different Applications SECTION
    VI. Conclusion Agriculture plays a pivotal role in a country’s economy and methods
    to make it more efficient should be devised. In this work, with the motivation
    of reducing the cost of early plant disease prediction systems, the leaf wetness
    sensor is used to detect the LWS and also the source of wetness on the leaf canopy.
    For this purpose, the data is collected from LWS, ambient temperature sensor,
    and relative humidity sensor. The initial preprocessing and data engineering helped
    us create a dataset that could be used to train a machine-learning model capable
    of predicting the natural event responsible for leaf wetness. The sensors produced
    numerical time series data indicative of the three leaf wetness events- dew, rainfall,
    and irrigation. STFT is applied to the LWS data to obtain an image since the patterns
    obtained in the sensor output for different events are different. Further, an
    MLP-CNN model is built, which is capable of learning from tabular data as well
    as image data simultaneously. The MLP with numerical data produced a satisfactory
    accuracy of 92.86% while the CNN model with image data produced an accuracy of
    62.93% and the ensemble NN (MLP-CNN) classifier produced an accuracy of 96.13%.
    It has been observed that the final model classified the leaf wetness events with
    an average precision and recall of 0.84 and 0.85, respectively. Authors Figures

  description: Canopy temperature in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and other crops is
    related to crop and soil water status. Multiple approaches have been used to measure
    canopy temperature, depending on the application of the data and available technology.
    Recent technological advances have made it possible to map canopy temperature
    using thermal cameras onboard unmanned aerial systems (UAS) at fine spatiotemporal
    resolution. Using a highly accurate UAS-mounted infrared camera, the objective
    of this study was to determine relationships of in-season cotton canopy temperature
    with seed cotton yield and soil moisture. This was accomplished in a two-year
    field study (2019 and 2020) with three irrigation (0, 40, and 80% ET replacement)
    and eight cotton variety treatments. Four in-season UAS flights were made per
    year. Using the approach described herein, it was possible to accurately exclude
    soil background information in thermal infrared orthomosaics using a simple threshold
    method without the need for ancillary imagery. This allowed accurate determination
    of average canopy temperatures across plots. Differences in canopy temperature
    and seed cotton yields across irrigation levels were largely aligned and, when
    comparing cotton varieties, there was evidence that canopy temperature identified
    subtle varietal differences that were not reflected in varietal yield differences.
    Overall, there were linear relationships between canopy temperature and seed cotton
    yield that ranged from weak to strong (R2 = 0.39 – 0.72, RMSE = 249.7 – 299.2
    kg ha−1), depending on growing conditions. Canopy temperature was generally correlated
    with soil volumetric water content (VWC), but the relationship was not consistently
    strong and depended on moisture sensor depth.

    (VWC), but the relationship was not consistently strong and depended on moisture

    water content 1. Introduction Water-use efficiency and drought tolerance are key
    traits for crop improvement, especially as pressure on available water resources
    continues to increase and the climate becomes more unpredictable. Climate projections
    for the Southern Great Plains region of the United States, for example, indicate
    that conditions in the second half of the 21st century will be drier than the
    most arid times in the last millennium [1]. Increasing water efficiency in irrigated
    systems and leveraging data to improve irrigation management decisions is similarly
    important, but it is necessary to account for both spatial and temporal variability
    in soil moisture caused by factors such as soil texture and uneven irrigation
    application. While mapping soil physical characteristics has become simpler through
    technologies such as electromagnetic induction sensing [[2], [3], [4]], mapping
    soil moisture at both fine spatial and temporal resolutions during the growing
    season is less practical. However, canopy temperature is closely related to both
    crop and soil water status [5] and advances in technology have made it possible
    to map canopy temperature using thermal cameras onboard unmanned aerial systems
    (UAS) at fine spatiotemporal resolution. The main crop physiological process that
    drives variability in canopy temperature is transpiration. Water is pulled from
    the xylem into the leaf mesophyll, evaporates into the air spaces within the leaf,
    and then diffuses out of the leaf through the stomatal pores [6]. For water to
    be taken up by roots and transported through the xylem to leaves, plants must
    maintain a transpirational water potential gradient and turgor pressure within
    cells. Transpiration provides a cooling effect for plants via the evaporation
    of water from the leaf surfaces. Water deficit stress induces stomatal closure,
    which limits transpirational water loss and reduces evaporative cooling [7]. This
    causes leaf temperatures, and thus canopy temperature, to increase relative to
    an unstressed, actively transpiring plant. Water stress and heat stress together
    can increase canopy temperature substantially, which can cause many adverse reactions
    in the plant and limit production [6]. Researchers have shown that infrared thermography
    can be useful for precision agriculture and more specifically for precision irrigation
    management [8]. Spatial variability of canopy temperature is closely related to
    irrigation management practices, irrigation application uniformity, and more directly
    to water deficit within the effective rooting zone of plants [9,10]. Infrared
    thermography also has potential advantages over gas-exchange measurements in plant
    phenotyping studies where stomatal responses are important [11], as canopy temperature
    measurements are not labor intensive [12]. Canopy temperature has performed similarly
    to multispectral vegetation indices for grain and lint yield estimation in different
    crops [13,14]. Canopy temperature is also strongly correlated to traits such as
    water use efficiency and leaf water potential, and is used to derive indices of
    water stress such as the Crop Water Stress Index or CWSI [8]. Thermal imagery
    could also be applied for disease detection, mapping soil properties, tillage
    mapping, drainage tile mapping, crop maturity mapping, and leaf water potential
    mapping [15,16]. Crop canopy temperature data is currently derived using several
    approaches, some of which have limitations for use in precision agriculture management
    or cultivar development. Terrestrial thermal data from satellite platforms such
    as Landsat is freely available, for example, but the spatial and temporal resolutions
    (e.g. 100 m and 16 days for Landsat 8) are currently too coarse for use in irrigated
    agriculture at commercial scales or in plant breeding programs [10]. Researchers
    have endeavored to capture canopy temperature more frequently and accurately by
    placing infrared thermometers (IRTs) directly in the field, putting them on ground-based
    phenotyping systems, or mounting them onto center pivot and linear irrigation
    systems [[17], [18], [19], [20]]. Field-based IRTs have spatial limitations, they
    present logistical challenges in the field, and they are expensive, especially
    if a large number of sensors (or points of measurement) is needed. When IRTs are
    mounted on irrigation systems, the system must be in operation to map canopy temperature
    and the measurements are susceptible to the effects of soil background prior to
    canopy closure. Canopy temperature measurements by ground-based phenotyping systems
    can likewise be affected by ground temperature in certain circumstances and are
    limited by the need for navigation on the field. Canopy temperature and indices
    derived from thermal data can overestimate water stress due to the influence of
    much warmer soil temperatures combining with cool crop temperatures [17,10]. Measuring
    crop canopy temperature by infrared thermography via UAS can be used to overcome
    many of the challenges and limitations presented by other approaches. But infrared
    thermography captured by an aerial system has suffered from the adverse influence
    of soil background. This is especially true early in the growing season when canopy
    cover is low and in dryland production systems in which the canopy never completely
    covers the ground [[15], [21], [22], [23]]. Researchers have tried to address
    this issue by also measuring a multispectral vegetation index to account for canopy
    cover in modeling endeavors [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28]]. While this improved
    water deficit stress detection with thermal imagery, removing soil background
    altogether was identified early as the ideal solution [5]. Drew et al. [29] developed
    a method to isolate crop canopy from thermal images by using a visible camera
    to distinguish between soil background and crop canopy. This technique may be
    useful if certain thermal cameras are used that have an integrated color camera,
    but thermal infrared cameras with dedicated sensors alone are typically more sensitive
    to subtle variations in temperature and therefore can more accurately distinguish
    canopy and soil. Scientists have begun investigating machine learning for leveraging
    rich datasets captured from UAS, but few researchers use techniques such as support
    vector machines or random forests to detect crop water stress [30]. While UAS
    now enable the collection of thermal imagery at unprecedented spatial resolutions
    that are fine enough to allow removal of soil background, few have explored techniques
    to accomplish this in row-cropping systems without ancillary data sources. Literature
    exploring cotton yield estimation with thermal imagery is also sparse. Therefore,
    the objectives of this study were to: 1) evaluate unmanned aerial infrared thermography
    for detecting differences in crop water stress across irrigation regimes and cotton
    varieties; 2) explore the relationship between UAS-derived canopy temperature
    and cotton yield across irrigation regimes and cotton varieties; and 3) examine
    the relationship between soil moisture and UAS-derived canopy temperature. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Study site This experiment was conducted in 2019 and
    2020 on a subsurface drip irrigated field at the Texas A&M University research
    farm near College Station, TX (30.550° N, 96.436° W). The field was managed with
    conventional tillage during this period and for more than 10 years prior to beginning
    the project. Belk clay, which is a fine, mixed, active, thermic Entic Hapluderts,
    is the prevailing soil type at the site [31]. The slope of the field is less than
    1 percent. The climate classification is humid subtropical and average annual
    precipitation is 1018 mm [32]. Weather data was collected on-site from a weather
    station located directly adjacent to the study field. Daily averages were used
    in subsequent calculations. 2.2. Experimental design and cultural practices The
    experimental layout was a completely randomized 3 × 8 factorial design with four
    replications. The first factor was irrigation rate, managed as a percentage of
    estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) requirement, with three levels: 80% (irrigated),
    40% (deficit-irrigated), and 0% (dryland). Data logged by the on-site weather
    station was used to estimate ETc requirements based on the FAO-56 method described
    by Allen et al. [33] and the growth stage-based coefficients for cotton published
    by Ko et al. [34]. Cotton variety was the second factor. Eight commercially available
    varieties were planted per growing season in April into four-row plots with 1
    m row spacing that were 12 m in length. Cotton was planted at 129,000 seeds ha−1
    to ensure crop production and yield were not limited by plant population density
    [35]. Seedbeds were prepared in December or January for planting each season.
    Cultural practices were similar between the two growing seasons. Weed control
    strategies included pre-emergence herbicide and glyphosate applied over-the-top
    when needed. Urea-ammonium nitrate fertilizer (32-0-0) was band-applied via knives
    at squaring in 2019 and prior to planting in 2020. To limit rank growth in 2019,
    mepiquat chloride was applied at the labeled rate. Chemical defoliants were applied
    at the end of September when the cotton reached approximately 60% open boll. During
    the first week of October each season, the two center rows of the four-row plots
    were harvested with a 2-row spindle picker. The picker was retrofitted with a
    scale inside the basket to measure seed cotton yield mass. Cotton stalks were
    destroyed with a flail shredder following harvest, and the residue was later incorporated
    by means of vertical tillage. 2.3. Soil volumetric water content Soil volumetric
    water content (VWC) data was collected continuously for one cotton variety, NexGen
    5700, with time domain reflectometry sensors (Model CS655, Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT). The sensors were placed near the center of two replicate NexGen 5700
    plots for each irrigation treatment at 15 cm and 30 cm soil depths. The sensors
    were placed at these depths because plant soil water extraction was expected to
    be active in this zone [36]. The number of sensors that were deployed was few
    due to equipment limitations. These sensors were installed on June 7 in 2019 and
    June 8 in 2020 and connected to a Campbell CR1000x datalogger with a 1 min scan
    interval and 15 min average. Only the VWC measurements logged during each UAS
    flight were used for further analysis. The VWC data collected over each UAS flight
    period was averaged and regressed (simple linear regression) against average canopy
    temperature determined by UAS from the same time. The VWC sensors were removed
    from the field prior to chemical defoliation. 2.4. Unmanned aerial system and
    image acquisition An ICI 8640P thermal infrared camera (Infrared Cameras Incorporated,
    Beaumont, USA) was used in the study. This camera represents some of the most
    advanced and accurate thermal camera technologies currently available. The thermal
    camera was attached to a DJI Matrice 600 Pro hexacopter (SZ DJI Technology Company
    Limited, Shenzhen, China) on a Gremsy H3 gimbal (Gremsy, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam)
    to maintain nadir view during flight (Fig. 1). The ICI 8640P camera had a 640
    × 512 radiometric imager that produced 14-bit thermal imagery for the spectral
    range between 7 and 14 μm. The sensor is a microbolometer with a sensitivity of
    0.02 °C at 30 °C and requires less than a Watt of operating power. The camera,
    which has a 12.5 mm manual focus lens with 50° by 37.5° field of view, was focused
    by hand on the ground using a laser rangefinder to position a photogrammetric
    target at the appropriate distance (40 m). The focusing ring was permanently marked
    to ensure the camera was correctly focused prior to each flight. Using UgCS flight
    control software (UgCS Integrated Systems, Riga, Latvia), photogrammetry missions
    were flown at approximately 40 m above ground level (AGL) to produce a 5 cm ground
    sampling distance. Four flights were conducted in 2019 on July 9, July 25, August
    12, and August 22. Four flights were conducted in 2020 on July 3, July 16, August
    4, and August 18. Download : Download high-res image (551KB) Download : Download

    Incorporated 8640p thermal infrared camera attached to a Gremsy H3 gimbal. The
    gimbal mount includes a rubber damping system to isolate any vibration produced
    by the hexacopter. Temperature-controlled reference targets made of aluminum plates
    with dimensions of about 60 × 60 cm were prepared in the scene before each flight
    for calibration purposes [37,38]. One reference target was heated for the high
    temperature reference (50 °C), while the other was cooled to serve as the low
    temperature reference (20 °C). Temperature was measured with nine thermistors
    distributed evenly across each reference plate and average temperatures during
    the flight were used for calibration. Optimal weather, defined as sunny conditions
    and minimal wind between about 12:30 and 14:30 (near solar noon), were chosen
    for flight times to ensure the best possible image quality capture. Permanent
    ground control points were installed with concrete footers and surveyed using
    a Reach RS+ Global Navigation Satellite System receiver (Emlid Limited, Hong Kong,
    China) with Trimble VRS real-time kinematic corrections (Trimble Navigation Limited,
    Sunnyvale, USA). 2.5. Image processing and analysis After each flight, raw 16-bit
    TIFF images were exported using ICI proprietary software. Orthorectified mosaics
    were generated using structure from motion photogrammetry (Pix4D S.A., Prilly,
    Switzerland). As described in detail by Han et al. [37], the heated and cooled
    temperature reference targets were identified in the orthomosaics and paired with
    their measured temperatures to build a linear regression model relating the thermal
    image digital numbers to measured temperature references. The equation from this
    regression was used to apply a radiometric calibration to produce a final orthomosaic
    with surface temperature in degrees Celsius. A threshold temperature was then
    selected for each orthomosaic using the bimodal temperature data histogram of
    all temperatures within the orthomosaic. Canopy temperatures were separated from
    soil temperatures by identifying the minimum or trough centered between the two
    local maxima (peaks) in the bimodal distribution. All pixels above the temperature
    threshold, which essentially represented the maximum canopy temperature in the
    orthomosaic, were set to a null value using ArcMap (ESRI, Redlands, USA). To confirm
    the threshold was accurate, the new image was displayed over a natural-color composite
    to ensure it matched the canopy area. This effectively removed soil background
    data from the surface temperature mosaics. Finally, a single canopy temperature
    for each plot was derived by averaging the temperatures within the plot vector
    boundaries. Fig. 2 is a flow chart that outlines the entire generalized workflow.

    workflow. Cool temperatures are represented by blue colors, while red colors indicate
    warm temperatures. 2.6. Data analysis Linear regression analysis was conducted
    in R Studio [39] to examine the relationship between canopy temperature and yield,
    and between canopy temperature and soil moisture for eight UAS flight dates over
    the two-year study. All available canopy temperature data within each year was
    also analyzed with multiple regression using the R leaps package [40], which returned
    the model with the highest Adjusted R2 value. The exhaustive search method included
    all possible subsets and was configured to select a maximum of three predictors.
    Linear models were evaluated using R2, root mean squared error (RMSE), and normalized
    RMSE (NRMSE). The NRMSE was calculated by dividing RMSE by mean yield and multiplying
    by 100. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of yield and canopy temperature was conducted
    in R Studio. Post-hoc means comparisons were made using Tukey''s Honestly Significant
    Difference. In addition to the time of UAS flights, heat units were also calculated
    to account for seasonal weather variation and to provide a more universal and
    physiological basis for analysis. Daily heat units were calculated using on-site
    ambient temperature and the development threshold temperature of 15.6 °C [41]
    using the following equation: 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Isolation and measurement
    of crop canopy temperature Using the approach described herein, soil background
    information was accurately excluded in UAS-derived thermal infrared orthomosaics
    using a simple threshold method without the need for ancillary imagery. This allowed
    direct and accurate non-contact determination of average canopy temperatures.
    Fig. 3 illustrates the results of this approach through a canopy temperature image
    overlaid onto natural color composite. The image shows the high temperature resolution
    and georeferencing accuracy of the approach. This method allowed for comparison
    of irrigation and cotton variety treatments in this study and the approach could
    be used in a wide variety of other agricultural and non-ag applications also.

    treatment effects on canopy temperature There were differences in seed cotton
    yield among irrigation treatments in both 2019 and 2020 (Table 1). There were
    also differences in canopy temperature among irrigation treatments on all flight
    dates in both years. Pairwise statistical comparisons of canopy temperature largely
    matched yield results among irrigation treatments, with some exceptions during
    earlier flights (Table 2). In 2020 the irrigated and deficit-irrigated treatments
    were not different early in the growing season (3 July and 16 July) when less
    than 1000 heat units had accumulated. In 2019, the deficit-irrigated treatment
    was not different than either the irrigated or dryland treatments at 774 heat
    units (9 July) and the deficit-irrigated and dryland treatments were not different
    at 989 heat units (25 July). This was likely due to rainfall during the previous
    two weeks that largely negated the need for irrigation in the deficit-irrigated
    treatment. Canopy temperature always differed among irrigation treatments for
    the flights conducted later in the season in August, as early as 1154 heat units.
    The irrigated cotton always had the lowest mean canopy temperatures, the dryland
    treatment had the highest canopy temperatures, and the deficit irrigated temperatures
    were generally moderate. These trends were noticeable in canopy temperature plots
    separated by irrigation treatment for the flight on 4 August 2020 (Fig. 4). Table

    Box and whisker plot of canopy temperature separated by irrigation treatment on
    4 August 2020 or 1154 heat units. Interestingly, there were differences among
    cotton varieties in seed cotton yield in 2019 and not in 2020, while there were
    differences detected among varieties in canopy temperature in 2020 but not in
    2019 (Table 1). Because there were differences in canopy temperature in 2020,
    only that data is presented (Table 3). Pairwise means comparisons showed that
    several cotton varieties had different canopy temperatures at two flight dates,
    both in August, despite the lack of differences in final yield. Varieties with
    cooler canopy temperatures also generally had greater yields, though not statistically
    greater (Table 3). The incongruity between the two datasets could be the result
    of physiological adaptations of the cotton varieties that allowed recovery from
    water deficit or related heat stress while minimizing yield loss. When screening
    for traits related to drought tolerance, Thorp et al. [42] similarly found significant
    differences in crop water use efficiency estimates (yield divided by amount of
    water consumed) among varieties derived from UAS multispectral remote sensing
    and noted that incorporating canopy temperature could improve the methodology.
    Results suggest that canopy temperature could be used to target labor-intensive
    data collection efforts such as plant gas exchange measurements, which are sensitive
    to the severity of crop drought stress [43]. Table 3. Means and statistical results

    and canopy temperature There were strong negative linear relationships between
    canopy temperature and yield in 2019 and 2020 (Table 4). Cotton plots with cooler
    canopy temperatures had higher yields, while plots with hotter temperatures had
    reduced yields. The linear regression models with canopy temperature from a single
    flight date in each year had R2 values that ranged from 0.39 to 0.72 with a RMSE
    of 249.7 to 299.2 kg/ha. For example, data from 16 July 2020 or 897 heat units
    is shown in Fig. 5. Thompson et al. [44] and Adams et al. [17] found similarly
    strong relationships between cotton yield and canopy temperature across irrigation
    treatments measured with IRTs mounted on proximal phenotyping systems. The best
    subset multiple regression model in 2019 included canopy temperature at 774 heat
    units (July 9) and 1237 heat units (August 12) and had an adjusted R2 = 0.57 and
    RMSE of 372.7 kg/ha (NRMSE = 15.2%). The best subset multiple regression model
    for 2020 had an adjusted R2 = 0.72 and RMSE of 250.1 kg/ha (NRMSE = 19.2%) and
    included canopy temperature from 709 to 897 heat units (July 3 and July 16). Both
    best subsets models included two independent variables (i.e. canopy temperature
    from two dates). Using a similar multiple regression approach to estimate cotton
    yield using UAS data, Siegfried et al. [38] investigated integration of in-season
    thermal data with multispectral indices and a “Boll Area Index” that was measured
    at maturity. They demonstrated that stronger correlations and lower error could
    be achieved by integrating multiple data types (i.e. thermal, spectral indices,
    and pixel classification techniques) into the model compared to multiple instances
    (i.e. flight dates) of the same data type. Table 4. Simple linear and multiple

    relationship between canopy temperature and seed cotton yield on 16 July 2020
    or 897 heat units. Plots with cooler canopy temperatures tended to produce higher
    yields; conversely, plots with warmer temperatures tended to yield lower. While
    the error in the models based on only thermal is moderate, they are derived from
    data collected early enough in the growing season that crop management practices
    could be adjusted using the results in a commercial production setting. For example,
    UAS could be used to quickly gather canopy temperature data to assess the distribution
    of irrigation water through variable-rate irrigation systems. The approach could
    be used to identify issues with irrigation systems, such as clogged sprinkler
    emitters. It could be used to understand field characteristics, such as suboptimal
    terrain and drainage patterns, which could be used as part of cost-benefit analysis
    for weighing mitigation options. It could be used to assess the severity of water
    stress in systems applying deficit irrigation regimes. 3.4. Relationship between
    volumetric water content and canopy temperature Canopy temperature derived from
    the thermal orthomosaics generally had weak negative linear relationships or no
    relationship with VWC measured by in-field sensors. Presentation of the few significant
    results that were observed are given here in the text only. In 2019, the only
    significant relationship between VWC at 15 cm depth and canopy temperature occurred
    at 1237 heat units (August 12) (R2 = 0.5). However, the relationship between canopy
    temperature from the same date with VWC at 30 cm deep was much stronger (R2 =
    0.9). The VWC at 30 cm was weakly correlated with canopy temperature at 1390 heat
    units on August 22 (R2 = 0.37). Out of both years, August 12 in 2019 (1237 heat
    units) was the only image date for which soil VWC also had significant differences
    among irrigation treatments, which were observed at both 15 cm (P = 0.04) and
    30 cm (P = 0.007) depths. Soil VWC at 30 cm furthermore had a strong relationship
    with yield on the same date (R2 = 0.81). Ritchie et al. [36] reported that the
    quantity of roots at 30 cm depth and deeper was much greater than at 15 cm in
    the conditions of their study, so it follows that VWC at 30 cm could be more strongly
    related to canopy temperature. The 30 cm sensors were also closer to the depth
    of the subsurface drip irrigation tape, although Kamara et al. [45] previously
    noted that emitter depth of drip irrigation did not affect cotton root depth or
    distribution in the conditions of their study. In 2020, the relationship between
    canopy temperature and VWC was even weaker. There was a positive linear relationship
    (R2 = 0.48) between VWC at 15 cm and canopy temperature at 897 heat units on July
    3. There was limited range in VWC (0.37 to 0.46) across irrigation treatments
    on that date caused by 50 mm rainfall over the previous two weeks. This suggests
    that the model was not necessarily related to crop water stress and therefore
    the relationship was not meaningful. The relationship was negative at 1356 heat
    units on August 18 (R2 = 0.4) when the soil was drier and there was a greater
    range in VWC (0.24 to 0.42). There were not any other significant relationships
    at 15 cm soil depth. For VWC at 30 cm, there was only one significant relationship
    on July 3 (R2 = 0.47), which had a slightly positive regression coefficient. As
    the model did not have a negative slope as expected, this was not likely related
    to crop water stress. Results may have been clearer if tensiometers were used,
    as such measurements are tied more directly to plant water stress [46] than VWC
    and would be sensitive to the effects of soil physical properties such as texture
    [47]. However, thermal imagery could likely be paired with soil moisture tension
    data from wireless sensor networks to better quantify soil moisture and crop water
    status together. 4. Conclusions Using the approach described herein, it was possible
    to accurately exclude soil background information in UAS-derived thermal infrared
    orthomosaics using a simple threshold method without the need for ancillary imagery.
    This allowed direct and accurate non-contact determination of average canopy temperatures
    without field-based equipment. The canopy temperature data was largely aligned
    with yield data across irrigation treatments, while it appeared that canopy temperature
    identified more subtle differences between cotton varieties that were not reflected
    in yield differences. Overall, there were linear relationships between UAS-derived
    canopy temperature and seed cotton yield, which ranged from weak to strong depending
    on growing conditions. While canopy temperature was generally correlated with
    soil VWC, the relationship was not consistently strong. This suggests that single
    time point soil VWC measurements are not always representative of crop water status
    and should not be used alone, but rather incorporated into broader irrigation
    management strategies. For example, thermal imagery could potentially be calibrated
    using georeferenced wireless soil moisture sensor networks for timely, high-resolution
    maps of soil moisture and crop water status. Ethics statement Not applicable:

    Wireless fidelity 1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture - Population, Climate Change,
    Sustainability, and Globale market size Agriculture was one of humanity''s first
    endeavors, and it remains a mainstay of our civilization. It has changed greatly
    throughout time in order to fulfill the needs of an expanding global population,
    adjust to shifting climatic circumstances, and solve sustainability-related issues.
    The relationship between agriculture and important variables including population
    dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and the size of the global market has
    had a significant impact on the agricultural landscape. The agricultural sector
    needs to provide enough food to cope with the world''s ever-increasing population.
    Innovative agricultural technologies, such as advanced technologies and crop management
    systems, are needed to increase productivit. Due to the high population growth,
    the globe will need to produce more than 70 % of food by 2050 [1]. Moreover, agriculture
    is also at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Agricultural yields
    and livestock are under serious threat from the effects of global warming, manifested
    in variable weather patterns, high temperatures, and changing levels of precipitation.
    Farmers are increasingly exposed to the risks of climate change, which requires
    rigorous strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to maintain
    agricultural productivity [2], [3]. It has become crucial to strike a balance
    between the need to produce food and the need to safeguard the environment and
    conserve natural resources. Sustainable agricultural methods are becoming increasingly
    popular as they promote ecological stability and resilience. According to Dhanaraju
    et al. (2022) [4] sustainable agriculture is a farming technique that tries to
    satisfy the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of
    future generations to satisfy their own needs. It focuses on reducing the negative
    environmental consequences of agriculture while ensuring that farmers can maintain
    their livelihoods and provide healthful food. It may boost the economy of nearby
    towns and farms, support regional food systems, promote rural development, and
    provide jobs for rural areas [5]. Overall, sustainable agriculture is a vital
    method of farming that may assist to ensure future generations have access to
    food and a healthy environment [6], [7], [8]. In parallel, the interconnectedness
    of the agricultural industry worldwide makes international trade in goods and
    commodities possible. To make wise choices and improve the allocation of resources
    among farmers and agri-food businesses, we need to understand market size, demand
    trends, and trade dynamics. Additionally, in the upcoming years, the value of
    the worldwide smart agriculture market will significantly rise.The rising need
    for food, the requirement for sustainable farming methods, and the adoption of
    cutting-edge technology in the agriculture field are all factors contributing
    to the market''s expansion [9], [10]. 1.2. Application of IoT, Blockchain, Embedded
    electronics, Robotics, and Automation in smart agriculture The rapid development
    of technology in recent years has paved the way for creative solutions in a variety
    of industries, and agriculture is no exception. Modern farming practices have
    been changed by the integration of the latest technologies, such as the IoT, robotics,
    blockchain, embedded electronics, and automation, giving rise to the idea of smart
    farming. This new paradigm involves the intelligent application of data-driven
    technology to improve the productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural
    methods. Smart agriculture will require the integration of new technologies like
    the IoT in order to gain a substantial competitive advantage. To meet the demands
    of the growing population, agricultural output must be raised [11], [12]. IoT
    is improving farming methods by providing connectivity and intelligence through
    automated irrigation systems and intelligent livestock monitoring. So that the
    agricultural sector will benefit from important advantages such as improving operational
    efficiency, reducing cost and waste, and improving crop quality thanks to intelligent
    agriculture based on the blockchain and IoT [13], [14], [15]. The agricultural
    supply chain is transparent and traceable thanks to blockchain technology. Immutable
    records boost consumer and stakeholder confidence by confirming the provenance
    of products and facilitating interactions between farmers and buyers. Smart agriculture
    also has a connection to the utilization of digital technologies, including embedded
    electronics, robotics, and automation [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Embedded electronics
    are crucial for smart agricultural equipment and gadgets. IoT is reinforced by
    robotics, which automates operations such as planting and harvesting to increase
    production and reduce manual labor. Automation driven by real-time data improves
    yields and optimizes the use of resources while reducing errors in farming practices.
    This technology seeks to simplify operations and improve productivity and decision-making.
    An agricultural control system known as “smart farming” offers a thorough approach
    to dealing with the geographical and temporal variability of soils and crops in
    order to enhance product quality, and boost profitability [21], [22]. 1.3. Application
    of sensors in smart agriculture and focus of this work Through the use of real-time
    data in smart agriculture, made possible by sensor technology, agricultural yields
    can be increased, costs can be cut, and there is less environmental harm. By acquiring
    data on a range of environmental factors, including nutrients, soil moisture,
    temperature, and others, farmers may make decisions about irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [23], [24]. Thanks to smart agriculture, farmers can continuously
    monitor crop growth and environmental conditions, anticipate potential problems,
    and take quick action in reaction to changes. This approach, which promotes efficient
    and environmentally friendly farming methods, is essential in light of climate
    change and other environmental problems. The application of sensor technology
    in agriculture is anticipated to have a substantial influence on future food production
    [25]. Every element of conventional agricultural operations has been significantly
    improved by the integration of cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology. Currently,
    smart agriculture has the potential to advance agriculture to previously unthinkable
    levels by seamlessly integrating wireless sensors and the IoT [26], [27], [28].

    IoT architecture for smart agriculture The perception, network, cloud, and application
    layers of an IoT architecture for smart agriculture, as shown in Fig. 5, form
    the foundation of smart farming. These integrated layers enable seamless user
    engagement, efficient data collection, secure transmission, reliable storage,
    and intelligent analysis while improving system performance. Agricultural practices
    reach new heights with the use of IoT architecture, enabling optimal and sustainable
    procedures that boost production and resource management. 1) Perception or Sensing
    and Actuator Layer: This layer includes the placement of sensors and actuators
    in the real environment in order to collect and transmit data to the IoT system.
    The actuators manage numerous operations, such as irrigation and fertilizer, while
    the sensors detect many factors, including soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    light, soil ph, soil conductivity, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) soil,
    etc… [39], [40], [41], [42], [44], [45]. 2) Network Layer: This layer facilitates

    All things considered, the four-layer IoT architecture for smart agriculture offers
    a reliable and scalable foundation for gathering, processing, and analyzing data
    to enhance farming operations [46], [47], [48]. Farmers may increase efficiency,
    production, and sustainability by utilizing IoT technology, which will enhance
    food security and make the agriculture industry more sustainable. 3. IoT application
    in smart agriculture The IoT has made smart agriculture, which is the most significant
    area for innovation in contemporary agriculture, conceivable. The combination
    of sensors, IoT, and data analytics technologies allows for real-time monitoring
    and management of farming activities, which helps to maximize resource utilization
    and increase crop yields. This section examines some of the most important IoT
    applications in smart agriculture, with a particular emphasis on 1) irrigation
    monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4)
    monitoring (yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing monitoring), forecasting,
    and harvesting, 5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. IoT technology
    has the potential to change the farming sector through these applications, fostering
    more effective, and sustainable agricultural methods. 3.1. Irrigation monitoring
    system smart irrigation based on IoT is a cutting-edge technology that automates
    and improves irrigation systems by harnessing the power of the IoT. This system
    reduces waste and conserves water resources while ensuring that gardens, lawns,
    and crops receive the proper quantity of water. Sensors, controls, and cloud-based
    software are used in smart irrigation systems to gather real-time data on plant
    water needs, weather, and soil moisture. Using this knowledge, irrigation plans,
    water flow rates, and other variables are modified to ensure that plants receive
    enough water when required [49], [50], [51], [45], [52], [53], [54]. These systems
    may be used in a variety of contexts, including landscaping for homes and businesses,
    golf courses, and agriculture. Reduced water waste, enhanced plant health, higher
    efficiency, and cheaper costs are all advantages of smart irrigation systems [55],
    [56]. By doing away with manual watering, users of smart irrigation systems may
    save time and money. They are the best option for anybody looking to install a
    more ecologically friendly and economical irrigation system since they allow users
    to preserve water resources while enhancing plant health and production [57],
    [58], [59], [60]. 3.2. Fertilizer administration Administration of fertilizers
    based in the realm of smart agriculture, IoT is a crucial application that makes
    use of IoT technology to maximize the usage of fertilizers. With the help of this
    application, farmers will be able to get up-to-the-minute information on the state
    of their soil and its nutrient content, which they can use to modify how much
    and what kind of fertilizer they apply to their crops [61], [63], [65], [67].
    Employing a variety of sensors, like the NPK sensors, temperature sensors, soil
    moisture sensors, and humidity sensors, farmers can determine when and how much
    fertilizer is required for their crops, resulting in more efficient and effective
    crop growth and development [62], [64]. Increased agricultural yields are one
    of the main benifits of IoT-enabled fertilizer administration [65]. Farmers may
    optimize the usage of fertilizers, which can result in better crop growth and
    development, by employing IoT sensors to monitor soil conditions and nutrient
    levels [63], [66]. For instance, NPK sensors may help farmers determine the right
    amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium needed for their crops [62], [64],
    [67], [69]. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth [62]. Farmers may change
    the type and amount of fertilizer applied by using real-time data on nutrient
    levels, which increases crop yields and improves crop quality [62], [63], [68].
    The decrease in fertilizer waste and associated costs is another advantage of
    IoT-based fertilizer management. IoT-based fertilizer administration can increase
    fertilizer application accuracy and precision in addition to optimizing fertilizer
    consumption and cutting waste [61], [62], [63], [70]. Overall, IoT-based fertilizer
    administration is a critical smart agricultural application that may support more
    productive and efficient farming methods. This technology lets farmers to utilize
    fertilizers more intelligently by giving them real-time data on nutrient levels
    and soil conditions. Higher agricultural yields, improved crop quality, and less
    environmental impact are the outcomes of this. 3.3. Crop diseases detection Controlling
    crop diseases is an essential part of contemporary agriculture. Illnesses may
    drastically lower agricultural production, costing farmers money and jeopardizing
    the world''s food supply [71]. The overuse of pesticides and other chemicals can
    also have negative environmental impacts, such as polluting water supplies and
    upsetting natural ecosystems [72]. Fortunately, improvements in IoT technology
    are opening up fresh possibilities to tackle these problems. In the field, IoT
    and sensors may be used to monitor crop health in real-time and spot early symptoms
    of disease or insect infestation. These sensors may gather information on a variety
    of environmental and biological elements, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, and plant development patterns, that have an impact on crop health [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77]. The prevention of disease propagation and the reduction
    of pests'' negative effects on crop yields are made possible by the use of sensors
    and IoT in agricultural disease and pest control [76], [78], [79]. Additionally,
    IoT technology supports data-driven decision-making for pest and agricultural
    disease management [73]. By analyzing data received from sensors and other sources,
    farmers may learn about the effectiveness of their pest management strategies
    and make adjustments to their operations. By evaluating the data produced by IoT
    and sensors using ML and other data analytics technologies, farmers may identify
    patterns and trends in crop health and choose efficient pest management strategies
    [73], [80]. In terms of intelligent agriculture, the application of IoT and sensors
    for pest management marks a significant achievement. IoT technology provides more
    precise and sustainable pest management procedures, minimizing the use of toxic
    chemicals and fostering a more effective and environmentally friendly agriculture
    sector by giving farmers real-time data on crop health and insect activity. 3.4.
    Monitoring, forecasting and harvesting Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting and harvesting are crucial aspects
    of smart farming that are increasingly using IoT technology to their advantage..
    In the field, IoT and sensors may be used to gather information on a variety of
    elements that influence agricultural yields, including temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and plant development patterns [61]. In order to estimate future
    harvests and get real-time insights on agricultural yields, this data may then
    be evaluated using new technologies [81], [82], [83], [84]. Real-time agricultural
    yield monitoring enables farmers to spot failing farms and make necessary adjustments
    to increase yields. IoT sensors may also offer information on the efficacy of
    various farming techniques, enabling farmers to adjust their plans for optimal
    output. The use of IoT in smart agriculture has the potential to transform the
    sector and solve pressing problems. IoT may have a significant positive impact
    in several crucial areas, including quality, processing, and logistical monitoring,
    predicting, and harvesting. Product compliance is ensured through quality control,
    while IoT sensors assist improve elements like soil condition. IoT-powered cameras
    are used for processing monitoring to guarantee constant product quality. Transportation
    efficiency is improved by using IoT devices like trackers for logistic monitoring.
    Another area where IoT technology might be quite helpful in crop forecasting[85].
    Farmers may employ machine learning algorithms to anticipate future harvests by
    examining previous data on crop yields and climatic variables. IoT and sensors
    may be utilized to increase productivity and reduce waste during the harvesting
    process [81], [83], [84]. In general, smart agriculture has advanced significantly
    with the use of IoT technologies for Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting, and harvesting. IoT technology
    provides more efficient and effective agricultural methods, leading to better
    yields, decreased waste, and increased sustainability by giving farmers real-time
    data on crop yields and anticipated harvests. 3.5. Climate conditions monitoring
    Smart farming is greatly impacted by the weather. Due to climate changes, agricultural
    produce''s quality and quantity may be impacted. Alternatively, farmers may place
    sensors like water level, humidity, and temperature sensors in the sector using
    the IoT as a way to gather real-time environmental data [86], [87], [88], [89].
    In contemporary agriculture, it is normal practice to utilize sensors to keep
    an eye on the health of crops and the environment in which they are growing. These
    sensors are essential for capturing real-time data, giving farmers insightful
    information, and assisting them in making decisions regarding their agricultural
    methods [86]. When a potentially hazardous environmental problem is discovered,
    it is either automatically fixed or a notice is provided to the farmer advising
    them to act quickly to avoid agricultural losses [88], [90]. 3.6. Fire detection
    Fire detection is a significant IoT application in smart agriculture. Farmers
    may employ IoT devices to monitor potential fire dangers in their crops and forests
    [91], [92], [97]. These sensors are able to detect changes in flame as well as
    the presence of smoke and other fire-related indicators [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [98], [99], [100], [101]. The IoT system may warn the farmer and/or the neighborhood
    fire department if a fire is found, enabling them to act immediately and stop
    the fire from spreading. IoT fire detection systems can monitor controlled burns,
    which are frequently used in agriculture to manage land and encourage new development,
    in addition to preventing fires from starting in the first place. These fires
    may be carried out safely and successfully by using IoT sensors to monitor the
    smoke and other parameters [93], [94]. In general, adding fire detection to IoT
    systems in smart agriculture may aid farmers in safeguarding their land, crops,
    and animals as well as avoiding harm to neighboring populations and natural resources
    [92]. 4. Sensors for smart agriculture The way we grow our food might be completely
    changed by the introduction of the IoT and sensors in the agricultural sector.
    With the use of these technologies, farmers can gather and evaluate data in real-time
    on a range of environmental elements that impact crops, including temperature,
    wind speed, soil moisture, smoke, flame, etc. Farmers can monitor the health of
    their crops, spot fields that require more attention, and decide when to sow,
    irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops by employing smart agriculture sensors.
    As a result, there may be more production and efficiency, less waste, and less
    negative environmental effect. For instance, farmers may plan when to irrigate
    their crops using soil moisture monitors, only applying water when it is required.
    In addition to saving water and money, this can avoid overwatering, which can
    cause soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Similarly to this, farmers may employ
    targeted treatments just where they are required by utilizing sensors to track
    soil quality and nutrient levels. This reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers
    while supporting sustainable agricultural methods. The majority of sensors widely
    used in smart agriculture are shown in Table. 2 name of sensors in column 1, sensor
    application type of data collect and description in column 2. Finaly type of data
    collect and description in column 3. Table 2. Agricultural sensors: Sensor application,
    type of data collecting and description. Sensor name Sensor application Type of
    data collect and description Soil NPK Sensor Fertilizer Administration. Determines
    the concentration of potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen in the soil to aid in
    fertilization. Using soil NPK sensors to track changes in soil nutrient levels
    over time, growers may adjust fertilizer application rates and timing. The application
    of soil NPK sensors can reduce fertilizer waste, enhance crop productivity and
    quality, and prevent nutrient runoff into nearby rivers [66]. Soil Moisture Sensor
    Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Forecasting and Harvesting. Measures the amount
    of water in the soil to determine when and how much to irrigate. These sensors
    may be positioned at various soil depths to monitor the water availability at
    varying depths. Soil moisture sensors can aid in crop growth optimization, water
    conservation, and avoiding overwatering, which can result in nutrient loss and
    soil erosion [19], [102]. Nitrate Sensor Fertilizer Administration, Crop Disease
    Detection. Determines the nitrate content of the soil to aid in fertilizer application.
    Growers may alter fertilizer application rates and timing by using nitrate sensors
    to monitor changes in soil nitrogen levels over time. In addition to improving
    crop output and quality, nitrate sensors can assist minimize nitrogen runoff into
    surrounding waterways and decrease fertilizer waste [67], [104]. Soil pH Sensor
    Fertilizer Administration, Crop Disease Detection. Determines the soil''s pH level,
    which can aid in enhancing plant nutrient absorption. Growers may modify soil
    amendments and fertilizer application rates by using soil pH sensors to monitor
    variations in soil acidity over time. The use of soil pH sensors can improve crop
    production and quality, reduce nutrient deficits and toxicities, and stop soil
    acidification over time [104]. Electrical Conductivity Sensor Fertilizer Administration,
    Quality Monitoring. Determines the electrical conductivity of water or soil, which
    may be used to check salt and nutrient levels. Adjusting irrigation procedures
    and preventing salt accumulation in soils may both be accomplished with electrical
    conductivity sensors [105]. CO2 Sensor Quality Monitoring, Processing Monitoring,
    Climate Conditions Monitoring. Measures the quantity of carbon dioxide in the
    air, which may be used to keep track of plant development and respiration. Growing
    conditions may be improved by adjusting ventilation and lighting systems, which
    can be done with the use of CO2 sensors, which can track changes in CO2 levels
    over time. By adjusting ventilation and illumination as necessary, CO2 sensors
    can assist minimize CO2 buildup, which can result in decreased plant growth and
    productivity. They can also aid in lowering energy use [98]. Temperature and Humidity
    Sensor Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Quality Monitoring, Processing Monitoring,
    Forecasting and Harvesting, Climate Conditions Monitoring. Monitors environmental
    conditions by taking air temperature and humidity measurements. Extreme temperature
    ranges, high humidity levels, and other environmental variables that may affect
    plant growth and development may all be found with these sensors. Sensors for
    temperature and humidity can be placed in a variety of places, such as outside
    weather stations or within greenhouses. These sensors can aid in improving growth
    conditions, guarding against pests and disease, and lowering energy expenditures
    [98]. Sensor name Sensor application Type of data collect and description Light
    Sensor Quality Monitoring, Climate Conditions Monitoring. Measures the amount
    of light that plants receive, which can aid in maximizing growth and output. These
    sensors can measure the amount of light in different parts of a greenhouse or
    field and may be used to modify lighting or shade arrangements to improve growing
    conditions. By decreasing illumination or shading as necessary, light sensors
    may assist producers in producing high-quality crops with optimal yield and quality
    while also reducing energy use [106]. Weather Station Logistics Monitoring, Forecasting
    and Harvesting. Gathers information on the wind''s direction and speed, the amount
    of rain that has fallen, the barometric pressure, and other weather-related data
    that may be used by farmers to make choices about planting, harvesting, and other
    agricultural tasks. With the use of these sensors, producers can foresee weather-related
    hazards and improve crop management techniques by tracking weather trends over
    time. Weather stations can be set up on a farm or in a particular area and used
    to track regional weather patterns and microclimates [103]. Water Level Sensor
    Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Logistics Monitoring. The level of water in a tank,
    pond, or other body of water can be determined with a water level sensor. In order
    to monitor the water levels in irrigation systems and other bodies of water, water
    level sensors are frequently employed in agriculture [19]. Livestock Sensor Logistics
    Monitoring. Observes the health and conduct of cattle, which can aid in disease
    prevention and maximize output. Animal activity, body temperature, and eating
    habits may all be monitored with livestock sensors, among other parameters. These
    sensors can aid in improving feeding and breeding procedures, reducing animal
    stress, and promoting animal welfare [15]. Plant Disease Sensor Crop Disease Detection
    Analyzes plant tissue or soil samples to look for plant diseases. Plant disease
    sensors can be used to keep an eye out for illness in crops and assist producers
    in taking steps to stop its spread or potential harm [107]. Smoke Sensor Fire
    Detection The smoke sensor calculates how many smoke particles are present in
    the air at any one time, which may signal the existence of a fire. The sensor
    alerts the smart agricultural system when smoke particles are found so that it
    may take the necessary precautions to stop the fire from spreading [99], [100].
    Flame Sensor Fire Detection Using infrared light emission, the flame sensor locates
    fires. The sensor can recognize the infrared radiation that a flame releases when
    it is present. The sensor alerts the smart agricultural system when a flame is
    found so that it may take the necessary steps to stop the fire from spreading
    [99], [100]. Flexible sensor Yield Monitoring. An advanced, flexible, wearable
    sensor called the plant and food quality monitor was created specifically to track
    the quality of plants, fruits, and food. Real-time data collection is made possible
    by its soft and versatile shape, which makes it easy to install easily on the
    surface of various food items and plants without causing any damage [108]. In
    addition, as the world''s population continues to expand, IoT and smart agricultural
    sensors can assist farmers in meeting the rising food demand. Farmers may boost
    productivity while decreasing expenses and environmental effects by implementing
    these technologies. On the other hand, wave-based technologies are rapidly being
    used in industrial applications and smart sensors, due to their efficiency in
    analyzing and processing complex signals [109], [110], [111]. Together, these
    studies highlight the variety of applications for wavelet-based signal processing,
    from denoising and analysis in industrial environments to applications for smart
    sensors and machine learning. Given their versatility and efficiency in processing
    complex signals, wavelet methods are increasingly used in a variety of fields
    as useful tools for industrial processes and current sensor technology. Overall,
    the application of IoT and smart agriculture sensors in the agricultural business
    has the potential to alter the way we grow our food. These technologies can boost
    production and efficiency, and support sustainable farming methods by letting
    farmers gather and evaluate real-time data on numerous environmental conditions.
    This will be essential for supplying the world''s growing population with food
    in the future. 5. The benefits and challenge of IoT in agricultural 5.1. Benefits
    IoT application in agriculture, as in other sectors, provides previously unavailable
    efficiency, resource savings, cost, automation, and data-driven operations. IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture offers a number of noteworthy benefits, including superior efficiency,
    expansion, reduced resources, cleaner method, agility, and also product quality
    improvement. Numerous research papers have looked into the advantages of implementing
    the IoT in intelligent agriculture [30], [60], [112], [113]. As shown in Fig.
    6, the six benefits of the IoT in agriculture, we will discuss each benefit separately
    following: 1) Superior efficiency: Today''s agriculture is competitive. Farmers
    must produce more despite unfavorable soil conditions, diminishing land availability,
    and rising weather whims. Farmers can track their fields and environmental conditions
    in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can generate ideas rapidly,
    foresee issues before they happen, and determine how to avoid them by employing
    information. IoT solutions for agriculture are also introducing automation, including
    irrigation, fertilization, automated harvesting, etc. 2) Expansion: By the next
    several years, there will be 9 billion people on the planet, with 70 % of them
    living in cities. Thanks to systems based on the IoT, especially systems that
    provide food supply chains, these people can be supplied with vegetables and fruits.
    It is now feasible to grow food practically everywhere, even on walls and roofs,
    in shipping containers, and inside everyone''s houses, thanks to intelligent closed-cycle
    farming systems. 3) Reduced resources: A lot of IoT solutions for agriculture
    are built to maximize the use of resources like electricity, water, and land.
    With the help of data gathered from numerous field sensors, IoT-based precision
    farming helps farmers to accurately distribute the proper quantity of resources.
    4) Cleaner method: Smart agriculture that supports the IoT is an effective way
    to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Intelligent farming helps farmers
    save water, energy, and the environment while drastically reducing the usage of
    pesticides and fertilizers. Compared to conventional agricultural methods, this
    technique enables the production of a cleaner end product to be produced. 5) Agility:
    IoT use in agriculture has the benefit of accelerating a number of processes.
    Farmers can quickly react to significant changes in weather, humidity levels,
    air quality, fires, and the state of specific crops and soil in the field thanks
    to real-time monitoring and forecasting systems. With the use of this technology,
    agricultural personnel may now save crops in the case of extreme weather or fires.
    6) Product quality improvement: The use of sensors and the IoT in agriculture
    improves and raises agricultural output. Crop sensors, drone-based overhead surveillance,
    and farm mapping are tools that farmers may use to better understand the intricate
    relationships between crop quality and the environment. They may duplicate ideal
    circumstances and improve the nutritional value of their crops by using linked
    systems.. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download full-size

    few decades, there have been enormous technology improvements that have impacted
    our everyday lives. By placing resources at our fingertips, we are credited with
    improving the convenience of our lives. Smart sensors collect real-time data and
    establish connections with each other or the internet to initiate required actions.
    IoT has successfully captivated a vast audience due to the numerous ongoing innovations.
    However, the adoption of IoT technology brings both advantages and challenges.
    The difficulties of using the IoT in smart agriculture have been covered in several
    research [29], [30], [32], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Despite the IoT''s development
    over the past two decades, significant conceptual, structural, and problems remain.
    Fig. 7 depicts the most important challenges to implementing the IoT in agriculture,
    like 1) superior efficiency, 2) cost and standardization, 3) heterogeneity and
    accessibility, 4) adaptability and energy optimization, 5) compatibility and reliability,
    6) mobility and environmental conditions.Here are the most pressing immediate
    problems of the IoTs: 1) Superior efficiency: Agriculture is nowadays a race.
    Despite poor soil conditions, dwindling availability of land, and increased vagaries
    of weather, farmers must produce more. Farmers can monitor their products and
    environmental conditions in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can
    quickly get ideas, anticipate problems before they arise, and decide how to prevent
    them from using knowledge. Automation is also being introduced by IoT solutions
    in agriculture, such as demand-based irrigation, fertilization, and automated
    harvesting. 2) Cost and Standardization: Due to regional economic disparities,
    creating a cost-effective strategy for IoT installations in agriculture is difficult.
    Economic models must be developed to control setup and operational expenses, which
    include the price of IoT devices, recurring subscriptions, data processing, maintenance,
    and energy. For devices, applications, systems, and products to function properly
    together, standardization is essential. Interoperability is challenging to achieve,
    though, because diverse IoT devices lack standardized formats and protocols. To
    enable the success of IoT implementations, interoperability is therefore required
    at the organizational, technological, semantic, and conceptual levels. 3) Heterogeneity
    and Accessibility: System design makes use of heterogeneous devices. Each gadget
    has a different set of operational and maintenance needs. Since the majority of
    models in agriculture use heterogeneous equipment, it is essential to create a
    connection between communication technologies and heterogeneous modules. The network
    becomes increasingly complex due to heterogeneity, which might occasionally result
    in the appearance of falsified results. Any IoT-based or other device-based farming
    decision support system must be built with the assumption that current software
    and hardware are always available everywhere. These problems must be fixed in
    order to ensure that services are available whenever and wherever they are needed.
    A lack of the required tools may result in chaos and service delays. 4) Adaptability
    and Energy Optimization: For smart farming, it is important that the devices are
    able to adapt to other devices in addition to the environment. Some hardware is
    incompatible with one another owing to the environment''s continually changing,
    as well as occasionally because of particular hardware or connection concerns.
    The most recent problem with communication devices, and other IoT is energy. Up
    until now, the designing and operating models have been supported by traditional
    sources of energy. However, with more gadgets on the market, using traditional
    energy is no longer a viable option. Aside from testing unconventional energy
    sources like solar, wind, and water energy harvesting plans, which haven''t had
    much success, new approaches also need to be developed. 5) Compatibility and reliability:
    The produced models or software should be adaptable and scalable in order to comply
    with the criteria of fragmentation and scalability. Reliability is a vital issue
    for IoT devices to effectively and seamlessly transmit data. The devices must
    collect and communicate accurate data since judgments are made utilizing the information
    that has been received and analyzed. Due to system failures, node failures, battery
    problems, and other interventions, reliability is still a difficulty. 6) Mobility
    and Environmental Conditions: The generated systems or models are often static.
    Because most devices and applications are portable, mobility is essential for
    the framework''s efficient implementation. The challenge of sustaining connectivity
    still exists in mobile models. Agricultural landscapes come in a variety. As a
    result, it becomes challenging to respond to those changes, which puts data and
    services at risk. This modifies a system''s accuracy. Download : Download high-res

    in agriculture. 6. Conclusion and perspective In conclusion, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) and sensor technology, then, provide significant potential for enhancing
    food security and sustainable agricultural methods. In addition to presenting
    four layers of the IoT architecture for smart agriculture, including the perception
    or sensing and actuator layer, the network layer, the cloud layer, and the application
    layer, this study also offers insights into the size of the global market for
    smart agriculture in the years 2021 to 2030. This review paper addressed the current
    state of IoT and sensor technologies for agriculture, as well as some of their
    potential applications, such as 1) irrigation monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer
    administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4) monitoring (yield monitoring, quality
    monitoring, processing monitoring, logistic monotoring), forecasting, and harvesting,
    5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. A variety of sensors
    for agriculture are also included in this study, including those that can detect
    soil NPK, moisture, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, CO2, temperature, humidity,
    light, weather station, water level, livestock, plant disease, smoke, flame, and
    flexible wearable. The advantages of IoT in smart agriculture are also highlighted,
    particularly in terms of of superior efficiency, expansion, reduced resources,
    cleaner method, agility, and product quality improvement. However, there are still
    problems that must be fixed before IoT technology can be employed in agriculture,
    which is what this study has discussed. further offer hints on potential future
    study avenues. Future readers and scholars will benefit from this study''s insights
    into the current status of academic accomplishment in this field. Agriculture
    has the potential to be revolutionized by the development and application of IoT
    and sensor technologies, enabling more sustainable and effective food production.
    The need for food will rise as the world''s population expands, and the agriculture
    industry must come up with novel solutions to fulfill this demand while preserving
    sustainability. IoT and sensors, which provide real-time monitoring and management
    of crops, soil, and environment, present a possible answer to these problems.
    However for them to be widely used and implemented, a lot of money must be spent
    on infrastructure, training, and research. To encourage the use of IoT and sensor
    technologies in agriculture and to address the difficulties facing the industry,
    governments, private sector players, and other stakeholders should work together
    to establish policies and strategies. The development of sustainable and effective
    agricultural techniques that can fulfill the requirements of a rising population
    while protecting the environment for future generations, as well as the successful
    integration of IoT and sensor technologies, are key to the future of smart agriculture.

  description: Sensor data and agro-hydrological modeling have been combined to improve
    irrigation management. Crop water models simulating crop growth and production
    in response to the soil-water environment need to be parsimonious in terms of
    structure, inputs and parameters to be applied in data scarce regions. Irrigation
    management using soil moisture sensors requires them to be site-calibrated, low-cost,
    and maintainable. Therefore, there is a need for parsimonious crop modeling combined
    with low-cost soil moisture sensing without losing predictive capability. This
    study calibrated the low-cost capacitance-based Spectrum Inc. SM100 soil moisture
    sensor using multiple least squares and machine learning models, with both laboratory
    and field data. The best calibration technique, field-based piece-wise linear
    regression (calibration r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 3.13 %, validation r2 = 0.67, RMSE =
    4.57 %), was used to study the effect of sensor calibration on the performance
    of the FAO AquaCrop Open Source (AquaCrop-OS) model by calibrating its soil hydraulic
    parameters. This approach was tested during the wheat cropping season in 2018,
    in Kanpur (India), in the Indo-Gangetic plains, resulting in some best practices
    regarding sensor calibration being recommended. The soil moisture sensor was calibrated
    best in field conditions against a secondary standard sensor (UGT GmbH. SMT100)
    taken as a reference (r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 %), followed by laboratory calibration
    against gravimetric soil moisture using the dry-down (r2 = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 %)
    and wet-up curves respectively (r2 = 0.62, RMSE = 6.29 %). Moreover, model overfitting
    with machine learning algorithms led to poor field validation performance. The
    soil moisture simulation of AquaCrop-OS improved significantly by incorporating
    raw reference sensor and calibrated low-cost sensor data. There were non-significant
    impacts on biomass simulation, but water productivity improved significantly.
    Notably, using raw low-cost sensor data to calibrate AquaCrop led to poorer performances
    than using the literature. Hence using literature values could save sensor costs
    without compromising model performance if sensor calibration was not possible.
    The results suggest the essentiality of calibrating low-cost soil moisture sensors
    for crop modeling calibration to improve crop water productivity.

    Surface irrigation, like other traditional irrigation methods, is inefficient
    due to deep percolation and non-uniform distribution of water (Pramanik et al.,
    2022). However, it may continue to remain the most extensively used irrigation
    method (Raine, 2006) due to its low-cost and energy requirements (Bjorneberg,
    2013). Hence, technological improvements to improve irrigation management need
    to be relevant and correspondingly cost-effective, particularly when they are
    designed for smallholder farmers, who tend to be more economical in technology
    adoption (Singh et al., 2009). Irrigation management techniques have combined
    either data from satellites (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000) or ground sensor networks
    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015) with agro-hydrological modeling (Chiara and Marco,
    2022). Precise irrigation water management requires accurate measurements as well
    as a comprehensive biophysical process understanding of crop response to water
    at different crop growth stages (Kisekka et al., 2022). Crop water simulation
    models describe the crop growth and production responses to the soil-water environment
    (C. Zhang et al., 2022). Such models are often data intensive, requiring numerous
    input variables and parameter values, which may not be available for different
    crops and environments (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014). Similarly, though commercial
    sensors, processors and communication components may be available, they need to
    be cost-effective, easy to access and maintainable for effective agricultural
    applications (Pramanik et al., 2022; Rodríguez-Robles et al., 2020). Soil moisture
    (or volumetric water content, VWC) is a key variable involved in precision agriculture
    and agricultural sustainability (Kisekka et al., 2022), which can be an input
    to crop growth models. Soil moisture sensing technologies can have low-utilization
    due to farmers'' economic limitations and reluctance towards such investment (Srbinovska
    et al., 2015). Further, soil moisture sensors need to be calibrated at each site
    because of the effects of the variability in soil properties on the sensor outputs
    (Peddinti et al., 2020). Researchers have highlighted the importance of field
    calibration as undisturbed soil samples are representative of field conditions
    where the sensors might be used (Robinson et al., 2003). However, soil moisture
    sensing is sensitive to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, bulk
    density, organic matter and clay content (Kargas and Soulis, 2012; Matula et al.,
    2016). Hence, manufacturers generally perform indoor calibration with sieved,
    uniformly packed soils at regulated VWCs and temperature conditions, particularly
    in homogeneous coarse soils like some sands and loams (Feng and Sui, 2020). Studies
    have used irrigation scheduling with calibrated low-cost capacitance sensors to
    detect crop water stress (Thompson et al., 2007a) and irrigation thresholds computed
    using measured VWC-based indices(Thompson et al., 2007b). Other studies have used
    expensive sensors in combination with crop modeling (Lu et al., 2021). The challenge
    is to combine accurate (calibrated) soil moisture sensing at low costs and parsimonious
    crop models without losing predictive power (Landau et al., 2000). This paper
    addresses this using four research questions. RQ1 pertains to LC soil moisture
    sensor performance on the field, and RQs 2 to 4 pertain to using LC soil moisture
    data for parsimonious crop model calibration: 1. Can low-cost (LC) soil moisture
    sensors be calibrated using more sophisticated techniques such as machine learning
    algorithms to improve their field performance? 2. Do raw data from LC soil moisture
    sensors have any advantage over literature values for parsimonious crop model
    calibration? 3. What is the difference in performance when such a model is calibrated
    using raw data from a LC vis-à-vis a reference soil moisture sensor? 4. What is
    the effect of calibrating the LC soil moisture data against a reference sensor
    on crop model performance? The novelty of this study lies in combining data from
    LC soil moisture sensors with parsimonious crop modeling to evaluate crop model
    performance in simulating canopy cover, VWC and water productivity (WP) using
    a two-step calibration process. Firstly, low-cost (capacitance based) soil moisture
    sensors were calibrated against uncalibrated reference (TDR-FDR) sensors via multiple
    models (least squares and machine learning algorithms). Consequently, these calibrated
    VWC data were used for calibrating the soil hydraulic parameters of a parsimonious
    crop model to assess improvements in WP. Such a laboratory-field-simulation study
    based on a food critical region in the Majority World, which combines low-cost
    soil moisture sensor calibration (using multiple models) with parsimonious crop
    modeling, has not been undertaken yet, to the best of the authors'' knowledge.
    2. Material and methods 2.1. Study area and wheat cropping season 2.1.1. Experimental
    site The study was conducted during the wheat cropping season of 2018 in Kanpur,
    which is representative of an intensively managed rural landscape in the Indo-Gangetic
    plains (Gupta et al., 2019). Measurements were collected in a 20 m × 30 m experimental
    field (Fig. 1) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India (26°30′56.8″N,
    80°13′47.3″E and altitude of about 126 m above mean sea level). The experimental
    site falls within the sub-tropical climate zone with an average annual rainfall
    of 833.5 mm, 92.5 % of which falls within the monsoon season (June to September);
    the other two seasons are the cold season from November–February and the hot season

    moisture monitoring using both Ref. and LC sensors were chosen for the study.
    2.1.2. Description of the wheat cropping season The Indian spring wheat variety
    K7903 (improved Halna) (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2012) was sown in
    check basins (or ‘plots’, each 3 m × 3 m) on January 5, 2018. The seeds were sown
    with a row-spacing, depth and planting density of 10 cm, 5 cm and 363 plants/sq.m
    respectively. Halna is a very late sown, short duration, drought tolerant variety
    of wheat (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2017). Agricultural management was
    performed based on local farming practices, that included fertilizer (urea) application
    during tillering (27 days after sowing, or DAS) and 4 irrigation applications
    (25 DAS, 45 DAS, 59 DAS and 74 DAS, given in Table A1) totaling 220.2 mm, to supplement
    the 50.4 mm rainfall during the cropping season. There was a flooding event which
    occurred just following the final irrigation, totaling 262.5 mm of water. Hence,
    the total water input was 533.1 mm. The crop was harvested on April 15, 2018 (101
    DAS). 2.2. Soil moisture sensing methods 2.2.1. Selecting appropriate soil moisture
    sensing techniques The various techniques for soil moisture sensing include neutron
    thermalization (Chanasyk and Naeth, 1996), water content reflectometer (Chandler
    et al., 2004; Kargas and Soulis, 2019), time domain reflectometry (TDR) (Robinson
    et al., 2003; Topp et al., 1980), time domain transition (TDT) (Blonquist et al.,
    2005), electrical impedance (Cosh et al., 2005; Gaskin and Miller, 1996), frequency
    domain reflectometry (FDR) (Ojo et al., 2015), electrical capacitance (Zotarelli
    et al., 2011), and sensing using electrical resistance blocks (Cummings and Chandler
    Jr, 1941) or tensiometers (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005). Capacitance-type soil
    moisture sensors are more widely used for decision support systems in irrigated
    agriculture (Fares and Alva, 2000; Gallardo et al., 2020) due to their lower cost,
    robustness, precision, and low power and maintenance requirements (Jones et al.,
    2005; Rosenbaum et al., 2011; Spelman et al., 2013; Visconti et al., 2014). However,
    despite performing well in laboratory conditions, they may exhibit sensor-to-sensor
    variability in field conditions (Bogena et al., 2017; Rosenbaum et al., 2010;
    Spelman et al., 2013), and consequently require site-specific calibration to be
    able to provide reliable VWC measurements (Kisekka et al., 2022; Peddinti et al.,
    2020). The. The WaterScout SM100 soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies,
    Inc., Plainfield, IL, USA) was chosen as the capacitance based ‘low-cost (LC)’
    soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies, 2014) investigated in the study.
    The accuracy and operating range of SM100 are 3 % (for EC < 800 mS m−1) and 0.5
    °C–80 °C respectively (Spectrum Technologies, 2014). Laboratory calibration (with
    repacked sands and silty loams) has improved its VWC accuracy (RMSE, Raes et al.,
    2018) to between 1.63 % and 2.97 % (Adla et al., 2020). The manufacturer''s calibration
    equation (D. Kieffer, personal communication, September 5, 2018) is given below:
    (1a) (1b) where VWC is measured in %, and VR is the voltage ratio of the output
    and input voltages (Vout/Vin). The SMT100 sensor (manufactured by Umwelt-Geräte-Technik
    GmbH, Müncheberg, Germany) was chosen as the secondary standard soil moisture
    sensor (Nakra and Chaudhry, 2006) to calibrate the LC SM100 sensor (see Section
    2.4.1.2.). It is henceforth called the ''reference (Ref)'' sensor due to its superior
    sensing technology which combines the higher accuracy of a TDR system with the
    cost effectiveness of FDR sensing with an oscillating frequency of 340 Hz in air
    and 150 MHz in water (Bogena et al., 2017; Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH, 2017).
    Its accuracy for VWC and temperature are 3 % and ±0.2 °C respectively, and it
    operates within the temperature range of −40 °C–80 °C (Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH,
    2017). Sensor specific laboratory calibration with (non-soil) materials of known
    apparent dielectric permittivity can improve the VWC accuracy (RMSE) to range
    between 0.21 % and 1.30 % (Bogena et al., 2017). The manufacturer''s calibration
    equation is identical to the one proposed by (Topp et al., 1980): (2) where ɛr
    is the sensed dielectric constant. Since the only common output across both SM100
    and SMT100 sensors was VWC, the uncalibrated SM100 VWC values were calibrated
    on the SMT100 sensor''s output VWC values. Details of sensor outputs are mentioned
    in the Appendix. A short description of the sensors (along with their costs) is
    given in Table 1, with more details available in the Appendix. Table 1. Details

    for the LC capacitance sensor 2.2.2.1. Least squares estimate based regression
    Studies have calibrated capacitance-based soil moisture sensors to improve performance,
    both in laboratories (Adla et al., 2020; Bello et al., 2019; Nagahage et al.,
    2019; Placidi et al., 2021) and in the field (Rudnick et al., 2015; Singh et al.,
    2018). Most of the calibration equations reported in the literature for low-cost
    sensors are least-squares estimates (e.g., linear, logistic, hyperbolic, logarithmic,
    exponential, or polynomial). Based on a visual inspection of the data, piecewise
    linear regression, power law regression and polynomial regressions (degree 2 and
    3) were used to calibrate the LC capacitance based SM100 sensor. 2.2.2.2. Machine
    learning based regression Diverse machine learning algorithms were also applied,
    including standard algorithms for regression applications: linear regression (LR),
    support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR) and multilayer
    perceptron neural networks (MLP). LR models have been applied extensively in soil
    moisture applications (Qiu et al., 2003; Teng et al., 1993); and are still relevant
    due to their simplicity and easy interpretation (García et al., 2016; Lee et al.,
    2019). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm defines optimal hyperplanes
    in a high or infinite dimensional space which can be used for classification or
    regression (Vapnik et al., 1996). SVR has been applied in soil moisture related
    studies (Gill et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2012). The RFR algorithm
    (Breiman, 2001) is based on averaging non-correlated decision trees for variance
    reduction and avoidance of overfitting. Its simplicity in training and tuning
    has made it popular in current regression applications of soil moisture (Carranza
    et al., 2021; Qingling et al., 2019; Srivastava et al., 2021; H. Zhang et al.,
    2022). However, calibration hyperparameters can be computationally expensive due
    to its many possibilities. The MLP is an algorithm based on the typical architecture
    of a neural network, hence it is a nonlinear statistical model which has unknown
    parameters (weights) meant to be tuned to make the model fit well to training
    data using back-propagation equations in multiple hidden layers. It has also been
    applied in soil moisture applications extensively (Chai et al., 2009; Gu et al.,
    2021; Yan et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2012, p. 20). All the algorithms were applied
    using the Scikit-learn tool library (v.10.2) (Pedregosa et al., 2011) in Python
    (v.3.8.5). Hyperparameters of each algorithm were calibrated with default values
    available in Scikit-learn and evaluated with a 10-fold cross validation (CV, k
    = 10), and are listed in Table A3. This process avoided skewing results in validation
    due to random sampling in the training process. The controlling metrics were the
    coefficient of determination (R2, Raes et al., 2018) and the root mean squared
    error (RMSE). Hastie et al. (2009) and Arias-Rodriguez et al. (2021) provide detailed
    definitions and an application of all these machine learning models, respectively.
    2.3. Parsimonious crop modeling 2.3.1. Selecting a parsimonious crop model Crop
    growth models can simulate physiological processes (Chenu et al., 2009; Yin et
    al., 2003), and crop growth behavior in the field (Keating et al., 2003; Robinson
    et al., 2003; Steduto et al., 2009). Consequently, they can inform management
    decisions regarding water and nutrients and explore the feasibility of new cropping
    systems (Asseng et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2017). The more popular models used
    for simulating crop growth and yield production of wheat under different soil
    water conditions and irrigation scenarios are: APSIM (Ahmed et al., 2016; Chen
    et al., 2010), DSSAT-CERES-Wheat (Attia et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018), FAO
    AquaCrop (Iqbal et al., 2014; Toumi et al., 2016), RZWQM2 (Saseendran et al.,
    2015; Zheng et al., 2020), and SWAP (Eitzinger et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2021).
    Crop modeling environments like DSSAT and APSIM can require 211 and 292 parameter
    inputs respectively (Soltani and Sinclair, 2015). This increased complexity enables
    such models to address complex research questions (Todorovic et al., 2009), but
    also amplifies errors and uncertainties (Silva and Giller, 2020). Further, data
    intensive models with numerous inputs and parameter requirements may not be practical
    in data-scarce regions (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014; Varella et al., 2010) like the
    Majority World (Graves et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2012). The water-driven FAO
    AquaCrop model has been envisioned to balance simplicity, accuracy and robustness
    (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014). Consequently, it relies on considerably fewer and
    relatively easier to measure inputs (about 19, according to FAO, 2016; Raes, 2017).
    Nevertheless, FAO AquaCrop''s performance is comparable to data-intensive models
    (Babel et al., 2019; Quintero and Díaz, 2020; Todorovic et al., 2009). Moderate
    to good simulation results have also been reported for wheat and regions of water
    scarcity (Andarzian et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2022; Kale et al., 2018; Singh
    et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). 2.3.2. Description of the crop-water model
    FAO AquaCrop FAO AquaCrop simulates daily yield loss in response to soil water
    depletion in the root zone, based on the approach of Doorenbos and Kassam (1979).
    Four main variables are calculated consecutively and on a daily basis through
    individual equations; i.e., accumulated canopy cover (CC), daily plant transpiration,
    accumulated aboveground biomass, and accumulated final dry yield. These model
    variables are mainly interconnected by empirical factors, such as the water productivity
    (WP) and harvest index (HI), which convert transpiration to biomass and biomass
    to yield, respectively. Water productivity only incorporates plant transpiration
    to account for the confounding effect of the nonproductive consumptive water use
    (Steduto et al., 2009). Moreover, WP is normalized for atmospheric CO2 concentration
    and climate (Raes et al., 2018), and hence makes the model more robust and generalizable
    (Steduto et al., 2009). Model set-up requires user input for climate parameters,
    ''non-conservative'' (i.e., spatio-temporally variable) model parameters, and,
    where applicable, an irrigation schedule and the groundwater water table. The
    model also needs daily data on precipitation, reference evapotranspiration, and
    minimum and maximum temperature. Non-conservative model parameters relate to crop
    phenology, soil conditions, and field management practices (Raes et al., 2018;
    Steduto et al., 2012). This study used the MATLAB-based AquaCrop OpenSource (AquaCrop-OS)
    v.6.1 tool (Foster et al., 2017). 2.4. Measurement methodology An automatic weather
    station at the experimental field measured precipitation, barometric pressure,
    global solar radiation, wind speed and direction. It also recorded air temperature
    and relative humidity at two different heights (2 m and 3 m above the ground).
    These data were measured at 15-min intervals and aggregated to daily values. During
    the cropping season, the average daily temperature and relative humidity (both
    at 2 m) ranged from 9.3 °C to 30.7 °C and from 35.3 % to 93.9 %, respectively.
    Soil texture classification was conducted by the UGT Sedimat 4–12 instrument,
    which determines the particle size distribution in mineral soils based on the
    Köhn method (König et al., 2005). The observed crop growth parameters included
    phenological parameters like days to emergence, start of flowering, start of senescence
    and maturity, length of flowering (days). The observed soil related parameter
    was maximum rooting depth. The observed crop management parameter was plant population
    density. The observations used for calibrating model parameters were leaf area
    index, VWC and above ground biomass. Leaf Area Index (LAI) was measured eight
    times during the season (36, 44, 55, 59, 68, 83, 90 and 101 DAS) using the LAI-2200C
    plant canopy analyzer manufactured by LI-COR Biosciences. It was converted into
    Canopy Cover values using an empirical equation for wheat (Nielsen et al., 2012).
    Surface soil moisture was determined at the center of each plot at 15-min intervals
    by Ref. SMT100 and LC SM100 sensors installed at a depth of 5 cm below the soil
    surface (Section 2.2.1). Both datasets were aggregated to the daily time-step.
    Above ground dry biomass was measured using crop cutting experiments (Singh, 2014)
    from a representative 1 sq. m section for each plot. Additionally, water productivity
    (WPET), introduced in Section 2.5.2, was calculated using actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa) measured using microlysimeters (Kumar, 2019). Six plots were used for all
    the analyses, as they had both Ref. and LC soil moisture data, as well as the
    observations required for crop modeling. VWC measurements for both the sensors
    were available on average for 61.2 days (s = 3.0 days) out of the 100-day cropping
    season across the six plots. 2.5. Calibration methodology of low-cost soil moisture
    sensors 2.5.1. Strategy to calibrate-validate soil moisture data Capacitance based
    soil-moisture sensors have been calibrated both with repacked (Adla et al., 2020;
    Nagahage et al., 2019; Placidi et al., 2020) or undisturbed (Bello et al., 2019)
    soil samples inside the laboratory, as well as in the field (Rudnick et al., 2015;
    Singh et al., 2018). In the laboratory, calibration of soil moisture sensors is
    generally carried out either using the substantially faster ''wet-up'' or wetting
    (downward or upward infiltration, taking <1 day) or slower ''dry-down'' or drying
    (taking a few weeks) processes (Burns et al., 2014). Fig. 2 describes the overall
    study workflow, contextualizing each research question. The sensors used are displayed
    at the top-left corner of the figure. Throughout the study, the data corresponding
    to the LC SM100 and Ref. SMT100 sensors are represented in blue and green colors
    respectively. The simulations corresponding to the calibrated LC soil moisture
    sensor data are represented in a deeper blue compared to the lighter blue representing
    raw LC sensor data. The workflow related to the LC soil moisture sensor (SM100)
    calibration is illustrated in the inset \"Soil moisture sensor calibration\",
    in Fig. 2. To address RQ1, the LC sensor data were calibrated against either a
    primary standard (gravimetric water content, Section 2.4.1.1.) or a secondary
    standard (the Ref. SMT100 data, Section 2.4.1.2.) - this is mentioned in the respective
    bubbles, \"Lab Cal.\" (laboratory calibration) and \"Field Cal.\" (field calibration).
    The number of paired data points (sensor and primary/secondary standard) used
    in both calibration approaches were n = 100 and n = 65 for laboratory and field
    calibration, respectively. The following process resulted in selecting the \"best\"
    LC calibration model to be used for crop modeling (Section 2.5.2.). Download :

    of the study methodology, contextualizing the four research questions (RQs). Sensor
    details are given at the top-left corner. The \"Soil moisture sensor calibration\"
    of the LC SM100 sensor was conducted in the laboratory (\"Lab Cal.\") using gravimetrically
    determined VWC, and in the field (\"Field Cal.\") using the Ref. SMT100 sensor.
    All the developed models were then validated in the field (\"Field Val.\") to
    select the most suitable model, \"Best LCcal model\". The \"Crop model calibration\"
    either used the literature (\"Default\"), raw VWC values from both Ref. and LC
    sensors (\"RawRef\" and \"RawLC\"), or the Best LCcal model (\"Calibrated\") to
    calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters (SHPs) of the AquaCrop model. The Best
    LCcal rhombus in \"Soil moisture sensor calibration\" is a flowchart decision,
    and the \"Calibrated\" diamond in \"Crop model calibration\" is a representation
    followed in Fig. 5. 2.5.1.1. Laboratory calibration of LC SM100 sensor A previous
    study calibrating the LC SM100 sensor (Adla et al., 2020) used piece-wise linear
    regression functions (PWLFs) (Jekel, 2017, p. 20) against gravimetric VWC (primary
    standard), for four soils (number of data points, n = 400). The study calibrated
    five sensors in controlled laboratory conditions with the wet-up curve (similar
    to (Matula et al., 2016)) to account for sensor-to-sensor-variability and improve
    cost-effectiveness in terms of saved time and energy resources (Burns et al.,
    2014). This study used a subset (n = 100) of the data from Adla et al. (2020)
    which represented the soil sampled from the current study site. LC sensor values
    were calibrated against gravimetric VWC using the different algorithms described
    in Section 2.2.2. R2 and RMSE were used to quantify the calibration performance
    in all cases. 2.5.1.2. Field calibration of LC SM100 sensor Out of the six plots
    used for the study, the plot with the highest (significant) linear correlation
    between the aggregated daily values of Ref. SMT100 and LC SM100 sensor (n = 65,
    R2 = 0.76) was selected for calibration. Due to the impracticality of frequent
    gravimetric measurements and its superior sensing technology, the Ref. SMT100
    sensor was selected as a secondary standard (Section 2.2.1.). Consequently, the
    daily aggregated LC SM100 data were calibrated using the daily aggregated Ref.
    SMT100 data, using the algorithms listed in Section 2.2.2. Calibration performance
    in each case was quantified by R2 and RMSE indices. 2.5.1.3. Field validation
    of laboratory and field calibrations Each calibration algorithm developed using
    both laboratory and field data were validated on independent data from the five
    remaining plots (n = 302). The Ref. SMT100 data measurements were taken as the
    secondary standard used for validating the field data. R2 and RMSE were used as
    the performance indicators for the validation process. 2.6. Crop model calibration
    scenarios 2.6.1. AquaCrop calibration method AquaCrop guidelines recommend calibrating
    all non-conservative and non-observed model parameters sequentially, with appropriate
    objective functions (AquaCrop. Tutorials., 2016; Raes et al., 2018; Steduto et
    al., 2012). Accordingly, model simulation is sequentially improved using intermediately
    computed model variables like canopy cover (CC), volumetric water content (VWC)
    and biomass (BM) by adjusting different sets of model parameters, until the simulation
    of the harvested yield agrees, visually and statistically, with observations within
    an acceptable error range (Raes et al., 2018). In this study, eight (non-conservative)
    crop growth parameters of the AquaCrop-OS model were calibrated: phenological
    parameters (initial canopy size of the emergent seedling CCo, maximum canopy cover
    CCx, and canopy growth coefficient CGC) and soil hydraulic parameters (readily
    available water REW, saturated soil hydraulic conductivity Ksat, VWC at permanent
    wilting point θPWP, field capacity θFC and saturation θs). 2.6.2. Different calibration
    scenarios used in the study (default, raw and calibrated) The inset \"Crop model
    calibration\" in Fig. 2 illustrates the FAO AquaCrop modeling scenarios used to
    address RQs 2 to 4. Crop growth parameters (CCo, CCx, CGC) were calibrated using
    a trial-and-error method (Liang et al., 2017, Ma et al., 2020) to maximize the
    Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and minimize the RMSE between the measured
    and simulated CC values for each plot (Raes et al., 2018). The soil hydraulic
    parameters (SHPs), θWP (%), θFC (%), θs (%), Ksat (mm/day), and REW (mm), were
    also calibrated to respectively maximize and minimize r and RMSE between simulated
    and observed (Ref. SMT100) soil moisture data. Soil Hydraulic Parameter (SHP)
    calibration was conducted under the following scenarios: ● The \"Default\" scenario:
    SHPs were calibrated based on average values from the literature (Rawls and Brakensiek,
    1989; Gupta et al., 2021), corresponding to the classified soil texture (silty-loam).
    ● The \"Raw\" scenarios (for both Ref. and LC sensor): SHPs were calibrated with
    the raw (uncalibrated) LC and Ref. soil moisture sensor data using a trial-and-error
    method (Liang et al., 2017, Ma et al., 2020). ● The \"Calibrated\" scenario (only
    for LC sensor): SHPs were calibrated using the \"best\" LCcal model. The difference
    in AquaCrop model performance between the Default and RawLC scenarios would illustrate
    the advantage of using raw LC data over literature values (RQ2). The difference
    between the performance of the models calibrated in the RawLC and RawRef scenarios
    would address RQ3, indicating the relative loss in crop model performance when
    LC sensor data is used for calibration vis-à-vis reference soil moisture sensor
    data. The difference between the \"Calibrated\" (CalLC) and \"Raw\" (RawLC) model
    performances would quantify the additional impact (on crop model performance)
    of using calibrated vis-à-vis raw LC soil moisture data (RQ4). Above ground dry
    biomass (BM) simulated by AquaCrop was compared with the observed biomass, using
    the mean absolute error (MAE, Witten et al., 2011), RMSE, NRMSE (normalized RMSE,
    Raes et al., 2018), and percentage bias (PBIAS, Sorooshian et al., 1993) indicators.
    Additionally, Water Productivity (WP) was simulated for each scenario to understand
    the \"efficacy of the crop production processes in relation to their required
    water consumption\" (Van Halsema and Vincent, 2012). This study used ET Water
    Productivity or WPET, defined as the following (Van Halsema and Vincent, 2012):
    (3) where Yield is the final (simulated or observed) crop yield (kg/m2) and ETa
    (m) is the cumulative actual evapotranspiration during the cropping season. The
    simulated WPET was computed by extracting the yield and seasonal evapotranspiration
    values simulated by AquaCrop. Observed WPET was computed using the observed biomass,
    the default harvest index for wheat, and ETa estimated on the field using microlysimeters
    (Kumar, 2019). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Description of the cropping season
    Fig. 3 illustrates the seasonal evolution of the daily water demand (depicted
    by the FAO-56 reference ETo, from (Allen et al., 1998)), water supply (depicted
    by rainfall and applied irrigation during the season), and soil moisture (VWC)
    monitoring by both low-cost (LC) SM100 and reference (Ref.) SMT100 soil moisture
    sensors. The soil texture, with 15.4 % sand and 66.3 % silt, was determined to
    have silty-loam texture (USDA classification). Moreover, the soil was relatively
    homogenous in depth and the groundwater table was deep enough to prevent capillary
    rise from influencing soil moisture measurements. Download : Download high-res

    performance in the laboratory and field respectively, using R2 and RMSE as the
    performance indicators. The validation in both cases is done on the same independent

    research with the dry down curve. Gedilu (2020) calibrated the LC sensor using

    equations developed using (a) lab and (b) field data. The index numbers correspond
    to Table 2. In both cases, the data used for calibration are given as points,
    and the \"Best\" model (in blue) is PWLF. During both laboratory and field calibrations,
    the performance of the machine learning algorithm Random Forest Regression (RFR)
    was quantitatively the best among all the algorithms included in the study (R2
    = 0.98 and RMSE = 1.26 % for laboratory calibration; R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 1.67
    % for field calibration). However, overfitting was observed (index 6 in Fig. 4),
    likely due to the limited tuning of the hyperparameters due to limited computational
    resources. Though RFR avoids overfitting from original decision trees (Hastie
    et al., 2009), generalization error variance decreases as more trees are added
    to the algorithm, without a change in the generalization bias. Though this study
    used the default n_estimators = 100 (Pedregosa et al., 2011), different options
    of decision trees should be examined, particularly searching for lower n_estimators
    using a GridSearch. As a consequence, the RFR-laboratory model had inadequate
    validation performance (R2 = 0.20, RMSE = 8.88 %). Moreover, the RFR-field and
    RFR-laboratory models were respectively non-monotonic and monotonically non-decreasing
    functions, implying that the calibrated LC VWC values could also decrease (or
    not increase, respectively) with increasing Ref. VWC. Both the model behaviors
    were not realistic. Consequently, the RFR algorithm was excluded from further
    analyses. The piece-wise linear regression function (PWLF) had the next best performance
    during calibration: laboratory R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 1.96 %; and field R2 = 0.76,
    RMSE = 3.13 %. Further, during both the respective validation cases, the PWLF
    performed adequately well when compared to the relative performances of the RFR
    models (PWLF-laboratory: R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 7.98 %, PWLF-field: R2 = 0.67, RMSE
    = 4.57 %). This piece-wise (segmented) behavior is also a feature of the manufacturer''s
    calibration equation which has linear and quadratic segments (Kieffer, personal
    communication, September 5, 2018). Fig. 5 shows scatter plots between measured/calibrated
    LC SM100 values and the measured Ref. SMT100 values for (a) laboratory calibration,
    (b) validation of the laboratory-calibrated PWLF model, (c) field calibration,
    and (d) validation of the field-calibrated PWLF model. Raw and calibrated data
    are represented by cyan bubbles and deep blue diamonds respectively. Some best
    practices for soil moisture sensor calibration were derived from this comparative
    analysis of calibration models, which can be more specific to capacitance-based
    sensors used in silty-loam agricultural soils: ● Field calibration of fewer sensors
    may be more robust than laboratory calibration of multiple sensors: Field calibrations
    with undisturbed soils may be more robust for field applications. The field validation
    performance (both R2 and RMSE) of laboratory-calibrated models was significantly
    poorer than field-calibrated models, supporting previous recommendations of on-site
    calibration using undisturbed soil samples (Feng and Sui, 2020). ● If field calibration
    is not possible, calibration should be done using the dry-down curve: Calibrating
    LC sensors in the laboratory using the dry-down curve rather than the wet-up curve
    leads to superior performance for field applications. The laboratory validation
    results corroborated with previous literature which claimed superior laboratory
    calibration accuracy using dry-down curves, particularly for finer textured soils
    (Burns et al., 2014). An earlier study which calibrated 3 LC SM100 sensors with
    a similar soil using the dry-down curve in the laboratory was found to have the
    best validation performance (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 %) among all laboratory calibrated
    models (Rai, 2012). Similarly, a linear dry-down calibration equation developed
    in the laboratory by Gedilu (2020) using only one LC SM100 sensor using repacked
    soil from the experimental field, also performed well (R2 = 0.61 and RMSE = 6.06
    %). These models performed better than all the laboratory models in this study
    (models 0 to 7), which were developed using the wet-up curve with five LC sensors.
    This suggests that capturing dry-down dynamics can compensate for the sensor-to-sensor
    variability even for repacked soils inside the laboratory. Further, the dry-down
    curve is more representative of the soil water dynamics during the dry non-monsoonal
    rabi cropping season in northern India, where rainfall majorly occurs during the
    monsoon kharif season (Sankararamakrishnan et al., 2008). ● Overfitting during
    calibration can lead to loss in robust application: Overfitting was observed in
    both laboratory and field RFR models, both of which performed poorly during validation.
    Machine learning models, applied to non-linear hydrological processes have had
    limitations of overfitting and reasonable justification of results (Elshorbagy
    et al., 2010). The data in this study suggest that monotonic (preferably \"gently
    sloped\") curves are more robust for soil moisture calibration. Overfitting using
    ML techniques is possibly also due to the relatively lower number of samples that
    exemplify soil moisture sensor calibration. This supports previous studies which
    mainly report linear and polynomial calibration curves (Bello et al., 2019; Deng
    et al., 2020; Gedilu, 2020; Nagahage et al., 2019; Placidi et al., 2020; Rudnick
    et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2007b, 2007a). With respect
    to research question 1 (RQ1), the PWLF model calibrated using field data was chosen
    as the \"best\" LCcal model due to the flexibility of multiple segments without
    compromising the positive correlation expected between data from two electromagnetic
    sensors in the same soil. This suggests that simpler models such as PWLF are more
    robust in calibrating LC soil moisture sensors than more sophisticated ML techniques,
    in such conditions, addressing RQ1. 3.3. Crop model calibration scenarios 3.3.1.

    DAS implies days after sowing. In the Default scenario, only crop growth parameters
    (i.e., CCo, CCx and CGC) were altered to improve the fit of the simulated CC curve
    with the observations. The SHPs which would impact the VWC curve fitting were
    chosen from (the average of) default values from literature (Table A2). CC was
    predicted very well as compared to the previous literature on AquaCrop wheat growth
    simulation, with r = 0.98 and RMSE = 5.71 % (Huang et al., 2022; Kale et al.,
    2018). These calibrated canopy growth parameters values were hence used in the
    RawRef., RawLC and CalLC scenarios, leading to nearly identical r and RMSE indicators.
    In all scenarios, the VWC simulations are compared against the observed soil moisture
    data from the reference sensor (Ref.). For the VWC simulations, the Pearson r
    values did not show significant differences across the scenarios. However, when
    the SHPs were modified based on the raw Ref. and LC sensor values, the RawRef.
    (RMSE = 5.69 %) showed a significant improvement, and RawLC (RMSE = 8.58 %) showed
    a significant deterioration, both compared to the Default scenario (RMSE = 7.76
    %). The worsening of the VWC simulation performance in the RawLC scenario in Fig.
    6 (g), which overestimated the VWCobs with a PBIAS = 46.19 %, resulted majorly
    from respectively higher VWCsim values during the drying periods leading up to
    each of the irrigation days, when compared with the Default scenario in Fig. 6
    (e), with a PBIAS = 27.74 %. This implies that the SHPs calibrated using raw LC
    soil moisture data were significantly poorer than those derived from the literature
    (Gupta et al., 2021; Rawls and Brakensiek, 1989), addressing research question
    (RQ) 2. For the VWC simulations, the Pearson r values did not show significant
    differences across the scenarios. However, when the SHPs were modified based on
    the raw Ref. and LC sensor values, the RawRef. (RMSE = 5.69 %) showed a significant
    improvement, and RawLC (RMSE = 8.58 %) showed a significant deterioration, both
    compared to the Default scenario (RMSE = 7.76 %). To answer research question
    (RQ) 2, the performances of the RAWLC and Default scenarios were compared. The
    worsening of the VWC simulation performance in the RawLC scenario in Fig. 6 (g),
    which overestimated the VWCobs with a PBIAS = 46.19 %, resulted majorly from respectively
    higher VWCsim values during the drying periods leading up to each of the irrigation
    days, when compared with the Default scenario in Fig. 6 (e), with a PBIAS = 27.74
    %. Hence, the SHPs calibrated using raw LC soil moisture data were significantly
    poorer than those derived from the literature (Gupta et al., 2021; Rawls and Brakensiek,
    1989), implying the AquaCrop models calibrated with raw data from LC soil moisture
    performed relatively poorly compared to those calibrated using the literature,
    addressing RQ2. The answer to RQ3 is that there was a significant difference between
    the VWCsim performances of the SHPs calibrated using the RawRef (RMSE = 5.7 %,
    PBIAS = 3.99 %) and RawLC (RMSE = 9.55 %, PBIAS = 46.19 %) data. This implies
    that the RawRef derived SHPs led to significantly superior VWCsim performances
    than that of the RawLC both in terms of accuracy and bias. To answer RQ4, the
    SHPs were modified using the calibrated LC soil moisture data (in the CalLC scenario).
    The CalLC scenario (RMSE = 5.9 %, PBIAS = 5.22 %) in Fig. 6 (h) significantly
    outperformed the RawLC (RMSE = 9.55 %, PBIAS = 46.19 %), nearly attaining the
    performance of RawRef (RMSE = 5.7 %, RMSE = 3.99 %). The SHPs calibrated in CalLC
    reduced the VWCsim overestimation seen in the RawLC scenario. This was corroborated
    by the seasonal water balance computations, which showed that the SHPs interacted
    to reduce the final root zone soil water storage in the CalLC scenario to 19.85
    % lower than the RAWLC scenario (but still not as low as the RawRef. scenario).
    This implies that there were significant advantages of using LC soil moisture
    data calibrated using the Ref. sensor data, to calibrate the crop model SHPs,
    which addressed RQ4. These results indicated the utility of calibrating LC sensors
    using Ref. sensors in terms of improving VWC simulation performance of AquaCrop,
    and that using raw LC sensor data would lead to poorer results than using the
    literature to calibrate SHPs. However, the overall VWC simulation performance
    was not as good as previous studies which used either cumbersome gravimetric VWC
    measurements or costly neutron probes, both of which are highly accurate in VWC
    measurement (Huang et al., 2022; Kale et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013). Nevertheless,
    it was promising to note that significant improvements were obtained in the VWC
    simulations by calibrating the LC capacitance-based sensor even against an uncalibrated,
    reference (TDR-FDR) sensor. 3.3.2. Final crop model outputs: crop model yield
    and water productivity Fig. 7 illustrates the simulated aboveground crop Water
    Productivity (WPET) for all the scenarios, as averages and standard error of the
    mean (SEM) for all the plots taken together. Table 3 also lists the MAE, RMSE
    and PBIAS for the respective biomass values. AquaCrop-OS overestimated the observed
    biomass by an average of 0.11 kg/m2, and an average RMSE of 0.145 kg/m2, and NRMSE
    of 13.41 %, which is considered to be a ''good'' simulation performance (Jamieson
    et al., 1991; Raes et al., 2018). There were no significant differences in the
    simulated BM across the five scenarios irrespective of the strength of VWC simulation,
    indicating that the FAO AquaCrop simulation of biomass relied primarily on the
    canopy curve development. Download : Download high-res image (183KB) Download

    (WPET) averaged over 5 field plots, for the 3 different AquaCrop-OS crop modeling
    scenarios (RawRef., RawLC and CalibratedLC). Error bars in all figures represent
    the SEM. However, the simulated water productivity (WPET) varied across the different
    scenarios. There was an improvement in WPET when the SHPs were calibrated using
    the raw Ref. sensor data as compared to the default literature (WPET for Def =
    1.566 ± 0.009 kg/m3, WPET for RawRef. = 1.629 ± 0.006 kg/m3), due to significantly
    lower ET in RAWRef. compared to Def. There was a non-significant change in WPET
    when raw LC sensor data were used to calibrate the SHPs: (WPET for Def = 1.566
    ± 0.009 kg/m3, WPET for RawLC = 1.564 ± 0.011 kg/m3), which corresponded to the
    non-significant differences in simulated ET (and yield) between the two scenarios.
    This implies that incorporating the raw LC SM100 sensor data to calibrate the
    SHPs was not significantly more useful compared to using the literature values,
    and did not address any water saving objectives, further highlighting the ineffectiveness
    of using raw LC soil moisture data shown in Section 3.2.1. However, when the LC
    sensors were calibrated using the Ref. sensors, there was a significant improvement
    in WPET (WPET for RawLC = 1.564 ± 0.011 kg/m3, WPET for CalLC = 1.601 ± 0.010
    kg/m3), due to the significant differences between simulated ET between both the
    scenarios. This difference of 0.037 ± 0.021 kg/m3 corresponds to water savings
    between 17,241 L and 62,500 L per kg of wheat yield produced. 3.4. Summary of
    results This section summarizes the conclusions regarding each research question.
    ● The answer to RQ1 was that simpler models are more effective than sophisticated
    machine learning (ML) algorithms in calibrating LC soil moisture against data
    from a reference soil moisture sensor, since ML techniques can lead to model overfitting
    and overall less robust results. This was based on the discussion surrounding
    Table 2, and Fig. 4, Fig. 5. ● The answer to RQ2 was that raw LC sensor data performed
    significantly poorly than literature values for parsimonious crop model calibration.
    There was no significant improvement in WPET compared to the default calibration
    case. These results were based on Fig. 6 in Section 3.3.1. However, sensor calibration
    may be difficult to implement due to the corresponding resource requirements (e.g.,
    scientific, logistical, financial, human). If the LC sensors cannot be calibrated,
    using default values from the literature for SHP calibration can save sensor costs
    without compromising crop model performance. ● The answer to RQ3 was that the
    simulated AquaCrop VWCsim output and WPET were poorer and significantly lower,
    respectively, when the raw LC soil moisture data was used to calibrate the SHPs
    (RMSE = 9.55 %, PBIAS = 46.19 %), compared to when the Reference soil moisture
    data were used (RMSE = 5.7 %, PBIAS = 3.99 %). These results were based on the
    discussion surrounding Fig. 6 in Section 3.3.1., and Section 3.3.2. ● The answer
    to RQ4 was that the effect of calibrating the raw LC soil moisture on the Reference
    sensor data significantly improved the VWCsim output of the AquaCrop model compared
    to the respective output from the raw LC data, nearly attaining the performance
    based on the Reference sensor data. Additionally, this calibration led to significant
    improvements in simulated WPET. These results are based on the discussions in
    Section 3.3.1. (Figs. 6) and 3.3.2. (Fig. 7). 3.5. Further discussion Capacitance
    based sensing is affected by environmental factors such as salinity and clay content,
    which can be measured and compensated for, to improve performance at lower frequencies
    of soil moisture sensing (Adla et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020). The SM100 sensor
    has been shown to have low sensitivity to salinity by Adla et al. (2020), and
    their recommendations of soil specific calibrations have been followed in this
    study to account for soil textural variability. Similarly, the UGT manual (Umwelt-Geräte-Technik
    GmbH, 2017) mentions that the SMT100 sensor can operate well in clayey soils,
    and has low salinity sensitivity. Hence, this study implicitly accounts for these
    environmental factors. The presence of a distinct wetting-front may also affect
    the calibration curves (Kargas et al., 2013; Young et al., 1997). While not capturing
    this phenomena is a limitation of the study, its impact on this particular application
    may have been relatively minor. The time for a wetting-front to pass the order
    of the sensor depth (∼10 cm) (Chu et al., 2018) was much smaller than the time-resolution
    of the crop model (daily) for which soil moisture measurements were used. Also,
    the horizontal placement of the sensors was more likely to ensure uniform VWC
    within the sensing volume (Kargas et al., 2013). Machine learning algorithms may
    have performed better by incorporating more data and variables (e.g., weather),
    but this was also not done to ensure comparability between the least squares and
    machine learning algorithms. The validations of the different soil moisture calibration
    models performed poorly than the recommended 3 % sensor accuracy for soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling systems (Soulis et al., 2015). However, since
    this study was aimed at analyzing the effect of sensor calibration on relevant
    crop model outputs, this was not a valid concern within this context, and would
    need further investigation. 4. Conclusions A set of best practices of calibrating
    capacitance based low-cost (LC) Spectrum SM100 soil moisture sensors was developed
    using two calibration approaches: calibrating against gravimetric water content
    in the using wet-up curve laboratory conditions, and calibrating against a TDR-FDR
    reference (Ref.) soil moisture sensor (UGT SMT100) in the field. Different least
    squares and machine learning approaches were used to calibrate the LC sensor.
    Field calibration was observed to be more robust than calibration in the laboratory.
    Calibration of the dry-down curve was found to be more accurate, and even calibrations
    using the dry-down curve in the laboratory were robust enough to perform similarly
    well as the superior field calibrations. Overfitting during calibration can lead
    to loss in robustness in the field, and hence, should be avoided. The best calibration
    model (LCcal), considering the above issues, was the field calibrated piece-wise
    linear regression function (PWLF-field). The soil hydraulic parameters (SHPs)
    of the FAO AquaCrop model were calibrated under different calibration schemes
    to understand the effect of using raw soil moisture sensor data, and the additional
    effect of calibrating the capacitance LC sensor, on model outputs. VWC estimation
    respectively improved and worsened on incorporating the Ref. and LC sensor data
    to calibrate SHPs, when compared with literature derived SHPs. However, LC data
    calibrated using the PWLF-field model resulted in nearly the same VWC simulation
    performance as the Ref. sensor. The water productivity (WPET) improved significantly
    when incorporating raw Ref. sensor data to calibrate SHPs. This was not seen when
    incorporating raw LC data, but on transforming the data using the best LCcal model,
    a significant improvement was seen in the WPET compared to both the raw and default
    scenarios. These experiments and modeling reveal that if calibration of LC sensors
    is not possible, it is preferable to use the literature to calibrate crop model
    SHPs without compromising overall model performance. However, calibrating the
    LC sensors using a higher-quality secondary standard sensor in the field may give
    rise to not only better VWC simulations by the crop model, but also significant
    improvements in water productivity and corresponding water savings at the same
    level of yield. CRediT authorship contribution statement Soham Adla: Conceptualization,

    Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (specially Mr. Sunil Nishad)
    for their technical support throughout the measurement period. Also, the authors
    are grateful to Mr. Aditya Kumar, Mr. Pravesh Singh and Mr. Santosh for their
    overall field support for the experiment to be completed successfully. The Technische
    Universität München Studienqualitätskommission (SQK) 2017-18 funding was used
    to purchase the SMT100 soil moisture sensors deployed in the study. Soil testing
    for the study was conducted at the Bayerische Landesanstalt für Landwirtschaft
    (LfL), Germany. Appendix. Details on the low-cost SM100 sensor The capacitance-based
    Water Scout SM100 soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield,
    IL, USA) operates with a pair of electrodes behaving as a capacitor and the soil
    surrounding the sensor behaving as the charge storing dielectric medium (Spectrum
    Technologies, 2014). An oscillator operating at 80 MHz drives the capacitor, and
    generates an output (voltage ratio) which is proportional to the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil-water system. The sensor output (voltage ratio/raw value) is then
    converted to a VWC value using the factory calibration equation - Equation (1a),
    (1b) in the manuscript (Kieffer, 2018). The outputs of the SM100 sensor are \"Raw
    value\" (which is related to the voltage ratio of the output to the input voltage)
    and \"VWC\". Details on the reference SMT100 sensor The sensor head of the UGT
    SMT100 soil moisture sensor (manufactured by Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH, Müncheberg,
    Germany) contains the sensor electronics which emit a steep pulse traveling along
    a closed transmission line buried in the soil. However, instead of directly measuring
    the time for the pulse to return (e.g., in TDT or TDR), the pulse is inverted
    and fed back into the line driver input, resulting in an \"oscillation\" frequency
    which is a function of the soil dielectric permittivity (Bogena et al., 2017).
    Also, unlike the FDR which is based on a capacitor, the SMT100 uses a ring oscillator
    to generate the pulse and transform the travel time to frequency (Bogena et al.,
    2017; Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH, 2017). The oscillation frequency is around 340
    MHz in air and 150 MHz in water (Bogena et al., 2017). This resultant frequency
    is high enough to not be influenced by the high clay content, electrical conductivity
    or imaginary dielectric permittivity of the soil (Blonquist et al., 2005; Umwelt-Geräte-Technik
    GmbH, 2017). The outputs of SMT100 are \"Supply Voltage\", \"Count\" (which can
    be linked to apparent dielectric permittivity through an empirical model, Bogena
    et al., 2017), \"relative permittivity\", \"volumetric water content\" (computed
    using the relative permittivity, Topp et al., 1980) and \"soil temperature\".

    hydrological modellingSubsurface drip irrigation 1. Introduction There is an increasing
    need to improve the irrigation and nutrient use efficiency of major crops e.g.,
    processing tomato in California''s Central Valley (CDFA, 2021). Both for practical
    and research purposes, agricultural soils are generally monitored and sampled
    before, during, and after the growing season to establish water and nutrient balance
    (Lazcano et al., 2015). However, subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and fertigation
    techniques increase the already heterogeneous water and nutrient distribution
    in the soil (Raij-Hoffman et al., 2022), making representative measurements a
    challenge under these complex cropping systems. In addition, the monitoring of
    the crop and soil water status as a proxy needs to be done for evaluating the
    correct application of water and nutrient and quantifying their effects on physiological
    processes. Thus, the need for implementing integrated monitoring approaches for
    monitoring the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) is pivotal. A number of
    ground-based measurements are used for sensing both the soil and plant water status
    at point/local scale, including the use of portable sensors for detecting the
    crop water status parameters (e.g. stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, stem
    water potential, etc.) or measuring the soil water content (SWC, e.g., using probes
    based on time domain reflectometry, TDR, or frequency domain reflectometry method).
    Other methodologies are used for determining the energy and mass flux exchanges
    that act within the SPAC system at the field level (e.g., eddy covariance, or
    scintillometry techniques). In addition, the recent development in remote and
    proximal sensing technologies has provided useful data and tools for deriving
    spatially distributed information about the soil and plant system by combining
    the information captured by thermal, visible and near-infrared sensors at different
    temporal and spatial scales (including the use of water-related indexes, such
    as the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, Rouse et al., 1974; or the
    crop water stress index, CWSI, Idso, 1982; Jackson, 1982). Moreover, huge advances
    have been achieved in the quantification of the SWC in the root-zone. In the last
    decades, hydrogeophysics (e.g., Binley et al., 2015), which involves the combination
    of geophysics and hydrological modelling, has provided promising approaches especially
    regarding the use of time-lapse applications for determining the spatial and temporal
    evolution of the SWC under herbaceous and woody crops (e.g., Cassiani et al.,
    2015; Garré et al., 2011; Michot et al., 2003; Moreno et al., 2015; Srayeddin
    and Doussan, 2009). In addition, the study of Vanella et al. (2019) opened an
    exciting research line on the integration of multiscale methodologies (i.e., by
    combining the use of remote sensing, modelling and geophysical methods) for supporting
    the irrigation management at the farm scale under drip irrigation conditions.
    The most advanced trends on precision agriculture coincide on the idea that applying
    integrated approaches, based on multiple monitoring/modelling techniques, can
    improve our knowledge of soil water redistribution under real field conditions
    (e.g., Heydari et al., 2023; Tsoulias et al., 2020). At the light of the above-mentioned
    state-of-the-art, the specific objectives of this study were two-fold: (i) to
    infer the SWC redistribution and root water uptake processes during an irrigation
    event under subsurface drip irrigation in a processing tomato field using point-based
    sensors, hydrologic modelling and geophysical techniques; and (ii) to explore
    the potentialities of applying minimally invasive (i.e., ERT in time-lapse mode)
    and proximal sensing techniques (i.e., thermal and visible-near infrared information)
    for detecting the CWSI and SWC relationships under the experimental conditions.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Field site description The trial was conducted in
    a 34-ha commercial processing tomato field located in Yolo County, California
    (USA). The soil at the field site is defined as a Capay silty clay (https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/).
    Processing tomatoes were planted on April 6th 2021, and supplied by SDI with fertigation
    according to best management practices at the growers'' discretion. The SDI dripline
    was buried in the middle of the growing bed at 20 cm depth, with a dripper spacing
    of 30 cm and a dripper discharge rate of 0.6 l h−1 (Fig. 1-A). Download : Download

    drip irrigation line. Circled numbers represent TDR sensors installed horizontally
    in the area near the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) transects; (B) Overview
    of ERT transects, perpendicular and parallel to the growing beds (ERT-1 and ERT-2),
    respectively, at a processing tomato field in Yolo County California during the
    2021 growing season. Irrigation was monitored using pressure transducers installed
    at the head of each irrigation line. The trial was performed on August 4th 2021,
    20 days before harvest, during the last irrigation event for the growing season.
    At this phenological stage, the plants were mature, with fully developed canopies
    and root systems. The SWC was monitored using 6 TDR sensors (TDR-3010H, Acclima,
    Inc., Meridian, USA) installed at the locations relative to the subsurface drip
    line, as described in Fig. 1-A at a distance of 35 m East of the ERT transects.
    Volumetric water content (VWC), soil temperature, and soil bulk electrical conductivity
    (EC) were recorded every 15 min during the ERT campaign (Table 1). Soil pore water
    EC in the root zone was calculated using TDR data according to the methodology
    presented by Hilhorst, 2000 Additionally, soil pore water EC was measured below
    the root zone, at 160 and 262 cm depth from the soil surface, using a deep vadose
    zone monitoring system as described in Rimon et al. (2007). Table 1. Time-lapse

    4:28 PM T7 4:55 PM 5:25 PM 2.2. ERT setup and data processing Electrical resistivity
    tomography (ERT) measurements were performed using a 10-channel Syscal Pro georesistivimeter
    (IRIS Instrument, Orleans, France) in a time-lapse mode. Specifically, one ERT
    dataset was acquired early in the morning, before the irrigation event (T0), and
    then, after the beginning of the irrigation phase (irrigation phase started at
    10:23 AM PST), 7 subsequent ERT datasets were acquired at a nearly hourly rate
    until 5:00 PM during the irrigation event (T1–T7, Table 1). Two ERT transects
    were arranged with a bi-dimensional (2-D) scheme, one perpendicular and one parallel
    to the growing beds (Fig. 1-B). The perpendicular ERT transect had 48 electrodes
    (stainless steel rods of about 0.30 m, with a diameter of 0.01 m, buried for about
    1/3 of their length into the soil surface) spaced 15 cm, covering 4 beds or 7.1
    m (ERT-1 (a-a′) in Fig. 1-B). The parallel ERT transect had 32 electrodes spaced
    10 cm, covering 3.1 m (ERT-2 (b-b′) in Fig. 1-B). For both ERT transects, direct
    and reciprocal measurements were acquired using a dipole-dipole configuration
    by automatically switching the current electrodes with the potential electrodes.
    The measurement error of the ERT data was assessed by calculating the reciprocal
    error above 10 % (Slater et al., 2000). In this sense, we can exclude abrupt ER
    changes occurred within the acquisition process. The forward and inverse solutions
    were obtained from the ERT data using the R2 code (v4.02, July 2020). The ERT-1
    and ERT-2 soil domains were discretized by generating two triangular meshes, made
    of 4672 and 4756 cells, and 9040 and 9280 elements, for ERT-1 and ERT-2, respectively,
    using the Gmsh software (Geuzaine and Remacle, 2009). Several forward models were
    created for determining the model error. Both measurement and model errors were
    used into the inversion model that was performed in absolute and in time-lapse
    mode. In particular, the absolute inversion model was applied as defined in Binley
    and Kemna (2005) and Binley et al. (2015) for determining the initial electrical
    resistivity (ER) distribution at T0 (Table 1) at each transect. The temporal ER
    changes (in percentage, %) were calculated using the ratio time-lapse inversion
    approach described in Vanella et al., 2021, Vanella et al., 2022. This ratio time-lapse
    inversion approach permits to identify the increasing or decreasing patterns referring
    to the ER changes in comparison to the initial condition (T0, Table 1). Due to
    the uncertainty of the actual subsurface dripper location, an optimization approach
    based on ERT data was developed to infer the dripper location at each soil bed
    monitored with ERT-1. It was hypothesized that the actual dripper location is
    within the soil wettest location (inferred by ERT) in each beds'' profile following
    a significant time period after the beginning of the irrigation event. Specifically,
    an area of 40 cm by 20 cm was defined around the theoretical dripper location
    as described by the grower, with ±20 cm in the x axis and ± 10 cm in the y axis
    (Fig. A.3-A). Then, the locations characterized by the more accentuated ERT decreasing
    changes at T2, were selected as the potential subsurface dripper location. In
    particular, T2 was chosen, that corresponded to 49 min after the beginning of
    the irrigation event (Table 1), since T1 was initialized only 15 min after the
    irrigation began and the SWC changes at that time were still too low to find an
    optimum location. 2.3. Ancillary monitoring data 2.3.1. Micrometeorological data
    Surface energy balance components, such as net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux
    (G), sensible heat flux (H), and latent heat flux (LE) (Fig. 2) (all measured
    in W m−2), along with other agrometeorological parameters, such as air temperature
    (°C), relative humidity (%), and solar radiation (W m−2), were continuously monitored
    using an eddy covariance (EC) station that was positioned close to the ERT transects.

    Fig. 2. Hourly surface energy balance fluxes measured in a processing tomato field
    in Yolo County California during the 2021 growing season. Timings of electrical
    resistivity tomography (ERT) acquisitions are reported as light vertical grey
    lines (T0–T7, Table 1). The EC system included a three-dimensional (3-D) sonic
    anemometer (Gill R3-50, Li-Cor Inc., NE, USA) to measure the orthogonal wind velocities,
    and an open path gas analyzer (LI-7500, Li-Cor Inc., NE, USA), that was installed
    2.5 m above the ground in order to measure both carbon dioxide and water vapor
    fluxes at a frequency of 10 Hz. Also, three soil heat flux plates (HFT-3, REBS
    Inc., WA, USA) were buried at 8 cm depth and coupled with soil moisture probes
    (GS-1, METER Group Inc., USA), and soil thermocouples (TCAV-L, Campbell Scientific
    Inc., UT, USA), placed at 2.5 cm depth to correct the heat storage above the plates.
    The flux data were then post-processed by applying several standard corrections
    and adjustments using the Eddy Pro software (Li-Cor Inc., NE, USA). For further
    information on the flux tower and data processing refer to Peddinti and Kisekka
    (2022). 2.3.2. Thermal-based plant water status monitoring Canopy temperature
    was monitored at different time steps, at the end of each ERT acquisition (Table
    1) using a portable infrared radiometer (MI-220 model SI-121, Apogee Instruments,
    Inc., Logan, USA). The instrument was mounted on a pole and a fixed angle of 90°
    from the vertical and a 30 cm distance from the canopy was maintained during the
    measurements. At the ERT-1 transect, two measurements per growing bed were performed,
    one above each plant (Fig. 1). At the ERT-2 transect, it was not possible to identify
    individual plants, so canopy temperature measurements were performed every 30
    cm or every 3 electrodes. At each measurement time step, the sky temperature data
    was also acquired and used to obtain the corrected canopy temperature values using
    the following Stefan-Boltzmann-based formula: (1) where Ttarget, Tsensor and Tbackground
    refer to the corrected, measured, and sky temperature (i.e., brightness temperature
    of the background), respectively; ε is the emissivity of the target surface, i.e.,
    0.98 for vegetation (Campbell and Diak, 2005). The correct canopy temperature
    and air temperature (from the in-situ agrometeorological station) measurements
    were used to compute the CWSI during the ERT measurements, using the Idso (1982),
    Jackson (1982) equation as follows: (2) where Tc and Ta refer to the canopy and
    air temperature (°C), respectively; LL and UL are the lower and upper limits,
    respectively. The term (Tc − Ta)LL was determined on experimental basis by fitting
    the theoretical (Tc − Ta) with the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) values measured
    in situ (kPa). This relationship resulted in the following equation: (3) The (Tc
    − Ta)UL was calculated using three different temperature values provided at the
    site-specific condition (i.e., 8 °C), and reported by Irmak et al. (2000) (i.e.,
    4.6 °C) and López-López et al., 2009, López-López et al., 2011 (i.e., 2.8 °C)
    for herbaceous crops. 2.3.3. Aerial imagery data A day before the ERT campaign,
    very high-resolution aerial imagery was taken using an airplane by CERES (Ceres
    Imaging, Inc., CA, USA). This imagery included multispectral images with a pixel
    resolution of 0.3 m and thermal images with a resolution of 0.2 m. The images
    were captured at 12:55 p.m. (PST) using the thermal sensor FLIR A65 (FLIR Systems,
    Wilsonville, Oregon, United States) in conjunction with a bespoke arrangement
    of a constellation of VNIR IDS camera systems. Readers can refer to Peddinti and
    Kisekka (2022) for additional information on image processing and acquisition
    processes. These images were utilized in the calculation of the NDVI as a proxy
    for the vigor of the vegetation (Rouse et al., 1974), and the NDVI values were
    extracted for each of the electrode locations of both ERT-1 and ERT-2. After that,
    these NDVI values were compared with the relative ER changes that occurred during
    the course of a day. The ER values between two neighboring electrodes in the ERT
    sections were averaged for each of the depths. To prevent the boundary effects
    from occurring, the first and last six data points were ignored as well as the
    points inside the furrow in ERT-1. 2.4. Hydrological simulations Unsaturated soil
    water flow was simulated using HYDRUS (2-D/3-D) software, version 2.05.0270, following
    a modified Richards equation and using van Genuchten (1980) – Mualem (1976) hydraulic
    functions (Šimůnek et al., 2011). For additional details on SDI modelling using
    HYDRUS (2-D/3-D), the reader is referred to Raij-Hoffman et al. (2022). 2.4.1.
    Domain and hydraulic properties A 2-D domain was defined following the simulations
    in Raij-Hoffman et al. (2022) and the growing bed geometry defined in Fig. 3 with
    a profile depth of 150 cm. Assuming geometrical bed symmetry, the simulation included
    half of the growing bed for computational efficiency. The water flow domain was
    defined with a subsurface dripper and a finer discretization around the dripper
    and at the top boundary resulting in 3951 nodes and 3667 elements. Download :

    where the time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors were installed. Hydraulic properties
    were estimated using the Rosetta3 pedotransfer model with measured inputs of sand,
    silt, and clay percentages as well as bulk density measured in the top 30 cm of
    soil (Table 2). In particular, soil texture and bulk density were measured at
    4 different locations in this field at depths of 0–15 cm, 15–30 and 30–60 cm using
    a modified pipette method (Waterhouse et al., 2021) and the gravimetric method,
    respectively. The results of the soil analyses showed low spatial heterogeneity
    and no clear difference between the cultivated layer and the deeper soil. Due
    to the low vertical heterogeneity also inferred by ERT at the beginning of the
    field campaign (T0, Table 1, refer to Fig. 4), it was decided to assume vertical
    homogeneity and use the top 30 cm properties for the entire soil profile. Table

    field in Yolo County California during the 2021 growing season. Values are expressed
    in log10 of the electrical resistivity (ER) in Ω m. In order to account for the
    natural spatial heterogeneity, fifty simulations were generated with stochastic
    distributions of the hydraulic conductivity (αK) and pressure head (αh) scaling
    factors using the Miller-Miller similitude approximation (Miller and Miller, 1956),
    where these two scaling factors are correlated. The mean Ks for the stochastic
    distribution is presented in Table 2, the standard deviation of log10 value of
    αK was defined as 0.25 cm, and zero as horizontal (X) and vertical (Z) correlation
    lengths (uncorrelated in any direction). Root density was defined using the Vrugt
    model (Vrugt et al., 2001) with a maximum rooting depth of 90 cm, depth of maximum
    intensity of 40 cm, a shape empirical parameter Pz[−] of 2, maximum rooting radius
    of 75 cm, radius of maximum intensity of 30 cm and a shape empirical parameter
    Px[−] of 5, indicating that the plant is not on top of the dripper at x = 0 cm,
    but at the side of the drip line (Fig. 3) following the agricultural practice
    in the field and experimental measurements conducted in similar but not identical
    cases (Hanson and May, 2007). The Feddes water uptake reduction model (Feddes
    et al., 1978) was considered with h1, h2, h3max, h3min, h4 values of −1, −2, −800,
    −1500, and −8000 cm, respectively, as described in Hanson et al. (2006) and a
    critical stress index of 0.8 assumed to allow for compensated root water uptake.
    No solute stress model was included in the simulation, and overall, no water uptake
    reduction due to low water content or salinity was expected, since irrigation
    was scheduled to be sufficient in volume and performed with low-salinity water.
    Four observation points were defined at the 4 relative locations of the TDR sensors
    (Figs. 1-A and 3), assuming total symmetry, and therefore sensor pairs located
    at the same depth and distance from the dripper are represented as one observation
    point. These are sensors 1–6 and 4–5 in Fig. 1-A. 2.4.2. Initial and boundary
    conditions Following Raij-Hoffman et al. (2022), the boundary condition at the
    dripper was defined as a variable flux, allowing for intermittent irrigation,
    and the bottom boundary was defined as free drainage (Fig. 3). The rest of the
    domain was defined as no flow assuming symmetry on both sides of the profile and
    all ET to be transpiration due to the high plant cover during the field campaign
    and the extremely dry bare soil areas due to the subsurface drip irrigation system.
    The irrigation rates applied in the field and the actual hourly ET measured with
    the EC method were defined as time variable boundary conditions (as in Groenveld
    et al., 2021). The typical irrigation strategy followed by the farmer (i.e. long
    duration events) lead to assume that actual ET provided by the EC is quite close
    to potential crop ET (i.e. no stress conditions). The initial conditions were
    defined as a uniform VWC of 0.36 cm3 cm−3 as estimated from the initial ERT dataset
    (T0, Appendix B, Figs. B.1.-B and B.2.-B). 3. Results 3.1. Time-lapse electrical
    resistivity images The ER pattern at T0, before the irrigation event begun, in
    Fig. 4. suggests lower SWC and in the shallow profile as a result of evaporation
    and root water uptake, as well as some water storage in the deeper parts of the
    profile (70 cm). The perpendicular profile (ERT-1, Fig. 4a) shows higher ER values
    in the furrow area than in the plant area, suggesting that the furrow acts like
    a hydraulic barrier without water flow or root water uptake for subsurface drip
    irrigation. Furthermore, most of the patterns described in Fig. 4 are due to small
    differences in ER and only discernible when looking at the data log-transformed,
    therefore supporting the assumption that the soil profile is relatively uniform
    in absolute terms (24 h after the last irrigation event ended, Table 1). The ER
    patterns that are visible with the untransformed data are: (i) the higher ER values
    in the edges of the growing beds may be due to soil surface exposures of the edges,
    i.e., no crops covered the edges resulting in soil drier conditions due to the
    higher soil evaporation, and/or to geometry differences from the theoretical profile
    used to create the mesh for the ERT analysis; and (ii) the higher ER values in
    the top 20 cm on the right side of the ERT-2 profile, probably due to the higher
    roots density. Referring to the time-lapse results at ERT-1, during the irrigation
    event, the ER increased between the growing beds and decreased around the subsurface
    dripper line (between the two crops, where a lower root density is expected),
    suggesting the homogenous distribution of the irrigation water around the drippers
    and the simultaneous root water uptake patterns occurred on both sides of the
    bed, where the two tomato plants were located (Fig. 5). Note that the theoretical
    and the recognized optimized subsurface dripper locations at ERT-1 (Fig. A.1.-A)
    are shown also in Fig. 5 referring to the different monitored time-steps. Download

    and optimized dripper location marked with “x”. In the parallel direction to the

    in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, suggest areas where root water uptake was equal to the water
    addition from the irrigation and, therefore, no changes can be seen during the
    monitoring time period. These areas are identified on the sides of the drippers
    on the perpendicular transect (ERT-1) and at around 20 cm depth in the parallel
    transect (ERT-2). In addition, there are areas below the furrow with no changes,
    suggesting negligible root water uptake or water distribution processes. Download

    continuum monitoring During the experiment, the irrigation began at 10:30 in the
    morning, which was approximately 210 min after the first data set (T0) was collected
    (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res image (205KB) Download : Download full-size

    Table 1) and cumulative measured evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation during
    the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) campaign (green and blue line, respectively).
    The ET values began to increase around 7:30 AM prior to irrigation, and they reached
    their highest point at 14.00 PM, which is when the T4 ERT data set was recorded
    (Fig. 2). Later on, the ET values continued to go down, and by the time the last
    data set was collected (T7), the ET values had hit 0.3 mm/h. After that, they
    went down until they reached zero by the end of the day (which was at 18:00 PM).
    Over the entirety of the time period, the rates of irrigation were greater than
    the rates of tree transpiration. SWC measured by the TDRs installed in the middle
    of the row showed a gradual decrease in VWC during the first part of the day (Fig.
    7). At 46 cm depth, the SWC began to increase when the inputs (irrigation amount)
    became larger than the output (ET fluxes), showing evidence of simultaneous wetting
    and drying processes until then, reducing any observable changes in either SWC
    or ER in the soil. At 61 cm depth, the SWC increased sharply at 9:30 PM (Fig.
    7). Soil temperature fluctuations during the ERT campaign were observed only at
    30 cm, while deeper sensors showed no change. Relative soil temperature changes
    (RelT, Fig. A.3.-A) were calculated with Eq. (4), where Ti is the temperature
    at T0 and T is the temperature at each time step: (4) These fluctuations were
    less than 1 °C and a total of up to 2 % of the soil temperature at the beginning
    of the ERT campaign. Relative soil pore water EC changes, estimated using TDR
    data, were also up to 2 % from the soil pore water EC at T0 (Fig. A.3.-A). Deeper
    soil solution measurements at 1.60 and 2.62 m showed stable soil pore water EC
    of about 1 dS/m before, during and after the ERT campaign, 3.2.1. Crop water status
    determinations The CWSI resulted in similar average values ranging from 0.31 to
    0.47 and from 0.27 to 0.41 at ERT-1 and ERT-2, respectively, using different (Tc
    − Ta)UL baselines (i.e. 8 °C, 4.6 °C and 2.8 °C for the site-specific conditions),
    and as reported by Irmak et al. (2000) and López-López et al., 2009, López-López
    et al., 2011. The temporal evolution of the CWSI, using these upper baselines,
    during the time-lapse ERT surveys (ERT-1 and ERT-2) is given in Fig. A.4-A. Fig.
    A.4-A. shows similar CWSI increasing trend in accordance with the atmospheric
    water demand and irrigation application. In particular, lower CSWI values were
    obtained early in the morning and after 7 h since the beginning of the irrigation
    phase; whereas, higher values were observed in the hottest hours of the day (Fig.
    3). In absolute terms, similar values were obtained for the CWSI formulations
    obtained with the local upper baseline and the value provided by López-López et
    al., 2009, López-López et al., 2011. A strong relationship was observed between
    the average ER changes (%) and CWSI obtained in time under the site-specific condition
    at ERT-1 (R2 = 0.83); whereas a weak relationship was achieved for ERT-2 (Fig.
    A.5.-A). 3.2.2. Relationships between soil and plant interactions At T0, before
    the irrigation started, there was a negative correlation between longitudinal
    ER in ERT-2 and NDVI (Fig. A.6.-A). This could evidence that even though higher
    biomass will result in higher transpiration, it will also result in higher soil
    water depletion and lower evaporation, therefore causing higher VWC (and therefore
    lower ER) two days after the last irrigation in areas with healthier vegetation.
    At the end of the ERT campaign at T7, i.e., 7 h after the irrigation started and
    almost at the maximum cumulative daily ET (Fig. 7), there is a positive correlation
    between ERT-2 change and NDVI, suggesting a lower SWC for higher NDVI locations
    and an evidence of higher biomass transpiring more water during a combined irrigation
    and ET event (Fig. A.6.-A). Even though the correlations between ER and NDVI in
    ERT-1 are weaker than for ERT-2, they still show the same trend. This weaker relationship
    in ERT-1 could be explained by the less crop vigorousness (and even the presence
    of bare soil) in this transect, which results in a higher NDVI range (0.30–0.70
    versus 0.62–0.74 for ERT-2 and ERT-1, respectively), hindering the possible relationship
    between crop NDVI and the correspondent ER (and ER change) (Fig. A.6.-A). 3.3.
    Hydrological simulations Simulated and measured VWC decreased during the beginning
    of the irrigation event, following the measured trends in the soil water balance,
    with the cumulative ET becoming higher than the cumulative irrigation at 2:30
    PM (T5, Table 1, Fig. 7, Fig. 8). About an hour after T5, there was an increase
    in measured and modeled VWC at 26 cm below the drip line (Fig. 8-B – 46 cm mid),
    followed by a slight increase in the VWC at 30 cm below ground level and at a
    lateral distance of 30 cm from the middle of the growing bed and drip line around
    5:00 PM (Fig. 8-A). Download : Download high-res image (393KB) Download : Download

    resistivity tomography (ERT) campaign, for four locations relative to the subsurface
    dripper in a processing tomato field in Yolo County California during the 2021
    growing season. Shaded areas represent the 95 % confidence interval for the 50
    simulations with stochastic distributions of the hydraulic conductivity and pressure
    heads. The TDR sensors and observation points at 46 cm below the soil surface
    level and a lateral distance of 30 cm from the middle of the growing bed showed
    a slight increase of VWC after 8:00 PM (Fig. 8-B). At the same time, a sharper
    VWC increase was observed by the TDR at 40 cm below the drip line, while the model
    showed a more moderate increase in VWC (Fig. 8-C). The model and measured were
    not calibrated to match one-to-one, but homogeneous soil properties were used
    to simulate the general trends. The profile is assumed to be symmetrical by design,
    however, two TDRs located in the same relative position showed the same relative
    SWC changes with a consistent lag of 0.02 cm3cm−3 and a model that will be calibrated
    to one of the TDRs will not agree with the other side of the measurements. An
    example of the effect of this assumption can be observed in the evolution of TDR
    30–46 series (each series corresponds to a different side of the bed) (Fig. 8).
    In general, both series followed the same pattern, with few points not falling
    in the general trend. These discrepancies represent a limitation of the model,
    and evidence some uncertainties of the model (e.g., irrigation line misalignment,
    heterogeneity of root distribution among different crops). Both ERT and model
    capture the general shape and trends (Fig. 9). While the simulations assume symmetry
    of the soil profile, the changes in ER during the irrigation event provided with
    an opportunity to observe the relative changes at replications of the simulated
    half profile. The two central beds from the monitored area during the ERT campaign
    (Fig. 1-B) were segmented into 4-half growing beds representing the simulated
    profile (Fig. 9). The profiles were segmented vertically at the optimized dripper
    location (x in Fig. 9) and TDR locations relative to the optimized dripper. The
    relative changes in ER can be visually compared to relative SWC changes in the
    HYDRUS (2-D/3-D) simulations. In both the model and ERT measurements it can be
    observed that there are negligible changes in either SWC or ER in the observation
    nodes located to the side of the dripper until T4. These modeled and measured
    results are in agreement with the observed higher ET than irrigation until 2:30
    PM (T5). Areas of decrease in SWC and increase in ER are observed as expected
    in the middle of the profile, where plants are located. Even though a clear wetting
    front profile is observed in the simulations, with a symmetrical circle around
    the dripper as expected in a clay loam soil, this theoretical pattern is not observed
    in the ERT change data (Fig. 9). Download : Download high-res image (699KB) Download

    minimally invasive techniques (i.e., geophysical and proximal sensing-based measurements)
    and hydrological modelling has provided site-specific information on soil water
    distribution and its interactions with crop features in a subsurface drip irrigated
    processing tomato field. Specifically, the results of this study highlight the
    practical role of the time-lapse geo-electrical approach for supporting the precision
    irrigation management (Vanella et al., 2021, Vanella et al., 2022, Vanella et
    al., 2023), and providing new insights to identify the subsurface dripper location.
    Specifically, this study promotes the use of relative ER changes as a proxy of
    SWC changes, being known that the absolute translation of ER into SWC is prone
    to additional uncertainty (does not deepen in this study; refer to Chen and Niu,
    2022; Tso et al., 2019). Moreover, the potential of our findings is enhanced when
    the ERT surveys are applied in combination with other SPAC measurements (i.e.,
    micrometeorological, multispectral and thermal information, and TDR sensors).
    Note that each available SPAC monitoring/modelling method may suffer from specific
    limitations, e.g., the scale of applications or the resolutions, that in some
    cases may be overcome with the advantages associated with the adoption of multiple
    methods (e.g., point-based measurements versus spatially distributed information).
    As a practical recommendation, the selection of the optimal approach depends on
    the desired target, the available costs (such as for the instrumentation and labor)
    and the response time in terms of data processing duration. Herein, the inferred
    SWC changes by ERT were highly linked with the root water uptake as evidenced
    by the multispectral and thermal sensed crop monitoring responses. As example,
    a direct relationship was obtained between the CWSI and changes in ER (Fig. A.6.-A);
    showing higher ER changes (suggesting lower SWC), when CWSI increases as well.
    These results show the potential of time-lapse ERT in describing the CWSI within
    an irrigation event (Garré et al., 2011). Moreover, in our research conditions,
    the aerial-based NDVI patterns resulted inversely correlated with the absolute
    ER values acquired before the irrigation event (T0), suggesting higher soil water
    depletion in areas with higher plant biomass (Fig. A.8). Similarly, the NDVI was
    directly correlated to the ER changes at the end of the ERT survey, proposing
    that areas with higher plant biomass had more water removed from the soil during
    the day, than areas with lower NDVI. These findings are supported by visual-based
    observations conducted in the field. This is also in agreement with other studies
    that linked the crop features (e.g., detected by multispectral or other plant-based
    methods) with the ER-inferred SWC information (e.g., Brillante et al., 2015; Cassiani
    et al., 2015; Rossi et al., 2018; Vanella et al., 2018). No clear root water uptake
    patters were depicted in ERT-2, where some areas with an increase in ER, with
    time were identified as zones with lower NDVI, suggesting lower canopy density
    and, therefore, higher soil evaporation, probably related to plant establishment
    after transplanting (Vanella et al., 2023). Interesting insights have been provided
    when ERT, hydrological modelling and ground-based soil moisture measurements using
    TDR were compared. Specifically, the comparison of TDR and HYDRUS-derived SWC
    values showed high accuracies at 30 cm and 60 cm, whereas higher discrepancies
    occurred at 46 cm positions (Fig. 8). These higher discrepancies are probably
    due to the fact that, when setting the initial modelling conditions, i.e., the
    root density, it was considered only one half of the bed (i.e. one plant). However,
    it is expected that at the center of the bed, an overlapping between the root
    system of the two crops occur, resulting in a hypothetically higher root density.
    This higher root density would result in a lower modeled SWC, being this decrement
    more evident at “46 cm Side” position. Thus, if this overlapping would have been
    considered, it is expected that the values modeled by HYDRUS and the ones provided
    by TDR had been more similar to each other. In general, faster soil water infiltration
    was observed at ERT-,1 than modeled or measured with TDR sensors (Fig. 8). Also,
    ERT-2 showed greater vertical water redistribution after the beginning of the
    irrigation event. While clear wetting bulbs were visually identified in ERT-1,
    the results obtained at ERT-2 confirms the assumption that the soil water distribution
    along the subsurface drip irrigation line is close enough to create a linear wetting
    pattern in the direction along the line instead of radial water distribution (Fig.
    5, Fig. 6). Vanella et al. (2021) have already highlighted the potential of time-lapse
    ERT monitoring in depicting the shapes of the wetting bulbs. In addition, in relative
    terms the variability between the relative TDR locations in the ERT repetitions
    along the ERT-1 transect was lower and averaged ∼2 % (Appendix B). In general,
    the variability in the ER profiles decreased with depth in both transects (Fig.
    5, Fig. 6, A.2.-A, C.1.-C and C.3.-C). This behavior is in agreement with the
    hydrological modeled results (Figs. 9, C.2.-C) and with previous ERT-based studies
    that found that the maximum root mass distribution is mainly located in the shallow
    subsoil for herbaceous crops (e.g., Amato et al., 2008). Moreover, even if the
    ER variability decreased with time, the SWC values increased. The assumption is
    that the ER values at the beginning of the simulation, when the soil is expected
    to be drier, may be influenced by other factors, such as soil texture, salinity,
    even soil temperature. Then, when the irrigation begins and water redistributes,
    the SWC becomes the factor of highest influence on ER changes, and, therefore,
    acts as a homogenizing factor for ER. As well-known, the soil ER is dependent
    on several parameters referring both to the static and state proprieties of the
    soil (Samouëlian et al., 2005). In this study, we applied the ratio inversion
    ER time-lapse approach in order to minimize the contributions of these multiple
    variables on soil ER and addressing the ER change for the most to the SWC changes.
    In particular, note also that, the time-lapse ERT surveys were carried out at
    the same locations (ERT-1 and ERT-2) and during the ERT acquisitions the soil
    temperature and EC of the soil pore solution changes were lower than 2 %, thus,
    the soil temperature and salinity effect on ER was ignored. On the other hand,
    the HYDRUS 2-D/3-D domain is either (i) completely ideally homogeneous with the
    only factor influencing the variability being the SWC redistribution, as a consequence
    of irrigation-water and root uptake-water flow or (ii) characterized by a theoretical
    heterogeneity as presented in this work. As example, the comparison between ERT
    and HYDRUS evidenced that water is moving down faster than how is modeled by HYDRUS,
    suggesting a limitation of the use of models for this kind of analysis, especially
    the critical role that the setting of the initial conditions has on the final
    obtained results. Thus, the initial variability observed in terms of ER, together
    with the related inversion uncertainty, can be used to set-up site-specific hydrological
    domains using integrated approaches (Rao et al., 2020, Tso et al., 2020) also
    based on coupled numerical models and/or data assimilation methods (Mary et al.,
    2021). 5. Conclusions This study represents an attempt to approach the soil water
    dynamics monitoring from a multi-perspective point-of-view. Of course, this is
    a complex challenge and herein we do not have the claim to propose an integrated
    SPAC monitoring approach, but at least to present the potential of using several
    stand-alone monitoring methods to describe the main soil-plant interactions under
    subsurface irrigation context. In this sense, multiple 2-D time-lapse ERT measurements,
    carried out in transects in perpendicular (ERT-1) and parallel (ERT-2) to the
    subsurface drip irrigation line, provided in-situ insights of water redistribution,
    resulting in concurrent soil wetting and drying patterns, because of simultaneous
    irrigation and root water uptake processes in a tomato field. Moreover, the ERT
    design applied in the present study allowed us to evaluate the ER distribution
    in the third dimension not considered in each single transect in a pseudo 3D manner.
    In particular, slight ER increases were observed in in the active root zone on
    the sides of the dripper in ERT-1 and in the top 20 cm in ERT-2, whereas close
    to the drippers, an ER decrease occurred both in ERT-1 and ERT-2. Thus, the two
    ERT transects showed different potentialities, being ERT-1 more useful for defining
    the lateral expansion of the wet bulbs, whereas ERT-2 allowed evaluating the performance
    of the irrigation system (e.g. dripper clogging would result in an increase of
    ER). Moreover, the use of ancillary data acquired by proximal sensing techniques,
    such as CWSI and NDVI, has evidenced of how the crop water status processes affected
    the soil dynamics inferred by ERT and vice versa. The ERT measurements permitted
    to depict the high spatial variability of the SWC distribution as derived from
    the different TDR-based observation points located in symmetrical locations from
    the drip line. Therefore, it was not realistic or possible to directly compare
    ERT changes and VWC measurements at specific locations. Finally, a 1-to-1 comparison
    of a 2-D HYDRUS hydrological model and changes in ERT during the irrigation event
    further confirmed the slight changes in ER at the TDR locations due to simultaneous
    wetting and root water uptake processes. However, the study highlights the critical
    role of the setting of the initial modelling conditions has on the final obtained
    results. CRediT authorship contribution statement Iael Raij Hoffman: Conceptualization,

  description: Irrigation system is widely used in agriculture sector and has significant
    impacts to the growth of the plantation or crops. Traditional method of irrigation
    system always counter problems such as time consuming, human labour cost, inefficient
    of water usage and monitoring challenging throughout the process. Thus to address
    the issues, this paper proposed the development of smart irrigation system that
    embedded various types of sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) platform used for
    monitoring plant growth. In this work, there are three module have been developed
    which are hardware, software and integration module of the proposed system. In
    hardware module, Raspberry Pi is used to calculate and process the data based
    on the sensors parameters. Different types of sensors have been employed such
    as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, ultrasonic and vision sensors. In this
    framework, the reading of soil moisture sensor was obtained from the base station.
    The Raspberry Pi will receive the information and starts to pump the water from
    the tank until the condition of soil moisture content is normal (i.e. reach the
    threshold value). In addition, the DHT22 sensor will act as the monitoring system
    in terms of temperature and humidity data. While, the ultrasonic sensor will send
    the information to the microprocessor and calculate the water level. Furthermore,
    the webcam vision is used for monitoring the plant growth during the day and night.
    While, the dripping process runs in real-time application to the plant. The microcontroller
    ESP8266 used to control the state of ON or OFF light bulb depending on the value
    of LDR sensor. Based on the results and monitoring process, the proposed smart
    irrigation system able to works in promising environment with real time data in
    which it has been monitored through the IoT platform.

  description: Irrigation plays a crucial role in maize cultivation, as watering is
    essential for optimizing crop yield and quality, particularly given maize’s sensitivity
    to soil moisture variations. In the current study, a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory
    (LSTM) approach is presented aiming to predict irrigation scheduling in maize
    fields in Bursa, Turkey. A critical aspect of the study was the use of the Aquacrop
    7.0 model to simulate soil moisture content (MC) data due to data limitations
    in the investigated fields. This simulation model, developed by the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO), helped overcome gaps in soil sensor data, enhancing the LSTM
    model’s predictions. The LSTM model was trained and tuned using a combination
    of soil, weather, and satellite-based plant vegetation data in order to predict
    soil moisture content (MC) reductions. The study’s results indicated that the
    LSTM model, supported by Aquacrop 7.0 simulations, was effective in predicting
    MC reduction across various time phases of the maize growing season, attaining
    R2 values ranging from 0.8163 to 0.9181 for Field 1 and from 0.7602 to 0.8417
    for Field 2, demonstrating the potential of this approach for precise and efficient
    agricultural irrigation practices.

    Abstract Irrigation plays a crucial role in maize cultivation, as watering is
    essential for optimizing crop yield and quality, particularly given maize’s sensitivity
    to soil moisture variations. In the current study, a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory
    (LSTM) approach is presented aiming to predict irrigation scheduling in maize
    fields in Bursa, Turkey. A critical aspect of the study was the use of the Aquacrop
    7.0 model to simulate soil moisture content (MC) data due to data limitations
    in the investigated fields. This simulation model, developed by the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO), helped overcome gaps in soil sensor data, enhancing the LSTM
    model’s predictions. The LSTM model was trained and tuned using a combination
    of soil, weather, and satellite-based plant vegetation data in order to predict
    soil moisture content (MC) reductions. The study’s results indicated that the
    LSTM model, supported by Aquacrop 7.0 simulations, was effective in predicting
    MC reduction across various time phases of the maize growing season, attaining
    R2 values ranging from 0.8163 to 0.9181 for Field 1 and from 0.7602 to 0.8417
    for Field 2, demonstrating the potential of this approach for precise and efficient
    agricultural irrigation practices. Keywords: precision agriculture; artificial

    demand for global food production inevitably leads to the increased irrigation
    and water use of several farming practices, leading to the consumption of 70%
    of the available freshwater globally [1]. Conventional irrigation scheduling is
    mostly based on the farmers’ estimations and experience resulting in the reduction
    of available water for irrigation and it usually takes place in an open-loop fashion,
    where the supplied irrigation volume and the prevailing soil water status are
    indirectly connected; consequently, they appear ineffective mostly due to their
    inability to take into account site-specific, spatially variable factors and weather
    conditions occurring in the irrigated area. For the above reasons, it is crucial
    to implement sustainable, yet effective water management practices towards the
    optimal crop health status, yield, and the minimization of water consumption and
    cost. Precision irrigation practices are based on the assessment of the accurate
    water volume and irrigation period required site-specific to each field, so as
    to enhance yield productivity while also reducing the farmers’ labor costs. The
    above tasks can be achieved through monitoring the soil moisture levels. Soil
    moisture is a critical variable in hydrological, climatic, and agricultural processes,
    influencing everything from plant growth to land-atmosphere interactions. The
    presence of soil moisture is beneficial for agricultural productivity, as it has
    the potential to enhance several physiological and biochemical processes associated
    with crop development and, subsequently, crop yield. Therefore, by acquiring knowledge
    about the soil moisture content, farmers can obtain valuable insights on optimal
    timing for sowing and growing crops, adequacy of soil infiltration, and sufficiency
    of the water supply needed to facilitate crop root growth. The realization and
    understanding of these procedures increases the need for the investigation of
    novel approaches that are capable of precisely estimating the level of soil MC
    in a specific location [2]. For the above reasons, continuous and accurate soil
    moisture records are very important for research and practical applications. However,
    obtaining such records can be challenging due to sensor malfunctions, data transmission
    errors, or environmental interferences [3]. For several decades, the assessment
    of irrigation needs in agricultural systems has relied on the application of conventional
    deterministic and empirical models. These models, rooted in established principles
    and equations, have served as the foundational framework for understanding and
    quantifying the water requirements essential for optimal crop growth. This approach
    has been instrumental in shaping irrigation strategies and resource management
    practices within the agricultural domain, contributing significantly to the sustainable
    development of crop cultivation methodologies. The applied models are typically
    based on already known relationships between key variables such as soil moisture,
    evapotranspiration (ET) rates, environmental conditions, and crop growth stages,
    however, they often fail to take into consideration some other important variables
    affecting irrigation needs, including spatial soil variability, which is attributed
    to natural variation in soil properties and characteristics even within the same
    investigated field. To overcome these limitations, the effective combination of
    deterministic and empirical models, coupled with advanced computational technologies
    such as machine learning (ML), can provide more accurate and adaptive irrigation
    management approaches. ML models can effectively predict key variables in irrigation,
    including ET and MC, with minimal human intervention by capturing their complex
    relationships, adapting to changing conditions, and incorporating nonlinear and
    interactive effects, elevating the potential to revolutionize the prediction of
    soil properties [4]. Wu et al. [5] developed a two-level ensemble model using
    ML models for the estimation of daily evapotranspiration (ETo). The first level
    included Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron
    (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), while the second layer contained the Linear
    Regression (LR) model, employed as the meta-learner for results extraction. The
    applied model demonstrated high accuracy, with coefficient of determination (R2)
    values ranging from 0.66 to 0.99. Other common ML approaches for the investigation
    and prediction of MC dynamics included the application of support vector machines
    (SVMs) [6] and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) [7] for simulating
    times series regarding soil MC, utilizing weather, precipitation, and crop coefficient
    data as input. The aforementioned traditional ML approaches demonstrated satisfactory
    performances compared to the deterministic and physical models, however they appeared
    sensitive to different environmental conditions, unstable in offering reliable
    predictions for the entire range of soil MC levels, and weak in providing insightful
    conclusions when employed in different regions than those that they were initially
    calibrated and developed in. In addition to the weaknesses of traditional ML models,
    the common ANNs models have been widely applied, but they are also limited in
    modelling dynamic data and approximating complex processes due to their tendency
    to lose previously attained and processed information, too [8]. There are some
    commonly applied techniques in order to enhance the performance of the traditional
    ANNs for time series prediction including the addition of extra steps during pre-processing
    [9] and parameters adjustment with the help of genetic algorithms [10]. However,
    preprocessing techniques are time-consuming due to their high dependency on time
    and frequency, and they negatively affect the models’ adaptability to unknown
    environments. The above ambiguities often pose disastrous results to the models’
    prediction performances especially when dealing with highly causal systems. One
    further technique to improve the performance of traditional ANNs is the employment
    of sliding windows. Sliding windows can be employed in an ANN by arranging sequential
    data into windows of defined length that can either overlap or not overlap with
    each other. These windows are then used as input for the model. However, these
    models lack inherent memory mechanisms to retain information from past inputs.
    Each window is treated independently, and the network does not naturally capture
    long-term dependencies in sequential data [11]. For the above reasons, robust
    and scalable data-driven models, in the form of Deep Learning (DL) models, such
    as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), radial basis function networks (RBFN),
    long short-term memory networks (LSTM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and deep
    belief network (DBN) are employed. Their efficacy lays in their special design’s
    ability to recognize complex patterns through capturing and retaining information
    among large sequential data, and to manage high-dimensional and spatiotemporal
    data resulting in accurate predictions. Among the above-mentioned prediction algorithms,
    the RBFN and LSTM are regarded as highly effective computational tools utilized
    for learning sequential data and are more suitable for predicting time series.
    More specifically, the efficiency of the LSTM models can be attributed to their
    architecture; they are structured of recurrent connected block units that are
    composed of at least one memory cell in order to store and access the information
    for a certain period. The existence of at least one memory cell helps to raise
    their efficiency, while also lowering the gradient error [12]. The self-looped
    cells of the LSTM model are capable of learning long-term temporal dependencies
    in sequential data, simultaneously retaining the information from previous time
    steps [8]. Agyeman et al. [13] developed a predictive control model with discrete
    actuators for predicting irrigation scheduling. In this approach, the soil–water–atmosphere
    system is evaluated with the help of an LSTM model, aiming to assess the optimal
    water uptake in crops. Jetitha and Rajesh [14] proposed a novel approach for irrigation
    scheduling based on a deep bi-directional LSTM model Deep Data Logger and Irrigation
    Activator Unit (D2LIAU). The results indicated that the DBLSTM-based D2LIAU approach
    enables efficient irrigation scheduling with a significantly higher degree of
    reliability in irrigation monitoring since it manages to save water consumption
    from 21.96% to 63.05% when compared to other controlled irrigation practices.
    The main aim of the current study is to demonstrate a hybrid LSTM approach for
    irrigation scheduling prediction. The irrigation needs have been predicted taking
    into account soil, weather, and vegetation data. An LSTM model has been employed
    so as to investigate the predictive capabilities of soil MC reduction per day
    based on the acquired weather data including average daily air temperature, the
    total daily solar radiation (SR), the average daily relative humidity (RH), and
    also the Leaf Area Index (LAI) in two maize fields located in Bakırköy village
    in Karacabey, Turkey. Maize, a widely cultivated cereal crop, is particularly
    sensitive to variations in moisture levels [3]. The study employed an LSTM model
    that integrates data from three distinct sources, including soil sensors, a weather
    station, and satellite imagery. The data measurements from soil sensors, the weather
    station and satellite were acquired on a daily basis for the entire investigated
    period. In order to overcome the lack of MC missing values in Field 1 and the
    limited number of soil MC measurements obtained from only four soil sensors in
    Field 2, the water-driven model Aquacrop 7.0 has been used [15,16] in order to
    compute the daily MC and to acquire data from two extra locations within Field
    2 for the entire investigated period. The limited number of soil measurements
    during the investigated cultivation period has been attributed to some difficulties
    encountered in establishing a reliable and continuous data transmission channel
    between the sensors responsible for MC measurements and the data logger. These
    transmission issues significantly affected the quantity of the MC data collected.
    Aquacrop 7.0 is regarded as a reliable tool due to its proven capability of simulating
    successfully parameters used as input data. These types of data can include soil
    MC, evapotranspiration (ET), and yield in the occasion that they fail to be measured
    in a continuous and accurate manner during experimental field measurements [17].
    In the current study, the failure of acquiring continuous and accurate records
    is often attributed to sensor malfunctions and data transmission errors. However,
    the performance of the LSTM model reveals its significant potential in efficiently
    predicting the future MC reduction in maize fields, overcoming the model’s physical
    tendency to be influenced by the availability and quality of data which is attributed
    both to its architecture and the simulation effect of Aquacrop, introducing novel
    techniques towards more efficient and precise agricultural irrigation practices
    and patterns. Moreover, the current approach encourages the adoption of site-specific
    irrigation patterns that enable Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI), paving the way
    towards enhancing the annual production yields of grains. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Study Area and Data Collection The experimental fields were located in Bakırköy
    village in Karacabey, Turkey (40°08′22.61′ N, 28°22′58.7′ E). An 8.2-ha field
    named Field 1 and a 2.5-ha field named Field 2 cultivated with maize were investigated
    (Figure 1). The type of soil in both fields is alluvial, while the soil texture
    characteristics differ since their percentage content varied between sand, clay,
    and loam clay. The determination of the mechanical composition of the soil was
    performed using the Bouyoucos hydrometer method. The results of this method are
    presented in Section 2.2.4 of this work. The field study was conducted during
    the 2022 growing season. The seeding took place on 16 May in Field 1 and on 11
    May in Field 2. The irrigation system that was utilized was the drip irrigation
    method. Figure 1. A view of the investigated maize fields (Field1 and Field 2).
    The irrigation water is supplied from the buried pressurized irrigation network.
    Field 1 was located in a 20-ha production field that was divided into five irrigation
    plots, each with a maximum area of 4.0 ha. Field 1 coincided with three of these
    plots. Deficit irrigation is common in the region, which was also used in this
    study. The row spacing of the maize crop was 0.7 m, irrigation lateral line spacing
    was 1.4 m, and the number of drippers was 18,000 per hectare during the irrigations.
    Inline linear drippers (Eurodrip -Eolos, Rivulis, Israel) were used in the irrigations
    with an irrigation intensity of 28.8 t/h-ha at an operating pressure of 3 bar.
    A manual valve was used to adjust the specified operating pressure (3.0 bar) of
    the drippers at the end of the secondary irrigation lines to ensure that the water
    pressure is not below 3.0 bar at the most distant lateral. An analog pressure
    gauge (Pakkens 0–6 bar) was used to measure the pressure at the end of the secondary
    (Field 1) and main lines (Field 2). For each irrigation, the farmer changed the
    irrigation time from 6 h to 10 h per irrigation. The farmer utilizes crop water
    demands given in the irrigation guide for the Bursa-Karacabey district and the
    weather station (Metos IMT280) data to determine the application rate for each
    irrigation. The frequency of the irrigations was affected not only by the technical
    data but also the availability of the labor since the irrigation system was not
    automatically controlled. In the early growth stages of the maize crop, the irrigations
    were done in 2–3 days whereas in the rest of the irrigation season the irrigations
    were done in 4–10 days depending on the aforementioned conditions. This type of
    pressurized irrigation system offers several advantages, including a high degree
    of linear control over the water application, optimal nutrient intake, the optimization
    of water usage, and the reduction of water resources waste [18,19]). The quantity
    and placement of the sensors were made according to the relative MZs constructed
    for irrigation. MZs were created based on the precise spatial data of predicted
    soil MC and clay. The aforementioned data were acquired on 28 June 2021 from visible
    and near-infrared spectral measurements, using the online multi-sensor platform
    developed by Mouazen [20]. The data for the development of the utilized LSTM model
    for soil moisture prediction were acquired from three distinct sources including
    soil sensors, a weather station, and satellite-based plant vegetation data. A
    cloud-based LoRA-WAN wireless network was used so that data from soil sensors
    could be constantly collected (Figure 2). The study involved the deployment of
    nine Dragino LSE01 soil sensors in various areas within Field 1, as well as four
    soil sensors in Field 2. The soil sensors were installed vertically at 30 cm depth
    to monitor the soil MC ((%) VWC), apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) (uS/cm),
    and soil temperature (°C). The sensors enable MC measurements using frequency
    domain reflectometry (FDR), and the accuracy of the MC sensors was reported to
    be ±3% by the manufacturer [21]. The accuracy of the sensors was checked during
    the irrigation season once by collecting soil samples at sensor locations, resulting
    in approximately 3–5% errors in soil moisture measurements. No further investigations
    were done to check or improve the measurement accuracy of MC sensors. The sensor
    network gateway was posed about 800 m away from the sensors in a clear view of
    sight. A commercial weather station (Metos IMT280) located near the farm center
    and 3.5 km away from the experimental field was used to collect weather data,
    including air temperature (°C), dew point temperature (°C), solar radiation (W/m2),
    vapor pressure (kPa), relative humidity (%), rainfall (mm), wind speed and instant
    wind speed (km/h), and daily evapotranspiration (mm). Figure 2. LoRa-WAN used
    for soil moisture collection. The availability of free-of-cost, high resolution
    satellite datasets (finer than 30 m) was obtained from sensors such as Sentinel-2
    and advanced open-source tools such as Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). This
    tool offers accurate and consistent values of LAI. Sentinel-2 images at 10 m resolution
    were used to derive LAI using the built-in Biophysical processor, also called
    the Sentinel-2 Land bio-physical processor (SL2P), within the SNAP Toolbox. The
    Biophysical processor uses eight reflectance bands (B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8A, B11,
    and B12) [22]. The utilized Sentinel-2 product was Level-2A. The LAI values were
    obtained from satellite images captured on 23, 26 and 28 June, as well as on 1,
    3, 8, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23 and 26 July and 2 August 2022. It is worthy to note that
    deliberate emphasis has been placed on the selection of imagery acquired on days
    characterized by optimal meteorological conditions. Emphasis was also given to
    instances featuring clear skies, abundant sunlight, and an absence of cloud cover,
    in order to ensure the acquisition of high-quality satellite imagery, defining
    the basis for a precise and reliable extraction of the Leaf Area Index (LAI).
    Recognizing the necessity for a continuous dataset, a linear interpolation method
    was implemented for those days that satellite images were not available. The interpolation
    technique involved leveraging the acquired data points to estimate LAI values
    for the sensor location pixel for the non-captured days, providing a seamless
    and comprehensive analysis for the entire monitoring period and bridging any temporal
    gaps within the dataset. Finally, for the days before the 23 June 2022, the values
    of LAI were equal to 0 as the crop was at the initial stages of growth. LAI, as
    an essential biophysical parameter of vegetation, is a dimensionless variable
    representing the ratio of leaf area to per unit ground surface area. This ratio
    is associated with gas-vegetation exchange processes including photosynthesis,
    evaporation, transpiration, and rainfall interception [23]. 2.2. Methods 2.2.1.
    The Long Short-Term Memory Model (LSTM) Process In the current study, a long short-term
    memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN) has been developed. RNNs belong to
    a more complex and advanced type of ANNs networks that are well-suited for modeling
    sequential inputs, such as speech data and natural language data, among others.
    The structure of RNNs is similar to that of feed-forward neural networks or artificial
    neural networks (ANNs). However, RNNs differ from ANNs in that they possess cyclic
    connections, in contrast to the acyclic nature of ANNs. In a typical ANN, information
    tends to flow only in one direction, moving from the input layer through hidden
    layers to the output layer. However, the cyclic connections that characterize
    RNN correspond to the feedback connections between the neurons that allow information
    to be fed back from the output layer to the hidden layers. This special feedback
    design enhances the RNN networks’ capability to learn from their own predictions
    based on previously attained information and refine their representations and
    predictive performance over time. This kind of architecture can be particularly
    useful when dealing with tasks where temporal dependencies or context are crucial,
    like in the occasion of time-series data handling. The cyclic connections enable
    the network to capture and leverage feedback information, making it more effective
    in tasks like sequence modeling [24]. More specifically, in the occasion of a
    RNN, the neurons inside a layer have the capability to establish connections with
    one another, including the possibility of self-connections, a feature that was
    previously not allowed in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Due to their inherent
    cyclic structure, RNNs leverage past inputs to calculate outputs at each iteration,
    enabling them to retain a memory of prior events. This memory is utilized to facilitate
    subsequent predictions. The presence of cyclic links enables the integration of
    prior information into the decision-making process [25]. The diagram in Figure
    3 illustrates the architecture of a recurrent neural network. Figure 3. Structure
    of typical recurrent neural network. Each neuron forms connections with the neurons
    in its own layer, as well as with the neurons in the preceding and next layers,
    and with itself. The LSTM model has been introduced by Hochreiter, and belongs
    to the broader category of RNN models, but in a more revolutionized version. The
    main advantage of LSTM over typical RNNs lies in their short-term memory availability.
    Consequently, as we move on to the next layers, the gradients are preserved so
    that the weight factors are updated and in the occasion that the short-term memory
    is in bidirectional means, the information is preserved in both directions [26].
    Regarding its architecture, the LSTM model is composed of one block with three
    gates, namely the Input Gate, the Forget Gate and the Output Gate. Each gate’s
    activation probability ranges from 0 to 1 corresponding to an open gate and a
    closed gate, respectively. There are some cells capable of recalling information
    and forwarding it to the next gate, while the hidden layer unit in RNN is replaced
    by three gates. The main objective of an LSTM model is to get the output variable
    𝑂 𝑡 by utilizing the equations denoted in Equations (1)–(6). In order to control
    the information flow within the LSTM network, each LSTM unit consists of a hidden
    state vector ℎ 𝑡 , a cell memory state vector 𝐶 𝑡 , and three gates. The architecture
    of an LSTM is presented in Figure 4. Figure 4. Architecture of an LSTM cell, comprising
    three special gates: Input Gate (i), Forget Gate (f), and Output Gate (O). These
    gates control which information is going to be retained, forgotten, and maintained,
    and the volume of information. The first gate ( 𝑓 𝑡 ) is called the Forget Gate,
    which controls to what extent should specific information from the prior cell
    memory state ( 𝐶 𝑡−1 ) be disregarded. The Forget Gate’s output vector is represented
    in Equation (1) as follows: 𝑓 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑤 𝑓 𝐼 𝑡 + 𝑧 𝑓 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑓 ), (1) where 𝑓 𝑡
    denotes the sigmoid activation function that takes values in the set {0,1}, 𝐼
    𝑡 is the input sequence, 𝑤 𝑓 and 𝑧 𝑓 are the adjustable weight parameters, and
    𝑏 𝑓 is the bias vector. At the initial time instant (t = 0), the variables ℎ 𝑡
    and 𝐶 𝑡 are initialized with a vector equal to zero as specified by the user-defined
    parameters of the network. Then, the cell memory state vector undergoes an update
    through the use of a hyperbolic tangent layer, namely the tanh function, which
    is mathematically demonstrated in Equation (2) as follows: 𝐶 𝑡 =𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑤 𝑐 𝐼 𝑡
    + 𝑧 𝑐 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑐 ), (2) where 𝐶 𝑡 ∈ {−1,1}, and 𝑤 𝑐 , 𝑧 𝑐 , and 𝑏 𝑐 are additional
    coefficients that can be learned. Furthermore, the output of the second gate,
    known as the Input Gate, regulates the information that is utilized so as to update
    the cell memory state 𝐶 𝑡 at the present time. This is expressed in Equation (3)
    as follows: 𝑖 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑤 𝑖 𝐼 𝑡 + 𝑧 𝑖 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑖 ), (3) where 𝑖 𝑡 ∈{0,1} is sigmoid
    function, and 𝑤 𝑖 , 𝑧 𝑖 , 𝑏 𝑖 are another set of learnable coefficients for the
    input gate. Using the outcomes of Equations (1) and (3), the cell memory state
    vector is modified as follows: 𝐶 𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑡 ⊙ 𝐶 𝑡−1 + 𝑖 𝑡 ⊙ 𝐶 𝑡 , (4) where ⊙ represents
    the multiplication between the gate and cell memory state vector elements. The
    first term of Equation (4) can be interpreted as the information that must be
    forgotten from the previous cell memory state vector 𝐶 𝑡−1 and the information
    that must be stored 𝑓 𝑡 close to one). Similarly, the second term can be interpreted
    as the degree to which new input information must be stored ( 𝑖 𝑡 close to 1)
    and the information that can be neglected ( 𝑖 𝑡 close to 0). The third and final
    gate is the Output Gate ( 𝑂 𝑡 ), which regulates the volume of information acquired
    from the current cell memory state vector, transferred to the next hidden state
    ℎ 𝑡 , and is represented in Equation (5) as follows: 𝑂 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑤 𝑜 𝐼 𝑡 + 𝑧 𝑜 ℎ 𝑡−1
    + 𝑏 𝑜 ), (5) where 𝑂 𝑡 ∈{0,1} is sigmoid function, and 𝑤 𝑜 , 𝑧 𝑜 , and 𝑏 𝑜 are
    the set of learnable coefficients for the output gate. In addition, the new hidden
    state ℎ 𝑡 is calculated using Equations (4) and (5), and it can be expressed as
    follows: ℎ 𝑡 =𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝐶 𝑡 )⊙ 𝑂 𝑡 . (6) Then, the final output of the Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) layer is forwarded to a completely connected dense layer that consists
    of a single neuron. The ultimate predicted output, denoted as 𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 , is calculated
    by Equation (7): 𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 = 𝑤 𝑑 ℎ 𝑘 + 𝑏 𝑑 , (7) where ℎ k is the output of the final
    LSTM layer, 𝑤 𝑑 and 𝑏 𝑑 are the weight coefficients and bias term of the fully
    connected dense layer [27]. 2.2.2. LSTM Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
    The soil measurements concerned the following variables: electrical conductivity
    (ECa), soil temperature, and moisture content (MC). In this study, MC has been
    solely utilized as the target variable that the model seeks to predict. More specifically,
    the daily MC reduction was determined through utilizing the value of MC for each
    sensor on a daily basis. The soil sensor data were acquired from mid-June to August
    3rd. However, sporadic missing values occurred as a result of transmission failures
    in the data logger. In order to address this issue and acquire a thorough dataset
    regarding the sowing dates, specifically on 11 May for Field 2 and on 16 May for
    Field 1, the Aquacrop program was employed to simulate the moisture content on
    a daily basis. Furthermore, in Field 2, due to the limited number of measurements
    obtained from the four soil sensors, the Aquacrop program was employed to acquire
    data from two extra locations inside the field throughout the entire period. The
    weather measurements were obtained by the utilization of a weather station. The
    meteorological data that was used consisted of the average daily air temperature,
    the total daily solar radiation, and the average daily relative humidity. Furthermore,
    the utilization of Sentinel-2 satellite images was employed to generate the leaf
    area vegetation index (LAI). The data (measured and interpolated) that were used
    for training the LSTM network are visually presented in Appendix A. The objective
    of the model is to forecast the reduction of MC for the next day using the MC
    reduction, the weather data, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the previous three days.
    The model underwent testing for a duration spanning from 18 June 2022 to 3 August
    of 2022, corresponding to four distinct phases. During the initial phase, the
    prediction of a decrease in MC between the 18th and 28th of June 2022 was made
    using data from the months of May (corresponding to the sowing date) up through
    to the 17 June, which were utilized for training purposes. Similarly, during the
    period from 29 June 2022 to 12 July 2022, the training process was conducted using
    data from May until 28 June. During the third phase, the model underwent training
    using data from the sowing date until the12 July 2022. The purpose of this training
    was to enable the model to generate predictions for the period between the 13
    and 24 July 2022. In the final phase, the entire available dataset was utilized
    to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting the MC reduction between
    the 25 July 2022 and the 3 August 2022 (Table 1). Table 1. Date periods throughout
    the investigated cultivating period divided into four district phases for training
    and testing of the LSTM model. During each phase, the available training dataset
    was divided into a window of three. The term “window of three” denotes that the
    model takes a sliding window of size three across the sequential data in order
    to predict the next target value. This window starts at the first data point and
    moves one step at a time through the sequence [26]. Furthermore, in each phase,
    the available dataset was partitioned into two subsets. Specifically, 80% of the
    dataset was assigned for training the model, while the remaining 20% was reserved
    for conducting an independent test. Through testing on unseen data, the model’s
    ability to generalize to the desired timeframe can be evaluated. In this study,
    the time series approach is essential because it accounts for temporal dependencies
    and seasonal variations that may affect irrigation requirements. By training and
    testing on discrete time periods, the model does not rely on future data during
    the training phase, preventing data leakage and obtaining objective performance
    metrics. Once the separation is completed, the data underwent pre-processing and
    fusion procedures prior to being fed to the model. Standardization was used to
    transform the features of the dataset so as to take a mean of 0 and a standard
    deviation of 1. Feature level fusion was selected due to the combination of features
    extracted from multiple sources. The selection of the appropriate hyperparameters
    used to train the model was also a significant issue that needed to be addressed,
    as they tend to have a substantial impact on the efficacy of the models. Tuning
    the hyperparameters is crucial, and can be accomplished through a variety of techniques,
    such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization [28]. The grid search
    technique has been chosen for the tuning of hyperparameters. In this method, a
    variety of hyperparameters are evaluated, and finally the one with the highest
    performance on the validation set is chosen. The different hyperparameters that
    were tested (first layer size, second layer size, optimizer, dropout rate, number
    of epochs, batch size) for training each model are demonstrated in Table 2. Table
    2. Tested values of the different deep learning hyperparameters for their tuning
    by grid search. Regarding the selection of the optimization algorithm, the Adaptive
    Moment Estimation (Adam) algorithm appeared to be more performant compared to
    other tested algorithms, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) and RMSprop
    (Root Mean Square Propagation), since the Adam’s learning rates can easily adjust
    to the varying gradients during the training of sequences when employing an LSTM
    model [29,30]. The selected Adam algorithm for training was set at a batch size
    of 16 and a total of 80 epochs. In addition, the optimal dropout rate was determined
    to be equal to 0, and the initial LSTM layer was selected with a size of 64, while
    the second LSTM layer was chosen to have a size of 32. An attention mechanism
    was placed between the two LSTM layers in order to enhance the model’s understanding
    of sequences. The method accomplishes this by computing relevance scores between
    a current time step and all other time steps. These scores are transformed into
    attention weights which were used to combine information from all time steps,
    creating an enriched dataset representation. This enriched information is integrated
    into the initial LSTM’s output and passed to the next LSTM layer. This process
    allows the model to emphasize important parts of the sequence, capture long-range
    dependencies, handle various sequence lengths, and produce more accurate predictions.
    The created attention mechanism tends to improve the model’s performance when
    dealing with sequence-related tasks through enabling the model to focus on relevant
    information and to interpret complex patterns [31]. Additionally, certain callbacks
    were involved to further optimize the Grid Search method and the overall performance
    of the training process. Under this framework, three primary callback functions
    were employed including Early Stopping, Model Checkpoint, and ReduceLROnPlateau.
    The Early Stopping callback has been chosen for monitoring the validation loss
    and also for finalizing the training process in case no progress is indicated
    throughout a specified period of epochs, also known as “patience”. In the current
    study, a patience level of 6 epochs has been selected. The Model Checkpoint callback
    was employed to store the model’s weights after each epoch, keeping the epoch
    with the highest validation accuracy, to ensure that the most optimal model will
    be used for future deployment. ReduceLROnPlateau was employed to dynamically adjust
    the learning rate of the optimizer based on the observed behavior of the loss
    function during training. In the current study, the learning rate was set equal
    to 0.0021. The data processing and models development have been implemented using
    the TensorFlow library (version 2.10) within a Python-based programming environment
    (Python version 3.9). 2.2.3. Evaluation Metrics for the LSTM Model The model was
    evaluated, using standard evaluation metrics that are commonly used in regression
    problems, such as the coefficient of determination ( 𝑅 2 ) and the root mean squared
    error ( 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 ). 𝑅 2 ranges from 0 to 1 and it is interpreted as the percentage
    of the variation in the dependent variable that can be attributed to the independent
    variables in the model. The formula for the R2 metric, also known as the coefficient
    of determination, is given in Equation (8) as follows: 𝑅 2 =1−( 𝑆𝑆𝑅 𝑆𝑆𝑇 ), (8)
    where 𝑆𝑆𝑅 (Sum of Squared Residuals) represents the sum of the squared differences
    between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable. It measures
    the unexplained variation in the dependent variable by the regression model. On
    the other hand, 𝑆𝑆𝑇 (Total Sum of Squares) represents the total sum of squared
    differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.
    It measures the total variation in the dependent variable. 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 represents the
    standard deviation of the residuals, i.e., the differences between the predicted
    and actual values. A lower 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 value indicates better accuracy and a closer fit
    of the model to the data. The formula for the Root Mean Square Error ( 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 )
    metric is given in Equation (9) as follows: 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= ( 1 𝑛  ⋅ ∑ (𝑦_𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑−𝑦_𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙)
    2 ) − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ , (9) where n is
    the total number of data points, 𝑦_𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 represents the predicted values from the
    mode and 𝑦_𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 represents the actual values of the dependent variable [32].
    2.2.4. AQUACROP Model Simulations Precision agriculture has gained momentum with
    the integration of simulation models and ML approaches. A precise estimation of
    maize’s water requirements can substantially augment water usage efficiency. In
    this work, Aquacrop v7.0 has been used [15] to simulate the soil MC so as to overcome
    the soils sensor’s failure to acquire constant or adequate measurements in the
    two investigated maize fields. The MC data derived from Aquacrop have been integrated
    to the existent MC datasets acquired from soil sensor measurements, then were
    employed for the training of the LSTM neural network to determine the maize’s
    water requirements. Aquacrop, developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO), Rome, Italy, of the United Nations, is a widely accepted deterministic
    model that primarily focuses on addressing water needs under different environmental
    conditions. The model is based on the balance between water availability and demand
    and is specialized in handling environments where water availability is limited.
    For maize, specific parameters such as root depth, canopy cover, and soil characteristics
    are used as input data into Aquacrop. The software has built-in templates for
    maize, but for better accuracy, it is essential to adjust settings based on local
    conditions [33,34]. One of the significant features of Aquacrop is its ability
    to utilize basic soil parameters and transform it into hydraulic properties with
    the help of pedotransfer functions, which are essential for performing accurate
    simulation regarding soil MC. The hydraulic properties required for AQUACROP v7.0
    were estimated using pedotransfer functions, derived from the soil texture data.
    In Table 3 and Table 4 the soil texture data and the hydraulic properties (residual
    soil water content θr, saturated soil water content θs, α and n empirical fitting
    parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks) were estimated using pedotransfer
    functions [35] for the investigated fields Field 1 and 2. These data are used
    to assess the water content of field capacity and permanent wilting point using
    the van Genuchten equation [36]. Table 3. Estimated soil texture and hydraulic
    parameters using pedotransfer functions in different soil sensor locations in
    Field 1. Table 4. Estimated soil texture and hydraulic parameters using pedotransfer
    functions in different soil sensor locations in Field 2. Clay loam soil has a
    balanced texture that includes a mixture of sand, silt, and clay particles. This
    balance allows it to retain moisture while still providing good drainage. Also,
    this type of soil generally has moderate to good infiltration properties. It can
    absorb water without excessive runoff, which is beneficial for crop growth. One
    of the strengths of clay loam soil is its ability to retain moisture. The fine
    clay particles help hold water in the soil, which can be advantageous during dry
    periods. Soil, crop, and meteorological parameters from both investigated fields
    were used as input data for Aquacrop (Table 3 and Table 4). The simulated MC data
    derived from Aquacrop have been integrated to the initial MC dataset acquired
    from the soil sensors, which was utilized for training the employed LSTM model.
    3. Results and Discussion In order to assess and predict the irrigation needs
    for each of the investigated fields, the reduction of MC within a defined period,
    from 18 June 2022 to 3 August 2022 needed to be assessed and predicted as well.
    The dataset was split into four distinct phases in response to fluctuations of
    crop irrigation needs and also to facilitate the repeated training and testing
    loops of the LSTM model to ensure that the developed model will be refined with
    the most pertinent data for every temporal interval, in order to yield the accurate
    predictions. The model predicts the decrease in MC in millimeters (mm) converting
    them using the volumetric water content (% VWC). Table 5 presents the results
    of the LSTM predictions for each of the four investigated phases regarding Field
    1. These findings reveal the model’s effectiveness in estimating the reduction
    in MC within the four designated time periods. Table 5. Coefficient of determination
    (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) results of Field 1 on test data. The findings
    derived from the LSTM predictive model demonstrate promising performance in estimating
    the decrease in MC in maize in Field 1 across the four discrete phases. The obtained
    results demonstrate an upward trend in the efficacy of the model as we move through
    the phases, a phenomenon that can be attributed to the increasing size of the
    training dataset. During the initial phase, the coefficient determination (R-squared,
    R2) was determined to be 0.8264, which suggests a significant degree of reliability
    in forecasting the decrease in moisture content. This phase corresponds to the
    time period from16 May to 28 June. During this phase the daily reduction of MC
    was low and exhibited a steady trend. As a result, the model exhibited very good
    performance during this phase, as the patterns observed in the testing dataset
    closely mirrored those present in the training data. Moving to the second phase,
    the R2 remains similarly high to that at phase 1, at 0.8163. While this value
    is slightly lower than the first phase, it remains quite impressive, since during
    this period the reduction in MC was more variable, which can explain the minor
    reduction in performance compared to the first phase. In the third phase, the
    model’s performance improves more, with an R2 equal to 0.8422. This increase in
    performance may be attributed to the continued expansion of the training dataset,
    giving the model the opportunity to capture a wider range of MC reduction patterns.
    The final phase demonstrates the highest R2 of 0.9181. This substantial increase
    regarding the model’s predictive accuracy indicates that the model has become
    exceptionally adept at forecasting MC reduction, leading to the general observation
    that the larger training dataset, that conveyed data from all the three previous
    phases, contributed significantly to enhancing the model’s predictive ability
    for the fourth phase. Figure 5 illustrates the comparison between the observed
    values and the predicted values generated by the LSTM model for each of the nine
    soil sensor locations throughout the first phase in Field 1. Figure 5. Comparison
    between the actual and the predicted MC per location in Field 1 during 1st phase.
    As observed in Figure 5, the reduction in MC at each location is generally minimal,
    with the exception of the final (ninth) day. This phenomenon occurs due to the
    relatively low ET rates during these eight days, leading to a subtle reduction
    of MC. Consequently, the model exhibits a high performance across all locations
    throughout the initial eight-day period. On the contrary, on the ninth day of
    the first phase, a slight deviation between the observed and predicted MC value
    is indicated. In Figure 6 the comparison between the observed values and the predicted
    values derived from the LSTM model for each of the nine soil sensor locations
    during the second phase conducted in Field 1 are depicted. Each panel of the illustration
    portrays a comparison between the three sensors. Figure 6. (a) Comparison between
    actual and predicted MC for locations 2, 3 and 5 during 2nd phase; (b) Comparison
    between actual and predicted MC for locations 7, 9 and 10 during 2nd phase; (c)
    Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations 12, 13 and 15 during
    2nd phase. The three panels in Figure 6 exhibit a noticeable variation between
    the observed and forecasted values for all sensors for the whole duration. In
    comparison to the first figure, it is evident from the graph depicting the MC
    reduction over the timeframe including 29 June 2022, to 12 July 2022, that there
    has been a notable decrease in MC. The considerable rate of MC reduction can be
    attributed to the significantly elevated levels of evapotranspiration that have
    been prevalent during this period. One particularly noteworthy observation is
    that on day 7, the most substantial decrease in MC from all the nine locations
    in the maize field was recorded. This day appears to have experienced conditions
    that contribute directly to MC reduction, including high temperatures, increased
    solar radiation, and lower relative humidity levels. Figure 7 depicts the comparison
    between the observed values and the predicted values of MC for the third phase.
    Figure 7. (a) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations 2, 3 and
    5 during 3rd phase; (b) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations
    7, 9 and 10 during 3rd phase; (c) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for
    locations 12, 13 and 15 during 3rd phase. The performance of the LSTM model in
    the third phase appears to be significantly high for all sensors, except sensor
    13. This notably abnormal behavior can be explained by the high content of clay
    in the soil, which contributed to the significant reduction of MC on a daily basis,
    and is comparatively lower in this particular location. The presented figure illustrates
    a consistent and significant daily decrease in MC across all locations. Figure
    8 presents a visual representation of the comparison conducted between actual
    and predicted MC for different locations during the fourth phase. Figure 8. (a)
    Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations 2, 3 and 5 during 4th
    phase; (b) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations 7, 9 and 10
    during 4th phase; (c) Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations
    12, 13 and 15 during 4th phase. As previously indicated, the estimated values
    closely align with the observed values in this phase. Moreover, it is noteworthy
    that the reduction in MC during this phase is of a higher magnitude compared to
    the previous phases (1st, 2nd and 3rd). The performance of the LSTM model on the
    testing dataset for Field 2 is shown in Table 6. Table 6. Coefficient of determination
    (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) results of Field 2 on test data. In contrast
    to the results observed for Field 1, in the occasion of Field 2 the LSTM model
    exhibits lower precision in estimating MC reduction. This difference can be attributed
    to multiple factors, with the limitation of data availability being the main factor.
    Field 2 demonstrates a comparatively constrained dataset compared to Field 1,
    so it would be reasonable to assume that this would have an immediate negative
    impact on the model’s ability to accurately capture and extrapolate the patterns
    of MC reduction. However, it is noteworthy to mention that the performance trends
    observed in Field 2 seem to follow a similar pattern to those of Field 1. In the
    first phase, Field 2 exhibited an R2 value of 0.8392, which indicates a good level
    of reliability. This phase corresponds to a period from 11 May to 28 June, which
    is characterized by a small and steady reduction in MC, making it easier for the
    model to make accurate predictions. However, during the second phase, the value
    of R2 decreases to 0.7602. Such a decrease of R2 in Field 2 can possibly be attributed
    to the increased variability or to the complexity of MC reduction patterns during
    this period, similar to Field 1. In the third phase, the model’s performance improves
    slightly with an R2 equal to 0.7992. Finally, in the fourth phase, Field 2 demonstrates
    an R2 equal to 0.8417. The performance of this phase concerning Field 2 closely
    resembles that of Field 1, indicating the model’s improvement, attributed to the
    inclusion of a bigger training dataset that incorporates data from the three previous
    phases. Figure 9 illustrates the comparison between the observed values and the
    predicted values generated by the model for each of the six soil locations throughout
    the first phase in Field 2. Figure 9. MC comparison per location in Field 2 during
    phase 1. Figure 10 depicts the comparative outcomes between the actual and predicted
    MC after the second phase in Field 2. Figure 10. Comparison between actual and
    predicted MC for locations (a) 8, 11 and 14 during 2nd phase and (b) 16, 17 and
    18 during 2nd phase. At this phase, the model indicates satisfactory results in
    predicting the reduction of MC in locations 11, 14, and 18. For the other locations,
    the model appeared less accurate in predicting the MC reduction values for day
    eight. The uniformity in soil MC reduction during the initial five days, followed
    by variations in the subsequent four days across all six sensor locations, can
    be explained due to the occurrence of several interacting factors during the four
    different phases that contributed to the reduction of MC. More specifically, weather
    conditions, including but not limited to air temperature, humidity and solar radiation,
    hold a pivotal role over the rate of evapotranspiration, which captures both plant
    transpiration and soil evaporation. The constancy in moisture reduction during
    the first five days may be attributed at least partially to the consistent meteorological
    conditions prevailing during the investigated time period. Finally, the progressive
    growth of maize plants over time, followed by the extension and deepening of their
    root systems, contributes to the inevitable decrease of MC since the plants have
    a greater ability to capture water and nutrients from deeper soil layers. Consequently,
    the maize crop development tends to significantly alter the soil moisture kinetics
    patterns. Figure 11 and Figure 12 illustrate the comparison of the observed values
    and the predicted values produced by the model for each soil location during the
    third and fourth phases in Field 2. Figure 11. Comparison between actual and predicted
    MC for locations (a) 8, 11 and 14 during 3rd phase and (b) 16, 17 and 18 during
    3rd phase. Figure 12. Comparison between actual and predicted MC for locations
    (a) 8, 11 and 14 during 4th phase and (b) 16, 17 and 18 during 4th phase. Similar
    to Field 1, the daily changes are substantial due to the heightened evapotranspiration
    during these stages and the greater frequency of irrigation by the farmer. Additionally,
    the model’s performance exhibits improvement during phases 3 and 4, similar to
    what was observed in Field 1. In summary, it can be concluded that the LSTM model
    exhibited encouraging potential forecasting the reduction of MC in maize fields.
    The results validated that the performance of the LSTM model was greatly influenced
    by the availability and quality of data confirming previously conducted research
    in the field [37], which utilized a Bi-LSTM model, and demonstrated a notable
    R2 improvement, benefiting from a comprehensive dataset spanning 14 years. A more
    extended period of investigation would have ideally offered a vast array of data
    for model training through the extensive historical datasets [38] to ensure robust
    predictive capabilities. However, in the current study, irrigation needs have
    been effectively predicted despite the challenge that has been encountered due
    to the soil data measurements’ discontinuity, revealing that predictions for irrigation
    scheduling can be made without the existence of extensive historical datasets
    that often require a span of several years to decades to yield high predictive
    performances. The high performance of the LSTM model is attributed to its special
    asset among traditional RNNs, characterized by its special gates that are responsible
    for controlling the flow, the volume, and the type of the previously attained
    and processed information that is going to be maintained and forwarded from the
    memory cell to the next hidden state. The utilization of the Aquacrop 7.0 model
    to simulate soil MC data due to data limitations in the investigated fields, equipped
    the LSTM model with a consistent and adequate volume of data in order to perform
    precise predictions for irrigation scheduling in maize crops, confirming its effectiveness
    towards the accurate and reliable simulation of moisture content (MC) [17] that
    is also mirrored in our findings. For both investigated fields, the LSTM model
    becomes more efficient in predicting MC reduction as we move through the four
    investigated phases, since the dataset is enriched with data from previous phases.
    The high performance of the model has been assisted by the sufficient number of
    soil sensors which provided a satisfactory volume of measurements. Comparing the
    performance of the LSTM model between the two investigated fields, the results
    appear slightly lower for Field 2 compared to those for Field 1, indicating an
    R2 ranging from 0.7602 to 0.8417 can be explained by the limited data availability.
    However, Field 2 continues to show similar behavior in its predictive ability,
    close to that of the LSTM model demonstrated for Field 1. It is worth noting that
    despite the lack of a sufficient number of sensors, there were only six for Field
    2, the observed variations in MC reduction occur mostly due to the same factors
    that are mostly related to the weather conditions and the expected crop growth
    over time. Incorporating these methods into a comprehensive system, such as the
    predictive irrigation scheduling system we employed, underscores the value of
    integrating real-time data with advanced modelling techniques. This integration
    allows for more effective irrigation strategies, aligning with the broader goals
    of sustainable agriculture and water resource management. The employed LSTM model
    has been proven capable of maintaining its predictive accuracy, highlighting the
    potential for real-time, season-specific irrigation management. This advancement
    is particularly significant in precision agriculture, where timely and accurate
    predictions can lead to more efficient water usage and improved crop management
    strategies. The further enhancement of the Aquacrop model with more comprehensive
    field data, including precise measurements of root distribution and Leaf Area
    Index (LAI), could substantially elevate its accuracy in simulating crop water
    needs. This improvement will enable more precise irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage while ensuring optimal crop growth and yield. In the future, additional
    studies will include the integration of detailed data regarding the root systems
    and canopy characteristics, that are expected to assist the model in reflecting
    the actual water uptake and evapotranspiration patterns of crops in a better and
    more detailed manner, leading to more precise predictions regarding the irrigation
    needs. 4. Conclusions The basis of the present study has been the soil moisture
    data which exhibited non-stationary time series, characterized by a regular periodic
    pattern with significant fluctuations. The above challenge has been faced through
    the application of the LSTM model. The LSTM model has been developed to forecast
    the reduction of soil MC, focusing on the needed amount of water so as to assess
    and cover the required irrigation needs in maize crops. The efficiency of the
    LSTM model has been evaluated based on its forecasting abilities on the impact
    of weather data and satellite extracted data on the reduction of MC in four distinct
    time phases. Based on the results demonstrated above, the performance of the proposed
    model has been estimated as high for both investigated fields despite the limited
    availability of soil sensors in Field 2 compared to Field 1. This demonstrates
    the fact that the LSTM model is a powerful tool for forecasting soil moisture
    dynamics in grain fields. Moreover, the LSTM’s adaptability and robustness in
    predicting the MC reduction, encourages its potential applicability to a variety
    of other precision agriculture practices that require effective handling of sequential
    data such as crop growth monitoring and crop yield prediction. The effectiveness
    of the LSTM model in accurately predicting the soil MC decrease holds the potential
    of revolutionizing agriculture, offering several benefits to farmers, agronomists,
    and policymakers. More specifically, through the adoption of such site-specific
    irrigation patterns enabled by RNN models, Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) application
    schemes can be adopted, securing and enhancing yield annual productivity in grains.
    Through its integration to decision support systems (DSSs), the LSTM model can
    provide a variety of real-time recommendations in the precision agriculture domain,
    due to the model’s efficiency of taking into account a wide range of factors,
    such as weather conditions and historical data, enabling dynamic and efficient
    irrigation. The above-mentioned ability can be considered as a special asset of
    the LSTM model in securing and improving decision-making in the field of precision
    agriculture. Consequently, farmers can optimize their irrigation scheduling practices
    based on accurate forecasts and policymakers are given the opportunity to use
    these forecasts for evidence-based decisions towards efficient irrigation water
    management and sustainable agriculture in general. Based on the results of this
    study, future work could focus on the design of a predictive irrigation approach,
    where crucial components of crop growth are integrated so as to have a better
    understanding of the future irrigation needs of crops based on the growth stage.

  description: Today, the use of sensors and imaging techniques, which are used to
    obtain information about plants and soil in smart irrigation systems, is rapidly
    becoming widespread. This study aimed to investigate the usability of leaf turgor
    pressure and thermal images from plant-based monitoring techniques to detect water
    stress and the irrigation time of pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv. “California Wonder”)
    and to determine their relationship with physiological traits in Canakkale/Türkiye
    in 2017 and 2018. The four irrigation treatments (100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%) were
    applied in the experiment. Leaf turgor pressure (Pp), thermal images and physiological
    measurements were carried out during the growing season. Soil moisture and Pp
    were monitored in real time by remote. Thermal and physiological measurements
    were made before each irrigation. As a result of the study, the average evapotranspiration
    (ETc) was 697 mm, and the yield value was 83.7 t ha−1 under non-stress conditions.
    Depending on the decrease in ETc, yield values also decreased significantly. Leaf
    water potential and stomatal conductivity values were statistically different
    in all irrigation treatments. The change in the activity of catalase (CAT) due
    to water stress was greater than that of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In this case,
    it can be said that other physiological traits are more successful than SOD in
    distinguishing water stress. According to the regression models, significant relationships
    were determined between both the indices calculated from the thermal images and
    Pp, yield, and physiological traits. The predictive ability of Pp values has been
    strengthened with the addition of meteorological properties to the model in general.
    The highest correlation (R2 =0.63) was between Pp + meteorological properties
    and CAT. All the regression models between physiological traits and indices calculated
    from thermal images were statistically significant. The highest R2 values were
    obtained in August. In this month, the highest correlations were between Crop
    Water Stress Index (CWSIp) and leaf water potential / stomatal conductivity (R2
    =0.91), IGp and stomatal conductivity (R2 =0.80). The predictive power of CWSIp
    was higher than Stomatal Conductivity Index (IGp). The experiment illustrated
    that Pp and temperature data, which are plant-based monitoring methods, have the
    potential to detect water stress in peppers.

    both the soil and the plant is quite important. • Stomatal conductance and leaf
    water potential are effective indicators of water stress. • Physiological traits

    1. Introduction Today, as in all sectors, the use of technology in the modernization
    process in agriculture is rapidly becoming widespread. Among these, remote sensing
    and sensor technologies in agricultural fields has gained importance. By using
    these techniques and technologies, it is now easier to understand the physiological
    state of the plant. Studies aimed at reducing the possible effects of environmental
    stress on plants were emphasized. Accordingly, the employment of new technologies
    has been the subject of studies to prevent the possible effects of water/drought
    stress on plants. Numerous studies have been conducted from the past to the present
    on the effects of water stress on plants. There are many valid indicators measured
    in the monitoring of plant water status, especially leaf water potential. However,
    the techniques used in the determination of the said indicators have disadvantages,
    such as damaging the plant, taking a long time to determine, and not allowing
    instant monitoring. Jones (2004) also pointed out some of the drawbacks of the
    various instruments employed in plant-based observations. In response to these
    disadvantages, sensors based on turgor pressure that allow continuous monitoring
    of the water status of the plant have been developed (Zimmermann et al., 2008).
    The use of these sensors has been researched in various plants (Rüger et al.,
    2010, Zimmermann et al., 2010, Ehrenberger et al., 2012, Fernandes et al., 2017).
    In addition, studies on the determination of symptoms caused by water stress with
    remote sensing techniques are increasing. Remote sensing is used because it is
    difficult to measure water stress indicators with ground-based techniques. For
    example, stomatal conductivity, which is an important indicator of the plant''s
    stress level, can be estimated with indices calculated from thermal images (Jones,
    1999). Plants under stress use enzymatic mechanisms to protect themselves. In
    such a case, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase,
    and glutathione reductase enzymes are active (Arora et al., 2002). These components
    involved in the enzymatic mechanism are used to inactivate free radicals called
    reactive oxygen species (ROS), which will occur when plants are exposed to stress.
    While the synthesis of ROS species is low under normal growing conditions, the
    amount of these compounds increases when plant growth is stressed (Smirnoff, 1993,
    Mullineaux and Karpinski, 2002, Miller et al., 2010). Under stress conditions,
    the plant defends itself with enzymatic or non-enzymatic mechanisms and tries
    to inactivate ROS species by synthesizing the above-mentioned components. Water
    stress or drought, are both the most important sources of environmental stress
    for plants. As with other environmental stresses, water stress causes the synthesis
    of ROS species and creates oxidative stress (Scandalios, 1997). Some studies have
    been conducted on the synthesis of enzymes that inactivate ROS species under conditions
    of water stress (Yaşar et al., 2013, Murshed et al., 2013). However, in these
    studies the relations between these enzymes used to determine the onset and level
    of stress cannot be detected visually and the thermal measurements and turgor
    level of the leaf were not discussed. Turkey, particularly the province of Canakkale,
    plays an important role in pepper production. Pepper production ranks second among
    vegetables in the province (Anonymous, 2015). The fact that pepper has great potential
    for the region and no research been carried out globally on the determination
    of water stress in pepper using turgor pressure and thermal images, prompted the
    necessity of the study. In order to determine water stress and irrigation time;
    this study, which is unique because it uses turgor and thermography techniques
    allowing rapid and instant monitoring without damaging the plant, aims to demonstrate
    the usability of plant-based monitoring techniques instead of soil-based monitoring
    techniques, and to create statistical models among them with yield and known physiological
    stress indicators (leaf water potential, stomatal conductivity, superoxide dismutase,
    and catalase activity). 2. Material and methods 2.1. Experimental site and design
    In 2017 and 2018, the experiment was conducted on Aristocrat F1 pepper (Capsicum
    annuum L. cv. ''California Wonder'') in the Crop Production and Research Station
    of the Faculty of Agriculture at Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University. Some soil
    features of the experiment area are given in (Table 1). Available water capacity
    (AWC) in the root zone (60 cm) of pepper is 81.4 mm. According to meteorological
    data, the average air temperature and total rainfall from May to October were
    22.3 °C and 143 mm in 2017, and 22.7 °C and 187 mm in 2018. The long-term average
    (1950–2017) is 21.1 °C air temperature and 152.2 mm precipitation. Table 1. Some
    physical analysis results of the experiment area soils. Soil Depth (cm) Texture

    34.9 22.4 30–60 SL 1.53 33.9 19.3 Each plot had an area of 3.5 × 6.6 m, with three
    replicates in a randomized block design of each treatment. The peppers were planted
    at a density of 33 × 70 cm on 26.05.2017 and 25.05.2018. To prevent water from
    flowing between treatments and the measurements being affected, a 2.1-meter gap
    was left between each parcel. In the study, four irrigation regimes were applied
    to the pepper plants: S100 (full irrigation), S75 (75% of the water consumed in
    S100), S50 (50% of the water consumed in S100) and S25 (25% of the water consumed
    in S100). In full irrigation, lack of moisture in the soil was completed to field
    capacity when 40 ± 5% of the available water capacity in the effective root zone
    was consumed. In both years, each plot received 20 kg ha−1 of 20–20–20 NPK + trace
    elements before planting and 4 L ha−1 of humic acid and 4 kg ha−1 12–8–13 NPK
    + 3 MgO + trace elements at the flowering stage of the pepper. Further fertilization
    procedures were performed during fruit formation (2 kg ha−1 MAP 12–61–0 and 4
    L ha−1 humic acid twice, 0.6 L ha−1 16% Ca). Herbicides and pesticides were used
    when necessary. 2.2. Irrigation water amount and evapotranspiration Sensors (GS1
    model, Decagon Devices, Inc., WA, USA) were placed to 0–30 cm, 30–60 cm, and 60–90
    cm depths of the soil on all parcels for monitoring soil moisture required to
    determine the irrigation water requirement and evapotranspiration. The data from
    the sensors were instantly monitored via a remote monitoring system (Devint Informatics,
    Izmir, Turkey). The sensors were calibrated with actual soil moisture values before
    the experiment started. The moisture level in the soil was kept at the level of
    field capacity continuously until July 10 in the first year and July 11 in the
    second year. After these dates, irrigation was started according to the treatments.
    The volume of water applied to each treatment was calculated by multiplying the
    area by the percentage of cover and was applied to the experimental plots in a
    controlled manner using a water meter. The percentage of cover was obtained by
    dividing the cover width of five randomly selected plants between rows before
    each irrigation. This value was taken as at least 30%. Calibrated data obtained
    from the soil moisture sensors placed on 0–30 cm, 30–60 cm and 60–90 cm soil layers
    for all repetitions of each subject was used to determine evapotranspiration.
    The effective plant root depth was taken as 60 cm, and the moisture content at
    60–90 cm soil depth was monitored for percolation and water table movement. The
    evapotranspiration amounts for each experimental treatment were calculated using
    Eq. 1, according to the water budget method (James, 1988): (1) ET = I + P - D
    ± R ± ΔS where ET: evapotranspiration (mm), I: irrigation water (mm), P: precipitation
    (mm), D: deep percolation (mm), R: the runoff (mm), ΔS: the change in soil water
    storage (mm). During the experiment, deep percolation was ignored since there
    was no change in the moisture sensors placed in the 60–90 cm soil layer. In addition,
    since the amount of precipitation occurring in this period was at a level that
    does not cause runoff, this value was accepted as zero in the equation. 2.3. Yield
    All plants in each plot, except for edge eﬀects, were regularly harvested and
    the yield was calculated as tonnes per hectare by weighing the harvested pepper.
    Harvest started on the 66th and 70th days after planting and ended on the 155th
    and 154th days, according to 2017 and 2018, respectively. 2.4. Plant based measurements
    In the study, stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, superoxide dismutase
    and catalase activity, leaf turgor pressure and plant temperature from plant-based
    measurements were determined. The measurements in question were made from 3 different
    leaves of 3 randomly selected plants at each replication. A total of 27 measurements
    were taken for each treatment. 2.4.1. Stomatal conductance Stomatal conductance
    was measured on the abaxial surfaces of the leaves using a steady state leaf porometer
    (SC-1, Decagon Devices, USA). The measurements were made on a sun-exposed and
    mature leaves of selected plants at each replication, before irrigation (the 45th
    day after planting), between 11:00 and 14:00. 2.4.2. Leaf water potential Leaf
    water potential was measured in leaves from 3 different plants at each replication
    using a pressure chamber instrument (Model 1000, PMS Instrument, USA) following
    the standard methodology (Scholander et al., 1965). The fully developed and sun-exposed
    leaves of the plant at that time were used in the measurements. These measurements
    were made before irrigation and in the midday. 2.4.3. Superoxide dismutase and
    catalase activity Leaf samples required for the determination of enzyme activity
    were taken five times on the days when other measurements were made, considering
    the developmental status of the plants. Three plants alike with plants in other
    measurements were selected from each plot for sampling. Three leaves from these
    plants were taken, and biochemical analyses were made. Superoxide dismutase (SOD)
    (Kakkar et al., 1984) and catalase (CAT) activity (Luck, 1963) values were determined
    in these samples. 2.4.4. Leaf turgor pressure and thermal measurements In the
    study, leaf patch clamp pressure (LPCP) probes (YARA ZIM Plant Technology GmbH,
    Hennigsdorf, Germany) were used to determine leaf turgor pressure and a thermal
    camera (Fluke Ti27 model, Fluke, USA) was used to obtain thermal images. The outputs
    of LPCP are called patch pressure (Pp). The concepts of this probe were described
    in further depth by Zimmermann et al. (2008). Details of the procedures in this
    study are also described in Camoglu et al. (2021). The modified crop water stress
    index (CWSI) and stomatal conductance index (IG) were calculated using the thermal
    imaging by means of Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively (Jones, 1999). The measurement
    and calculation details regarding these are also given in detail in Camoglu et
    al. (2021): (2) (3) where Tcanopy: The canopy temperature, Twet: the temperatures
    of the wet reference surface and Tdry: the temperatures of the dry reference surfaces.
    Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and precipitation were recorded hourly
    with the help of the climate station placed in the experimental area to be used
    in thermal measurements and leaf pressures. 2.5. Statistical analysis Data obtained
    from the two-year field experiments were subjected to variance analysis. Duncan’s
    multiple comparison test was applied to compare differences between mean values.
    Regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between leaf turgor
    pressure, thermal indices, and the traits examined. In this context, the simple
    linear regression method was used for the estimation of yield and physiological
    traits by means of thermal indices. Regression graphs were prepared in the MS
    Excel program, and the significance levels of the regression models obtained were
    determined in the SAS package program (SAS Institute, 1999). The multiple linear
    regression method was used to estimate the yield and physiological traits by employing
    the leaf turgor pressure and meteorological properties. These models were created
    using the stargazer package of the R program (Development Core Team, 2012). 3.
    Results and discussion 3.1. Changes in soil moisture In the first year of the
    experiment, all treatments were brought to field capacity on the 38th day after
    planting (DAP38), and irrigation treatments began to be applied on the 45th day
    (Fig. 1). Irrigation was finished on DAP125 and soil moisture was monitored until
    the day (DAP155) of the last harvest. When the soil moisture values of the irrigation
    treatments are examined, it is seen that the moisture values in the S100 treatment
    generally vary between the field capacity and the 40% value, which is the allowed
    portion (Ry) of the available water capacity. Soil moisture decreased below the
    40% limit since DAP110 for S75, DAP72 for S50, and DAP57 for S25. However, the
    moisture content of S25 remained at the wilting point level since DAP86. Download

    Changes in soil moisture at effective root depth of treatments in (a) 2017, (b)
    2018. In the second year of the experiment, all parcels were brought to field
    capacity on DAP43, and irrigation treatments began to be applied on DAP47 (Fig.
    1). Irrigation was finished on DAP119, and soil moisture was monitored until DAP154,
    when the last harvest was made. In the second year, it is seen that the moisture
    changes in S100 are closer to the field capacity, compared to the first year.
    Although the soil moisture in S75 treatments fell below the Ry value from time
    to time, it changed above the limit value with irrigation and precipitation. For
    S50, the moisture value changed between Ry and the wilting point since DAP80.
    As for S25, although soil moisture values had approached the wilting point for
    a day or two (DAP98, DAP101-DAP103), they were generally above the wilting point.
    When a general evaluation is made, it is seen that the moisture values in all
    treatments were higher in the second year of the experiment compared to the first
    year. It can be said that the reason for this is that the plant growth in the
    second year is weaker than the first year. 3.2. Total amount of irrigation water
    and evapotranspiration The total irrigation water and seasonal evapotranspiration
    values were calculated to be 242–684 mm and 313–734 mm in the first year of the
    experiment, and 209–524 mm and 347–660 mm in the second year, respectively (Fig.
    2). The values in the first year were higher than the second year. This may be
    due to the meteorological differences between the two years as well as the fact
    that the first-year plant growth was slightly better than the second year. Download

    Total amount of irrigation water and seasonal evapotranspiration values of treatments
    in (a) 2017, (b) 2018. There have been many studies in Turkey and worldwide in
    which different applications (irrigation, fertilization, salt applications, chemical
    applications, etc.) were made on different pepper varieties. Despite this, studies
    on irrigation regarding the \"California Wonder\" variety in our study are insufficient.
    In one study of this variety in Canakkale, Erken (2004) used five different pan
    evaporation coefficients (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25) and applied irrigation
    water between 121.8 and 609.0 mm and 183–915 mm, respectively. Demirel et al.
    (2014) applied four different irrigation levels (100%, 66%, 33%, and 0% according
    to soil moisture) on pepper plants. As a result of their study, different amounts
    of irrigation water (between 72 mm and 801 mm) were applied to the treatments.
    Yildirim et al. (2017) used five different pan evaporation coefficients (0.00,
    0.33, 0.66, 1.00 and 1.25) in their study from which they reported that the total
    irrigation water amount and seasonal evapotranspiration values varied between
    72 and 951 mm and 72–1047 mm, respectively, in the first year of the experiment
    and between 106 and 1115 mm and 106–1085 mm, respectively, in the second year
    of the experiment. Some differences were observed between studies conducted in
    the same region and this study. It can be said that these differences may be due
    to meteorological characteristics that occurred between years and differences
    in the varieties used, even if it is the same pepper type, and since they consider
    different methods (such as Pan-Evaporation) in calculating the amount of irrigation
    water. In studies conducted in India on the same pepper variety, Paul et al. (2013)
    applied the amount of irrigation water according to the pan evaporation on mulched
    and non-mulched treatments. They used three different pan evaporation coefficients
    (1, 0.8 and 0.6) and stated that the amount of applied irrigation water varied
    between 199 mm and 319 mm. Antony and Singandhupe (2004) has applied different
    irrigation methods (surface and drip irrigation) and different irrigation levels
    according to pan evaporation (1.2, 1.0, 0.8 and 0.6 for surface irrigation and
    100%, 80%, 60% and 40% for drip irrigation). As a result of the study, they applied
    irrigation water between 200 mm and 440 mm with the surface irrigation method
    and between 141 mm and 282 mm with the drip irrigation method. It is clear that
    there are differences between the results obtained from studies conducted in different
    countries and this study; due to the irrigation methods used, method of application,
    meteorological characteristics between regions, and use of different varieties.
    3.3. Yield Yield values changed between 22.9 and 90.7 t ha−1 and 22.5 and 76.6 t
    ha−1 according to the irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018, respectively (Fig.
    3). It was seen that the yield differences among the treatments were statistically
    significant in both years of the experiment. However, although the yield values
    of the first year for S100 and S50 were different compared to the second year,
    there was no difference between S75 and S25 treatments. Download : Download high-res

    to irrigation treatments. In studies conducted in the same region (Canakkale)
    with the same pepper variety, Erken (2004) applied irrigation water using five
    different pan evaporation coefficients for two years. As a result of the study,
    it was reported that yield varied between 23.49 and 68.88 t ha−1 in the first
    year and between 21.39 and 65.64 t ha−1 in the second year. Demirel et al. (2014)
    obtained yield values between 20.25 and 84.16 t ha−1 as a result of a study in
    which they applied four different irrigation levels. Yildirim et al. (2017) used
    five different pan evaporation coefficients. They reported that the yield values
    varied between 20.25 and 84.16 t ha−1 in the first year of the experiment and
    between 12.22 and 66.93 t ha−1 in the second year. Similarities were observed
    between studies conducted in the same region and the findings obtained from the
    research. It is seen that the yield values, especially among the least irrigated
    treatments (except for the second year of the experiment by Yıldırım et al. (2017),
    are very close to each other, and the yield values obtained by Demirel et al.
    (2014) are similar to those of this study. We consider that this similarity exists
    because the amount of irrigation water applied in the experiments is calculated
    according to the moisture loss in the soil in both studies. Erken (2004) and Yıldırım
    et al. (2017) used pan evaporation while calculating the amount of irrigation
    water to be applied in their studies. For this reason, although too much irrigation
    water was applied, there was not much difference among yields in these studies.
    In studies conducted in India on the same pepper variety, Paul et al. (2013) stated
    that the yield values in mulch and non-mulched treatments varied between 18.2
    and 28.7 t ha−1. Antony and Singandhupe (2004) compared surface and drip irrigation
    methods using pan evaporation, and they obtained yield values between approximately
    28 and 45 t ha−1 and 33 and 50 t ha−1 (read from the chart), respectively, according
    to the methods. 3.4. Physiological results 3.4.1. Leaf water potential Considering
    the change in leaf water potential according to irrigation treatments in the current
    study, it was determined that there are statistically significant differences
    between irrigation treatments for 2017 (Table 2). It was determined that the water
    constraint increased respectively among the irrigation treatments applied to the
    peppers and the leaf water potential decreased in the S75, S50 and S25 treatments.
    While the mean lowest leaf water potential value was − 1.84 MPa for S25, it was
    followed by S50 (−1.56 MPa) and S75 (−1.38 MPa) treatments, respectively. The
    average highest leaf water potential value with − 1.16 MPa was obtained from the
    S100 irrigation treatments (control) where the reduced moisture was completed
    to the field capacity when 40 ± 5% of the usable moisture in the 0–60 cm soil
    layer was consumed (Table 2). Table 2. Mean and standard error values of leaf

    capital letters in each month indicate the difference between irrigation treatments.
    Different lowercase letters in each topic indicate the difference between months.
    According to the leaf water potential values of the experiment in 2018, it was
    determined that the irrigation treatments had a statistically significant effect
    on the leaf water potential in the other months except September and in the average
    values (Table 2). In this context, the lowest average leaf water potential value
    was measured at S25 (−1.52 MPa), while the highest leaf water potential value
    was determined at S100 (−1.15 MPa). When the changes in leaf water potential values
    of the treatments are examined according to the months, the leaf water potential
    values of the S100, S75 and S50 treatments did not show a significant difference
    according to the months during the experiment, which included the vegetative and
    generative periods in 2017. In the second year, this situation was only realized
    with respect to S100. The leaf water potential value of S25, where water stress
    was applied the most in both years, decreased in the following July but increased
    again with the effect of precipitation in September of the second year. It is
    thought that the change in leaf water potential, especially in this regard, may
    be due to the increase in the heat load on the plant and the number of windy days
    in Canakkale in August and September, compared to July. According to Kaufmann
    (1981), the critical level in the leaf water potential varies depending on the
    plant type and growth period, as well as the environmental conditions, and the
    value decreases rapidly with the decrease in the soil water potential. In a studies
    conducted on dwarf green beans (Köksal et al., 2010) and bell pepper (Bozkurt
    Colak, 2021), they stated that the leaf water potential values differed between
    irrigation treatments, and the value increased as the irrigation water level increased.
    Similarly, Pıtır (2015) stated that the leaf water potential and the relative
    water content of the leaves decreased because of the reduction in irrigation during
    the period from flowering to harvest in Jalepeno peppers. 3.4.2. Stomatal conductance
    It was determined that different irrigation levels applied to the pepper plant
    used in the study significantly affected the stomatal conductance of the leaves
    (Table 3). In both years, the highest stomatal conductance values were determined
    in the S100. This treatment was followed by S75, S50, and S25, respectively. All
    irrigation treatments were statistically separated from each other in all months
    (except for September 2018) of both years. In September 2018, it was seen that
    S100 and S75 were in a different group from other irrigation treatments. It was
    observed that stomatal conductance values increased in the same month, similar
    to the leaf water potential values. This can also be explained by the precipitation
    in September. As a matter of fact, this increase can also be seen when the changes
    in the treatments are analyzed according to the months. While stomatal conductance
    decreased as expected towards September in 2017, the opposite was seen in 2018.

    * : p < 0.05, Note: Different capital letters in each month indicate the difference
    between irrigation treatments, and different lowercase letters in each topic indicate
    the difference between months. This phenomenon, which occurred among the treatments
    in both years, is because plants control O2 and CO2 diffusion by closing their
    stomata in the face of abiotic stress. In other words, stomatal permeability decreases
    in pepper leaves because of decreased transpiration. Costa et al. (2000) also
    stated that the closure of stomata is one of the drought-avoidance mechanisms
    that allows plants to keep water in their tissues and that it can reduce the photosynthetic
    rate and slow down the growth rate of the plant, as it prevents CO2 from entering
    the mesophyll cells. Jones (1992) stated that leaf stomatal permeability may decrease
    under the influence of environmental factors. Eriş et al. (1998) stated that the
    stomatal conductance and transpiration rate decreased as water deficiency increased
    in grapevine varieties under the same stress level conditions. Camoglu et al.
    (2019) stated that the stomatal conductance of tomato plants decreased significantly
    due to the increase in water stress. Many researchers have also pointed out that
    drought can lead to decreases in stomatal conductance and reported that the change
    in stomatal conductance is one of the important factors affecting the drought
    resistance performance of the varieties (Mehri et al., 2009, Kuşvuran et al.,
    2009, Nawaz et al., 2015). 3.4.3. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity Superoxide
    dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, which shows the stress status in
    the plant, changed significantly depending on the irrigation treatments. When
    the changes in SOD activity by months were examined, a difference was observed
    among the treatments only in August, when the stress was highest in 2017, while
    this difference was not statistically significant in any month in 2018 (Table
    4). However, in the second year of the experiment, S25 was in a different group
    than the others, according to the mean SOD values. In the first year, this did
    not occur. When the changes in the treatments according to the months were examined,
    an increase was observed in the SOD values of all treatments after July, and this
    increase was statistically significant. Table 4. Mean and standard error values

    Note: Different capital letters in each month indicate the difference between
    irrigation treatments, and different lowercase letters in each topic indicate
    the difference between months. According to the change of CAT activity by months,
    the highest enzyme activity values were recorded in August in both years (Table
    4). Contrary to SOD values in CAT activity, differences among the treatments in
    all months and mean values were found to be statistically significant. When the
    changes in the treatments according to the months are examined, it is seen that
    the CAT value is the highest in August. Studies have shown that both SOD and CAT
    activity can be used as indicators of abiotic stress (Manchandia, 1999). CAT has
    the ability to inhibit H2O2, that occurs as a result of stress (Polidoros and
    Scandalios, 1999). SOD, on the other hand, has the ability to inhibit the first
    free radicals formed during stress, by removing O2 accumulated in the cell and
    reducing the OH– ions (Mittler, 2002). With these aspects, the synthesis of both
    enzymes increases in order to reduce the effect of free radicals formed in plant
    cells during stress. Findings from the study also confirm this. However, it has
    been observed that there may be differences in the time-dependent change of the
    enzyme activities in question due to the year or environmental conditions. 3.4.4.
    Relationships between leaf pressure, meteorological parameters, and the examined
    traits The results of the regression analyses performed to estimate the yield,

    Evaluation for yield According to the results of the model (1) created by assigning
    leaf pressure as the sole independent variable, it is seen that the change in
    leaf pressure can explain a 54.7% variation in yield (Table 5). This model was
    found to be statistically significant. It has been determined that it is not possible
    to explain the change in efficiency if the measurements of temperature, relative
    humidity, and wind speed, which are meteorological characteristics, are used separately
    as estimators. There is no change in the predictive power of the model (R2 =54.8)
    in terms of explaining the existing change in yield if meteorological properties
    are included in the model, as well as leaf pressure. 3.4.6. Evaluation for leaf
    water potential Model (1) created by assigning the leaf pressure as the independent
    variable in the prediction models created for the leaf water potential can explain
    24.4% of the change in the leaf water potential (Table 5). It is understood from
    the meteorological features that it is insufficient to explain the change in leaf
    water potential as a predictor by itself. We determined that approximately 4%
    of the change in leaf water potential can be explained if all meteorological characteristics
    in addition to leaf pressure are assigned to the model as predictors for the prediction
    of leaf water potential. 3.4.7. Evaluation for stomatal conductance According
    to the regression coefficient of the model in which only leaf pressure is used
    as an estimator among the regression models created for the estimation of stomatal
    variability, it is seen that 45.6% of the variation in stomatal conductivity can
    be explained by leaf pressure (Table 5). If the temperature, humidity, and wind
    values are added to this model (7), 50.2% of the variation in stomatal conductivity
    can be explained by the model. In other words, the success of the model can be
    increased by 5% if meteorological features are used together with leaf pressure.
    The linear regression equation of the model in question was found as stomatal
    conductivity = 807.653–6.081 x leaf pressure - 3.970 x temperature + 3.718 x relative
    humidity - 21.419 x wind speed. In the literature, the relationships between leaf
    water potential and stomatal conductivity were investigated using the data obtained
    with leaf pressure sensors. Bramley et al. (2013) found statistically significant
    relationships between these physiological traits and leaf pressure in wheat. Martinez‑Gimeno
    et al. (2017) stated that there was a good correlation between leaf pressure and
    shoot water potential in persimmon. 3.4.8. Evaluation for superoxide dismutase
    The regression coefficient (R2 = 0.29) of the model (1), in which leaf pressure
    was used alone as an estimator among the regression models created for SOD activity,
    was found to be low (Table 5). Therefore, the models including temperature and
    wind speed data can be effective in explaining the change in SOD activity, albeit
    at a low level. In addition to the leaf pressure values, the regression coefficient
    of the model in which all meteorological features were used was found to be significantly
    higher than the single models; so much so that when the model in which only leaf
    pressure is used (1) is compared with this model (7), it is seen that there is
    an 11% difference in the regression coefficient. 3.4.9. Evaluation for catalase
    activity In models where leaf pressure and meteorological features are used separately
    as predictors of CAT activity, regression models appear to be statistically significant
    when relative humidity and temperature are used alone. It was determined that
    the change in relative humidity alone could explain 37.7% of the change in CAT
    activity. Thereby, 62.9% of the change in CAT enzyme activity can be predicted
    with the model (7), in which all variables are used. The linear regression equation
    of the model in question was obtained as: CAT = −45.109 + 0.592 x leaf pressure
    + 3.913 x temperature - 1.550 x humidity + 5.959 x wind speed. 3.5. Relationships
    between thermal indices and the examined traits 3.5.1. Regression models between
    thermal indices and yield According to the results of the regression analyses
    between the yield obtained at the end of the growing period and CWSIp - IGp, a
    negative linear relationship was found between yield and CWSIp, and a positive
    linear relationship with IGp (Fig. 4). The R2 values between yield and CWSIp varied
    between 0.43 and 0.91, and 0.33 and 0.85 with IGp, depending on the months. In
    both indices, the lowest value was in September, while the highest value was in
    August. This means that yield estimation can be made with higher accuracy by using
    thermal measurements made in August. Camoglu et al. (2018) found the R2 values
    between yield and CWSIp varied between 0.52 and 0.75, depending on the measurement
    days, in their study on a different pepper cultivar (Demre). It was stated that
    the relationship between them increased in further measurements after planting.
    In studies on different plants, O’Shaughnessy et al. (2011) obtained the R2 value
    between soybean yield and empirical CWSI (CWSIe) as 0.88 in 2004 and 0.83 in 2005,
    and the value between cotton yield and CWSIe as 0.78. Camoglu and Genc (2013)
    also found the R2 value between green bean yield and CWSIp to be 0.34. Download

    physiological traits and thermal indices. Camoglu and Genc (2013) and Garcia-Tejero
    et al. (2017) reported that thermal and spectral data are useful tools to predict
    physiological characteristics such as plant water status, stomatal conductivity,
    and chlorophyll. Camoglu et al. (2018) found the R2 value between leaf proportional
    water content and CWSIp to be 0.23, which they determined as an indicator of plant
    water status in the Demre pepper variety. Relationships between leaf water potential
    and CWSI were also investigated in studies on other plants. Cohen et al. (2005)
    found that the R2 values between leaf water potential and CWSI in cotton were
    between 0.79 and 0.90, according to the measurement time. Möller et al. (2007)
    obtained the R2 values between CWSI and leaf water potential calculated from thermal
    images to be between 0.52 and 0.91. Ben-Gal et al. (2009) stated in their study
    on olives that CWSI values calculated with the help of thermal images can be used
    to determine both leaf water potential and stomatal conductivity. Zia et al. (2013)
    obtained the R2 value between stomatal conductivity and CWSI as 0.62 in maize.
    Camoglu et al. (2019) found the R2 value to be between 0.53 and 0.91, and stomatal
    conductivity between 0.55 and 0.96 between CWSI and leaf water potential, which
    they calculated empirically from thermal images in tomato. They also stated that
    the strength of the relationship increased after the first measurement. According
    to the analysis results, the R2 values between leaf water potential and CWSIp
    varied between 0.59 and 0.91 depending on the months (Fig. 5). The values were
    between 0.33 and 0.76 for IGp. The R2 values between stomatal conductivity and
    CWSIp and IGp were also between 0.68 and 0.91 and 0.43 and 0.80, respectively
    (Fig. 5). The highest values between both leaf water potential and stomatal conductivity
    and the indices were realized in August, as in the yield. In addition, the predictive
    power of the CWSIp index for both physiological traits were found to be higher
    than IGp. Accordingly, these can be predicted more accurately by using CWSIp in
    August. This could be explained by the fact that the irrigation was started in
    July, when the plants were not yet fully stressed, and the leaves of the plants
    entered the aging process due to the harvest in September. Among the enzyme activities,
    the R2 values between SOD and CAT values and CWSIp were 0.02–0.31 and 0.68–0.80,
    respectively, and the values between IGp were 0.005–0.23 and 0.34–0.66, respectively
    (Fig. 5). The highest R2 values were also found in August. The correlation between
    the indices and SOD was found to be lower than that of the CAT enzyme. In particular,
    the R2 value between CAT and CWSIp was higher than the others. In this case, it
    can be said that the CAT enzyme can be predicted more successfully with the CWSIp
    index. 4. Conclusions According to the results of the study, it was determined
    that the pepper plant is very sensitive to water stress. It was concluded that
    the evapotranspiration and amount of irrigation water should be calculated correctly
    so that the pepper plant is not exposed to water stress; for this, the soil moisture
    needs to be constantly monitored. To accomplish this, soil moisture sensors and
    remote monitoring systems that allow instant and continuous monitoring of moisture
    are very advantageous tools. The total irrigation water amount, seasonal evapotranspiration,
    and yield values under non-water stress conditions were obtained as 604 mm, 697 mm,
    and 83.7 t ha−1, respectively, according to the average of two years. The highest
    monthly evapotranspiration in these non-stress plants was in August. Water stress
    had a negative impact on all the physiological properties of pepper plants. Leaf
    water potential and stomatal conductance values differed significantly according
    to irrigation treatments. In order to prevent the pepper from being exposed to
    water stress and to determine the irrigation time, these physiological traits
    can be taken as a threshold value for the results on the S100, separately for
    each month. While superoxide dismutase values from enzyme activities were not
    successful in distinguishing the treatments from each other, catalase activity
    was successful in determining the stress level. In this case, it can be said that
    catalase activity is more useful than superoxide dismutase in determining stress.
    Statistically significant relationships were obtained in the estimation of investigated
    traits using leaf pressure + meteorological properties. According to the multivariate
    regression models, the coefficients of determination between leaf pressure + meteorological
    properties and yield, leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, superoxide dismutase,
    and catalase activity were determined as 0.55, 0.29, 0.50, 0.42, and 0.63, respectively.
    In this case, the catalase enzyme can be predicted more accurately than the other
    traits. All the models obtained according to the simple linear regression analysis
    between the thermal indices and the traits examined in the study were found to
    be statistically significant. In the analyses made by months, the best relations
    were found in August. In addition, the predictive power of CWSIp was higher than
    IGp. Accordingly, the mentioned index can be suggested for predicting yield and
    physiological characteristics. This study has revealed the extensive potential
    to identify water stress in peppers using leaf patch clamp pressure probes and
    thermal cameras, which are plant-based monitoring tools. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

    Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) is the most troublesome weed in
    agronomic cropping systems in the United States (Heap Reference Heap, Pimentel
    and Peshin 2014). Several factors have enabled A. palmeri to become such a dominant
    and difficult-to-control weed, including its rapid growth rate (Ehleringer Reference
    Firbank and Watkinson 1985; Ehleringer and Forseth Reference Ehleringer and Forseth
    1980), prolific seed production (Keeley et al. Reference Keeley, Carter and Thullen
    1987), and ability to tolerate adverse environmental conditions (Franssen et al.
    Reference Franssen, Skinner, Al-Khatib, Horak and Kulakow 2001), including disease,
    genetic abnormalities, and water stress (Chahal et al. Reference Chahal, Irmak,
    Jugulam and Jhala 2018). From a 2-yr field study in Kansas, Horak and Loughin
    ( Reference Horak and Loughin 2000) reported that A. palmeri had a 50% higher
    growth rate (i.e., 0.18 to 0.21 cm per growing degree day) and leaf area than
    redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), tumble pigweed (Amaranthus albus
    L.), and waterhemp [Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.) Sauer]. In a field trial in
    Missouri, Sellers et al. ( Reference Sellers, Smeda, Johnson, Kendig and Ellersieck
    2017) reported a 65% greater dry weight of A. palmeri compared with A. retroflexus
    and A. albus, A. tuberculatus, spiny amaranth (Amaranthus spinosus L.), and smooth
    pigweed (Amaranthus hybridus L.) 2 wk after planting. It has also been reported
    that A. palmeri has greater root length and root biomass than most crops, allowing
    it to occupy a larger soil volume and extract soil nutrients (Wright et al. Reference
    Wright, Jennette, Coble and Rufty 1999), leading to crop yield losses if it is
    not controlled early in the growing season. Annually, weeds cause an estimated
    economic loss of more than US$100 billion and a 10% yield loss on a global scale
    (Appleby et al. Reference Appleby, Muller, Carpy and Muller 2000). In light of
    these losses, it is clear that a greater understanding of crop–weed interactions
    in terms of water, nutrients, light, and competition for other resources is necessary
    to develop cost-effective and sustainable weed management practices. Crop–weed
    competition models offer a significant tool for understanding and predicting crop
    yield losses due to crop–weed interference. Research is currently dominated by
    empirical studies in which crop yield loss (or crop yield) and weed threshold
    values are predicted in response to variable weed density or biomass in certain
    environmental conditions. Complex empirical models have been developed by considering
    variables such as multiple weed species in simultaneous competition (Diggle et
    al. Reference Diggle, Neve and Smith 2003; Firbank and Watkinson Reference Firbank
    and Watkinson 1985; Pantone and Baker Reference Pantone and Baker 1991; Park et
    al. Reference Park, Benjamin and Watkinson 2002), timing of weed emergence (Cousens
    et al. Reference Cousens, Brain, O’Donovan and O’Sullivan 1987; Neve et al. Reference
    Neve, Diggle and Smith 2003), and weeds with multiple emergence patterns (Peltzer
    et al. Reference Peltzer, Dougla, Diggle, George and Renton 2012). However, within
    these models, weed biological characteristics are unknown, limiting our understanding
    of weed growth in competition with crops and how that competition affects crop
    growth parameters as well as soil water dynamics and water use (evapotranspiration).
    At the intersection of weed and crop stomatal behavior, environmental conditions,
    and soil water availability, evapotranspiration is a major unknown. Crop–weed
    competition is a complex phenomenon, and for predictive purposes, a detailed mechanistic
    model offers greater insights than an empirical model. Mechanistic models consider
    all underlying morphological and physiological processes and their dependence
    on one another with respect to external forces and time (Singh et al. Reference
    Singh, Kaur, Chauhan, Chantre and Gonzalez-Andujar 2020). However, morphological
    and physiological plasticity in weed species is a challenge for studies/models
    that have been developed based on weed growth. Although some research on weed
    biology and ecology has been conducted, additional systemic studies in different
    locations and under different environmental conditions are needed to elucidate
    simulation models and thus weed management decisions (Chauhan and Johnson Reference
    Chauhan and Johnson 2010; Van Acker Reference Van Acker 2009). Robustly measured
    evapotranspiration data in systems can aid in strengthening modeling capabilities.
    In terms of crop–weed competition, the competitive ability of crops depends on
    many factors, such as (1) crop type and cultivar or variety selection, sowing
    date, row spacing, and tillage practice; (2) weed density and composition; (3)
    soil and climatic factors; and (4) crop rotation (Singh et al. Reference Singh,
    Kaur, Chauhan, Chantre and Gonzalez-Andujar 2020). As the inherent ability of
    crops to compete against weeds is weakened by climatic and soil stresses (Mohler
    Reference Mohler, Liebman, Mohler and Staver 2004), the time and method of irrigation
    management may also impact crop–weed competition, as weeds also benefit from increases
    in available soil water during irrigation. Additionally, understanding when, where,
    and how water is consumed by evapotranspiration is useful not only for evapotranspiration
    analyses, but for improving water use efficiency. Developing irrigation management
    strategies based on available soil water requires knowledge of weed and crop responses
    to water deficits, which can be obtained through modeling (Paredes et al. Reference
    Paredes, Rodrigues, Alves and Pereira 2014), relating biomass production to actual
    evapotranspiration (ETa). The effects of crop ETa rates on crop yield are well
    known; however, there is a lack of scientific information in terms of the effect
    of weed ETa on weed morphological features (e.g., biomass, leaf area index, plant
    height). While empirical crop–weed competition models have been useful, they have
    not been adequate in predicting crop–weed competition with A. palmeri under varying
    irrigation practices. By adopting a mechanistic approach to examine the effects
    of irrigation type on A. palmeri and crop competition, we can begin to use parameters
    such as ETa and total soil water (TSW) to strengthen predictive capabilities of
    mechanistic crop–weed competition models. Thus, the objective of this research
    was to determine the effect of center-pivot (CPI) versus subsurface drip irrigation
    (SDI) systems on the ETa of A. palmeri grown in maize (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine
    max (L.) Merr.], and fallow systems under the soil, climate, crop, and water management
    conditions of south-central Nebraska. Materials and Methods Plant Materials Glyphosate-resistant
    A. palmeri seeds were germinated in 11.4-cm-deep square plastic pots in a University
    of Nebraska–Lincoln greenhouse maintained at 18/24 C day/night temperatures with
    a 14-h photoperiod. Glyphosate-resistant A. palmeri was used so that other weeds
    could be controlled after A. palmeri plants were transplanted in the field. To
    ensure that A. palmeri plants were glyphosate-resistant, glyphosate at 2,526 g
    ae ha−1 mixed with liquid ammonium sulfate at 3% v/v was sprayed on 10- to 12-cm-tall
    A. palmeri plants using an AIXR TeeJet® (TeeJet, Grime, IA) nozzle. The herbicide
    mixture was applied at a rate of 140.3 L ha−1 at 1.0 m s−1 using a chamber track
    sprayer. Amaranthus palmeri plants survived the glyphosate application, signifying
    that the seed source was truly glyphosate resistant. Field Experimental Design,
    Site Description, and Crop Management Field experiments were conducted in 2019
    and 2020 growing seasons in the Irmak Research Laboratory’s advanced crop production,
    evapotranspiration, irrigation engineering, plant physiology, and climate change
    impact on agriculture and water resources research facilities at the University
    of Nebraska–Lincoln, South Central Agricultural Laboratory near Clay Center, NE
    (40.57°N, 98.12°W). A large experimental field was divided into CPI and SDI research
    facilities, both of which irrigation methods were established/installed by the
    senior author (SI) in 2005. Thus, the field topography, slope, soil characteristics,
    and other soil- and field-related characteristics of both CPI and SDI fields were
    similar (Table 1). The CPI field was irrigated using a four-span hydraulic and
    continuous-move system (T-L Irrigation, Hastings, NE) (Irmak Reference Irmak 2015).
    In the SDI field, 257-m-long drip lines were installed 0.40 m below the soil surface
    and were centered in the interrow area of every other plant row. Irrigation was
    applied directly to the crop root zone via drip emitters spaced approximately
    0.45 m apart along the drip lines (Netafim-USA, Fresno, CA) (Irmak Reference Irmak
    2010). Typical effective rooting depth of field maize in the experimental site
    is 1.2 m. The 30-yr average rainfall in the area during the growing season (May
    to August) is 112.4 mm, with significant annual and growing season variability
    in both timing and magnitude (de Sanctis and Jhala Reference De Sanctis and Jhala
    2021; Irmak Reference Irmak 2010, Reference Irmak 2015). Rainfall data from the
    2019 and 2020 growing seasons are presented in Figure 1. Table 1. Field and soil
    characteristics of center-pivot and subsurface drip irrigation fields. Figure
    1. Daily rainfall in (A) 2019 and (B) 2020 growing seasons at the experimental
    site (University of Nebraska–Lincoln, South Central Agricultural Laboratory near
    Clay Center, NE). The experiment was carried out as a split-plot design with two
    levels of irrigation assigned at the whole-plot level: CPI and SDI. At the split-plot
    level, six crop types were assigned to subplots. Nonrandomized subplots consisted
    of maize, soybean, and no crop (i.e., fallow) with A. palmeri; and maize, soybean,
    and fallow without A. palmeri. Maize, soybean, and fallow subplots without A.
    palmeri were included for TSW and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) data comparisons
    with subplots containing A. palmeri. Each subplot measured 3-m wide by 9-m long,
    with four rows of maize or soybean in the subplots containing these crops. The
    field was rolling stalk-chopped without tillage. A broadcast application of 11-52-0
    N-P-K at 168 kg ha−1 and an in-furrow injection of 32-0-0 N-P-K at 201 kg ha−1
    were applied across the entire experimental site before crops were sown. ‘Dekalb
    DKS 60-87RIB’ maize was planted at a depth of 5.0 cm and rate of 85,000 seeds
    ha−1. ‘NK S29-K3X’ soybean was planted at a depth of 3.8 cm and rate of 375,000
    seeds ha−1. Once A. palmeri plants reached a height of 18 to 25 cm in the greenhouse,
    12 plants were alternately transplanted 1 m apart in the two center rows of the
    subplots assigned A. palmeri. A premix of saflufenacil–imazethapyr–pyroxasulfone
    (Zidua® PRO herbicide) (Zidua Pro herbicide, Research Triangle Park, NC) (Acuron
    herbicide, Greensboro, NC) was applied at 215 g ai ha−1 to soybean; a premix of
    atrazine–bicyclopyrone–mesotrione–S-metolachlor (Acuron® herbicide) was applied
    at 2.4 kg ai ha−1 to maize and fallow; and a postemergence application of glyphosate
    at 1,263 g ha−1 was applied across all plots for control of existing weeds. Measurement
    of Soil Water Status and Irrigation Management Watermark Granular Matrix Sensors
    (Irrometer, Riverside, CA) were installed next to three A. palmeri plants or crop
    plants and between three A. palmeri and crop plants in each subplot to measure
    soil matric potential (SMP) on an hourly basis. The sensors were buried at 0-
    to 0.30-m, 0.30- to 0.60-m, and 0.60- to 0.90-m soil depths, and hourly data were
    collected from the A. palmeri transplant date to shortly before crop harvest in
    both years. A total of 45 and 54 sensors were installed across the subplots of
    each irrigation system in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The sensors were connected
    to model 900M Watermark Monitor data loggers (Irrometer). SMP measurements were
    converted to percent volumetric soil water content (VWC) using predetermined soil
    water retention curves for the same experimental field (Irmak Reference Irmak
    2019a, Reference Irmak 2019b): (1) where θv is the VWC (% vol or m3 m−3), and
    SMP is the soil matric potential (kPa). VWC was converted to TSW by adding the
    VWC values at each sensor depth and multiplying by a conversion value of 3.048
    (ft to mm). The TSW in the complete monitored soil profile (0 to 0.90 m) reflects
    the daily integration of soil moisture detected at individual incremental depths
    throughout the profile. Sensor data were used to determine crop and A. palmeri
    evapotranspiration using the soil water balance approach and for irrigation timing.
    Irrigation was initiated under CPI and SDI when the average SMP values of the
    top 0.90 m were approximately 100 to 110 kPa (Irmak et al. Reference Irmak, Burgert,
    Yang, Cassman, Walters, Rathje, Payero, Grassini, Kuzila, Brunkhorst, Eisenhauer,
    Kranz, VanDeWalle, Rees and Zoubek 2012, Reference Irmak, Payero, VanDeWalle,
    Rees, Zoubek, Martin, Kranz, Eisenhauer and Leininger 2016), which translates
    to a depletion of soil water in the crop root zone of 40% to 45% below field capacity
    (Irmak Reference Irmak 2019a, Reference Irmak 2019b). This SMP range was implemented
    to prevent water stress. Irrigation of 32 mm was applied once per experimental
    field between July 31 and August 2 of 2019. In 2020, irrigation of 32 mm was applied
    six times per experimental field between July 13 and September 1. Seasonal Actual
    Evapotranspiration Using Soil–Water Balance Crop and A. palmeri actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa, mm) were calculated for each experimental subplot using the procedures outlined
    in Irmak ( Reference Irmak 2015) by implementing a soil water balance equation:
    (2) where P is precipitation (mm), I is irrigation water applied (mm), U is upward
    soil-moisture flux (mm), R on is surface run-on within the field (mm), R off is
    surface runoff from individual treatments (mm), ΔSWS is change in soil water storage
    in the root zone soil profile (mm), and D is deep percolation below the crop root
    zone (mm). U was assumed to be zero, as the groundwater depth in the experimental
    field is about 33 to 35 m below the surface (Irmak Reference Irmak 2010). Deep
    percolation was estimated by a soil water balance approach using a program written
    in Microsoft Visual Basic (Bryant et al. Reference Bryant, Benson, Kiniry, Williams
    and Lacewell 1992; Irmak Reference Irmak 2015). Inputs to the program include
    initial water content of the soil profile at crop emergence, irrigation date and
    amount, maximum rooting depth, crop maturity date, soil parameters, and daily
    weather data (i.e., incoming shortwave radiation, relative humidity, air temperature,
    precipitation, and wind speed). The program calculated daily ETa and the water
    balance in the crop root zone using the two-step approach (ETa = K c × ET0), where
    ETo is evapotranspiration of a grass reference crop, and K c is the crop coefficient.
    In the program, ETo is calculated using weather data as the input to the Penman-Monteith
    equation (Monteith Reference Monteith 1965), and K c is used to adjust the estimated
    ETo for the reference crop to that of the desired crops at different growth stages
    and environments (Irmak Reference Irmak 2015). The daily soil water balance equation
    used for calculating deep percolation as presented in Irmak ( Reference Irmak
    2015) is: (3) where D j is deep percolation on day j (mm), P j is precipitation
    on day j (mm), R j is precipitation and/or irrigation runoff from the soil surface
    on day j (mm), I j is irrigation depth on day j (mm), ETaj is crop or A. palmeri
    actual evapotranspiration on day j (mm), and CD j is root zone cumulative depletion
    depth at the end of day j − 1, estimated using the two-step approach (Irmak Reference
    Irmak 2015). Following Irmak ( Reference Irmak 2015), R off from individual treatments
    was estimated using the USDA-NRCS curve number method. As suggested by Irmak (
    Reference Irmak 2015), according to the silt loam soil at the experimental site
    and the known land use, slope, and conservation tillage, curve number C = 75 was
    used. Assuming U and R on are negligible, the soil water balance equation was
    reduced to the following form for calculating crop and A. palmeri ETa (Irmak Reference
    Irmak 2015): (4) Growth Index, Plant Biomass, and Total Leaf Area Measurements
    Three A. palmeri plants were selected and sampled at four removal timings according
    to soybean growth stage. Soybean growth stage was selected instead of maize growth
    stage, because it was easier to visually determine compared with maize. Removal
    timings occurred at V4, R1, R3, and R5 soybean growth stages in 2019, and at R1,
    R3, R5, and R6 soybean growth stages in 2020. The later removal timings in 2020
    were a result of COVID-19 delays. Growth index, plant biomass, and total leaf
    area of each A. palmeri plant were determined at these removal timings and then
    averaged over all subsampled replicates for a total of 24 sample units each growing
    season. Growth index was calculated using the following equation (Irmak et al.
    Reference Irmak, Haman, Irmak, Jones, Campbell and Crisman 2004; Sarangi et al.
    Reference Sarangi, Irmak, Lindquist, Knezevic and Jhala 2015): (5) where w is
    the width of the plant calculated as an average of two widths, one measured at
    the widest point and another at 90° to the first; and h is the plant height measured
    from the soil surface to the shoot apical meristem. After plant height and width
    measurements were taken, leaves were counted and removed from each A. palmeri
    plant to measure total leaf area using a leaf area meter (LI-3100C Area Meter,
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Amaranthus palmeri plants were stored separately in paper
    bags and oven-dried at 65 C for 7 d to obtain dry biomass. Statistical Analysis
    TSW, ETa, growth index, plant biomass, and total leaf area (TLA) responses were
    averaged over all subsampled replicates across study years. Data responses were
    averaged across study years, because crop type and A. palmeri combinations were
    not randomized across subplots. Thus, A. palmeri plants within each crop subplot
    were not independent replications. When data were averaged across study years,
    the crop subplots with and without A. palmeri were the experimental units for
    TSW and ETa data analyses, while sampling date was the experimental unit for growth
    index, plant biomass, and TLA data analyses. Response analyses were run in PROC
    GLIMMIX within SAS v. 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). TSW and ETa responses were
    assumed to be normally distributed based on the residual plots. Variables included
    in the model were irrigation, crop type, presence of A. palmeri, and time of season
    in which the treatment response was measured. The time of season variable was
    created by separating dates across study years into early-, mid-, and late-season
    time intervals (Table 2). Within each time interval, five and four individual
    dates were included in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Individual dates were used
    as the level of replication for each of the irrigation, crop type, A. palmeri,
    and time of season variable combinations. Random effects included in the model
    accounted for whole-plot variation within a year between experimental units where
    irrigation was assigned; for split-plot variation due to the relationship between
    subplots; for variation between the time of season data that were measured within
    subplots throughout the experiment; and to fit a covariance structure to the residual
    variability that arose from the relationship between individual date measurements
    taken on the same experimental units within combinations of year, irrigation,
    crop type, and time of season. AR(1) and ARH(1) structures were utilized for the
    TSW and ETa responses, respectively. Least-squares means (LSM) analyses were performed
    on means of each main effect (i.e., irrigation, crop type, presence of A. palmeri,
    and time of season) across years. A t-test was performed for all LSM analyses
    to indicate differences among the estimated means of the main effects. Table 2.
    Early-, mid-, and late-season date ranges within each time interval in 2019 and
    2020. Growth index, plant biomass, and TLA subsampled averages were skewed, with
    late-season responses having much larger values than early- and mid-season treatment
    responses. Based on the skewness and the fact that these treatment responses can
    only have values greater than zero, the responses were analyzed using a gamma
    distribution with a log link function (Lawless Reference Lawless 2002; Nelson
    Reference Nelson 1982). Final analyses for growth index, plant biomass, and TLA
    contained 48 observations, including data across 2 yr, two types of irrigation,
    three crop types, and four sampling dates. Averaging over the subsamples, year
    measurements were used as the level of replication; thus, variables included in
    the final model were irrigation, crop type, and sampling date. The model contained
    random effects accounting for whole-plot variation within a year between experimental
    units where irrigation was assigned and for split-plot variation due to the relationship
    between subplots. Results and Discussion TSW Regarding the time of season effect,
    early-season TSW was greatest (308 mm), followed by similar midseason (288 mm)
    and late-season (290 mm) subsampled TSW means (Figure 2B). Neither irrigation
    method nor presence of 1 A. palmeri plant m−2 significantly affected TSW at the
    subplot level. Although 1 A. palmeri plant m−2 did not significantly affect mean
    subplot TSW in this study, it is plausible that A. palmeri density > 1 plant m−2
    will have variable effects on TSW given differing environmental conditions (Nielsen
    et al. Reference Nielsen, Lyon, Higgins, Hergert, Holman and Vigil 2016; Robinson
    and Nielson Reference Robinson and Nielsen 2015; Unger and Vigil Reference Unger
    and Vigil 1998). Studies conducted by Berger et al. ( Reference Berger, Ferrell,
    Rowland and Webster 2015) and Massinga et al. ( Reference Massinga, Currie and
    Trooien 2003) found that crop fields with 1 A. palmeri plant m−2 have lower TSW
    than weed-free cropping systems. Several factors could have affected these results,
    including hard to control weeds that impacted subplot water use data (e.g., spotted
    spurge [Chamaesyce maculata (L.) Small]), low sample size for each treatment,
    and deeper rooting systems of A. palmeri compared with maize and soybean. Although
    root length and distribution of A. palmeri plants were not collected, the rooting
    system of A. palmeri plants likely extended beyond the depth of the soil-moisture
    sensors in the study (Wright et al. Reference Wright, Jennette, Coble and Rufty
    1999), increasing the TSW around soil-moisture sensors in fallow subplots with
    A. palmeri. Figure 2. Estimated average total soil water (TSW, mm) across (A)
    crop type and (B) time of season in a study to determine evapotranspiration of
    Amaranthus palmeri in maize, soybean, and fallow under center-pivot and subsurface
    drip irrigation systems at the experimental site (University of Nebraska–Lincoln,
    South Central Agricultural Laboratory near Clay Center, NE). Standard error bars
    represent a 95% confidence interval. Different letters indicate significant differences
    between crop type and time of season (P ≤ 0.05). According to a type III test
    of fixed effects for variable interactions and main effects, TSW was affected
    by crop type (P = 0.002) and time of season (P = 0.0023) across 2019 and 2020.
    Mean TSW was greatest in fallow subplots with and without A. palmeri (325 mm),
    followed by mean TSW in soybean subplots (291 mm) and maize subplots (269 mm)
    with and without A. palmeri (Figure 3A). These results were expected, as A. palmeri
    was the only plant extracting soil water in fallow subplots, while both A. palmeri
    and crops were extracting soil water in the maize and soybean subplots. These
    results are also supported by the fact that A. palmeri typically has a deeper
    root system than maize or soybean (Wright et al. Reference Wright, Jennette, Coble
    and Rufty 1999), allowing A. palmeri to extract soil water far below the soil-moisture
    sensors, resulting in higher mean TSW in fallow subplots. Figure 3. Estimated
    average actual evapotranspiration (ET, mm) across crop type and time of season
    in a study to determine evapotranspiration of Amaranthus palmeri in maize, soybean,
    and fallow under center-pivot and subsurface drip irrigation systems at the experimental
    site (University of Nebraska–Lincoln, South Central Agricultural Laboratory near
    Clay Center, NE). Standard error bars represent a 95% confidence interval. Different
    letters indicate significant differences between crop type and time of season
    (P ≤ 0.05). Scaled Actual Evapotranspiration According to a type III test of fixed
    effects for variable interactions and main effects, ETa was affected by crop type
    and time of season interaction (P = 0.013) and by the presence of A. palmeri (P
    = 0.045) across 2019 and 2020. According to the simple effect comparisons of the
    crop type and time of season interaction, subplots with maize and soybean recorded
    statistically greater early-season ETa of 28 to 30 mm and late-season ETa of 7
    to 8 mm compared with fallow subplots. Midseason subplot ETa values in maize and
    soybean were similar, while fallow subplot ETa was similar to maize and slightly
    lower than soybean subplot ETa (Figure 3). Sugita et al. ( Reference Sugita, Matsuno,
    El-Kilani, Abdel-Fattah and Mahmoud 2017) reported similar time of season changes
    of ETa, where strong ETa responses to irrigation or rain events occurred during
    earlier growth stages, and more stable ETa responses occurred at the vegetative
    peak of the growing season. This is important, because A. palmeri can germinate
    and grow throughout an entire growing season (May to September) (Keeley et al.
    Reference Keeley, Carter and Thullen 1987). Although germinating late in the growing
    season may be detrimental to A. palmeri growth and seed production, optimal temperatures
    late into the growing season allow for rapid growth of A. palmeri while maize
    and soybean growth is beginning to slow, increasing the competitive ability of
    A. palmeri for water and nutrients that the crop also needs for seed production.
    Regarding the presence of A. palmeri on ETa, subplots with A. palmeri had greater
    ETa of 28 mm compared with 23 mm in subplots without A. palmeri (Figure 4). Greater
    ETa from subplots with A. palmeri can be attributed to the variable relationship
    between VWC and ETa throughout the growing season (Wilson et al. Reference Wilson,
    Kustas, Alfieri, Anderson, Gao, Prueger, McKee, Alsina, Sanchez and Alstad 2020).
    In early spring, when V2-V3 crops and 18- to 25-cm A. palmeri were the primary
    sources of evapotranspiration, ETa was strongly correlated with VWC. As crop and
    A. palmeri growth progressed, ETa was largely independent of VWC as plants began
    to access water beyond the depth of the soil-moisture sensors. As the soil profile
    dried during the growing season, the correlation between ETa and VWC emerged once
    again as the crop became largely dependent on irrigation. Amaranthus palmeri likely
    affected overall subplot ETa, because the root system remained below 0.90 m and
    was less dependent on irrigation compared with the crops. Root length and root
    distribution of A. palmeri plants were not analyzed in this study, although these
    plant characteristics likely contributed to the ETa differences seen in subplots
    with and without A. palmeri (Wright et al. Reference Wright, Jennette, Coble and
    Rufty 1999). Figure 4. Estimated average actual evapotranspiration (ET, mm) of
    subplots with and without Amaranthus palmeri in a study to determine evapotranspiration
    of Amaranthus palmeri in maize, soybean, and fallow under center-pivot and subsurface
    drip irrigation systems at the experimental site (University of Nebraska–Lincoln,
    South Central Agricultural Laboratory near Clay Center, NE). Standard error bars
    represent a 95% confidence interval. Different letters indicate significant differences
    between subplots with and without A. palmeri (P ≤ 0.05). Growth Index, Plant Biomass,
    and TLA According to a type III test of fixed effects for variable interactions
    and main effects, the mean growth index and mean biomass of A. palmeri were affected
    by a sampling date and crop type interaction across both study years (P < 0.0001).
    As expected, from the second sampling date onward, the growth index and biomass
    of A. palmeri in fallow subplots were higher (0.3 to 5.6 m3 and 0.06 to 1.27 kg,
    respectively) compared with A. palmeri in maize (0.06 to 0.23 m3 and 0.008 to
    0.03 kg, respectively) and soybean (0.06 to 0.7 m3 and 0.01 to 0.16 kg, respectively)
    subplots (Figures 5 and 6). While A. palmeri growth index rates in maize and soybean
    were similar throughout the growing season, A. palmeri biomass was higher in soybean
    (0.05 to 0.16 kg) compared with maize (0.01 to 0.03 kg) at the third and fourth
    sampling dates (Figure 6). Mahoney et al. ( Reference Mahoney, Jordan, Hare, Leon,
    Roma-Burgos, Vann, Jennings, Everman and Cahoon 2021) reported similar results,
    wherein taller weeds like A. palmeri were more competitive in fields with shorter
    crop canopies (e.g., soybean) and less competitive in crops that provide shading
    earlier in the growing season (e.g., maize), resulting in greater A. palmeri biomass
    in soybean systems (0.035 kg plant−1) compared with maize systems (0.002 kg plant−1).
    The reason for this is that when growing in competition with maize, A. palmeri
    allocates most of its resources toward vertical growth, whereas in competition
    with soybean, A. palmeri first allocates most of its resources toward vertical
    growth. Once it reaches the soybean height, A. palmeri begins allocating most
    of its resources toward lateral growth, resulting in more branching and thus greater
    biomass production. These results are not surprising, given A. palmeri’s rapid
    growth rate (Culpepper et al. Reference Culpepper, Webster, Sosnoskie, York and
    Nandula 2010; Horak and Loughin Reference Horak and Loughin 2000), biomass accumulation
    (Sellers et al. Reference Sellers, Smeda, Johnson, Kendig and Ellersieck 2017),
    and photosynthetic rate three to four times that of maize, soybean, and cotton
    (Gossypium hirsutum L.) (Steckel Reference Steckel 2007). Figure 5. Estimated
    average of scaled Amaranthus palmeri growth index across crop type within each

    Agricultural Laboratory near Clay Center, NE). Standard error bars represent a
    95% confidence interval. Different letters indicate a significant difference between
    crop types within each sampling date (P ≤ 0.05). Estimates are scaled down by

    August 8, 2019, August 26, 2020. According to a type III test of fixed effects
    for variable interactions and main effects, A. palmeri TLA was affected by a sampling
    date, irrigation, and crop type interaction across both years (P = 0.023). Similar
    to A. palmeri growth index and biomass results, differences in A. palmeri TLA
    across crop type were evident from the second sampling date until the end of the
    growing season. The TLA of A. palmeri in fallow subplots was greater (41 to 2,575
    m2) compared with maize (6.6 to 17.8 m2) and soybean (10.0 to 47.6 m2) subplots,
    which correlates with A. palmeri growth index and biomass results. An irrigation
    effect on TLA was detected, although this is likely due to the missing TLA data
    points of A. palmeri in fallow subplots under CPI and SDI in 2020. Due to a severe
    hailstorm the evening before the sampling date, only one A. palmeri in the fallow
    subplot under CPI was sampled for TLA in 2020, resulting in skewed A. palmeri
    TLA under SDI from an outlier in 2019. Thus, sampling date and crop type are the
    variables more likely to affect TLA in this study. Practical Implications This
    is the first study evaluating the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of A. palmeri
    in multiple crops under CPI and SDI with the goal of finding an irrigation effect
    on A. palmeri ETa. The results indicate differences in A. palmeri ETa between
    time of season (early, mid-, and late season) and crop species across 2019 and
    2020. While our analyses indicate irrigation contributes to differences in mid-
    and late-season A. palmeri TLA between crop species, irrigation did not affect
    subplot or sub-subplot ETa, TSW, or A. palmeri growth index or biomass. Additionally,
    the irrigation effect on A. palmeri TLA is likely a result of missing TLA data
    at the fourth sampling date in 2020. Although irrigation did not significantly
    affect subplot data, the presence of A. palmeri did have an impact on sub-subplot
    ETa across both years. This can be attributed to the variable relationship between
    VWC and ETa throughout the growing season due to advancing phenological stages
    and management practices. As crop and A. palmeri growth progressed, ETa was largely
    independent of VWC as plants began to access water beyond the depth of the soil-moisture
    sensors. As the soil profile dried during the growing season, the correlation
    between ETa and VWC emerged once again as the crop became largely dependent on
    irrigation. However, A. palmeri likely affected overall sub-subplot ETa, because
    the root system remained below 0.90 m and was less dependent on irrigation compared
    with the crops. Root length and root distribution of A. palmeri plants were not
    analyzed in this study, although these data parameters likely contributed to the
    ETa differences seen in subplots with and without A. palmeri. Thus, future studies
    exploring weed species’ water use should measure root length and root distribution
    using soil-moisture sensors over the entire rooting profile of the plant to better
    understand the relationship between VWC and ETa. As indicated by the time of season
    effect on TSW and ETa, irrigation or rain events, along with plant phenotypical
    development, can significantly influence the TSW and ETa relationship. These observations
    hold significance for growers who are considering irrigation expansion and upgradation.
    Selecting an SDI system may lower water use due to reduced evaporation; however,
    the presence of a heavy A. palmeri infestation in an SDI field may increase competition
    for water between A. palmeri and the crop, because the irrigated water is more
    readily available to plants. The rooting depth and distribution of A. palmeri
    under differing irrigation systems will need to be quantified and compared with
    water use data to make an accurate assessment of irrigation choice. Traditionally,
    crop system suitability, irrigation efficiency, and investment cost are factors
    that determine selection among CPI and SDI systems. However, results of this study
    suggest that weed–crop competition should also be considered, making irrigation
    method selection a holistic process that weighs both biotic and abiotic consequences.
    This study provides fundamentally critical information on A. palmeri evapotranspiration
    and its relation to A. palmeri morphological features (e.g., growth index, biomass,
    and TLA) for future use in mechanistic (and empirical) weed–crop competition models.
    ETa is highly location specific and is driven by weather, soils, and farm management;
    thus, further research on ETa of economically important broadleaf and grass weed
    species should be conducted under diverse environments to build a robust database.
    Other economically important weed species such as velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti
    Medik.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), and giant foxtail (Setaria
    faberi Herrm.) in row-crop production would likely result in lower ETa due to
    lower competitive phenotypes compared with A. palmeri. Root depth and distribution,
    along with growth rate, are factors that would need to be considered when comparing
    water use of multiple weed species and the effect of varying irrigation methods
    on water use. The ETa results for A. palmeri would likely differ in other environments
    as well, demonstrating the need for more research of this nature conducted in
    diverse environments. Ehleringer ( Reference Ehleringer 1983) reported the net
    rate of A. palmeri photosynthesis is temperature dependent, with the optimum range
    occurring between 36 C and 46 C. The average daytime temperatures in July and
    August in south-central Nebraska are 29 C and 30 C, respectively (NCEI 2020).
    If this same study were conducted in the southern United States, A. palmeri plants
    would likely have higher rates of ETa because of higher rates of photosynthesis
    due to higher average temperatures, likely increasing A. palmeri growth index,
    biomass, and TLA. To effectively build a robust database of the interaction of
    evapotranspiration (i.e., water use) and morphological features of economically
    important agronomic weed species, this type of research should be implemented
    across various and diverse environments. Acknowledgments The advanced CPI and

  description: Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has emerged as a reliable method
    for soil moisture and snow estimation. However, the applicability of this method
    beyond research has been limited due to, among others, the use of relatively large
    and expensive sensors. This paper presents the tests conducted on a new scintillator-based
    sensor especially designed to jointly measure neutron counts, muons and total
    gamma rays. The neutron signal is first compared against two conventional gas-tube-based
    CRNS sensors at two locations. The estimated soil moisture is further assessed
    at four agricultural sites, based on gravimetric soil moisture collected within
    the sensor footprint. Muon fluxes are compared to the incoming neutron variability
    measured at a neutron monitoring station and total gammas counts are compared
    to the signal detected by a gamma ray spectrometer. The results show that the
    neutron dynamic detected by the new scintillator-based CRNS sensor is well in
    agreement with conventional CRNS sensors. The derived soil moisture also agreed
    well with the gravimetric soil moisture measurements. The muons and the total
    gamma rays simultaneously detected by the sensor show promising features to account
    for the incoming variability and for discriminating irrigation and precipitation
    events, respectively. Further experiments and analyses should be conducted, however,
    to better understand the accuracy and the added value of these additional data
    for soil moisture estimation. Overall, the new scintillator design shows to be
    a valid and compact alternative to conventional CRNS sensors for non-invasive
    soil moisture monitoring and to open the path to a wide range of applications.

    2023 – Accepted: 19 Oct 2023 – Published: 16 Jan 2024 1 Introduction Soil moisture
    plays a key role in the hydrological cycle controlling water and energy fluxes
    at the land surface (Seneviratne et al., 2010; Vereecken et al., 2008). For this
    reason, an accurate monitoring of this variable is crucial in many applications,
    ranging from agricultural water management (Lichtenberg et al., 2015), runoff
    generation and floods (Bronstert et al., 2011; Saadi et al., 2020) and landslide
    prediction (Abraham et al., 2021; Zhuo et al., 2019). The main challenges in monitoring
    this variable are related to its strong spatial and temporal variability driven
    by the different hydrological processes at the land surface (Haghighi et al.,
    2018) and further aggravated by human activities like irrigation and drainage
    (Domínguez-Niño et al., 2020). Several instruments for monitoring soil moisture
    are available nowadays, ranging from invasive point-scale soil moisture sensors
    to remote sensing methods with larger coverage (Babaeian et al., 2019; Corradini,
    2014; Ochsner et al., 2013). More recently, attention has been paid to the development
    and assessment of the so-called proximal soil moisture sensors (Bogena et al.,
    2015). These non-invasive near-ground detectors have the advantage of estimating
    soil moisture over an intermediate scale (10–200 m radius) and at subdaily resolutions,
    providing a new perspective for hydrological observations (Ochsner et al., 2013).
    Among these non-invasive techniques, cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) (Zreda
    et al., 2008) has shown good performance in several environmental conditions like
    natural ecosystems (Franz et al., 2012), meadows (Zhu et al., 2016), cropped fields
    (Rivera Villarreyes et al., 2011; Coopersmith et al., 2014) and forests (Heidbüchel
    et al., 2016; Jeong et al., 2021). This technique relies on the negative correlation
    between natural neutron fluxes in a specific energy range (0.5 eV–100 keV) and
    hydrogen pools at and in the ground, providing the base for monitoring soil moisture
    (Zreda et al., 2012), snow (Schattan et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2016) and biomass
    (Baroni and Oswald, 2015; Jakobi et al., 2018). It is noteworthy that this negative
    correlation has been detected for a long time but mostly considered a nuisance
    in space weather monitoring (Hands et al., 2021; Hendrick and Edge, 1966) and
    rock dating (Gosse and Phillips, 2001). First studies showing the value of this
    signal for hydrological applications were presented only some years later, based
    on a neutron detector installed below the ground (Kodama et al., 1979). Its application,
    however, remained limited to some integrations into long-term observation networks
    for snow estimation (Morin et al., 2012). A strong contribution to the development
    and spread of this technique was provided only more recently when the need for
    a better understanding of the interaction of these neutron fluxes and soil moisture
    led to its investigation (Zreda et al., 2008). In this context, the neutron detector
    had been installed aboveground, and the signal agreed well with soil moisture
    over an area of several hectares and down to a depth of several decimeters (Franz
    et al., 2012; Köhli et al., 2015), providing a new prospective monitor of hydrological
    variables at the land surface (Desilets et al., 2010). Nowadays, this aboveground
    CRNS method is used by many research groups worldwide, and it is integrated into
    some national monitoring systems to provide a better understanding of hydrological
    processes and to support water management and assessments (Andreasen et al., 2017b;
    Bogena et al., 2022; Cooper et al., 2021; Hawdon et al., 2014; Upadhyaya et al.,
    2021; Zreda et al., 2012; Evans et al., 2016). Initially, all the CRNS detectors
    were based on proportional gas tubes filled in with helium-3 or boron trifluoride
    (Schrön et al., 2018; Zreda et al., 2012). Alternative sensors are now emerging
    that could also pave the way for new and wider applications (Cirillo et al., 2021;
    Flynn et al., 2021; Patrignani et al., 2021; Stevanato et al., 2019; Stowell et
    al., 2021; Weimar et al., 2020; van Amelrooij et al., 2022). In this context,
    the scintillator-based neutron detector design showed a good capability to measure
    neutrons with different energies (Cester et al., 2016). A first prototype specifically
    for soil moisture estimation was developed and tested, showing good performance
    in comparison with independent soil moisture observations (Stevanato et al., 2019).
    This detector was further improved by, e.g., reducing environmental temperature
    effects on the recorded signal and reducing its energy consumption (Stevanato
    et al., 2020). First comparisons with independent data confirmed the good performances
    of these devices (Gianessi et al., 2021), with the additional advantage of measuring
    muons for on-site incoming neutron correction (Stevanato et al., 2022). In this
    study, we present a comprehensive description and assessment of this new scintillator-based
    CRNS detector. The assessment is performed based on (i) a comparison of the detected
    neutron counts with conventional gas-tube-based CRNS instruments at two experimental
    sites, (ii) a comparison of the derived soil moisture with independent gravimetric
    soil moisture measurements at four additional experimental sites, (iii) a comparison
    of detected muons with incoming neutrons measured at a neutron monitoring station,
    and (iv) a comparison of total gamma counts with a conventional gamma ray spectrometer
    at one experimental site. The added value of muons and gamma particles simultaneously
    recorded by the sensor are also explored and discussed. 2 Materials and methods
    2.1 The detector assembly Scintillators have been identified as a promising alternative
    to proportional gas tubes for measuring neutrons in many applications (Peerani
    et al., 2012). The main advantages are the use of cheaper and safer materials
    than proportional gas tubes based on helium-3 or boron trifluoride, respectively.
    Moreover, the flexibility in manipulating the detecting material (e.g., thin layers)
    allows us to optimize the sensitive area and to develop relatively efficient but
    compact sensors. The scintillators are made of plastic or organic materials that
    emit photons in the visible or near-ultraviolet (UV) region when hit by radiation.
    The scintillator materials used for neutron detection, in particular, have a unique
    property, in comparison to inorganic scintillators, in that they release light
    in different ways when hit by different particles. The identification of the type
    of particle or ray is achieved by means of pulse shape analysis (PSA), which exploits
    the different profiles at the time of the signals. Among others, a typical parameter
    used in this analysis is the so-called pulse shape discrimination parameter (PSD),
    which is given by the ratio of the integrated charge in the tail of the signal
    with respect to the total integrated charge. An example is shown in Fig. 1a, which
    shows how different particles (here thermal neutrons and cosmic muons) populate
    very different regions in the PSD vs. integrated-charge plane. For more details
    on the analysis and on the parameters used for the identification of the single
    events, we refer to more specific studies (e.g., Cester et al., 2016). In the
    present study, we use the scintillator-based sensor FINAPP3 developed by FINAPP
    s.r.l. (http://finapptech.com/en, last access: 14 January 2024). The main parts
    of the sensor are shown in Fig. 1b. The sensor hosts two main detectors. The first
    detector (detector 1 in Fig. 1b) is a multi-layer zinc sulfide Ag-doped scintillator
    mixed with lithium-6 fluoride powder embedded in a silicone-based matrix. Epithermal
    neutrons are further moderated by the polyethylene shield and brought to thermal
    energies (around 0.026 eV), where the neutron capture cross section on Li-6 is
    the maximum. The Li-6 embedded inside the detectors has a large cross section
    for neutron capture. When a Li-6 nucleus captures a neutron, then a nuclear reaction
    occurs, and the compound Li-7 breaks into an alpha particle (He-4) and a triton
    (H-3), with a large energy release of almost 5 MeV. This energy is converted into
    light (a flash of optical photons) by the ZnS(Ag) crystals. The energy release
    in the thin layers of the scintillator (a few hundreds of microns) is strong for
    local interactions coming from the neutron–Li capture reaction products, providing
    a large electrical signal that is well above the voltage threshold used to cut
    the instrument noise. This detector can also measure cosmic-ray-induced muons
    (in the energy range of around 4 GeV) that are distinguished by a real-time PSD,
    as described above. The possibility to detect muons in the same device was proven
    by the comparison with standard muon telescopes (patent no. IT102021000003728).
    The second main detector (detector 2 in Fig. 1b) is a small (2 in. ×2 in.; 5.08 cm
    ×5.08 cm) commercial organic scintillator (EJ200 from Eljen Technology Inc.).
    Due to the low effective atomic number Zeff, typical of organic materials, gamma
    rays interact with this scintillator mainly by Compton scattering, providing the
    spectrum shape of the Compton continuum from zero to the Compton edges. In the
    energy range above 3.0 MeV, no gamma rays are present but only signals with a
    larger energy deposit (e.g., 10 MeV); this is mainly due to cosmic muons. For
    this reason, this second detector can not only measure muons as the first detector
    but also the total gamma ray fluxes in the energy range between 0.3 and 3.0 MeV.
    For more details about the detected signals, we refer to more specific studies
    (Boo et al., 2021; Ford et al., 2008). Finally, two commercial photomultipliers
    (PMTs in Fig. 1b) from Hamamatsu Photonics (Hamamatsu, Japan) are used to transform
    the light (visible photons) to an electric pulse. The sensor can be further integrated
    with air pressure, air temperature and air humidity sensors. A single electronics
    board takes care of detector signal acquisition, real-time data processing and
    data logging to a remote server. All the components of the detector are in a box
    of about 40 × 30 × 20 cm, with a total weight of 8 kg. Energy consumption is minimized
    to 0.4 W (35 mA at 12 V), and it is supplied by a relatively small solar panel
    (20 W) installed above the sensor. Overall, the new sensor assembly provides neutrons,
    muons and gamma counting rates that can be further corrected and elaborated on
    to retrieve soil moisture, as described in the next sections. Figure 1(a) Typical
    pulse shape discrimination (PSD) vs. integrated-charge plot for a FINAPP3 detector.
    Red and blue ovals indicate the neutron and muon region, respectively. (b) Scintillator-based
    sensor FINAPP3, with the two main detectors, photomultiplier (PMTs), board and
    battery. 2.2 From neutron counts to soil moisture estimation The measured neutron
    count rates N are corrected for air pressure (fp), variability in the incoming
    neutron flux (fi) and air vapor (fv) to account for local atmospheric effects
    based on the following correction factors (Zreda et al., 2012): where β= 0.0076 (mb−1),
    α= 0.0054 (m3 g−1); p and h are air pressure (mb) and absolute humidity (g m−3);
    I is the incoming flux of cosmic-ray neutrons induced by galactic primary particles
    in the Earth''s atmosphere (counts per hour, cph); and href, pref and Iref are
    reference values (here the average is taken) of air pressure, absolute air humidity
    and incoming neutron flux during the measuring period, respectively. Air pressure
    and relative air humidity are generally measured locally (or taken from a weather
    station nearby) and the latter can be converted into absolute air humidity using
    measured air temperature. In contrast, data of the incoming fluctuations are commonly
    downloaded (e.g., from https://www.nmdb.eu/nest/, last access: 14 January 2024)
    from dedicated neutron incoming monitoring stations located at some places globally
    (Simpson, 2000). For the specific case study, data from JUNG station at Jungfraujoch
    (Switzerland) are used for the correction, as commonly adopted in many applications
    in central Europe (Bogena et al., 2022). Finally, the corrected neutron count
    rate Nc is transformed to volumetric soil moisture θ based on Desilets equation
    (Desilets et al., 2010): where ρbd and ρw are the soil bulk density (kg m−3) and
    water density (kg m−3), respectively; θoffset is the combined gravimetric water
    equivalent of additional hydrogen pools, i.e., lattice water (LW) and soil organic
    carbon (SOC); and N0 is approximately the counting rate of the detector at a site
    during very dry soil conditions. The value N0 can be calibrated based on independent
    soil sampling campaigns, as suggested in different studies (Schrön et al., 2017;
    Franz et al., 2012). The data processing described above has been implemented
    in a simple spreadsheet available from Baroni (2022b). For a more advanced data
    processing that also integrates additional external datasets, readers can refer
    to Power et al. (2021). 2.3 Assessment of neutron counts to other conventional
    CRNS sensors at two sites (Austria and Germany) The comparison to other conventional
    gas-tube-based CRNS detectors has been conducted at two experimental sites (Fig.
    2). The first site is located at Marchfeld (near Vienna, Austria; 48.24∘ N, 16.55∘ E).
    The second site is located at Marquardt (near Potsdam, Germany; 52.45∘ N, 12.96∘ E).
    The recorded time series covers the period of 7 months, starting from May 2021,
    when a FINAPP3 detector was installed at both sites. Figure 2Experimental sites
    at (a) Marchfeld (near Vienna, Austria) and (b) Marquardt (near Potsdam, Germany).
    At Marchfeld experimental site, the FINAPP3 sensor is compared with a CRS2000
    device, a boron-10 trifluoride proportional gas tube produced by Hydroinnova (https://www.hydroinnova.com,
    last access: 14 January 2024) and that has been used in many studies (Andreasen
    et al., 2016; Baroni and Oswald, 2015; Hawdon et al., 2014). At the Marquardt
    site, several CRNS sensors of different designs are available for comparison (Heistermann
    et al., 2023). In the present study, we selected a sensor based on two boron trifluoride
    proportional gas tubes (a double CRNS sensor system type called BF3-C-4) from
    Lab-C LLC, sold by Quaesta Instruments (https://www.quaestainstruments.com, last
    access: 14 January 2024). This sensor provides a high sensitivity for neutron
    detection and thus a good signal-to-noise ratio, which promises potential for
    estimating soil moisture at even about hourly time resolutions (Fersch et al.,
    2020). All the detectors have been installed at a height of around 1.5 m above
    the ground and placed at a distance of a few meters distance apart. Considering
    the large footprint of the signal detected, this horizontal difference is considered
    negligible for the comparison (Rivera Villarreyes et al., 2011; Patrignani et
    al., 2021; Schrön et al., 2018). All the detectors have been equipped with a solar
    panel and with GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) data transmission
    for supporting long-term observations and real-time monitoring. 2.4 Assessment
    of derived soil moisture with independent gravimetric soil sampling campaigns
    (Italy) A second assessment of the FINAPP3 sensor was carried out by a series
    of independent gravimetric soil sampling campaigns. The experiments were conducted
    in 2021 at four experimental sites located in the Po river plain, northern Italy
    (Fig. 3). At the San Pietro Capofiume (44.65∘ N, 11.64∘ E; near Bologna, Italy)
    and Legnaro sites (45.34∘ N, 11.96∘ E; near Padova, Italy), the sensors were installed
    over a grassland with low biomass that is surrounded by agricultural cropped fields.
    Conversely, at Ceregnano (45.05∘ N, 11.86∘ E; near Rovigo, Italy) and at Landriano
    (45.31∘ N, 9.26∘ E; near Pavia, Italy), the sensors were installed in the middle
    of agricultural fields, where fast biomass growth and irrigation took place. More
    specifically, at Landriano, sorghum was cropped and irrigated by a sprinkler system.
    At Ceregnano, soybeans were cultivated and irrigated by a variable rate irrigation
    ranger system. The soil texture at the experimental sites is quite homogenous
    over the main area investigated by the sensors (approximately 100 m radius), except
    for Ceregnano, where a sandy fluvial deposit crosses the loamy field. Figure 3Experimental
    sites with FINAPP3 sensor (white points) and locations where gravimetric soil
    samples (red points) have been collected for comparison (pictures from © Google
    Earth). At Ceregnano site, a gamma ray spectrometer (Medusa Radiometrics gSMS)
    was also installed few meters from the CRNS sensor. Download At each site, weather
    data were collected by meteorological stations operated by the Regional Environmental
    Protection Agencies (ARPA) at the same positions at which the CRNS sensors were
    installed or located in close proximity (a few kilometers). In these cases, the
    meteorological observations have been considered representative of the local conditions.
    Moreover, three field campaigns were conducted during the vegetation season to
    collect soil samples for the calibration and assessment of the CRNS signal. The
    sampling took into account the sensitivity of the signal decreasing with distance
    from the sensor. Specifically, undisturbed soil samples were collected at 18 locations
    (red points in Fig. 3) and at four different depths (0–5, 10–15, 20–25 and 30–35 cm
    from the soil surface) for a total of 72 soil samples. Gravimetric water content
    for each soil sample was measured by oven-drying method (105 ∘C for 24 h). A mixed
    soil sample was further prepared at each site to measure soil organic carbon (SOC)
    and lattice water (LW). These two parameters have been measured by a loss on ignition
    (LOI) method, respectively, with a cycle of 24 h at 500 ∘C and 12 h at 1000 ∘C
    (Barbosa et al., 2021). All the values have been processed to account for the
    spatial sensitivity of the neutrons detected, based on the most recent methods
    (Schrön et al., 2017). A simple spreadsheet in which these weighting functions
    have been implemented is publicly available (Baroni, 2022b). The results are summarized
    in Table A1 in the Appendix. 2.5 Assessment of muons counting rate The use of
    muons has been shown to be a possible alternative to the use of the neutron monitoring
    stations for incoming correction, since they are produced from the same cascade
    as cosmic-ray-induced neutrons in the atmosphere (Stevanato et al., 2022). We
    also test this signal in the present study, and for sake of clarity we report
    here on the main data-processing steps. Specifically, muons are first corrected
    to account for air pressure and air temperature effects as follows: where Eq.
    (6) is analogous to the pressure correction for neutron flux (see Eq. 1)'' p and
    T are the air pressure (mb) and air temperature (∘C), respectively; and pref and
    Tref are the reference value (here the average is taken) of air pressure and air
    temperature during the measuring period. In contrast to the neutrons, the effect
    of air vapor on the muon counting rate has been not identified so far (Dorman,
    2004; Maghrabi and Aldosary, 2018), and it is also not considered in the present
    study. It is noteworthy that the whole air temperature profile should be considered
    for the correction. This would better represent the atmospheric condition, and
    it would better capture the effect on muons. Some studies, however, have shown
    how the use of air temperature measured at 2 m height provides a good approximation
    of the muon effect (de Mendonça et al., 2016). This approach is used also in this
    study, but it should be further tested in future research. For the muon assessment,
    first the parameters βM and αM are derived, based on the data collected within
    this study to evaluate the effect of air pressure and air temperature on the muon
    signal. These values are then compared with βM = 0.0016 mbar−1 and αM = 0.0021 ∘C−1
    provided by Stevanato et al. (2022). These values have been estimated based on
    a recursive analysis conducted on a relative long time series collected at the
    same area (1-year time series collected at around 200 km distance). For this reason,
    the values can also be representative of the experimental sites of the present
    study. Refinements of these values should be expected in case of application in
    different locations. The corrected muon flux MC is then compared to the incoming
    variability measured at the neutron monitoring station usually adopted for CRNS
    incoming correction (https://www.nmdb.eu/, last access: 14 January 2024). Finally,
    the effect of using a muon signal instead of using neutron counts from a neutron
    monitoring station for the incoming correction (Eq. 2) and soil moisture estimation
    is also presented and discussed. 2.6 Assessment of total gamma rays The measurements
    of gamma rays have been shown to be a valid approach for soil moisture estimation
    at relative small scale, i.e., tens of meters (Baldoncini et al., 2018), or for
    identifying irrigation events at agricultural sites (Serafini et al., 2021). More
    specifically, gamma rays measured above the ground (e.g., by a detector installed
    about 2 m from the ground) are mainly produced by radionuclides in the soil. The
    gamma ray fluxes are also attenuated by the presence of water in the soil, due
    to the increased average absorption coefficient of the wet soil with respect to
    the dry soil. For this reason, the gamma ray signal (i.e., the 40K full-energy
    peak at 1.46 MeV or, in any case, in the energies between about 1.0 and 2.5 MeV)
    shows a negative correlation with the amount of water in the soil, and thus this
    relation can be used to estimate the soil moisture dynamic (Strati et al., 2018).
    In contrast, gamma rays in the energy range of 214Pb (352 keV), a radon progeny,
    has a much stronger volatility, and it is also present in the atmosphere. Thus,
    a fast increase in the gamma rays in the energy range of this photo peak can be
    detected during precipitation events due to the effect of radon atmospheric deposition.
    In contrast, during an irrigation event, no such behaviour is expected. It is
    noteworthy that the gamma signal should not be corrected for other effects (i.e.,
    air pressure, air temperature and air humidity). For these reasons, it can provide
    some advantages when using neutrons for soil moisture application. For the assessment
    of the gamma signal measured by FINAPP3, a stationary cesium iodide (CsI) gamma
    ray spectrometer (gSMS, Medusa Radiometrics, https://www.medusa-radiometrics.com/,
    last access: 14 January 2024) has also been installed at Ceregnao site in 2021,
    a few meters away from the CRNS location. A direct comparison between total gamma
    fluxes measured by the two sensors is performed. The capability of the signal
    to discriminate precipitation and irrigation events is also explored in the present
    study, based on the data collected at the experimental sites. 3 Results 3.1 Comparison
    between neutrons detected by FINAPP3 and conventional CRNS sensors The corrected
    hourly neutron count rates measured by the different sensors are shown in Fig.
    4. As expected, the sensors have different sensitivities, with a mean neutron
    counting rate over the period at Marchfeld of 1279 and 1797 cph for FINAPP3 and
    CRS2000, respectively, and at Marquardt of 1187 and 8387 cph for FINAPP3 and Lab-C,
    respectively. Accordingly, the relative lower sensitivity of FINAPP3 produced
    a higher amount of statistical noise when compared to its benchmark (CRS2000 or
    Lab-C, respectively). However, this difference is less substantial when the signal
    is smoothed over a longer time interval. Specifically, the analysis shows a good
    agreement of the detected signals (R2= 0.66) at a 1 h integration time. The performance
    improves (R2= 0.91) when the values are already integrated over a 6 h interval.
    The good correlation can also be appreciated by looking at a fast drop of the
    neutron counting rates during a short timescale (Fig. 4c, d). For this reason,
    the FINAPP3 sensor can be considered reliable for many applications, while it
    is suggested to employ a more sensitive detector for especially demanding settings,
    e.g., when focusing on fast (e.g., hourly) hydrological processes like canopy
    interceptions (Andreasen et al., 2017a; Baroni and Oswald, 2015) or mobile applications
    (Jakobi et al., 2020). Figure 4Comparison of measured neutrons in 2021 at the
    (a–c) Marchfeld site, Vienna, Austria, and the (d–f) Marquardt site, Potsdam,
    Germany, by the two different sensor pairs (CRS2000 and FINAPP3; Lab-C and FINAPP3).
    Panels (a) and (d) show the hourly values (in orange) and are based on a running
    average of 6 h (in blue). Panels (b) and (e) show the neutron fluxes corrected
    for air pressure, with a running average of 6 h. The relative counts over the
    mean are shown for comparison. Panels (c) and (f) show a zoom-in during a fast
    drop in the neutron counts. Download 3.2 Assessment of the derived FINAPP soil
    moisture with independent gravimetric soil samples The neutron counts collected
    at the four Italian experimental sites were transformed to volumetric soil moisture,
    as described in Sect. 2.2, using all the soil samples for the calibration of the
    parameter N0 (Eq. 5). Before the transformation, the corrected hourly neutron
    values were smoothed with a Savitzky–Golay filter to decrease the random fluctuations
    at a short time period, as suggested in the literature (Franz et al., 2020). The
    calibration curves obtained, based on all the gravimetric soil samples, are shown
    in Fig. 5 (dashed black lines), together with some performance metrics between
    estimation and observation (coefficient of determination R2 and RMSE). Moreover,
    calibration curves based on the data collected during only one single soil sampling
    campaign are added to better visualize the differences (gray lines). Figure 5Calibration
    curves obtained at each site (Legnaro, San Pietro Capofiume, Ceregnano and Landriano)
    using data collected during one single field campaign (gray lines) or based on
    the best fit over all of the samples (dashed black line). Download At the Legnaro
    site, the calibration curve aligned well the observations, with a high goodness
    of fit (R2>0.9; RMSE = 0.006 g g−1). In contrast, at the other three sites, the
    goodness of fit deteriorated, with the worst case obtained at Ceregnano site (R2>0.2;
    RMSE = 0.041 g g−1). These performances are in agreement with studies conducted
    with other conventional CRNS sensors (e.g., Franz et al., 2012), and they can
    be explained in relation (i) to the effect of other hydrogen pools like biomass
    (Baatz et al., 2015; Franz et al., 2015; Jakobi et al., 2018) and (ii) to the
    contributions to the signal from remote areas (Schattan et al., 2019; Schrön et
    al., 2017). Specifically, the very good fit at the Legnaro site can be explained,
    considering that the FINAPP3 sensor has been installed at a grass site with low
    biomass, and the surrounding areas are characterized by relatively small agricultural
    fields (see Fig. 3). In these conditions, the soil samples represent the average
    soil moisture within the footprint well, and no additional hydrogen pools are
    relevant. As such, the results support the sufficiency of one single calibration
    campaign and the accuracy of the detected signal when these conditions are met.
    At San Pietro Capofiume, the FINAPP3 sensor was also installed at a grass site
    with low biomass. This area, however, reached very low soil moisture values during
    the summer. In contrast, the remote areas are large irrigated maize cropped fields
    (i.e., with much higher expected soil moisture). As recently discussed (Schrön
    et al., 2023), in these particularly heterogeneous conditions, the sensor can
    detect soil moisture changes at a more remote distance than the actual footprint,
    and the gravimetric soil samples collected during the field campaigns could be
    not representative of the average soil moisture condition detected by the sensor.
    On the one hand, this can explain the unrealistic apparent negative soil moisture
    values estimated during August. On the other hand, it supports the need for additional
    soil samples at the irrigated areas to provide a soil moisture basis more representative
    of this CRNS footprint. Finally, at Ceregnano and at Landriano, the FINAPP3 sensors
    were installed at the center of a homogenous cultivated field, where the contribution
    of the fast biomass growth to the detected signal should be expected. Thus, the
    apparent overestimation of soil moisture towards the peak of the growing season
    at both sites is very plausible. Some corrections to the signal to account for
    the biomass contribution have been suggested in the literature (Baatz et al.,
    2015; Franz et al., 2015; Jakobi et al., 2018), but it is beyond the scope of
    the present study to assess these approaches. The use of more recently proposed
    soil moisture–neutron relation could also be tested in future studies to see possible
    compensations for these effects (Köhli et al., 2021). Anyway, these results confirm
    the need to conduct, when possible, more than one calibration campaign to account
    for some of these effects (Heidbüchel et al., 2016; Iwema et al., 2015). Finally,
    the time series collected at the four experimental sites in Italy are shown in
    Fig. 6. The FINAPP3 signal was regularly recorded and transmitted over the entire
    period. Only a few data gaps were experienced, and they are related to short periods
    of low power supply by the solar panel during wintertime. At all the sites, the
    estimated soil moisture dynamic responds well to precipitation. As previously
    discussed, the derived soil moisture values are in good agreement with the gravimetric
    soil moisture (green crosses). For these reasons, the results show how FINAPP3
    can be considered a reliable soil moisture sensor that can be integrated in long-term
    monitoring networks, as proposed by other studies (Cooper et al., 2021; Zreda
    et al., 2012; Bogena et al., 2022). Figure 6Estimated volumetric soil moisture
    (m3 m−3) by FINAPP3 in 2021 at the four experimental sites (black line) compared
    to the weighted average soil moisture, based on soil samples and gravimetric methods
    (green crosses). At each site, the precipitation is also shown (blue bars). Download
    3.3 On the use of muons for incoming corrections Muons have been recorded simultaneously
    by the detector at all of the experimental sites. Some malfunctions in the pulse
    shape discrimination integrated in the electronic board and on the data transmission
    have, however, been initially identified. These malfunctions were later fixed,
    but some data have been corrupted. For this reason, the muon time series cover
    a shorter period in comparison to the neutron counts (i.e., June–November). Figure
    7 shows the muon counting rates collected at Legnaro site, for example, but similar
    results have been detected in the other experimental sites. As expected, the results
    show a strong relation between measured muon counting rates and air pressure (Fig.
    7a). The slope of the relation (−0.0018) is also very similar to the value obtained
    by Stevanato et al. (2022) (i.e., −0.0021). In contrast, within the present study,
    no relation is detected between the pressure-corrected muons and air temperature
    (Fig. 7b). The behaviour is attributed to the relatively short time series and
    the small temperature range (±5∘). However, the representativeness of air temperature
    measured at 2 m height in comparison to the need for a whole-atmosphere air temperature
    profile is also questionable, and it should be further investigated (de Mendonça
    et al., 2016). The residual spread in the relationship suggests that the influence
    of factors to the signal other than cosmogenic muons cannot, however, be excluded,
    and it should be considered in further studies. Figure 7Comparison of data collected
    at Legnaro site. (a) Relative air pressure vs. muon counting rate. (b) Air temperature
    vs. pressure-corrected muon counting rate. Download The muon counting rate is
    further analyzed by comparing its dynamic to the incoming neutron fluxes measured
    at a neutron monitoring station (Jungfraujoch) and based on the effect on the
    derived soil moisture (Fig. 8). During most of the monitoring period, the main
    fluctuations are clearly visible in both muon and incoming neutron (JUNG) time
    series (Fig. 8c). On some days (e.g., on 5 July, when a precipitation event occurred),
    some differences are detected that might be attributed to different local atmospheric
    conditions between the experimental sites and Jungfraujoch, where the incoming
    neutron fluxes are measured. However, these differences do not propagate into
    significant differences in derived soil moisture. For this reason, the analysis
    within the present study is not conclusive, but longer time series (e.g., years)
    with stronger incoming variability are needed to test the use of muons for the
    incoming correction. Figure 8(a, b) The average precipitation over the four Italian
    experimental sites. (c, d) The incoming correction based on neutron monitoring
    station (JUNG) and based on the average muon detected at the four experimental
    sites (Muons).The standard deviation is also shown as gray area. (e, f) Estimated
    soil moisture using the two different approaches for the incoming correction of
    the signal, based on the standard approach of data from neutron data base (e.g.,
    JUNG plotted as an orange line) and using locally detected muons (blue line).
    The measurements refer to the year 2021. Download It is noteworthy that one single
    relevant event has been recorded at the beginning of November (Fig. 8d). During
    this period, a fast drop in the incoming fluxes has been detected, producing an
    ∼ 8 % increase in the incoming correction (if neutron monitoring is concerned).
    In contrast, the fluctuations in the muons are much smoother. At the current stage,
    the reasons for these differences have been not identified, but only some hypotheses
    are formulated. First, the FINAPP3 muons count rate is relatively low, and the
    recorded signal is smoothed over a relatively long time period (days) to reduce
    the statistical errors. For this reason, short-term dynamics cannot be captured.
    Second, the muon detector is also not directional (e.g., as a telescope looking
    upward), but it measures muon particles that are scattered in all the directions.
    These characteristics could produce some differences in comparison to the directional
    detector when these fast and strong events are considered. For this reason, the
    need for a bigger or directional muon detector could be considered for further
    developments to detect events that occurs during relatively short period. Still,
    it is interesting to note the propagation of these different corrections into
    soil moisture estimation. Specifically, a precipitation event was observed over
    all the Italian sites during this strong incoming neutron variability. Accordingly,
    soil moisture should have increased to some degree. The effect of the incoming
    correction based on the neutron monitoring station, however, smoothed this effect,
    and the soil moisture remained constant or even started to dry down. In contrast,
    by using the muon signal, the soil moisture increased. While the magnitude of
    this increment is, in some cases, questionable if compared, for instance, to the
    increment recorded during the earlier precipitation event, these results support
    previous findings that muon detection can be a possible approach to better account
    for local atmospheric conditions. In this context, FINAPP3 can be considered a
    valuable sensor for collecting new data for further testing this hypothesis. The
    use of continuous independent soil moisture measurements should, however, be designed
    for benchmarking. 3.4 Assessment of measured total gamma rays The comparison between
    total gamma counts (TGCs) measured at the Ceregnano site by FINAPP3 and gSMS Medusa
    is shown in Fig. 9. On average, the sensitivity of the FINAPP3 is lower, with
    an average counting rate over the monitored period of 2531 counts per hour (cph).
    In contrast, the gSMS Medusa sensor showed higher sensitivity and an average counting
    rate over the monitored period of 8281 cph. The correlation between the two signals
    is low, at an hourly time resolution (R2= 0.08), mainly due to the presence of
    extreme values observed during the precipitation events. The correlation increases
    (R2= 0.32) with a consistent detected dynamic (Fig. 8b) when these extreme values
    are removed, and the time series is smoothed over a 6 h time window. Figure 9Comparison
    between total gamma counts measured by FINAPP3 and gSMS Medusa gamma ray spectrometer
    in 2021 at the Ceregnano site. Download The measured total gamma counts are further
    compared to the soil moisture simultaneously derived by FINAPP3 and with precipitation
    and irrigation events (Fig. 10). Please note that a relatively shorter time series
    (June–September) in comparison to the neutron time series is shown due to some
    malfunctions of the electronic board and data transmission that have been initially
    deprecated the gamma signal, as also discussed for the muon signal. The collected
    results show a negative correlation with the soil moisture dynamic estimated based
    on the neutron counts (i.e., TGC increases with soil moisture decreasing, and
    vice versa). Thus, the results confirm how the total gamma fluxes are attenuated
    by the presence of water in the soil, providing the scientific basis for the development
    of a gamma ray sensor for soil moisture estimation (Strati et al., 2018). However,
    the total gamma counts show a higher dynamic at a subdaily timescale in comparison
    to the estimated neutron-based soil moisture, and the correlation between the
    signals is weak (Pearson correlation coefficient r= −0.18). For this reason, further
    experiments and analyses should be conducted to better understand the added value
    of this signal for soil moisture estimation. Among others, the weak correlation
    can be attributed to the smaller horizonal and vertical footprint of the gamma
    fluxes (< 25 m radius; < 15 cm depth) in comparison to the neutron (∼ 100 m radius;
    ∼ 40 cm depth). Thus, a dedicated soil sampling campaign within the theoretical
    soil volume detected by the gamma particles should be performed for better assessment.
    An exponential decrease in the sensitivity of the signal has also been suggested
    in the literature in both horizontal and vertical directions (Baldoncini et al.,
    2018). However, considering that the gamma footprint is strongly affected by the
    height of the detector installation (van der Veeke et al., 2021), further and
    more dedicated experiments should be performed to develop specific weighting functions
    and to conduct a proper assessment. Figure 10(a, b, c) Precipitation (blue) and
    irrigation (light blue) (mm d−1), (d, e, f) volumetric soil moisture estimated
    by FINAPP3 (m3 m−3) and (g, h, i) total gamma counts (TGC) over the mean of the
    monitored period (year 2021). Download It is noteworthy, however, that a peak
    in the total gamma radiation generated by the deposition of atmospheric radon
    during the precipitation events is clearly identifiable. In contrast, no such
    peaks occur during the irrigation events. The results are shown in Fig. 10, where
    two short periods are visualized as an example. For this reason, while the use
    of total gamma radiation for soil moisture estimation will require additional
    refinement, the new sensor can be used for discriminating the increase in the
    soil moisture due to irrigation, in contrast to precipitation events, as shown
    in other studies using more dedicated gamma ray spectrometers (Serafini et al.,
    2021). The use of this signal to extend existing gamma ray dosimeters can also
    be foreseen (Rizzo et al., 2022). 4 Conclusions This study presents the activities
    conducted to test a new CRNS sensor design, based on scintillators for non-invasive
    soil moisture estimation. The results show that the new sensor performed very
    well in different environmental conditions in comparison to other conventional
    gas-tubes-based CRNS sensors (R2>0.9 at 6 h integration time) and based on several
    gravimetric soil moisture samples (RMSE < 0.04 m3 m−3). The sensitivity of this
    new sensor design was found to be suitable for monitoring daily temporal soil
    moisture changes over the long term (years). However, the signal-to-noise ratio
    was relatively high at an hourly timescale, and only the aggregation to a 6 h
    interval yielded a reasonable robustness of the signal. For this reason, a more
    sensitive detector should be considered when fast hydrological processes such
    as canopy interceptions or roving applications are targeted. Part of the tested
    sensor design contains components that simultaneously measure muons and total
    gamma radiation. In previous studies, muons were found to be a potential candidate
    to support the correction for incoming cosmic rays (Stevanato et al., 2022). On
    the other hand, the use of gamma ray spectrometry was identified as an alternative
    method for non-invasive soil moisture estimation (Baldoncini et al., 2018) and
    irrigation discrimination (Serafini et al., 2021). The muons measured within the
    present study confirmed the negative correlation with the air pressure that has
    been found in the literature (Stevanato et al., 2022; de Mendonça et al., 2016).
    The effect of the air temperature was, however, not identified, suggesting the
    need for longer time series and a wider temperature range. The incoming correction
    using muons showed some differences in the incoming variability detected by the
    neutron monitoring station that could be attributed to different local atmospheric
    conditions. In most of the period, however, the effect on the soil moisture estimation
    was negligible. Further analyses with longer time series should then be conducted
    to better understand the added value of detecting this radiation form. A comparison
    to other recently proposed alternatives, like the use of neutron spectroscopy
    (Cirillo et al., 2021) or improvements on the use of neutron fluxes measured at
    the neutron monitoring station (McJannet and Desilets, 2023), should also be performed.
    The sensor had also a good performance in the measurements of the total gamma
    radiation in comparison to a gamma ray spectrometer (R2= 0.29 at 6 h integration
    time). The signal also showed a negative correlation to soil moisture, as presented
    in other studies with the focus on specific gamma energy ranges, e.g., 40K (Strati
    et al., 2018; Baldoncini et al., 2018). The correlation using total gamma counts
    is, however, weak (Pearson correlation coefficient r= −0.18), suggesting the need
    for additional studies for a better understanding of the signal response and of
    the footprint size for soil moisture estimation. In contrast, high peaks of total
    gamma radiation generated by a shower of radon in the atmosphere have been detected,
    allowing a clear identification of precipitation vs. irrigation events. Overall,
    this tested sensor design has shown to be a valuable alternative to more traditional
    CRNS detectors for soil moisture estimation. Considering that it can be built
    smaller than conventional neutron systems and offers the potential benefit of
    the additional detection of muons and total gammas, it can also pave the way for
    new and wider applications like space weather applications (Hands et al., 2021;
    Rizzo et al., 2022) and for monitoring agriculture water use (Foster et al., 2020).

  description: This paper addresses the concerns in irrigation mechanisms and employs
    a Sensors and cloud-based platform to monitor and control an irrigation system.
    In order to monitor the soil's moisture level in real time, moisture sensors are
    placed in the field. These sensors wirelessly provide data to the NodeMCU, which
    processes and relays the information. The NodeMCU gathers the sensor data and
    processes it, considering standard deviations and crop-specific parameters. Using
    this information, the system starts the water pump and opens the solenoid valves
    to begin the irrigation operation. The NodeMCU coordinates with these valve-opening
    devices via wireless communication. In addition, the system uses online weather
    prediction data to provide more precise watering schedule optimisation. The system
    dynamically modifies the irrigation schedule based on analysis of weather patterns,
    evapotranspiration rates, and crop water needs to save water during times of rain
    or high humidity. The solution makes use of cloud-based platforms to improve scalability
    and accessibility. The gathered sensor data and command instructions are safely
    transferred to the cloud server. This allows farmers to remotely check on and
    adjust the irrigation system by means of the web or mobile apps. In addition,
    data analytics methods may be used to infer information and provide suggestions
    for improved methods of water management and crop care. In conclusion, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) NodeMCU smart irrigation system provides an automated and intelligent
    approach to water management in agriculture. Water is saved, crop yields are boosted,
    and sustainability is enhanced thanks to the capacity to irrigate precisely based
    on real-time soil moisture data, weather predictions, and crop needs.

  description: This study assessed the effects of rainfall on soil physico-chemical
    properties (pH, moisture, temperature, Nitrogen value, Phosphorus value and Potassium
    value) of MD2 pineapple cultivation on marginal soil, and also investigated correlation
    between rainfall and soil physico-chemical properties based on IoT-based monitoring.
    Agromon Smart Agriculture and NPK Sensors (Agromon) that is equipped with a Sigfox-based
    wireless transmitter was used to provide real-time marginal soil properties data
    from an experimental MD2 pineapple field plot in UiTM Sarawak. Rainfall data between
    March and July 2021 for Samarahan Rainfall Station were obtained from Department
    of Irrigation and Drainage, Sarawak (DID). Soil properties data were transmitted
    from field plot gateway to the nearest Sigfox base station in Santubong, and subsequently
    to SATU dashboard server in order to be accessible to all users. Agromon demonstrated
    the capability of IoT system in monitoring selected soil properties across favored
    and unfavored weather conditions. Pineapple farmers can make timely and cost-effective
    farm operation decision anywhere to optimize plant vigor and therefore, improve
    yield.

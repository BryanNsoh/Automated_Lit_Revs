  description: Soil salinization is a widespread environmental hazard and a major
    abiotic constraint affecting global food production and threatening food security.
    Salt-affected cropland is widely distributed in China, and the problem of salinization
    in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    is particularly prominent. The salt-affected soil in Inner Mongolia is 1.75 million
    hectares, accounting for 14.8% of the total land. Therefore, mapping saline cropland
    in the irrigation district of Inner Mongolia could evaluate the impacts of cropland
    soil salinization on the environment and food security. This study hypothesized
    that a reasonably accurate regional map of salt-affected cropland would result
    from a ground sampling approach based on PlanetScope images and the methodology
    developed by Sentinel multi-sensor images employing the machine learning algorithm
    in the cloud computing platform. Thus, a model was developed to create the salt-affected
    cropland map of HID in 2021 based on the modified cropland base map, valid saline
    and non-saline samples through consistency testing, and various spectral parameters,
    such as reflectance bands, published salinity indices, vegetation indices, and
    texture information. Additionally, multi-sensor data of Sentinel from dry and
    wet seasons were used to determine the best solution for mapping saline cropland.
    The results imply that combining the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data could map
    the soil salinity in HID during the dry season with reasonable accuracy and close
    to real time. Then, the indicators derived from the confusion matrix were used
    to validate the established model. As a result, the combined dataset, which included
    reflectance bands, spectral indices, vertical transmit–vertical receive (VV) and
    vertical transmit–horizontal receive (VH) polarization, and texture information,
    outperformed the highest overall accuracy at 0.8938, while the F1 scores for saline
    cropland and non-saline cropland are 0.8687 and 0.9109, respectively. According
    to the analyses conducted for this study, salt-affected cropland can be detected
    more accurately during the dry season by using just Sentinel images from March
    to April. The findings of this study provide a clear explanation of the efficiency
    and standardization of salt-affected cropland mapping in arid and semi-arid regions,
    with significant potential for applicability outside the current study area.

    Soil salinization is a matter of concern in agriculture, as the excess salt hinders
    crop growth by obstructing the ability to uptake water. In another sense, it causes
    a loss in soil fertility and leads to the desertification of cropland [1,2]. According
    to the estimation released by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there
    are more than 424 million hectares of topsoil (0–30 cm) and 833 million hectares
    of subsoil (30–100 cm) are salt-affected around the globe (8.7% of the planet)
    [3]. Most of them can be found in naturally arid or semi-arid environments in
    Africa, Asia and Latin America [4]. Soils are easily affected by salt in arid
    and semi-arid regions where low rainfall and high evapotranspiration lead to the
    concentration of salts such as sodium, magnesium and calcium to form saline soils
    [5,6,7,8]. FAO launched the Global Map of Salt-Affected Soils in 2021, although
    the salt-affected soil of China has not been included in that. Nonetheless, estimates
    show that 20 to 50% of irrigated soils across all continents are too salty, implying
    that over 1.5 billion people face significant challenges in meeting rising food
    demand due to severe cropland salinity and cropland degradation [9]. Saline cropland
    is an essential part of reserve cropland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    in China and is an integral part of the cropland restoration program [10]. The
    salt-affect soil in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is mainly disturbed in
    the Xiliao River Plain in the east and Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in the
    west. The cropland of HID is dominated by saline soil and accounts for 30.5% of
    the saline cropland in Inner Mongolia [10]. In the early stage of the reclamation
    HID, flood irrigation without drainage facilities caused the secondary salinization
    of the field soil. For now, cropland salinization has gradually evolved into the
    main factor restricting the sustainable development of agriculture in HID. Therefore,
    the severe salinity cropland is a typical area for the agricultural management
    department’s soil rehabilitation program, which has attracted the interest of
    many academics [11,12]. The cropland soil salinity in HID is mainly adapted from
    the irrigation water of the Yellow River. Only 20% of the initial salt can be
    discharged through drainage, while 80% of the salt is kept in the soil of the
    irrigation area, showing a salinization trend [13]. Soil salinity will adversely
    affect plant growth, crop yields, and underground water quality, leading to soil
    erosion and land degradation [14]. The hazard of soil salinity is not limited
    to the environment but also includes the economy. For example, for the secondary
    salinization of the land in the Sultanate of Oman, the direct economic loss from
    mild to moderate salinity is about 1604 US dollars per hectare, and the direct
    economic loss from mild to severe salinity is as high as 4352 US dollars per hectare
    [15]. Thus, knowing the spatial distribution of salt-affected cropland is an urgent
    need to alleviate the contradiction between humans and land [16,17], which is
    also vital for promoting the high-quality development of the national agricultural
    economy [18]. At the same time, the eradicate because of dynamic and accessible
    restress from salinization after agricultural activities seriously endangers the
    sustainable development of agriculture and its productivity, which makes the timely
    detection of salt-affected cropland within HID with limited cropland resources
    particularly urgent [19,20,21]. Traditionally, soil salinity was measured by collecting
    soil samples and analyzing them in a laboratory to determine their solute concentration
    or electronic conductivity [22]. However, due to intensive sampling being time-consuming
    and expensive, the spatial variability of soil salinity is hardly fully characterized
    traditionally in a large area. Remote sensing data and techniques can more effectively
    provide economic and rapid tools and methods for mapping soil salinity [23]. Remote
    sensing data and its analyzing processes have gradually become the most convenient
    method of mapping soil salinity since black-and-white and color aerial photographs
    were used to describe salinity-stressed soils in the 1960s. Multispectral imagery
    such as Landsat [24], Sentinel [25], IKONOS [26], QuickBird [27] and UAV-Borne
    [28] are highly suitable for evaluating soil salinity. In the last three decades
    of research on monitoring saline soils, multispectral sensors have been mainly
    used. In addition, some researchers have emphasized the importance of ground sample
    data [29,30]. In practical applications, multispectral sensors also show limitations,
    as their spectral resolution and fewer bands affect the quality and quantity of
    information provided. Many current studies pointed out this limitation, thus monitoring
    the salinity using hyperspectral [31] and thermal infrared data [32], even Synthetic
    Aperture Radar (SAR) data [33] in the last few years. Nevertheless, the broad
    acquisition capability of Sentinel data, high spatial resolution (10 m), and the
    combination of active and passive remote sensing data can compensate for the deficiencies
    of multispectral data widely available for free. Remote sensing data with meter-level
    high resolution or sub-meter-level resolution (IKONOS, QuickBird, WroldView-2,
    GF series) have also been gradually introduced into salinity mapping research
    and have become indispensable data sources. Mapping the salinity of cropland combining
    high spatial resolution images and ground sampling data using machine learning
    algorithms is mainly carried out at the field scale or farm scale [34]. However,
    the validity and reliability of such a method need to be assessed in a larger
    area. Recent years have seen an increase in nonparametric machine learning techniques,
    particularly Random Forest (RF), to calculate soil salinity [35,36]. Since it
    can manage the high dimensionality and multicollinearity of remote sensing data
    with excellent classification accuracy and insensitivity to overfitting, RF is
    one of the most extensively used algorithms in land cover classification. Additionally,
    it has been stated that RF in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides
    unassailable benefits in the remote sensing classification of land cover in a
    large area [37,38]. Some researchers have demonstrated that RF outperforms other
    popular nonparametric machine learning algorithms, which can significantly increase
    soil salinity mapping accuracy [25,39]. However, many scholars have shown that
    using remote sensing technology to map cropland salinity in arid and semi-arid
    regions is challenging [23,24,40]. It is mainly because the bare ground and other
    sparse vegetation are easily confused with saline soil in spectral reflectance
    [33,41]. Alternatively, the method based on spectral reflectance may lead to unreliable
    results when the soil is moisturizing or the soil salts are not exposed on the
    soil surface in crystalline form but mixed with other soil components [42]. In
    this case, SAR data, frequently employed in detecting soil salinity, can capture
    information that is challenging to acquire using multispectral imagery. Various
    remote sensing data have already been used to study saline soil in HID. Nonetheless,
    the majority of these studies have focused on single sensors rather than multi-sensor
    images. Therefore, to comprehend the main mechanism causing agricultural salinization
    and degradation, a salt-affected map using a wide range of remote sensing data
    must be acquired in almost real time. To fill this gap, the following questions
    will be addressed in this study: Is the PlanetScope image of April appropriate
    for sample collection employing the Visual Interpretation strategy? If so, how
    can the samples’ validity—which includes cropland that is both saline and non-saline—be
    estimated? How to quickly and efficiently map salinized cropland using Sentinel-1
    and Sentinel-2 data freely available in GEE? These questions are unavoidable in
    multi-sensor data-based mapping of salinized cropland, and addressing them is
    the primary goal of the current study. The specific objectives of this research
    are to: Create a cropland base map using global land cover data from ESA WorldCover
    while masking off roads and irrigation ditches collected from the electronic map
    of HID; Evaluate the validity of samples, comprising both saline and non-saline
    cropland, using the quantile and quantile plots testing method; Create a multi-variable
    dataset for salt-affected cropland identification using VV + VH dual polarization,
    reflectance bands, and vegetation indices; Determine the best solution for mapping
    salt-affected cropland in dry and wet seasons using the overall accuracies and
    indicators from the confusion matrix of various datasets. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. The Study Area HID is located at the top of the northernmost Bay of the Yellow
    River and spans a region situated at 106°11′35″E–109°53′52″E and 40°10′30″–41°16′43″N.
    HID comprises five counties in Bayannur city with a total area of 17,243.23 km2
    (Figure 1), with 733,333.33 hectares of cropland. The crop yield has been stable
    at more than 5 billion tons for a long time. It is Asia’s largest artesian irrigation
    area and one of China’s three largest irrigation areas. In addition, HID was included
    in the World Irrigation Engineering Heritage List in 2019. Spring wheat, corn,
    vegetables, citrus, and sunflowers are the main crops in HID (see phenology of
    main crops in HID in Table S1). Vegetables are grown in a few places after the
    spring wheat harvest, while other crops are sown as one-season crops. Figure 1.

    and PlanetScope images acquired from 1 to 13 April in 2021 (shown in false color
    composited-R: NIR (Near-Infrared) band, G: Green band, B: Blue band). (b) The
    location of HID in China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. (c) Field photographs
    taken on April 2021, showing the salt on the soil surface before crops were planted.
    A typical temperate continental climate prevails in the study area. The number
    of hours of sunshine per year is 3210.8–3305.8; the total amount of solar radiation
    is 146–152 kcal per square centimeter; the average yearly temperature is 6.1–7.6
    °C; the daily average temperature difference is 13–14 °C. Additionally, the average
    annual evaporation is 2200 mm, which is nearly twelve times the average annual
    precipitation of 180 mm. 2.2. Data 2.2.1. Filed Sampling The sample data for mapping
    saline cropland are based initially on the ground survey samples in previous studies.
    In contrast, the PlanetScope images acquired from April 2021 were utilized for
    delineating the reference samples using a visual interpretation strategy in this
    study, which was mainly because of the controlling measurements for preventing
    the COVID-19 epidemic during the critical period for collecting the ground truth
    samples. To accurately distinguish salt-affected soil from non-salt-affected soil
    on the cropland base map of HID, 1000 saline samples and 1000 non-saline samples
    were selected, as shown in Figure 2. High-resolution PlanetScope images were used
    as a reference to assess whether the soil was saline or non-saline, and each sample
    was labeled as either salinized or non-salinized, following the principle introduced
    in Figure 1. The study area is a typical arid irrigation farming area in northern
    China, with no winter crops grown throughout the year. This means the cropland
    surface in the irrigation area is bare outside from the previous year’s harvest
    to the sowing of the following year. Therefore, the soil salinity is in layers
    0–10 cm from March to April, which means the salinity of soil is on the surface
    and can be distinguished by the naked eye. This phenomenon leads to the surface
    reflectance of the saline soil captured by the imagery is also significantly different
    from that of the healthy soil. Figure 2. (a) The distribution of the samples of
    saline and non-saline cropland, (b) the samples in the false color composited
    PlanetScope image (R: NIR band, G: Green band, B: Blue band). Moreover, to ensure
    the accuracy of the artificially delineated saline and non-saline cropland samples,
    the number and spatial distribution must be as consistent as possible. Therefore,
    after the initial sample data are selected, the validity of the samples needs
    to be checked to ensure that the samples can adequately represent the category
    to which they belong. In this part, the quantile and quantile plots testing method
    will be applied to validate whether the selected saline and non-saline samples
    obey the normal distribution (Section 2.4). 2.2.2. Remote Sensing Data Collection
    PlanetScope PlanetScope, operated by Planet, is a constellation of approximately
    130 satellites that is able to image the entire land surface of the earth every
    day (a daily collection capacity of 200 million km²/day). PlanetScope images have
    a resolution of about 3 m per pixel. The four-band frame imager with a butcher-block
    filter provides Blue, Green, Red and NIR bands. The PlanetScope Ortho Scene Level
    3B Product has been used for selecting samples visually since it is an orthorectified,
    scaled Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Radiance Surface Reflectance image product suitable
    for analytic and visual applications. Sentinel The European Space Agency (ESA)
    was renamed the EU Global Security Monitoring GMES as the Copernicus program,
    considering service duplication and discontinuity in 2012. Sentinel satellites
    are part of the Copernicus program. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are two Earth observation
    satellites currently in service with high-resolution sensors that can be shared
    globally. The Sentinel-1 mission consists of a constellation of two polar-orbiting
    satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, operating day and night to perform C-band
    synthetic aperture radar imaging. SAR data with a 10 m resolution are available
    for 12 days revisit period. Commonly used Class 1 products include Single-Look
    Complex (SLC) and Ground Range Detection (GRD) products. SLC products preserve
    phase information and process at natural pixel spacing; GRD products incorporate
    detected amplitudes and multi-look to reduce speckle effects. Currently, only
    GRD products with Sentinel-1 data are integrated with GEE. The Sentinel-1 SAR
    imagery, in the Interferometric Wide (IW) mode, C-band, with dual polarization
    VV and VH, was acquired from 1 March 2020, to 31 April 2020, in coincidence with
    the field samples’ selection period. The Sentinel-2 mission consists of two solar
    polar-orbiting satellites, Sentinel-2A (23 June 2015–present) and Sentinel-2B
    (7 March 2017–present), distributed in a sun-synchronous orbit, each other into
    a 180° phase. Currently, Sentinel-2 mainly provides two product data: L1C and
    L2A. The L1C product is the reflectance data of TOA after orthorectification and
    sub-pixel geometric precision correction; the L2A product is the surface reflectance
    data product obtained using the Sen2cor tool officially provided by ESA to perform
    atmospheric correction on L1C. Data are available across Europe from October and
    globally from January 2017. Each Sentinel-2 satellite carries a multi-spectrometer
    MSI with 13 bands in the Visible, NIR, Narrow NIR and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR)
    spectral ranges, including three Red Edge bands. Sentinel-2 Leve-1C and Leve-1A
    data products have been integrated into GEE (find details in Table A1). Considering
    that the Leve-1C product has more extended data availability, the Leve-1C TOA
    data product of Sentinel-2 has been selected for mapping saline cropland. 2.2.3.
    Ancillary Data An initial cropland base map was created using the ESA WorldCover
    global land cover data package, which was developed based on the Sentinel-1 and
    Sentinel-2 at 10 m resolution, and it may be accessed at https://viewer.esa-worldcover.org/worldcover,
    accessed on 16 October 2022. The cropland category is 40 in the ESA WorldCover
    global land cover data. 2.3. Generating the Cropland Base Map In this section,
    the roads and irrigation ditches with a resolution of 2.4 m provided by AutoNavi
    Electronic Maps will be used to mask out the non-cropland areas within the fields
    of HID. Firstly, the GDAL module of Python extracted the roads and irrigation
    ditches from the electronic maps and then converted them to the SHP file. Secondly,
    the RASTERIO in Python was captured to mask the non-cropland parts from the WorldCover
    global cropland cover data. 2.4. Quantile and Quantile Plots Testing Generally,
    the same type of ground objects should have the same or similar spectral reflectance
    characteristics in the same wavelength range of remote sensing images. The saline
    soils in arid regions mainly contain salts such as chlorides, sulfates and carbonates.
    Before the first irrigation of spring sowing in the Yellow River irrigation district,
    the salinity in the topsoil of 0–10 cm would be at the highest level, and saline
    elements would cover the soil surface, whitening the soil surface, as shown in
    Figure 1c. Spring wheat is the earliest sowing crop in the study area that cannot
    be grown in saline soil. Other crops, such as vegetables, corn and fruit, can
    be grown in soils with slight to moderate salinity. Sunflower is the main salt-tolerant
    crop and can even be planted in severe saline soil. Therefore, the 3 m resolution
    PlanetScope images obtained in early April (spring wheat grows in the Emergence
    Stage and can cover the ground surface) were chosen to collect sample data additionally
    to solve the problem that ground truth sample data are difficult to distribute
    evenly in a large area (Figure 2b). It can be assumed that the eigenvalues of
    the saline and non-saline samples in different wavelength ranges obey the normal
    distribution. Conversely, when a specific sample contains anomalies, its distribution
    will deviate from the normal distribution. Therefore, the quantile graphical method
    (Quantile and Quantile Plot, Q-Q plot) can be used for sample validity tests for
    elements inconsistent during sample selection caused by visual interpretation
    errors. The Q-Q plot is a graphical technique for determining if two datasets
    come from populations with a common distribution. A Q-Q plot is the quantiles
    of the first dataset against the quantiles of the second dataset. Thus, the point
    (x, y) on the graph represents the quantile of the second dataset (y-coordinate)
    and the same quantile of the corresponding first dataset (x-coordinate). Therefore,
    the Q-Q plot will approximately lie on the line y = x superior if the two distributions
    are the same or similar. In this study, the x-axis was set as the normal data
    quantiles of the sample’s reflectance value. In contrast, the y-axis was set as
    the normal theoretical quantiles to test whether the two categories of samples
    obey the normal distribution. The reflectance of the ten bands (B2, B3, B4, B5,
    B6, B7, B8, B8A, B11, B12) of the Sentinel-2 images observed from March to April
    2021 (reduced to mean value on Google Earth Engine) are set as examples to illustrate
    the Q-Q plot (find the testing results in Section 3.2). 2.5. Modeling Strategy
    The technical frame of this study is illustrated in Figure 3. First, the reflectance
    bands of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were selected via spatial resolution
    to ensure the generalization and robustness of the models. In this step, bands
    at 60 m resolution were dedicated primarily to detecting atmospheric features
    and therefore are not included in subsequent research. Thus, indices and texture
    variables based on spectral reflectance were created at 10 m resolution. On the
    other hand, the backscattering signal of the Sentinel-1 VV + VH dual-polarization
    also participated in the modelling process at 10 m resolution. Figure 3. Technical
    framework of this study. 2.5.1. Spectral Salinity Indices The wide range of wavelengths
    of the Sentinel-2 data has an excellent capability for remote sensing monitoring
    and mapping requirements of soil salinity [25]. Therefore, the mean values of
    Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance were included in the combined dataset to map the
    saline cropland in HID accurately. Table A1 (Section 2.2.2) lists the bands used
    in this study. Applying spectral indices to investigate cropland salinity is built
    upon the different spectral behavior associated with image pixels of the ground
    object [43]. The salinization can dramatically change soil surface characteristics,
    leading to a significant difference from healthy soil, especially during the best
    monitoring period before the growing season in the arid and semi-arid regions
    with low vegetation cover and more exposed soil. Moreover, the presence of salinity-tolerant
    crop coverage on the soil may also be a marker to reflect the soil salinization,
    thus allowing indirect mapping of salinity-stressed cropland [44]. On the other
    hand, unhealthy vegetation photosynthetic activity resulted in increased visible
    reflectance and decreased near-infrared reflectance (NIR) [25]. Therefore, several
    vegetation indices (VIs), such as Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted
    Vegetation Index (SAVI), Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and
    Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), were used to map soil salinity.
    Numerous academics have regarded the VIs performance as appropriate for estimating
    soil salinity using remote sensing images [45]. To create a multi-variable model
    to map the saline cropland in an arid and semi-arid area, a succession of VIs
    commonly used for monitoring soil salinity was proposed in this study. Corresponding
    to this, other researchers have created various salinity indices, including the
    Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI) and Salinity Index (SI), to identify
    and map soil salinity. Table A2 provides specific information. On the other hand,
    for combinations of two or three wavelengths in remote sensing images, extensive
    information can be obtained from the indices determined by spectral reflectance
    at the 10 m resolution. 2.5.2. Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix Texture variables
    can provide valuable spatial information, reflecting the spatial distribution
    of the gray levels of remote sensing images and representing the spatial relationship
    between image features and the surrounding environment [46]. For instance, soil
    salinization in HID refers to the phenomenon in which the salt in the bottom soil
    or groundwater rises to the surface with capillary water. After the water evaporates,
    the salt accumulates in the surface layer. Thus, this phenomenon could significantly
    change the texture features of the land surface. The textures are essential for
    identifying objects or regions of interest, whether in photographs, aerial photos,
    or satellite images. GEE provides the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) function
    to calculate broad applicability textures and can be utilized in various image
    classification applications [47,48,49]. In this study, the 14 GLCM indicators
    proposed by Robert et al. [50] and four other indicators proposed by Conners et
    al. [51] were used to construct texture variables. The reflectance-based texture
    variables based on the B2 with the highest accuracy of the Sentinel-2 images were
    obtained in GEE for modeling the mapping strategy for saline cropland in HID.
    2.5.3. Classifier and Accuracy Assessment Random Forest is one of the machine
    learning algorithms widely used in land cover classification [52] and has been
    applied to the remote sensing monitoring research of saline cropland gradually
    [53]. Furthermore, the importance evaluation function of the variables of Random
    Forest can screen out the variable that contributes the most to classification.
    Therefore, it can support further research on soil salinity monitoring. Random
    Forest can build a multi-layer decision tree and randomly select subsets and variables
    of training samples. The classification accuracy of the Random Forest classifier
    on the GEE platform uses the incremental step of 100 trees to reach the highest
    accuracy with 600 trees. In addition, 70% of random samples are used to train
    the classifier, and 30% of random samples are used to validate the accuracy of
    the saline cropland classification. Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA),
    and User Accuracy (UA) were used to evaluate the performance of Random Forest
    classifiers on the GEE. OA is the ratio of the total number of correctly classified
    pixels to the total number of pixels (the total number of pixels in the ground
    reference samples). UA corresponds to the probability that a randomly selected
    pixel from the map is classified as correct in the ground reference samples. PA
    corresponds to the likelihood that the reference sample is correctly classified
    on the map. The Kappa coefficient was previously considered an indicator that
    can be used for consistency checks and to measure classification effects. However,
    Foody [54] points out that the Kappa coefficient is not a measure of accuracy
    but an agreement beyond chance. Hence, it is unnecessary and should not be used
    in typical remote sensing applications. Therefore, Foody [54] argues that researchers
    should abandon the Kappa coefficient as a measure of accuracy instead of per-class
    accuracy estimation and confusion matrices to evaluate machine learning classification
    accuracy. Based on this, the Kappa coefficient is not used as a criterion for
    assessing the accuracies in this study. In addition, to test the robustness of
    the RF on GEE, the F1 scores (F1 = 2 × UA × PA/ (UA + PA)) of saline cropland
    and non-saline cropland were also calculated. The F1-score is the harmonic mean
    of producer and user accuracies. In studies where the classification samples are
    not perfectly balanced, the F1 score is a strong indicator for testing the stability
    of classification. The F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating
    better classification performance. 3. Results 3.1. Cropland Base Map The cropland
    base map without roads and irrigation ditches was generated through the two steps
    introduced in Section 2.3. As a result, the boundaries of fields are more prominent,
    and the problem of adhesion between field pixels in the study area is eliminated,
    as shown in Figure 4. There are 887,938.39 hectares of cropland in the study area.
    In addition, the area calculated from remote sensing results was compared with
    the data of The Third National Land Survey of China in 2020; a minimal difference
    between the modified cropland area and that of in land survey was found, and the
    specific data are relevant in Table 1. Therefore, the cropland base map is reliable
    and can be a basis for consecutive research. Figure 4. Cropland distribution in
    HID, (a) HID base map of modified cropland, (b) detailed map of initial cropland

    map of modified cropland at 10 m resolution. Table 1. Cropland area derived from
    remote sensing data and areas included in The Third National Land Survey. 3.2.
    Sample Validity Test The samples’ pixel reflectance means values derived from
    the ten spectral bands of Sentinel-2 were acquired during the mapping period in
    this study (from March to April). Then, Origin 2018 was used to generate the Q-Q
    plot diagrams of the values of non-saline and saline cropland samples, as shown
    in Figure A1. In addition, the R-square (R2) between the normal data quantiles
    and normal theoretical quantiles is a practical approach to showing the validity
    of samples. The specific R2 values can be found in Table 2. Table 2. R2 values
    between normal data quantiles and normal theoretical quantiles of samples for
    the various bands of the Sentinel-2 image. It can be found that the samples of
    either non-saline or saline cropland obey the normal distribution in the validation
    results. The scatter points in the Q-Q diagram of the saline and non-saline cropland
    before the growing season (from March to April) tend to fall on the x = y reference
    line, and the R2 of all sample data is above 0.9. Whereas, the R2 values of both
    non-saline and saline cropland samples on the B2 appear lowest (0.93 and 0.90,
    respectively) in all bands. This is because salt-affected soil has a valley of
    absorption close to the blue wavelength. Because of this, the reflectance is also
    lower than at other wavelengths. The sample points on the other bands in Figure
    A1 lie on the line x = y except for the B2 band, demonstrating the linear relationship
    between the normal data quantiles and the normal theoretical quantiles. This indicates
    a high level of sample consistency between two distributions of sample data on
    the B3 to B12 (Green to SWIR2) bands. The results of the sample validity test
    show that the samples chosen in this study for two cropland classes before the
    growing season have adequate consistency and representativeness to meet the needs
    of the subsequent research. 3.3. Accuracy Assessment of Saline Cropland Mapping
    The other probability of mapping saline cropland in the dry or wet season was
    tested in this part. According to observing the total precipitation in the last
    decade (chart in Figure 1a), the precipitation peaks in August and September and
    has been set in the wet season, while there was less precipitation from March
    to April and can be set as the dry season. Therefore, the accuracies of each dataset,
    including (1) the Sentinel-1 dual-polarization VV + VH dataset, (2) textures of
    Sentinel-2 B2 band, (3) Sentinel-2 spectral band dataset, (4) indices built based
    on Sentinel-2, and (5) the dataset of combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 in different
    time intervals were assessed to present the performance of the modeling strategies
    in the dry and wet season. The box plot of validation results are presented in
    Figure A2, and the validation indicators are shown in Table A3. The results showed
    that the highest accuracy was achieved In the dry season from March to April,
    which was significantly higher than other time interval combinations. In comparison,
    no significant difference has been observed in the box plot of March, August and
    August to September. The result indicates that the two-month data combination
    in the dry season is the best solution for mapping saline cropland in HID. Thus,
    the dataset combined with March and April generated the salt-affected cropland
    map. Moreover, to clarify the best multi-variables with the highest accuracy for
    saline cropland mapping, the performances of the variables and their combinations
    were estimated, respectively, as shown in Figure 5 and Table A4. Figure 5. Classification
    accuracies of each variable and the combined datasets: Sentinel-1 indicates the
    mean value of Sentinel-1 dual-PolSAR (VV + VH) bands; Sentinel-2 suggests the
    combination of texture and indices derived from reflectance bands of Sentinel-2
    and original mean values of spectral bands. S1_S2 combined indicates the combination
    of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets. As shown in Figure 5 and Table A4, the
    B2 band reflectance showed the highest accuracy (OA = 0.80) in the spectral bands
    of the Sentinel-2 data, which was followed by the B3 band. The Red Edge wavelength
    range is considered sensitive to green plants’ growth status [55]. Thus, the B5,
    B6 and B7 bands of Sentinel-2 data showed no obvious advantage for salt-affected
    soil mapping at 20 m resolution in this case, as shown in Figure 5. Notably, the
    visible band has higher advantages for identifying salt-affected soil than the
    Infrared band in the dry season. The VV + VH dual-polarization backscattering
    signal of Sentinel-1 data did not show competitive accuracy assessment results,
    with an overall accuracy of 0.68. The accuracy of the VH backscattering signal
    was higher than the VV backscattering signal, reaching 0.67 and 0.58, respectively.
    In addition, it can be seen in Table A4 that a very slight improvement (0.0019)
    has been detected in the assessment results by adding Sentinel-1 SAR data to Sentinel-2
    spectral data. In this case, the mapping of salinity-affected crops is not significantly
    impacted by the VV + VH dual-polarization backscattering information. SAR data,
    however, can also be an essential supplemental data source in overcast and rainy
    regions where continuous optical images are challenging to obtain. Each index
    variable’s OA was greater than 70%, which denotes high accuracy. With an OA of
    0.79, SI had the highest accuracy of any index, which was followed by MSAVI with
    an OA of 0.72. The degrees of accuracy for NDVI, SAVI, OSAVI, NDSI, and DVI are
    equivalent. These findings suggest that SI is the most appropriate indicator for
    saline cropland in salt-affected cropland mapping before the growing season in
    an arid and semi-arid region. In this situation, combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
    (S1_S2 combined in Figure 5), modeling strategies provided the optimal solution
    for saline cropland mapping, with an OA of 0.8938. 3.4. The Map of Saline Cropland
    The dataset, including the spectrum reflectance, indices, texture information
    and PolSAR backscattering signal, produced the highest overall accuracy and F1
    score (non-saline cropland is 0.91 and saline cropland is 0.87). Therefore, the
    Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 combined datasets were selected for mapping the saline
    cropland before the growing season in HID. Furthermore, the cropland in HID was
    classified into two categories, as aforementioned. As seen in Figure 6, the amount
    of non-saline cropland in HID is more than the area of saline cropland, with 58.30%
    and 41.70% of cropland, respectively. The stretch between Wuyuan County to the
    west bank of Ulansuhai Nur is the largest saline cropland zone in HID. Additionally,
    the concentration of saline soil increases with proximity to the Yellow River
    Basin. As seen in Figure 6, the cropland is generally dispersed in strips toward
    the south and north to the east of Ulansuhai Nur. The majority of the cropland
    in the north uses drip irrigation, and some portions are watered by groundwater.
    Figure 6. The distribution of non-saline and saline cropland with the percentage
    pie chart. In contrast, the salinization is relatively high in the area irrigated
    mainly by the Yellow River in the south. As a result, there is less salinization
    than in the southern region. Numerous studies have shown that flood irrigating
    with Yellow River water causes soil salinization in HID. Therefore, the higher
    salinization is in keeping with the actual situation in areas irrigated with water
    from the Yellow River. 4. Discussion 4.1. Indices in Salt-Affected Cropland Mapping
    Index variables were important in previous research on salt-affected soil monitoring
    and inversion. The analysis based on SI-MSAVI is the most renowned among them
    and has been shown to invert soil salinity [56,57,58] accurately. Likewise, NDVI
    and DVI, commonly used to monitor vegetation status, are also widely used in land
    salinization monitoring research and are critical indicators [59,60,61]. A mapping
    methodology for salinized cropland was developed in this study using several variables
    based on two bands (see Table A2 for details). The Red and NIR bands produce all
    other indices besides the SI. Figure 7 shows that even though the saline and non-saline
    samples have clear absorption valleys in the visible wavelength range, their reflectance
    values significantly differ. In comparison, the reflectance value in the NIR wavelength
    range is relatively high, but no clear difference has been observed. Near the
    two bands of water vapor (945 nm) and cirrus (1375 nm) of the Sentinel-2 image,
    there are more wide absorption valleys but practically overlapping curves in the
    SWIR wavelength range; however, near the SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands, the difference
    becomes more evident. Nevertheless, when employing a single SWIR band for accuracy
    assessment, the result does not achieve the high accuracy of the visible band
    due to the SWIR band’s resolution of 20 m. Figure 7. Reflectance curve of non-saline
    and saline cropland samples over the wavelength range of Sentinel-2 data in dry
    season. Commonly, SI measures the direct relationship between Electrical Conductivity
    (EC) and moisture. This ratio shows the salinity concentration in the available
    water [62]. By utilizing the more pronounced differences between the two cropland
    sample types in the Blue and Red bands, the SI index based on the visible band
    in this study was the variable with the highest contribution and achieved higher
    classification accuracy. However, other indices have similar classification accuracy
    since they are both constructed from red and NIR bands. While NDVI and NDSI represent
    normalized differences between the Red and NIR bands of the Sentinel-2 image,
    NDVI is the NIR minus the Red and NDSI is the inverse. Thus, a positive value
    of NDVI and a negative value of NDSI at the same pixel are equivalent. However,
    when NDVI or NDSI are not employed, the overall accuracy of the salt-affected
    cropland mapping slightly decreases (the accuracy decreases by 0.0019 when NDVI
    is removed, and the accuracy drops by 0.0058 when NDSI is removed). Consequently,
    NDVI and NDSI have equal correlation coefficients with the sample data, which
    means positive correlation coefficients for NDVI and negative correlation coefficients
    for NDSI). Additionally, NDSI was found to be more sensitive for detecting saline
    cropland in the wet season with OA at 0.66, which is slightly higher than the
    accuracy that NDVI can achieve in the wet season with OA at 0.65. 4.2. Multi-Sensor
    Data Application in Saline Cropland Mapping Soil salinization is a severe problem
    faced by land worldwide, and the affected area is vast [18]. However, there is
    no exact standard for monitoring solutions due to different data sources and statistical
    methods. Unlike non-salt-affected land and other ground features, soil salinization
    has distinct and unique spectral reflectance characteristics and tends to show
    higher reflectance on spectral images [40,63,64,65]. Satellite remote sensing
    technology has irreplaceable advantages (near real-time and covering a large area)
    and good application prospects for observing soil salinity. Therefore, using multispectral
    remote sensing images to monitor the soil-affected cropland in an area with complex
    land surface objects is feasible. On the other hand, microwave remote sensing
    has been widely used in the inversion of surface soil moisture and salinity for
    a long time [66,67]. Since the C-band polarization radar data of the Sentinel-1
    satellite was introduced into civilian use, some breakthroughs have been made
    in soil moisture inversion research at the beginning [68,69]. However, the salinity
    change in the soil surface will affect the soil dielectric properties and thus
    will change the microwave emissivity of the land surface. Therefore, in addition
    to considering the impact of soil moisture alone, soil salinity has to be considered
    in areas with severe soil salinization [70,71,72]. As a result, the study of monitoring
    soil salinity using microwave remote sensing data has gradually attracted extensive
    attention [73,74]. The method combining the optical and microwave remote sensing
    data has been discussed preliminary in this study. However, many studies have
    shown that the identification ability of the backscattering coefficient will be
    significantly enhanced after the polarization decomposition of radar data. Nevertheless,
    the importance of radar data in this study is still minimal, which may be because
    the eigenvalues after polarization decomposition are more advantageous for identifying
    salt on the soil surface than the original backscattering coefficient. The GRD
    data provided in GEE do not have phase information, so it is impossible to realize
    GEE’s polarization decomposition. Hence, it is difficult to establish the eigenvalues
    after polarization decomposition in a large area to extract saline cropland. The
    application of remote sensing to earth observation is an essential means to understand
    the earth and study various natural phenomena in the future. Remote sensing technology
    is constantly developing, including many commercial satellite programs. As a result,
    the earth will be observed without a dead angle. In addition, the data volume
    will increase in geometric multiples; managing and using data efficiently and
    reasonably will be both a challenge and an opportunity for developing various
    algorithms and applications for salt-affected cropland monitoring. 4.3. Strongly
    Saline Cropland Abandonment in HID The ESA WorldCover global land cover data did
    not recognize some fields with severe salinization as cropland. However, it is
    a minor error, because these have been abandoned for many years. On the other
    hand, a few severely salinized croplands have been planted late for sunflower
    seeds because of their salt tolerance [75]. In either case, it points to the severely
    salinized cropland in HID under the high potential abandonment stress. Soil salinization
    has become an essential topic of global change research. The latest research shows
    that global soil salinization will be characterized by regional prominence, global
    intensification, and the coexistence of local salinization and intensification.
    Severely salinization is one of the most hazardous reasons why cropland is removed
    from production and then causes the abandonment globally of 0.3–1.5 million hectares
    per year [76]. It is generally recognized that a large proportion of salt-affected
    soils in irrigated areas occurs on land inhabited by smallholder farmers. However,
    salt-affected cropland degradation’s social and economic dimensions have received
    little attention compared to its biophysical aspects [77]. Well-known examples
    of salt-induced land degradation include the Aral Sea Basin (Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya
    River Basins) in Central Asian countries, the Indo-Gangetic Basin in India, the
    Indus Basin in Pakistan, the Yellow River Basin in China, the Euphrates Basin
    in Syria and Iraq, the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia, and the San Joaquin
    Valley in the United States. Severe salinity also reduces paddy yields in many
    previously productive land areas; many paddy fields in Jaffna Peninsula, Sri Lanka,
    have been abandoned and are currently becoming shrubland [78]. Nevertheless, there
    has been no comprehensive study on the contribution of soil salinity to reduced
    agricultural productivity and the abandonment of paddy lands in a region. A study
    based on the analysis of the spatiotemporal variation in cropland expansion and
    loss in Xinjiang over 20 years found that the abandonment was the primary reason
    for the loss of cropland, with soil salinization playing an increasingly major
    role in the cropland abandonment [79]. Furthermore, Wu et al. [80] found widespread
    abandonment of reclaimed land and tillage in Xinjiang. A major reason for this
    abandonment was soil salinization with as much as 12,680 km2 of cropland being
    affected. There was a strong sense of expansion in the land use pattern of humanity
    with a poor understanding of sustainable development in the last few decades in
    Inner Mongolia. As a result, the saline bare land in northeast China has been
    utilized to a certain extent. However, due to the lack of protective technology,
    paddy fields’ abandonment and salinization reappearance have also occurred in
    some areas after the high-intensity utilization of cropland. The extensive area
    saline cropland treatment was also implemented in 2022 with the government’s support
    since the abandoned cropland is an essential reserve in China. The efficient utilization
    of salinized land is vital to ensure national food security, especially under
    the current COVID-19 pandemic and the global background of frequent disasters;
    it is imminent to utilize the reserve cropland and control the salinity. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, after manual visual selection of samples, creation of a cropland
    base map of HID, and sample validity testing, a saline cropland identification
    model based on multi-sensor remote sensing data and the multi-variable dataset
    was built and achieved with high classification accuracy. One of these, the sample
    validity test method, was used for the first time in the saline cropland monitoring
    study and produced promising experimental results. The multi-variable dataset
    based on Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images from March to April
    furthermore exhibits strong performance in the remote sensing mapping of salt-affected
    crops. The methodology and results reported in this study may be advantageous
    for mapping saline cropland before the growing season in arid and semi-arid regions.
    They can therefore be encouraged and utilized in a broader area. Supplementary

  description: According to the United Nation’s World Water Development Report, by
    2050 more than 50% of the world’s population will be under high water scarcity.
    To avoid water stress, water resources are needed to be managed more securely.
    Smart water technology (SWT) has evolved for proper management and saving of water
    resources. Smart water system (SWS) uses sensor, information, and communication
    technology (ICT) to provide real-time monitoring of data such as pressure, water
    ow, water quality, moisture, etc. with the capability to detect any abnormalities
    such as non-revenue water (NRW) losses, water contamination in the water distribution
    system (WDS). It makes water and energy utilization more efficient in the water
    treatment plant and agriculture. In addition, the standardization of data format
    i.e., use of Water Mark UP language 2.0 has made data exchange easier for between
    different water authorities. This review research exhibits the current state-of-the-art
    of the on-going SWT along with present challenges and future scope on the mentioned
    technologies. A conclusion is drawn that smart technologies can lead to better
    water resource management, which can lead to the reduction of water scarcity worldwide.
    High implementation cost may act as a barrier to the implementation of SWT in
    developing countries, whereas data security and its reliability along with system
    ability to give accurate results are some of the key challenges in its field implementation.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract According to the United Nation’s World Water Development
    Report, by 2050 more than 50% of the world’s population will be under high water
    scarcity. To avoid water stress, water resources are needed to be managed more
    securely. Smart water technology (SWT) has evolved for proper management and saving
    of water resources. Smart water system (SWS) uses sensor, information, and communication
    technology (ICT) to provide real-time monitoring of data such as pressure, water
    ow, water quality, moisture, etc. with the capability to detect any abnormalities
    such as non-revenue water (NRW) losses, water contamination in the water distribution
    system (WDS). It makes water and energy utilization more efficient in the water
    treatment plant and agriculture. In addition, the standardization of data format
    i.e., use of Water Mark UP language 2.0 has made data exchange easier for between
    different water authorities. This review research exhibits the current state-of-the-art
    of the on-going SWT along with present challenges and future scope on the mentioned
    technologies. A conclusion is drawn that smart technologies can lead to better
    water resource management, which can lead to the reduction of water scarcity worldwide.
    High implementation cost may act as a barrier to the implementation of SWT in
    developing countries, whereas data security and its reliability along with system
    ability to give accurate results are some of the key challenges in its field implementation.
    Keywords: smart water system; smart irrigation; water resource management; leakage
    detection; water ML 2.0; water body monitoring 1. Introduction Water and sanitation
    were declared as basic human needs by the United Nations (UN) in 2012 [1]. In
    the current scenario, 786 million people do not have access to clean drinking
    water [2]. Events like floods, climate change, and water pollution make freshwater
    scarcer. According to the World Bank database, 44 developed countries have non-revenue
    water (NRW) losses of 35% [3,4]. Because of these losses, extra water has to be
    pumped [5]. Efficient water management has become a major issue for many countries
    and water industries. Using ICT, researchers are coming up with self-learning
    systems known as Smart water system (SWS), having the capability to manage water
    more efficiently [6,7]. In addition, the SWS is suggested as one way to tackle
    some issues related to climate change by improving the ecosystem by reducing the
    water footprint [8]. Several research articles and textbooks [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
    have given attention to the water loss management techniques such as infrastructural
    and non-infrastructural pressure management, leakage assessment and their control
    by identifying leakages, smart metering, etc. for water distribution systems (WDS)
    [16]. Sensege [17] has given an evaluation regarding different present sensor
    technologies for smart farming highlighting their capabilities of providing better
    revenue to the farmers by suggesting crop best suitable for their field on the
    basis of environmental analysis. At the same time reducing the water foot print
    by predicting efficient watering timing. River waters and other water bodies are
    important parts of the ecosystem and the main source of water supply for cities.
    Hence, their quality needs to be monitored assuring contamination-free water to
    the consumers and protecting the ecosystem. Smart sensor technologies [18] are
    capable of protecting water bodies by monitoring their contamination, toxic content
    check, oxygen content, etc. The system provides alarm in case of any suspicious
    findings. Water from river is usually treated in water treatment plants before
    supplying it to the end users. Hence, the role of water treatment plants is equally
    important. Hence, for unstoppable supply of water to the society efficient of
    management of these water infrastructures are required [19,20]. Smart water technologies
    provide better management by proving efficient water quality monitoring, helps
    in managing labor, etc. [21,22]. Previously presented reviews were more focused
    on smart water techniques on an individual field, rather than towards overall
    water management techniques. This paper provides a review on present SWT for water
    management, along with future challenges and scope of research. Based upon the
    state of the art technologies and their available case studies on SWM across the
    world, more than 100 reputed publications have been referred to understand the
    role of SWT for better water management to reduce water footprints and their capability
    to save ecosystem. This review study is an extension survey for the selective
    literature review [23] of leakage management techniques in water distribution
    system, which described leakage management-related techniques (leakage modeling,
    different leakage assessment techniques, pressure management, smart water techniques
    for pipeline burst detection and localization, pump scheduling). These topics
    are related to water distribution systems i.e., water networks. However, providing
    quality water to end users is not only a better water distribution system in the
    city but it requires contamination-free river water resources and efficient water
    treatment plants. Hence, researchers working in the field of smart water management
    for smart cities should posses some knowledge of different smart water technologies
    available for water treatment plants and water body monitoring etc. This article
    reviews different smart water techniques dedicated to leakage management of water
    distribution systems, water treatment plants, smart farming, water bodies monitoring,
    energy harvesting for sensors, the role of smart metering etc. The topics discussed
    in this paper are organized as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. The organization of
    the discussed topics in this survey. The purpose of this review article is to
    highlight the recent smart water technologies in different fields utilizing real-life
    case studies. Some of the objectives of this review article are as follows: To
    give a review of different smart water technologies. To make a comparison between
    different available smart water techniques utilized in different parts of the
    world. To identify and highlight the benefits observed in utilizing smart technologies
    such as a reduction in water loss, energy, and waste management, better revenue
    in farming, etc. To identify the key challenges such as high cost, cyber attacks,
    data standardization, etc. that need to be addressed in the future by the researchers.
    To mention the political and social constraints in implementing smart technologies.
    To mention the solution to remove the political–social constraints. The paper
    is arranged in the following manner: Section 2 gives information on SWS for WDS.
    Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5 present smart water technology for agriculture,
    water body monitoring, and water treatment plants. The smart metering concept
    is discussed in Section 6. Section 7 throws light on the standardization of the
    hydro-meteorological data format. The conclusion is drawn out in Section 8. The
    list of abbreviations used in the paper are defined in Table 1. Table 1. List
    of abbreviations used in the paper. 2. Smart Water Systems for Water Distribution
    System According to a report by the World Bank, every year, 45 billion cubic meters
    of water are lost, which costs around US$ 14 billion [15]. Water is lost due to
    poor connections, leakages from pipes, faulty metering, unauthorized connections,
    etc. NRW for any district metering area (DMA) can be calculated using Top-down
    and Bottom-up approaches [24,25,26]. Data reliability, unavailability of data,
    and high costs are the drawbacks of these techniques. 2.1. Leakage Detection Leakages
    are the main sources of NRW losses, which highly depend on pressure and water
    consumption [26], and increase water contamination. Acoustic sensors are old and
    commonly used methods for leakage detection in WDS [27]. Ground-penetrating radar
    [28], infrared thermography [11], and electromagnetic sensors are other developed
    techniques available for leakage detection. These techniques suffer from a limited
    surveying range for leakage detection. With recent advances in science and technology,
    researchers are coming up with SWT having the capability to automatically detect
    and locate the burst event. Some of the the commonly used sensors and their applications
    in smart cities are explained in Figure 2. Figure 2. Sensors and their applications
    in smart cities. This section discusses different smart techniques (such as transient
    analysis of pressure signal, online monitoring, etc.) present for detecting leakages
    and burst events in the pipeline network. In the end, different smart techniques
    available for minimizing leakages through pressure management are discussed followed
    by a case study on the SWG of Singapore. Sensor technology provides real-time
    monitoring of water infrastructures [29]. Measured data taken from these sensors,
    when combined with efficient data processing techniques, enable better management
    and response in case of infrastructure failure. In the UK [30], a decision support
    system (DSS) is installed, to improve the operations of the water supply system,
    under the Neptune Project Research Consortium. Flow and pressure sensors data
    have been analyzed for leakage identification, pump scheduling and to investigate
    steady and dynamic properties of the system under Pressure Relief Valves (PRV)
    control. Leakage assessment is performed in the Lisbon water supply system using
    the Bottom-up approach [31]. Flow meters and pressure transducers are installed
    at some predefined points for data measurements. The location of leakages is identified
    using acoustic sensors. This has resulted in a 40% reduction of water losses,
    causing a total saving of €63,500. Research institutes are coming up with a future
    prototype of smart water networks for leakage detection and its control. A smart
    water network [32] is installed at Graz University. Magnetic valves along with
    flow and pressure sensors were installed to identify leakages in the networks.
    Experiments under more complex networks are desired to make such a prototype more
    practically implementable in WDS. Other smart water techniques for leakage detection,
    by monitoring abrupt changes using flow and pressure sensors, were presented in
    [33,34]. Inverse transient analysis (ITA) [35] and frequency analysis [36] of
    the pressure signal (collected from pressure sensors) have grabbed the attention
    of researchers in the recent past for leakage detection in the pipeline system.
    Gupta and Kulat [37] have used Wavelet and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) analysis on
    the transient pressure signal collected from the sensor network for automatic
    detection of burst events in the pipeline. The system is tested for a small pipeline
    testbed. It is observed that using wavelet analysis alone is not sufficient for
    the detection of burst events. Although CUSUM alone can detect the abnormalities
    observed in pressure signal, pinpointing the exact time of abnormality is not
    possible. Table 2 discusses some of the real-world case studies and their drawbacks.
    Table 2. Smart water techniques for burst event detection in WDS. Other leakage
    identification techniques such as the transient damping method (TDM) [41] and
    impulse response analysis (IRA) [42] are limited to simple pipeline architecture.
    Field implementation and verification of these techniques are shown to be still
    lacking. Leakage detection and assessment can be performed by calculating the
    difference between measured and predicted hydraulic parameters [43]. Similarly,
    Ye et al. [44] proposed a Kalman filter based prediction algorithm for prediction
    of hydraulic parameters of WDS at North England. The proposed methodology is computationally
    simple and requires a smaller amount of data, compared to the artificial neural
    network (ANN) based techniques [45]. This technique has been successfully applied
    for detecting small leakages and small abrupt changes. Gupta et al. [46] have
    shown how the water flow data collected from flow sensors of water tanks can be
    utilized to find out the optimum tank water level. Optimal tank water level helps
    minimize the excess pipeline pressure in the water network, which leads to leakage
    reduction in the water networks. Other prediction algorithms such as autoregressive
    integrated moving average (ARIMA) [47] and Pattern sequence-based forecasting
    (PSF) [48,49] can be used in the future, for further improvement in prediction
    modeling. It is equally important to identify commercial losses. The water industry
    [50] known as Smart water came up with a smart device, capable of providing information
    regarding the water level of installed house tanks, on the smartphone. Water losses
    occurring inside the homes (for example leak through sanitation, etc.) can be
    easily identified using this device. A similar study is performed to identify
    leakages in the large water tanks of the society by analyzing the difference in
    the actual water utilized by consumes (using smart meters) and the total water
    flow from the tanks [51]. A SWS [40] can replace older DMA leak assessment and
    detection techniques for the identification of pipeline bursting events. SWT performs
    analysis on collected sensors data to detect pipeline leakages, which reduces
    water losses. Water, which gets lost earlier due to physical and commercial losses,
    can serve many people deprived of water scarcity. This can lead to reducing water
    scarcity worldwide. The localization of burst events reduces the cost required
    for pipeline maintenance. More techniques are needed to be developed to identify
    small leakages and commercial losses present in the network. Exact pinpointing
    of burst location can be seen as future work. Excess pipeline pressure reduction
    controls the leakages in the WDS [52]. Sensus [53] has come up with a smart water
    solution for water utility and monitoring. Different sensors such as pressure,
    flow and water quality sensor have been deployed in water infrastructure for online
    monitoring and analysis of these hydraulic parameters for leakage detection and
    thus the system reduces water losses. Pump scheduling is decided according to
    demand variations observed on the analysis of measured data. Pressure monitoring
    and pump scheduling helps perform pressure management of WDS, and thus reduces
    the bursting probability of the aging pipeline. Hence, a reduction in the cost
    of pipeline maintenance is observed. This system can lead to global savings of
    US $ 12.5 billion if adopted worldwide. Software controlled [54] advanced pump
    scheduling system has been installed in Poznan. The bursting of pipeline depends
    upon the pressure of water. Using OPIR software, pressure-demand is predicted.
    It works on a self-learning algorithm from past databases. Demand for the next
    48 h is forecasted, and water is supplied according to the predicted demand. Pressure
    reducing valves (PRV) (NGE9001) are installed at different points to control the
    pipeline pressure, based on the required demand. This pressure reduction technique
    reduces the bursting probability of pipeline and thus reduces water loss by 21%.
    This causes a reduction in energy usage by €21,500 annually. Di et al. [55] presented
    an Ant algorithm for improving the water network. Remote-controlled valves have
    been suggested for controlling leakages in WDS using pressure management. Sensor
    technology performs demand prediction which helps perform pressure management,
    thus reduces excess pressure present in WDS. This avoids the bursting of the pipeline.
    Pump scheduling helps reduce water losses and energy consumption. The high implementation
    cost of the sensor network can be seen as a drawback. Due to high sensor cost
    it can be deployed in limited numbers only. Hence, efficient sensor placement
    is required in order to get maximum of meaningful data [56]. Shahra and Wu [57]
    have shown the usage of an evolutionary algorithm (EA). The study uses virtual
    water contamination scenarios in different locations to identifies the locations
    of sensors placement. Incorrect data may cause unappropriated prediction, making
    WDS pressure inefficient for providing efficient services. 2.2. Smart Water Grid
    The implementation of SWT is a costly affair [58]. The government can involve
    the public sector in the development of smart infrastructures in the cities. This
    will improve the quality of service. In Singapore, the government in collaboration
    with a private firm known as Water-Wise has taken an initiative to reduce water
    losses by 50%. Pressure, water flow, pH, and Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)
    sensor have been installed to form a smart water grid network [59] as shown in
    Figure 3. Figure 3. Water-Wise Sensors used in the Singapore city [59]. Water-Wise
    uses integrated data and electronic alerts system (IDEAS) for water quality assessment,
    leakage identification, and pressure measurement. The decision support tools module
    (DSTM) is installed for demand prediction using flow meters to perform pump scheduling
    optimal operation. Demand predictions allow efficient management of water demand
    [60]. Transient pressure analysis using wavelets is performed for the detection
    of burst events. The system is successfully tested for pipeline burst events varying
    from 7 1 𝑠 to 3 1 𝑠 . Classification of burst events from other hydraulic operations
    such as the closing of valves, pump operation, etc., are some of the observed
    challenges and concluded as future work. Singapore smart water network [61] does
    not reduce commercial water losses. Implementations of smart meters have successfully
    helped in reducing commercial losses in Australia [62] and Kennebec Water District
    (KWD), USA [63] by creating awareness among the users regarding excess consumptions.
    Similarly, implementations of smart meters in Singapore will also help in reducing
    commercial water losses and thus can be seen as future work. Similar smart water
    monitoring protypes for smart city water monitoring known as Low-Power Wide Area
    Network (LPWAN) technology is proposed in [64]. The proposed techniques are theoretically
    well defined but need to be tested on actual cites to identify actual changes.
    In many cases, building infrastructure requires high loans at higher interest
    rates and paying them for a longer period is an important issue. This withdraws
    the interest of many private firms from investing in pipeline infrastructure.
    Loans can be provided to water utilities at the lower interest rate for developing
    water infrastructure. In the USA [65], the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency (USEPA) has started the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
    (WIFIA) program under which private firms receive loans at a lower rate of interest,
    for a longer period for developing water infrastructure. This will help to accelerate
    investment in water infrastructure. 3. Smart Farming To satisfy the demand of
    a growing population, it is expected to enhance the crop production by 70%, by
    2050 [66]. This indicates an increase in water demands for this additional cultivation
    of crops. Optimum timing and supply of water and fertilizers are required for
    the efficient growth of crops. By adopting smart irrigation, water consumption
    can be reduced. Some of the smart faming technology and their applications can
    be understand from Figure 4. Figure 4. Smart farming technologies and their application.
    Real-time information helps to protect the field from lateral damage. IBM Inc.
    [67] came up with a smart sensor for smart farming to reduce water usage and to
    give better revenue at the end. These tools analyze weather, soil qualities such
    as moisture and humidity content and suggests the crops that can be grown at a
    given location along with their harvesting time. They provide answers regarding
    the time and place of selling those crops to earn better revenue. By adopting
    this smart farming technology, yield can be increased by 8.5%, with a reduction
    in fuel and water consumption. Dacom [68] in the Netherlands comes up with smart
    farming devices, that use weather stations, GPS, and moisture sensors to provide
    information about soil moisture, humidity, etc. The farmer can record water quantity
    consumed by crops each day. Sensing and supplying only required water to crops
    helps in saving 20% of the water in the field. The sensor network consumes high
    energy [69]. Providing electricity to a rural area is itself a challenging task
    in developing countries such as India, Bangladesh, etc. This makes the deployment
    of a sensor network to be extremely challenging in such an area. Hence, there
    is a need for sensor technology that does not consume energy from foreign sources
    [70]. Edyn garden sensor [71], as shown in Figure 5 is a portable sensor that
    works fed by solar energy. These sensors can be directly placed in soil. They
    record humidity, moisture, soil nutrition, and temperature. Depending on the collected
    data, the sensor will suggest the crops, which are suitable to grow in the field.
    This sensor communicates with mobile phones and provides information regarding
    field data. Based on the weather forecast and moisture content in the soil, the
    Edyn valve sensor can control the time of watering and the time of harvesting
    of crops. Alerts are sent on mobile if any abrupt changes are observed in the
    field. Optimized scheduling of water in the gardens will result in a reduction
    of water and energy consumption. Figure 5. Edyn Garden Sensor and water valve
    [71]. Abbas et al. [72] have proposed a moisture sensor-based smart garden, in
    which data is sent to the central location via a radio module. Depending upon
    the moisture content in the soil, the scheduling of water to plants is decided.
    This will result in a reduction in water consumption for gardening. Smart farming
    allows efficient scheduling of fertilizers to crops, which helps in saving agricultural
    land from lateral damage. Efficient water scheduling in the agricultural field
    reduces water consumption by 20%. Information regarding the harvesting of crops
    leads to a better quality of crops, with better revenue generation from them.
    Even though there are various smart farming techniques that are available still
    very less adaption of such technologies are observed [73]. Table 3 shows the comparative
    study on farmers response on adaptation of smart farming technology. The main
    reason for dissatisfaction is due to non-accurate predicted weather information.
    Whereas it is also observed that some of the farmers and not willing to share
    their field data due to unavailability of legal rules against such field data
    sharing [74]. This unavailability of data makes it harder for smart farming software
    to produce accurate results. Some filed surveys can be performed by researchers
    in order to identify the slow adaption of such useful technologies by farmers.
    Standardized software for smart farming can be seen as near-future work [75].
    Unavailability of wireless, broadband coverage, and energy in a rural area along
    with the high cost of these devices makes it harder for field implementation in
    developing countries. Some of the challenges and opportunities related with data
    security of smart farming against cyber attacks are discussed by Gupta et al.
    [76]. Table 3. Various surveys on accepting smart farming technology by farmers.
    4. Water Body Monitoring River water characteristics such as pH value, toxic content,
    dissolved oxygen, etc. are needed to be tracked down. Floating sensors can be
    deployed to monitor the water body and their parameters such as temperature, salinity,
    freshness, contamination, etc. These devices can generate an early alarm during
    events such as floods, water contamination, increasing toxic content, etc. Skinner
    et al. [80] have performed temperature monitoring of large water bodies such as
    rivers, lakes, etc., using hundreds of temperature sensors placed in water bodies,
    and temperature variations with respect to depth are studied. A noticeable temperature
    variation of 0.58 ∘ C has been observed at a variable depth. The University of
    California in Berkeley [18,81] came up with a Generation 3 drifter floating sensor
    to check the salinity of San Joaquin river. This sensor network consists of pressure,
    salinity sensor, and GPS for communication, as shown in Figure 6. The sensors
    continuously send the data regarding speed and direction of water flow to the
    central station, where analysis is performed on collected data to generate the
    required information. The implementation of sensor technology has shown efficient
    results for saving aquatic ecosystems by monitoring toxic content. Van et al.
    [82] have shown usage of ToxProtect sensors for detection of toxic substances
    present in water bodies such as cyanide but are unable to detect Fluorocetate,
    which is a kind of super-toxic material, having probable oral lethal dose in humans
    is less than 5 mg/kg (7 drops) and requiring high maintenance. Zurita et al. [83]
    have shown the usage of TOXcontrol sensors to monitor the microbiological population
    present in the water bodies. Measurement of chlorophyll concentration is one way
    to evaluate the marine ecosystem. Figure 6. Generation 3 drifter floating sensor
    [18]. Contamination Identification and Level Monitoring Electronic Display Systems
    (CILM-EDS) is a prototype developed for central monitoring of water contamination
    of large water bodies using water imaging. Any suspension contamination is identified
    and is reported in the central display too [84]. The prototype is still under
    trials but have shown promising results in identifying the water contamination.
    Similar prototyping for monitoring water body temperature, pH and dissolve value
    of small water bodies such as lakes ponds etc is proposed [85]. The devices use
    solar panel for providing energy harvesting solution for sensors. The results
    can be monitored via mobile phones as well. A sensor network [86] of standard
    ISU/IEC/IEEE 2145 is installed for evaluating water quality at the Apulla region,
    by monitoring chlorophyll content on the river surface. DSS is used here to take
    decisions on critical environmental issues. Similar case studies for monitoring
    of water bodies have been discussed in Murray et al. [87]. Some of the researchers
    around the world are developing different prototypes. Table 4 highlights some
    of the similar prototypes proposed in resent scenario. Table 4. Various prototypes
    for water body monitoring. Sensor technology has made the study of the aquatic
    ecosystems faster and easier. Storey et al. [88] presented a review on present
    online water quality monitoring technology in the USA and UK, for monitoring of
    water bodies such as a rivers, lakes, etc. Maintenance, high-cost device, sensors
    life (battery) in water, data reliability, and protection from physical damage,
    can act as challenging issues. Field implementation of such sensor technology
    needs to be motivated in near future. 5. Smart Water Technology for Water Treatment
    Plants Water treatment plant (WTP) is an important infrastructure that provides
    clean water supply to the locality. To maintain the purity of water, real-time
    surveillance is required. With the increase in the development of ICT, online
    monitoring of water quality is possible. It also optimizes the device utilization
    with real-time alarming by detecting any abrupt changes such as water leakages
    and its contamination. This smart system provides a solution for efficient management
    of labourers, which is required for faster pipeline repairing operation. Different
    smart water technologies have been provided by the leading industry for better
    management of water treatment plants. Table 5 highlights some of the technology
    provided by the world leading industries. Table 5. Smart technologies for water
    treatment plants by industry pioneers. Schneider [22] provided a solution for
    maintaining water infrastructure by monitoring the quality of water using sensor
    technology. Additionally, it reduced water losses by detecting pipeline leakages.
    This saves electricity which is required for pumping and filtering of extra water
    which lost earlier, thus can reduce carbon footprint and electric bills by 20%
    and 15%, respectively. It helps manage labours by providing real-time field monitoring
    in WTP using cameras, thus increases the working efficiency of labors by 25%.
    IBM and District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DCWASA) [89] work on issues
    related to the aging water and sewer infrastructure. The software solves issues
    related to valves, pipeline maintenance, and public fire hazards by providing
    a real-time mapping application. The system identifies the location in WDS, where
    maintenance is required. Automated meters installed in WDS have helped reduce
    water bills. This makes pipeline management faster, easier, and helps in reducing
    the required manpower. Siemens [90] introduced SIWA sewer, used to regulate wastewater
    flow by providing even load distribution on the sewage treatment plant. It also
    provides water quality monitoring with leakage detection in WDS. Combined sewers
    overflow (CSO) [91] causes pollution in nearby rivers. Schneider came up with
    a smart system for monitoring of waste and stormwater. Weather prediction is used
    to identify how much the drainage system can be affected by rainfall, floods (if
    any), etc. This helps in diluting the stormwater effect and saves sewage infrastructure.
    All the water waste management industries require high electricity consumption
    for operation; hence, increases carbon footprint. Using network modeling [22],
    electricity demand can be reduced by 15%. Energy harvesting technology needs to
    be applied to reduce electricity consumption and carbon footprint. Reducing carbon
    footprint will help in improving the environment. OR waste treatment plant [92]
    in the city of Gresham, USA generates greater or equal energy used by plants.
    In 2015, solar panels and biogas generators were installed. The 92% of electricity
    is generated from biogas and the rest from solar panels, causing the saving of
    US $500,000 which was earlier invested in paying electricity bills. SWS for WTP
    provides water quality monitoring, leakage detection and reduces pollution by
    performing even load distribution on sewage treatment plants. It also increases
    work efficiency by providing real-time monitoring of workers. WTP consumes high
    energy; hence, the usage of renewable energy for WTP needs to be motivated. Data
    analysis from SWS also had a secondary application. Based on the wastewater analysis,
    China is trying to find out the drug usage in society [93]. They are working towards
    building a system that will analyze the drug content and based upon the waste
    locality and the users living near the area it is possible to track the potential
    drug user. 6. Smart Metering for Water Distribution System Smart water metering
    is capable of providing early alarming of unusual events such as leakages, high
    water consumption, etc. from the perspective of the water consumer. Gathered data
    analysis helps in making decisions regarding intervention policies, pricing strategies,
    and setting of water usage reduction targets. Some of the other applications along
    with their advantages of using smart metering can be better understand from Figure
    7. Figure 7. Smart metering applications and their advantages. Masia et al. [94]
    have shown usage of a smart meter for reducing NRW losses and demand management
    in WDS of Gauteng, South Africa. Smart water metering has created awareness among
    the 40% of the population regarding excess water consumption by them. Supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA) [95] is installed for analysis of collected
    data from a smart meter, in WDS of North Yorkshire, UK to identify burst events
    by generating alarms. Results show 40% of alarm corresponding to burst events.
    KWD [63], USA supplies 1.2 gallons of water per day to 23,000 customers. KWD suffers
    from challenges such as handling of water meter reading and labor cost. KWD installed
    advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) at homes, which can communicate in two
    directions. It can communicate or issuance of command or price signal from the
    utility to the meter and on other hand, they communicate water consumption data,
    etc. to the utility. They provide water consumption data to consumers, making
    them aware regarding water usage. This results in an improvement in the quality
    of WDS services, with a reduction in manpower, and can solve leakage problems
    (including commercial losses) more easily. A smart water grid [96] prototype has
    been developed for smart cities. Data transmission from a smart meter, flow, and
    pH sensor is done at 169 MHz. The microcontroller MSP430M has been used to collect
    the data and control the operation at the receiving end. This increases the user’s
    awareness and will improve the efficiency of the water grid infrastructure and
    its management. South-east-Queensland residency end-user study (SEQREUS) was performed
    in winter 2010 [97] to analyze the water demand pattern and to increase the awareness
    among people regarding water consumption. As a result of this study, many consumers
    have started using water efficient washing machines leading towards a reduction
    of water consumption causing estimated annual savings of US$ 45,000. Smart meters
    were installed in 337 homes in Melbourne city, during winter 2010 and summer 2012
    in order to estimate daily water consumption by individuals [62]. It was observed
    that during summer, the city had a water consumption rate of 149 l/capita/day
    while in winter, it was reduced to 117 l/capita/day. More water is usually consumed
    in irrigation, evaporative cooler, and toilets during the summer season, which
    increases water demand. Wang et al. [98] have proposed an algorithm to predict
    water usage activities based on smart meter readings. Loureiro et al. [99] have
    used smart meter readings from 311 houses to identify low, medium, and high water
    consumption groups. A daily water consumption pattern in the district was estimated
    based on measured data. Gurung et al. [100] developed a simulator which models
    the water system with more operational variables, making the implementation of
    ICT devices easier in WDS. This study has shown the usage of smart meters for
    calculating average and peak demand for maintaining optimal pressure in WDS which
    results in a reduction of leakages. Thus, a smart meter can be seen as a perfect
    tool for identification of demand in WDS. DMA requires high-resolution and costly
    devices for monitoring purposes. The high implementation cost of these smart meters
    makes them difficult to be used in many countries. A conventional mechanical water
    meter is installed in older WDS of some countries. Conversion of such mechanical
    meters into smart meters will lead to an improvement in the quality of services
    and reduction of manpower for data collection, particularly in underdeveloped
    or in developing countries. A novel mechanical meter [101] having an additional
    circuit is used as a smart meter in Japan. Reading on meters acts as a sensing
    pad (Figure 8). Water is filled inside the device, which acts as a capacitive
    medium between the arrow and sensing pad. A code is generated whenever the pointing
    arrow is above the sensing pad. The data is collected in the microprocessor. GPRS
    is used to transmit signals to the control room. [102] have proposed other low
    cost wireless smart meters based on ZigBee. All the devices present in a predefined
    area transfer meter reading to the master node which sends data to the central
    processing center, where data analysis is performed. Figure 8. Mechanical meter
    as a smart meter [101]. Smart meter failure will lead to the creation of uncertainties
    related to water loss in WDS, thus a proper replacement is required. Ref. [103]
    have proposed an algorithm to suggest the optimum replacement time of smart meters.
    Similar case studies on smart meters with their benefits and challenges are also
    discussed in [104,105]. Various available smart water technologies have been discussed
    in a report by Oxford [50]. Smart meters will lead to an improvement in the quality
    of services, data reliability, and reduction of manpower during operations of
    data collection [63]. Leakage assessment can be performed more efficiently on
    WDS using a smart meter [30]. A smart meter provides additional information regarding
    post meter leakages known as commercial losses [50] and helps in predicting demand
    variations [106]; detection of leakages [95], which leads to a reduction of water
    losses in WDS. It increases awareness among consumers regarding water consumption
    [97]. This awareness can reduce water consumption which can cause estimated annual
    savings of US$ 45,000 for developed countries such as Australia. Smart meter [104]
    suffers from challenges such as privacy of data, interference with other electronic
    devices, power consumption, high cost, low accuracy at low flow, and uncertainties
    related to water loss due to failed meters. Other challenges while deployment
    of smart meters in water infrastructures can be found in the study given by [107].
    The study proposes fog computing paradigm for SWS to reduce the data volume exchanged
    between the different system layer. Universal metering can be seen as one future
    task for improvement of leakage assessment in WDS. 7. Standardization of Hydro-Meteorological
    Data Format Most countries have their own standard data formats for sending meteorological
    data; this makes data exchanging difficult among different nations [108]. Much
    less effort has been made on a global level for data standardizations [109]. The
    data format used for sending hydro-meteorological data such as weather, annual
    rainfall, condition of water resources, etc., needs to be standardized at a global
    level. In January 2010 [110], the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) together
    with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) decided to work jointly to develop water
    markup language 2.0 (Water ML.2.0). It will be an international standard data
    format that will be used during the exchange of geospatial hydro-meteorological
    observations and data measurements with other meteorological communities of the
    world. Initially, an OGC encoding standard was developed for the representation
    of time series hydrological observations. This standard will be used during the
    exchange of rating data such as discrete river discharge flow measurements, etc.
    Underwater ML 2.0, Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA)
    in Australia started developing an interim data encoding standard based on the
    OGC standard data encoding, known as water data transfer format (WDTF). This will
    be used for delivering Australian water information (data measurements) to the
    Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), Australia. A report on successful completion of 10
    years of ML. 2.0 concluded that the standardization has helped different water
    agencies such as National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and
    WMO to improve the water management due to standardization of data format making
    easy exchange of data possible [111]. 8. Constraints This section is discussing
    various constraints associated with smart water technologies. 8.1. Constraints
    from Society Adoption of smart water technology not just faces technical and research-oriented
    constraints but also from financial constraints such as lack of funding. Even
    though funds are available, many a times, there is no proper technical support
    (depending upon geographical locations), which is required to successfully maintain
    such technology. The decision regarding opting for such technology for the betterment
    of the city, depends on the local governance. Therefore, lack of understanding
    in local governance may deprive its citizens to take advantage of such technologies
    [112]. Data security is another risk which restricts individual from using smart
    water technology such as at homes for personal awareness or the sensors used in
    farms. The users might afraid of the usage of personal data stored on the cloud
    [113]. The data can be misused by some third person. Laws need to be created by
    governments, which will restrict the industry from misusing the personal data
    by firms or through cyber-attack [114]. One such example is observed in Queensland,
    Australia where an unauthorized user has taken the control of the SCADA system
    and has released 80,000 L of raw sewage into the surrounding water system [115].
    The industry needs to update the security system for finding the unauthenticated
    users and can send regular software updates to the individual to improve the security
    of the system. This will also improve the trust of the individual over firms and
    motivate them to implement such technology in near future [116]. 8.2. Social-Technical
    Constraints Real-world is made from components such as people, governments, different
    communities, etc. There are many social components involved while implementing
    smart technology in the city for example for developing cities, building proper
    toilets for sanitation will be more essential and prioritized work for water industries
    than the implementation of a smart sensor network in the water system [117]. Therefore,
    the local challenges may act as a barrier while implementing such technologies
    in the real world. Similar social-technical constraints were analyzed in the smart
    city project of Songdo and PlanIT Valley in South Korea and Portugal, respectively
    [118]. It is observed that community and political support over a longer period
    is more required than the presence of an innovative environment for faster development
    and implementations of such technologies. It is observed in Europe and North America
    that smart system implementations involve resistance from society as they believe
    such technology neglects environmental protection, technology is more for the
    rich people rather than every citizen as they fail to solve their daily life problems
    [119]. Keeping transparency about the failures of smart water technology to the
    citizens along with success stories and the differences created by such technology
    in the citizen’s life. This will help in understanding the technologies and creating
    awareness among the citizens [120]. 9. Conclusions Water scarcity is a serious
    issue in many parts of the world and it needs attention. Using sensor technology,
    SWS provides online monitoring which helps in managing water resources more efficiently.
    SWT performs analysis on sensor data for optimal pressure management and detection
    of commercial water losses and pipeline leakages, which leads to a reduction of
    water losses in WDS. Water, which gets lost earlier due to commercial and physical
    losses, can be utilized to serve the people deprived form it. This can lead to
    reducing water scarcity worldwide. SWS improves WDS services by performing efficient
    labor management. It also indicates the location of WDS where pipeline maintenance
    is required. Smart farming increases the yield of the agricultural field. Based
    on weather studies and information regarding moisture and nutrient content in
    the soil, watering and fertilization scheduling in the agricultural field is decided
    by sensors, which can reduce water consumption by 20% and saves agricultural land
    from lateral damage. The sensor can act as a catalyst for monitoring toxic and
    chlorophyll content, present in water bodies. It makes monitoring possible even
    during adverse conditions such as monitoring at a greater depth of water bodies.
    These devices help in reducing water pollution by maintaining an equal load on
    sewage treatment plants. Installation of smart meters in WDS will lead to an improvement
    in the quality of services, data reliability, and reduction of manpower for meter
    reading and data collection. Leakage assessment can be performed more efficiently
    on WDS using SWT. Thus, smart technology is capable of replacing DMA methodology
    in the near future for leakage assessment and detection. Use of smart water technology
    can help in improving the ecosystem by reducing the carbon and water foot prints.
    Based on the literature review being discussed, the following are the challenges
    and future scope that needs to be resolved: Leakage detection using online monitoring
    has taken leakage management to a higher level. SWT technology suffers from false
    alarms due to the presence of different operations such as valve opening and closing,
    pump operation, etc. Researchers need to rectify this by differentiating the burst
    event from different hydraulic operations such as valve closing, pump switching,
    etc. Pinpointing the exact location is still difficult. The present system has
    a localization error of 50 m. There is a scope of improvement in the localization
    techniques. A device that will rectify commercial losses such as internal leakages
    from houses is needed to be developed. ITA has shown some success in recent past
    in-field implementation of leakage detection. Leakage detection techniques such
    as TDA and IRA need to be encouraged towards field implementation. Wavelet transforms
    have proven to be efficient tools for burst detection in WDS using pressure transient
    analysis. Other transforms such as the Hilbert transform, Teager energy operator
    (TEO) are yet to be explored for transient analysis. Kalman filters and ANN have
    been widely used for the prediction of abnormalities in WDS but support vector
    machine (SVM) can be seen as an alternative in the near future. Based on the collected
    data from sensors, prediction modeling can be used to predict maintenance operations
    such as pipeline replacement, bursting of the pipeline. This will lead to further
    improvement in WDS services along with a reduction in manpower and maintenance
    costs. Failures in predictions may leads to some devastating results. Thus, there
    is scope of improvement in the field of predictions. Hence, more accurate predictions
    algorithms needs to be developed. Such prediction algorithms can be developed
    in the near future and can be field specified only. Millions of sensors will consume
    lots of energy; providing electricity to a rural area is itself a challenging
    task in developing countries of Asia and Africa. This makes the deployment of
    a sensor network challenging in such rural areas for efficient farming. Farming
    sensors based on energy harvesting need to be developed in the future for smart
    farming [121]. To protect sensors from physical damage is a challenging task for
    water industries. Universal smart water metering can be seen as an important leakage
    assessment technique at the user’s end. This will make the consumer more aware
    of internal leakages and excess water consumption. The use of different data formats
    for sending hydro-meteorological data may act as a barrier while exchanging data
    at a global level. Hence, standardization of data format for sending meteorological
    data is needed to be done along with their adoption at a global level. This will
    make data exchange convenient and data can be easily used further by research
    communities in different countries. Dynamic allocation of sensors and extracting
    data from dynamic sensors is a challenging task. Lots of research work is still
    needed to be done for the algorithmic development of dynamic sensor allocation.
    Wireless transmission of data from the sensor may cause interference with other
    devices. A dedicated frequency band should be allocated for transmission of data
    from smart water devices to avoid interference with other devices. Billions of
    data points will be generated from sensors; handling such massive data in the
    control center, and assuring to maintain privacy is still a challenging task.
    To generate useful information from these collected data, big data analysis can
    be a step that researchers can look to work in the near future. Modification of
    the MAC layer in network architecture can be seen as future work to increase data
    reliability and privacy. Smart water devices must have a common standardized module
    and platform so that machine to machine communication can be established among
    them. Work should be done in the standardization of the platform and module to
    be used in smart water devices. The development of smart portable devices can
    be an area which researchers can look into. The use of SWT for WDS, agriculture,
    industry, etc. in many countries is a challenging task due to some poor economies.
    There is a need for low cost and low maintenance SWS which is simple in-field
    implementation and has high efficiency in terms of data reliability and privacy.
    Several techniques are proposed in the literature but their field implementation
    and their results are rarely analyzed. Thus, more collaboration between research
    institutes and the water industry needs to be done to feel this gap of absence
    of actual field implementation of various valuable proposed techniques. Standardization
    of data format i.e., use of Water Mark UP language 2.0 has made data exchange
    easier between different water authorities. This data availability helps water
    authorities to perform efficient data analysis to get more accurate results which
    leads to better management of water resources. Selling of SWT-based products and
    making them acceptable by society is going to be a challenging task. Some awareness
    needs to be created among people regarding the advantages of such devices. It
    is important to know the state-of-the-art in the working field. A common platform
    needs to be made where information can be shared. A smart water forum has been
    developed (SWAM) which consists of members from different industries. The idea
    behind this forum is to share new research so that joint efforts can be made.
    This can act as a good platform for new researchers. Reliability, privacy, and
    synchronization of sensor data may act as a challenging task when it comes to
    field implementation. This review has summarised the work carried out by various
    researchers related to SWT, associated problems, and their solutions, in the last
    two decades. This can help researchers working in smart water technology to identify
    their problem statements. Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.D.G., A.F.

  description: Wireless sensor networks are used in various fields, such as military,
    healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, Monitoring and preparation of
    critical infrastructure. However, due to some of the restrictions of WSNs on storage,
    power consumption, communication, computation, scalable, security and privacy;
    people are looking forward cloud environment with large storage framework for
    the processing and storing of real time data. The cloud environment is providing
    large storage space and better services to the people in scalable manner. Sensor-cloud
    infrastructure is popular, providing an open, flexible and reconfigurable platform
    for many monitoring and control applications. In this work presenting a sensor-cloud
    infrastructure for storing data related to agriculture, Infrastructure that shows
    how to transfer data from WSNs to the cloud. In addition we addressed malicious
    attacks, issues and challenges in sensor cloud infrastructure. The idea of our
    proposed work is to collect all the samples for the soil. We choose the most favored
    plants around the India, then, select three plants, namely rice, sugarcane and
    wheat. After selecting the plants we collect data related to agriculture irrigation
    from different types of sensors such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and soil PH, CO2 and light sensors. Based on the data collected, our proposed
    system advice to farmers that usage of pesticides, fertilizers which are most
    suitable to their lands at the same time, we integrate to improve agriculture
    productivity in India.

  description: The recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and the proliferation
    of sensor platforms have allowed the implementation of different applications
    used to connect physical devices (Things) to the real world, enabling a multi
    cross domain and multidisciplinary data exchange. The agricultural sector is also
    greatly benefiting from this progress with several advantages, including the optimal
    management of resources and the improvement of human labour (i.e., crop growth
    monitoring and selection, irrigation decision support, fertilizers, pesticide
    and agrochemicals application, etc.). Moreover, advancements in mechanization
    and GPS-assisted vehicle guidance in agriculture has established the concept of
    precision agronomy and precision farming, as well as automation in food production
    chain. However, current systems still have significant drawbacks in areas such
    as flexibility, networking, standardization, robustness, skills' requirements
    and lack of real time data and actuation. A current trend is based on the interaction
    of machines and autonomous systems, in order to fit into cyber-physical production
    systems and enabling data collection and networked site-specific monitoring and
    control. This paper explores all the cutting-edge challenges and solutions required
    to implement the digital agriculture framework, intended as the evolution from
    Precision Farming to connected, knowledge-based farm production systems, in a
    context where digital technologies are first-class elements for the automation
    of sustainable processes in agriculture.

  description: In the past, the field investigation data of water quality and farmland
    soils were mainly paper-based records. After each survey, a large amount of data
    were needed to be digitized which took a lot of manpower and time. In this study,
    the information and communication technology platform (E-platform) was established
    to integrate the survey planning, survey progress management, and results checking
    to simplify the field investigation procedure and data recording and collation.
    In addition, the applications for standardization digital data format, recording
    survey data, and positioning coordinates, were developed on the mobile devices
    (M-devices). The data collected was sent with specific coordination data to the
    E-platform via WIFI or 3G mobile communications directly in real-time. Accordingly,
    the challenges in the field investigation were overcome, the accuracy and the
    quality of data were improved by using the E-platform and the M-devices.

    management Introduction Water management of irrigated fields is crucial in global
    water resource management and competitiveness. Many irrigation schemes are exploring
    different, cheaper, and more efficient ways of curbing huge water losses from
    flood irrigation system. The application of modern technology, such as geographic
    information system (GIS), Global positioning system (GPS), wireless technology,
    and Sensors to agriculture has brought unprecedented revolution in agricultural
    water management (Tagarakis et al. 2011). Good water management means applying
    the precise amount of water at the right time in the right place and quantity.
    Many computer-aided tools have already been developed with the aim to improve
    water management of irrigation schemes (Kettelhut 1991; Rowshon & Amin 2010),
    yet there is a need for a more robust system. There are several tools and techniques
    currently available for planning, designing, and managing irrigation projects.
    In most cases, project managers have to use a number of different software packages
    and expertise to complete a successful project. Advances in communication networks
    have overcome many difficulties in the use of timely and spatially distributed
    resources in the decision-making processes (Bidgoli & Attaran 1988; Choi et al.
    2005). Traditional GIS-based Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) are complex
    systems that require sophisticated hardware and infrastructure (Peeters et al.
    2012). Decision support system (DSS) is a set of tools and procedures that work
    interactively to accomplish task easily. It is capable of enhancing the quality
    of the decision-making processes in the system (Power 2003; Anastasiou et al.
    2005). GIS is currently converging with several other technologies to provide
    new levels of accessibility and functionality as web GIS (Drummond & French 2008).
    As web technologies and the GIS advanced considerably and practiced widely (Tan
    2003), the web-based GIS has become a popular means of information sharing and
    visualization. The goal of the DSS is to leverage these specific information technology
    investments and provide platform that will allow the users to visualize and ask
    questions that gone beyond a single domain of discipline. The objectives of this
    review were: firstly, to provide a useful summary and reference work for various
    Web GIS DSS applications to irrigation water management. Secondly, to incorporate
    DSSs, geospatial water management, and consider in-depth various applications.
    And thirdly, to examine some current issues and future perspectives related to
    irrigation water management and web geospatial systems. An overview of DSS In
    precision farming, the main areas investigated for the design of DSS concerned
    with the area of data collection, data transmission, and data processing. Commercially
    available software packages such as database management systems (DBMS), spread-sheets,
    and GIS can be used to improve the storage, retrieval, analysis, and presentation
    of bulks amounts of data (Tsihrintzis et al. 1996). Technologies and tools available
    can be adapted and transformed into operational DSS to assist managers in managing
    agriculture through precision farming (Ge et al. 2013). GIS evolved as a means
    of assembling and analyzing diverse spatial data. These systems evolved from centuries
    of mapmaking and compilation of data (Eldrandaly 2007). It further reiterates
    the constituents of GIS as it involves two geographic data components: spatial
    data relate to the geometry of spatial features, and attribute data give the information
    about the spatial features. A GIS organizes and stores information about the world
    as a collection of thematic layers that can be linked by geography. A DSS can
    be described as a computer-based interactive human–computer decision-making system
    that supports decision-makers rather than replaces them and utilized data and
    models, solves problems with varying degrees of structure (nonstructured, semistructured);
    however, it focuses on effectiveness rather than efficiency in decision processes.
    Abawi et al. ( 2001) pointed out that conceptual models or frameworks are crucial
    to understanding complex system. They define DSS broadly as an interactive computer-based
    system that helps decision-makers to use data and models to solve problems. Components
    of DSS The development of DSS requires an interdisciplinary approach and involves
    disciplines such as computer science, decision theory, statistics, psychology,
    information and knowledge engineering, and organizational science (Mysiak et al.
    2005). A DSS consists of two major subsystems – human decision-makers and computer
    systems. Therefore, a DSS doesn''t make decision but only support human decision
    in making process. As an unstructured or semistructured decision by definition
    cannot be programmed because it''s precise nature and structure are illusive and
    complex, the roles of human decision-makers are crucial. The function of a human
    decision-maker as a component of DSS is not to enter data to build database, but
    to exercise judgment or intuition throughout the entire decision-making processes.
    Computer system components of DSS consist of data management subsystem, model
    management subsystem, interface and dialog management subsystem, and knowledge-based
    subsystem. Data management subsystem Database management subsystems consist of
    DSS database, database management system, data dictionary and directory system,
    database query facility, model base, and program routines, functions, utilities,
    applets, add-ons, etc. DSS database is inclusive of decision-makers’ personal
    database, database specially built for DSS, and data gathered from or access provided
    to other organization or external database. DBMS are computer programs which primarily
    are concerned with a large amount of data in a physical storage such as hard disks
    and creating, updating and querying database. DBMS can be either an independent
    program or embedded within a DSS generator that allows users to create database
    file as input to the DSS. Model management subsystem The first step of the decision-making
    process begins with the creation of a decision support model using an integrated
    DSS support program (DSS generator) such as utility programs etc. In performing
    decision, users create models and related database files to make specific decisions.
    The created models and databases are stored in the model base and database in
    the direct access storage devices, such as hard disks. Data management in DSS
    is a necessary function in the intelligent stage of the decision-making process,
    but not sufficient to support design and choice of stages of decision-making process.
    DSS utilizes many types of management science and operational research models.
    They include linear, integer and goal programming models, network models, statistical
    and simulation models, and spreadsheet modeling. All these models are stored in
    the model base. Model-based management system (MBMS) is a set of computer programs
    embedded within DSS generator that allows users to create models, restructure,
    update models, and delete a model. Inclusive in the model management systems are
    model directory and modeling languages. In addition, model management, multiple
    criteria decision-making model embedded DSS together with knowledge-based DSS.
    Knowledge-based subsystem The knowledge-based decision support system (KBDSS)
    which is a subset of DSS comprise of Expert System (ES), which are classified
    into two as Expert Support System (ESS) and Intelligent Support System (ISS).
    ESS is created to replace human expertise with machine expertise, while ISS is
    created to amplify the memory and intelligent of human and groups. The new integrated
    system of ESS and ISS can support decision-makers by using the expertise of key
    organizational members. Knowledge-based subsystem is an artificial intelligence-based
    application into DSS architecture to assist users in selecting appropriate model
    for the problem solving, managing model libraries, and integrating uncertainties
    into mathematical models and assist user in interpreting model results. User interface
    (UI) The UI subsystem is the gateway to both DBMS and MBMS. For users, the UI
    subsystem is the only part of DSS components with which they have to deal (Kumar
    et al. 2011). The interface system allows users’ access to data subsystem (database
    and database management software) and model subsystem (model base and model base
    management software). The functions of the UI subsystems are to provide interaction
    between decision-makers and DSS simply by allowing the user to create, update,
    delete database files and decision models, Providing variety of input and output
    formats such as color graphics, tables, and multiple windows in screen. Web GIS
    Web GIS has capabilities to integrate several databases for manipulation, analysis
    for visualization, and display information online. Spatial data such as soil,
    rainfall, land use, transportation, topography, and demography can be implemented
    for better decisions in resources, facilities planning, and management. With its
    powerful capacity for management and analysis of spatial data, GIS becomes an
    important tool in irrigation management (Lin et al. 2004). The web mapping basically
    deals with technical issues, web-based cartography theory issues social issues,
    and usability of maps. It is the presentation media for web maps and gaining more
    analytical capabilities (Pinheiro et al. 2009). GIS integrates and relates data
    with spatial component and supports users to view in proper format which supports
    in making complex spatial decisions through visualization, interactive modeling,
    and analysis environments. GIS is thus far utilized to help with perception and
    understanding of spatially distributed phenomena in many areas of decision-making
    and evaluating problems (Sakamoto & Fukui 2004). Generally GIS systems were considered
    as platform-dependent applications (Zhang et al. 2011). The development and rapid
    growth of web and web-based application created a new platform for traditional
    GIS to grow and spread. Unfortunately, not everyone has access to GIS, nor would
    be able to spend time necessary to use it effectively, that open chance for Web
    GIS application which are easy to manipulate. Web GIS became a cheap and easy
    way of disseminating geospatial data and processing tools (Alesheikh et al. 2002).
    Web GIS has the highest number of users, although typically Internet users focus
    on simple display and query tasks (Goodchild et al. 2005). The capability of Web
    GIS for interacting dynamically in distributed environment from cross platform
    to client/ server computing system made it more interesting to develop and use
    for accessing spatial information. The major development of cartography is using
    web as a distribution medium. By means of web, now it has opened the possibility
    of the availability of real-time maps, cheaper maps sharing, more frequently updated
    database sources, and cheaper software and hardware requirement. There are some
    problems and difficulties for full development of web mapping. Some technical
    difficulties such as bandwidth, lower resolution of image are common. Reliability
    issues and security issues have limited the expansion of web mapping. The development
    of web cartography and GIS is steady as compared to web technologies. This evolution
    leads GIS away from data browsing, analyzing, and managing for individual decisions,
    and more toward participatory GIS and communicating on social decision issues
    (Carver 1999; Malczewski 1999). As Craig et al. ( 1999) describe the Public Participation
    GIS principles as accessibility, understanding ability, and accountability, Web
    GIS continues to draw attention as a public participation tool (Sakamoto & Fukui
    2004). Nowadays, Google Maps, Google Earth, Open Street Map, Yahoo Maps, Microsoft''s
    Live Search Maps, and many other commercial as well as noncommercial applications
    provide many kinds of geographical related information such as detailed maps,
    satellite images, and terrain maps covering all over the world and allow users
    to use their Application Programming Interface (API) for those that are open source
    (Zhelu 2009). Developing GIS web service GIS Web Service can also support customizable
    spatial analysis functions. Therefore, ArcGIS Server services can be used to develop
    two types of Web services: ArcGIS Server data web services and application function
    Web services. Hongjun et al. ( 2008) develops a Web service described using XML-standards
    like the Web Service Description Language (WSDL). Web Services are different from
    Web applications, don''t require people to use; but software applications to call
    and that makes it flexible yet powerful. ArcGIS Server ADF takes full advantage
    of Web services and can be used to connect ArcGIS Server services. The Web Service
    layer uses the popular WSDL, Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI),
    Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), to descript, register and release the GIS
    service provided by the application service layer. For sharing geographic information
    resources in different places, ArcGIS Server provide some modes to find these
    resources, such as ArcGIS local services, ArcGIS Network Services, Arc IMS services,
    Arc Web services, WMS services. Directory services generates in ArcGIS Server
    Manager which take charge for the service requested of receiving, analysis, finding,
    positioning, and returned service description. Developing web application There
    are a number of different tools and techniques currently available to plan, design,
    and manage projects. Skelton ( 2010) explores web-based GIS and how it contributes
    to the field of Project Management (PM), specifically an open-source GIS web solution.
    In most cases, project managers must use a number of different software packages
    to complete a successful project. With the advent of API and open-source software,
    proper cost-effective tools can be at the disposal of project managers and staff.
    An open source alternative exists on all levels of web GIS infrastructure. Project
    risk and waste can be limited by the ability to effectively plan and control projects,
    thereby increasing the probability of success. The website created in this case
    study provides users the ability to view the progress of a project – according
    to user needs. Its dashboard-style interface aids in visualizing and disseminating
    project information. A pilot-type PM GIS web application was created and evaluated
    using a User Experience Analysis survey. Survey results provided insight to end-user
    needs and preferences, which will be utilized for future application development.
    By utilizing open-source resources, web GIS PM software is capable of rapid implementation
    with minimal input costs. Web mapping services An emphasis is placed on the technical
    developments from desktop to mobile applications, as well as the development of
    base maps and map types from pre-rendered tiles to editable map styles in different
    viewing modes from bird eye view, 3D, and augmented reality. Schmidt and Weiser
    ( 2012) put forward the trend in Web mapping services like Google, introduced
    in 2005, it has altered the online mapping experience. Not only could maps be
    viewed in a fast and simple way, but there was also the possibility some manipulations
    through APIs, leading some to proclaim the “democratization of mapping” (Schmidt
    & Weiser 2012). How they impacted the existing Web mapping environment and possible
    future areas of development while the first maps produced with APIs were mostly
    static point maps, new features have enabled dynamic and interactive applications
    with “GIS-like” functionalities, often supported by third party implementations.
    Web GIS DSS There were different tools used to develop web GIS DSS, opened source
    and commercial tools but with same basic structures. Sugumaran ( 2005) state that
    the essential component to develop Web GIS DSS was to include a web-based GIS
    as a problem-solver and facilitate geographic data retrieval, display, and analysis.
    It combines several different components including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
    UIs, Internet interface programs, computational models, and geographic databases.
    There are two ways to set up a Web GIS DSS: (1) server-side processing and (2)
    Client-side processing. The server-side approach uses a thin client and most of
    the processing, including spatial data access and manipulation, is performed on
    the server side. The resulting information and image objects are then sent to
    the client to be rendered. The client-side processing approach uses a thick client
    in which GIS functionality is preloaded on the client machine, and only the geographic
    data is accessed from one or more servers. The server-side Web GIS DSS requires
    only a browser installed on the client machine to carry out GIS DSS tasks. However,
    every user action requires communication between the client and the server. Web
    GIS DSS in water management Decision-making about water resources management requires
    crucial knowledge, wisdom and critical thinking, and cross-discipline techniques
    to identify alternatives for actions and to assess their effects. The combination
    of engineering technology, and physical and life sciences helps managers to understand
    environmental issues and beyond. But a decision-maker is not left alone in this
    battle for a good decision. DSS in other word is a interactive computer-based
    system intended to help decision-makers use communications technologies, data,
    documents, knowledge, and/or models to complete decision process tasks” (Power
    2003). Much more literatures were evolving on DSS. Many of the early researches
    were on automated report generation using main frame computers (Power 2003), some
    were on business problem and water quality issues (Bonczek et al. 1984). Worthy
    of mentioning that DSS is a decision support and not making decision, this was
    due to the fact that it addresses the advantage of computer to manipulate large
    amount of data but yet rely on decision-maker''s judgment. Heilman et al. ( 2005)
    stressed that the early applications and development of DSS including some of
    the most recent ones which were designed based on the spatial database in (GIS)
    format are complex. Multi-objective decision-making tool also incorporated in
    GIS application which opens a new window for transforming decision approach in
    agriculture (Malczewski 1999). The geospatial data including remote sensing brings
    us closer to sort and solve the complexes in watershed management. Similarly,
    on-farm irrigation water management constitutes a lot of such complexity that
    need the same approaches in order to understand and work with precision to reduce
    losses from the fields. System for integrated monitoring (SIM) tool SIM Tool was
    built as a result of challenges to build a GIS that can be dynamically fed with
    data, allowing researchers and other agents to recover actual and up-to-date information.
    Pinheiro et al. ( 2009) developed SIM tool. Web technologies were used to develop
    the tool based on the open source paradigm in such a way that results can be achieved
    by serving two main characteristics: low-costing and information sharing. The
    main idea was to allow different users with distinct needs to feed the system
    with data and to have access to all information by way of maps available on the
    Internet. The research issues involved the acquisition and processing of different
    types of video and images in the form of Small Format Aerial Images. This was
    acquired by a radio-controlled helicopter used for construction of mosaics to
    be fed in the GIS, and underwater geo-referenced pictures. The SIM continues with
    the feeding and processing of environmental control data collected and finishes
    with the presentation of all information on the Web. For this dynamic processing,
    they have developed tools that make Map Server more flexible and dynamic, allowing
    data uploading by the users. They developed a module that uses interpolation to
    aim spatial data analysis. A complex application that has validated this research
    is to feed the system with data coming from coral reef regions located in northeast
    of Brazil. Rice irrigation information system (RIMIS) RIMIS can give information
    on the uniformity of water distribution and the shortfall or excess and what decisions
    to adopt for the next day. Rowshon et al. ( 2009) develops a GIS-integrated tool
    known as RIMIS for equitable irrigation supply to tertiary canals and the characterization
    of their irrigation delivery performance as the season advances. RIMIS dynamically
    links a field irrigation demand prediction model for the area irrigated by a canal
    network in GIS. The system can correctly simulate and evaluate recommended irrigation
    supplies among tertiary canals that match the available discharge at the system
    head. Similar to Azhan et al. ( 2008), the user interface was developed using
    Arc Objects and Visual Basic for Application (VBA) programming languages in ArcGIS
    software. It ensures equal sharing of water for the tail-end users. The system
    helps to keep input and output databases always updated with respect to the field
    conditions. The results were displayed in the form of charts, maps, and tables
    in a comprehensible form. This helps irrigation managers to enhance decision-making.
    Dynamic decision support system (DDSS) – INNOVA RIEGO DDSS was developed to support
    the farm water management in surface irrigation. The online DDSS was based on
    the formulation and integration of three components: a dynamic-relational database,
    an administrator model, and a graphical UI, providing information in real time.
    Carlos et al. ( 2010) developed DDSS called INNOVA RIEGO and was applied in an
    orange orchard under furrow irrigation to evaluate the actual irrigation management
    carried out in the orchard, and determine both the suitable water management factors
    and the respectively irrigation efficiencies of the production system. Using INNOVA
    RIEGO, an Excellent management factors status was achieved. The results achieved:
    exposed that the user was able to improve his farm water management, reaching
    sustainable results, reducing significantly the quantities of percolation and
    surface runoff, and increasing the irrigation efficiencies. Scheme irrigation
    management information system (SIMIS) Contrary to other DSS, SIMIS was designed
    to assist in planning and operations. It was based on water balance model covering
    different modules for modeling the root zone water balance which was done by daily
    time series steps. Mateos and Lo ( 2002) came up with a model – SIMIS is a DSS
    for managing irrigation schemes. The SIMIS approach was based on simple water
    balance models with capacity constraints. The user can simulate management alternatives,
    assess the results, and try out new alternatives, until a satisfactory solution
    is found. SIMIS also helps in the administrative aspects of managing irrigation
    schemes (accounting, calculating water charges, and controlling maintenance activities)
    and in assessing their performance. SIMIS was organized in five main sets related
    to meteorological, cropping, irrigation layout, plot, and maintenance aspects
    (Mateos & Lo 2002). GIS-based water resources and agricultural permitting and
    planning system (GWRAPPS) A GWRAPPS was developed by integrating the Agricultural
    Field Scale Irrigation Requirements Simulation (AFSIRS) crop water model, a GIS,
    and a database management system within an ArcGIS framework (Satti & Jacobs 2004).
    GWRAPPS is a DSS for permitting and planning irrigation water demand. GWRAPPS
    operates in a Windows environment that tightly couples ArcGIS (ESRI) with the
    AFSIRS model. AFSIRS simulates the dynamic processes of soil water infiltration,
    redistribution, and extraction by evapotranspiration as steady-state processes
    and schedules irrigation based on an allowable level of soil water depletion from
    a two-layer crop root zone. GWRAPPS can simultaneously simulate irrigation requirements
    of thousands of farms that grow any of 60 crops including 16 perennial crops e.g.,
    pasture, citrus, alfalfa, and turf and 44 annual crops e.g., beans, cotton, potatoes,
    and wheat grown on any of the 766 soil types mapped in Florida by the Soil Conservation
    Service (SCS) using nine irrigation systems. CRP-DSS CRP-DSS was use in resource
    management and assessment of environmental quality. Specifically, the DSS is targeted
    toward aiding USDA to better manage and plan Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
    enrollments. Rao et al. ( 2007) designed and developed a web-based GIS DSS for
    managing and planning USDA''s CRP. The complete work was based on design and development
    of a prototype web-GIS DSS. The DSS targets on the emerging industry-standard
    ArcIMS GIS platform and integrates a mapping component Automated Feature Information
    Retrieval System (AFIRS) and a modeling component Soil and Water Assessment Tool
    (SWAT). Our novel integrated web-GIS DSS is implemented using web server and Java
    Servlet technology over an ArcIMS platform to support data access and processing
    in a distributed environment. AFIRS functions as a feature extraction protocol
    that uses multisource geospatial data-sets, and SWAT serves to simulate long-term
    trends of soil and water quality. Web-based SDSS Web-based SDSS components are
    based on Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Internet communication and server side
    operation. Choi et al. ( 2005) work on the SDSS and came up with an interesting
    framework of developing SDSS. Although a web-based SDSS can combine several different
    components, essentially a web-based SDSS is comprised of HTML UIs, Internet interface
    programs, computational models, and geographic databases. In a similar development
    of SDSS, Peeters et al. ( 2012) presented the SDSS which is being developed within
    the framework of the “3D-Mosaic” project which aims at optimizing water consumption
    in orchards by employing precision agriculture methods through the application
    of information and communication technology (ICT). ISAREG model The irrigation
    scheduling simulation model ISAREG is a GIS-based application and was aimed at
    supporting the implementation of improved farm irrigation management and, in a
    later phase, to also help PM. The integration concerns the creation of spatial
    and weather GIS databases usable by ISAREG, the model''s operation for different
    water management scenarios, and the production of crop irrigation maps and time-dependent
    irrigation depths at selected aggregation modes, including the farm scale. Fortes
    et al. ( 2005) applies ISAREG model to support improved irrigation scheduling
    in the Syr Darya basin, Uzbekistan, due to previous applications in similar climates.
    It is a conceptual non-distributed water balance model for simulating crop irrigation
    schedules at field level and to compute irrigation requirements under optimal
    or water stressed conditions. The resulting information on alternative irrigation
    schedules is, therefore, spatially distributed and shall be used both to support
    irrigation scheduling advising and to help in the identification of practices
    that may lead to water saving and provide for salinity control. Web GIS multi-criteria
    decision analysis (MCDA) The framework, called Participatory GIS, has been implemented
    within the Google Maps environment; it consists of two main elements supporting
    the deliberative and analytic components of the decision-making process. Boroushaki
    and Malczewski ( 2010) presents a framework for a collaborative Web GIS multi-criteria
    decision analysis. It focuses on the underlying theories and techniques for designing
    and implementing the conceptual framework. The deliberative part is based on the
    concept of Argumentation Maps; the analytic component consists of multi-criteria
    decision analysis methods. Participatory GIS uses the server-side architecture
    approach to Web-based GIS. It employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client
    side and a combination of PHP scripting language and a MySQL database on the Participatory
    GIS server. The Google Maps server provides the map and Google Maps API. DRASTIC
    model The DRASTIC model is based on the seven data layers that provide inputs
    into the modeling process. It corresponds to the initials of seven layers i.e.
    Depth of water, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of
    vadose zone, and hydraulic Conductivity. ILWIS 3.0 (Integrated Land and Water
    Information System) and Arcview 3.2a GIS software were used to find out the water
    vulnerable zones in shallow aquifers. Rahman ( 2008) applied the DRASTIC model
    to find out the groundwater vulnerable zones in shallow aquifers in Aligarh and
    its surrounding areas, using the DRASTIC model in a GIS environment. The GIS technique
    has provided an efficient tool for assessing and analyzing the vulnerability to
    groundwater pollution. Real-time DSS for irrigation The evolution of real-time
    DSS for irrigation in agriculture is becoming more attractive to agricultural
    water managers. This is true especially when data are displayed in real time to
    ensure planning and efficient management. There are many real-time DSS tools in
    irrigation management today, few among them were presented in the following section
    to show their capabilities and composition in tackling various irrigation and
    water resources management problems. Irrigation water management system (IWMS)
    In a quest to improve the irrigation management level and optimization plan of
    the irrigation, Cheng-cai et al. ( 2012) developed IWMS based on flex viewer framework;
    according to the business procedure, the structure and function modules of ZhaoKou
    irrigation management system were established in this work. Combining the fuzzy
    clustering method and Markov chain, this work designed the precipitation forecasting
    module. And the crop water demand forecasting module is built on Penman formula
    and crop coefficient index. The establishment of water re-distribution module
    was successfully used in the optimization plan of the irrigation. In order to
    integrate the above three modules, Flex Viewer framework has been chosen to build
    the management system of Zhaokou irrigation based on the ArcGIS Server REST technology.
    Hence, the implement of this irrigation management system provided a reference
    application of Flex Viewer in water resources re-scheduling and improved the irrigation
    management level and optimization plan of the irrigation. The IrriSatSMS This
    is a new approach of providing tailored but widely applicable irrigation water
    management services. Hornbuckle et al. ( 2009) developed an IrriSatSMS hybrid
    satellite and Short Message Service (SMS) system. This approach aims at delivering
    daily data to irrigators to support and facilitate their irrigation decision-making
    process. Thus, all components need to run on a “real-time” basis. This IrriSatSMS
    approach is based on the computation of crop water requirements based on weather
    data and crop-related coefficients which then translate into a water balance and
    the required irrigation demand. The IrriSatSMS approach undertakes all the tedious
    calculations needed to convert weather stations based reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) data and crop coefficient data (Kc) to useful water management information
    for the irrigator. GIS-based decision support system (GDSS) The idea of DSS for
    water management is not a new phenomenon; rather, how to make it accessible at
    the right time to effect decision is the main challenge. Rao et al. ( 2004) developed
    GIS-based DSS for real-time water estimation in distributaries. It is dynamically
    linked to field irrigation demand prediction model for the area irrigated by distributaries
    with GIS of the canal network. Furthermore, the real-time information was centered
    on water demand and supply on the field, but this study did not clearly indicate
    the cooperation of field water demand in the system, most importantly on the farm
    demand using the field water balance model. Web DSS for integrated water resources
    management The water resources management model based on genetic algorithm (GA)
    was developed in the DSS, facilitating efficient allocation of water resources
    among different regions within a city (Zeng et al. 2012). In his study, a DSS
    was developed for supporting integrated water resources management in Daegu city,
    Republic of Korea. The developed DSS contained four subsystems including database,
    model base, and knowledgebase, as well as general user interface (GUI). It was
    then connected with the National Water Management Information System. A flow prediction
    could be conducted through the incorporated HEC-HMS Version 3.0.1. Also, an urban
    water demand forecasting model was also developed using an artificial neural network
    (ANN)-based model. The result indicated that the developed DSS is very useful
    to deal with complex water resources management problems and could be further
    applied to similar cities in South Korea. Based on ArcGIS Engine, SQL Server 2000,
    and Web environment, the developed DSS could provide real-time forecasted hydrological
    and hydraulic information, improving decision-makers’ capabilities in handling
    issues related to spatial queries, scenarios analysis, and optimal decision-making.
    With the applications of ANN for water demand forecasting and GA for water resources
    allocation, the system could deal with the problems of complex and nonlinear water
    resources system, both in water demand and optimal water allocation aspects. The
    successful application of the DSS in Daegu city demonstrated that it is a significant
    move toward a fully integrated water-environment DSS for South Korea. Discussion
    In contemporary world today, the need to improve agricultural practice and facilities
    cannot be overemphasized; therefore, inculcating smart farming strategy becomes
    imperative. Researchers are working hard to come up with sophisticated tools that
    could be affordable, easy to operate, and viable to assist in managing the operations
    of agricultural services. Cross-discipline approach to handle such problems is
    necessary. These discussions highlight the trends of development of the available
    tools in irrigation water management with particular focus on the merit, limitations,
    and pending issues. Proper irrigation water management and schedule needs to measure
    exact crop water needs and losses, predict rainfall amount for maximum utilization
    of rainwater, and to determine where water is needed most in the field. There
    are several DSS for irrigation water management which has been successfully developed
    so far and are being applied in different areas. DSS has been incorporated into
    GIS to give it spatial characteristics to solve spatial problems related to irrigation
    water management (Rao et al. 2004; Fortes et al. 2005; Rahman 2008; Rowshon et
    al. 2009). DSS using GIS and deployed on web has been tried to enable user to
    carry out some analysis and to reach out to wider users so that people can access
    information regarding field water budget in real time (Hongjun et al. 2008; Cheng-cai
    et al. 2012; Zeng et al. 2012). However, the latest trend in this area was the
    establishment of real-time web service application; this new approach not only
    provides the DSS, SDSS, or Web GIS DSS as a database for viewing information but
    displays results in real time (Jia et al. 2009; Bonaiti & Fipps 2012; Schmidt
    & Weiser 2012; Wenkel et al. 2013). This simplifies a lot of issues not only for
    the stakeholders in irrigation services generally, but even policy-makers and
    agribusiness entrepreneurs. Because of the complexity of irrigation water management,
    there are many interactions between different factors on the field, most of these
    systems were developed so far to handle some aspect of irrigation water management
    (Mannini et al. 2013). Comprehensive irrigation water management needs to take
    into account upstream/downstream water condition, on-farm water balance and underground
    water as the condition depicts, and distribution criteria which differ by location
    due to differences in environmental condition, rainfall variability, and cultural
    practices and user-centered interface system (Lanter & Barbara 1991; Khadra &
    Lamaddalena 2010). Some of the systems developed differ in concept and procedures,
    while others are site specific (Jia et al. 2009; Bonaiti & Fipps 2012). Some can
    be customized and applied broadly but usually are generalized, and precision becomes
    an issue. System Evaluation remain a challenge as mostly only two terms are used
    for evaluating DSS in most cases (Udo 1992; Kumar et al. 2011). Two commonly used
    measure of DSS effectiveness are: user satisfaction and system usage, some realistic
    measures of DSS are difficult to measure; in view of this, there will be a need
    to develop an authentic tool to evaluate and assess DSS standards. Future needs
    and perspectives Many studies related to the above topic have been reviewed, and
    it reveals that a lot has been done in area of providing DSS using GIS and to
    deploy it online. Many systems were already performing well online and are displaying
    real-time information. This area of study is multidisciplinary in nature and is
    gaining attention from Irrigation Engineers, System Developers, and Cartographers.
    The real time Web GIS can really be of importance in solving many problems regarding
    irrigation water management, when well-developed can be safe, cheap, and maximize
    profit. Few of the problems faced by the developers were resolved fast; many sophisticated
    and accurate instruments are emerging, that shows the future of Web Map Application
    is limitless. However, despite this breakthrough, there are still few bottlenecks
    that need to be addressed in order to achieve the full potential of these emerging
    systems, especially the real-time information systems. There is a need for standardizing
    development environment and API used, file format for auto feed of data from sensors
    and other equipment (SCADA System) to the database. Other issues are the security,
    marketing of the information, and setting standard to ensure precision in information.
    Nowadays, the most tedious aspect of web GIS DSS is the knowledge base part of
    it, how to develop the conceptual models, and translate it into a workable system
    that can solve a genuine and practical problem. For the Web Map service, there
    are methods coming up to develop and deploy the system online without much tedious
    programming; for instance, the ESRI products like ArcGIS viewer for flex, ArcGIS
    viewer for Silver light, and so on are anticipated in the future. This review
    argues that the current trend in developing and deploying the DSS online will
    be sustained in the future and its application in agricultural water management.
    This brings a revolution in the way irrigation system will be operated especially
    when remote sensing data could be obtained in real time all over the world. Currently
    with heavy deployment of SCADA system, real-time information becomes accessible.
    However, some firms offer commercial services but is expensive, meaning that small-scale
    farmers or farmers in the Third World countries will be at disadvantage and therefore
    will not enjoy this new technology development. But hopefully in the near future,
    it may be cheap and affordable to all, when real-time remote sensing data is made
    available worldwide. Conclusion Sequel to the selected systems developed and presented
    so far, it becomes very clear that different system have different limitations
    and capabilities. Those that used field water balance model did not clearly state
    which of the model was adopted, because water balance model differ with respect
    to location (upland or lowland). Similarly, in the case of the resource selection
    such as open source software or commercial software. The general problems encountered
    by many researchers in developing real-time map service application are: data
    management, Users need and best solutions, data availability, and data validation
    to mention but a few. Also expertise to specific system and choice of technology.
    As technology advances, many of the methodologies will fade out, for example those
    that uses VBA application in ArcMap will face difficulty of migrating to either
    Java or other APIs since the new ArcGIS package such as ArcGIS 10.1 will no longer
    support VBA. Others will face problem with some open source, as they may no longer
    exist in the future. These are few challenges that should be taken care of when
    considering developing web GIS applications. Another sensitive issue which the
    developers of map service application may face in the future is the issue of user''s
    security and privacy. Users’ private information and some sensitive information
    may be displayed and can easily be downloaded or accessed. Web base GIS and Public
    participation web GIS will soon be a norm, and that will curb farm input losses
    due to lack of real-time information in irrigation. Acknowledgments We wish to

  description: A case study on a gate-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) starting
    from the delivery of germinated seeds to the production of oil palm seedling in
    an oil palm nursery was carried out. The oil palm nursery, located in Selangor
    and licensed by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) was selected for this study.
    One oil palm seedling was the defined functional unit. The environmental impact
    from activities in the nursery were determined from the input and output into
    and from the processing steps in the nursery. The LCA study was conducted in accordance
    with the procedural framework ISO 14040 - 14044 series of the International Organisation
    of Standardisation (ISO). The purpose of the study was to obtain a life cycle
    inventory (LCI) of input and output associated with the production of one oil
    palm seedling and to provide a comprehensive picture of the environmental impact
    associated with production of one oil palm seedling in the nursery, by applying
    the LCA methodology. Inventory data collection consists of the input of raw materials
    and energy such as polybags, fertilisers, pesticides, diesel, pipes and petrol
    for transportation and irrigation. Real time measurement of gas and greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions from the pump for irrigation in the nursery was also carried
    out. The results show that the LCA methodology is suitable for assessing the environmental
    impact associated with oil palm seedling production.

  description: A lack of real-time soil or plant status feedback and decision support
    systems has been a major stumbling block to the practical use of precision or
    site-specific irrigation and chemigation technologies. Data are needed on both
    a spatial and a temporal scale. It was hypothesized that an array of infrared
    thermometers, mounted on a center pivot, could provide this missing spatial and
    temporal feedback as they move over the entire field at regular intervals throughout
    the season. This was tested in a field of soybeans with varying degrees of induced
    water stresses in 2004 and 2005. Infrared thermometers were used to create canopy
    temperature maps of the underlying field every time the pivot moved over the field.
    These maps were standardized and combined into a single map for each year using
    an algorithm modeled after that used to combine multiple years of yield maps.
    These end-of-year maps for each year clearly showed stressed areas of the field.
    The combined, averaged, and standardized temperatures from the end-of-year maps
    were correlated with the end-of-year yield, biomass, and total water use in the
    different stressed plots for both years, resulting in r 2 values close to 0.8.
    These average, standardized temperatures were also significantly different across
    irrigation treatments in 2004. This demonstrates the method's ability to show
    spatial stress patterns in a field. To capture temporal variation and to highlight
    when temperature differences were caused by more than natural variation, statistical
    process control (SPC) charts were used to evaluate each point on the standardized
    temperature maps over time. Stress was deliberately introduced to a particular
    area of the field late in the 2005 season, and although the stress was not visible
    to the eye, this stressed area was clearly apparent in the SPC charts. These data
    demonstrate the ability of an array of infrared thermometers mounted on a center
    pivot to provide producers with feedback on both the spatial and temporal variability
    of a field during a growing season.

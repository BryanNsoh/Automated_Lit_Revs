    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and

    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    • Light intensity, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and air temperature
    were selected as input neurons. • A 4-8-1 back propagation (BP) neural network
    yielded the MSE equal to 0.00857724 and R equal to 0.98963. • Used computational
    fluid dynamics (CFD) software to simulate the shapes of a comb, fish bone and
    the letter H. • The drip irrigation pipe network in the H-shaped arrangement was
    more suitable for field crop irrigation. Abstract There is a global shortage of
    fresh water to meet the clean production of field crops. Water-saving irrigation
    can increase the production of field crops, but under certain conditions it can
    be overly water-saving and unsustainable, particularly in complex terrains in
    China where there is already a shortage of water resources. In light of the insufficient
    water resources and partial inequality in China, several investigators in China
    and abroad have researched irrigation nozzles and pumps, but there is little information
    on the impact of the environment on crop irrigation. The purpose of this study
    was to provide a fast and effective crop water demand prediction model to estimate
    the water requirement during the growth period of crops, to achieve the purpose
    of applying water according to the demand of the crops, and to optimize the irrigation
    network to determine the optimal network structure in order to reduce irrigation
    energy consumption in the process. Specifically, this study analyzed the environmental
    factors, namely, the soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, air temperature,
    and light intensity, affecting the physiological water demand of field crops.
    Relevant sensors were used in the field, and environmental information was collected.
    This study used the collected environmental data to build a water demand prediction
    model based on the back propagation (BP) neural network. It also carried out optimized
    layout and hydrodynamic analyses of the drip irrigation network and identified
    the best pipe network arrangement. On the basis of the BP neural network, the
    remarkable R amount of 0.98963 was obtained for the water demand prediction model.
    The mean square error (MSE) value was 0.00857724. We also found that the drip
    irrigation pipe network in the H-shaped arrangement was more suitable for field
    crop irrigation than the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped arrangements. This study
    employed the common field crops in China as the research object, used the wireless
    sensing technology to obtain the field environment information quickly, and constructed
    a water demand prediction model with high prediction accuracy. Finally, this study
    realized the precise control of field crop irrigation, reduced the waste of agricultural
    water, and achieved sustainable field crop production. Previous article in issue

    optimizationPrecision irrigation 1. Introduction Water is an indispensable element
    for crop growth. However, there are significant differences in the response mechanisms
    of field crops at different stages of growth and development to water (Chukalla
    et al., 2017). Presently, agricultural irrigation accounts for approximately 70%
    of total freshwater in the world, and this value is even higher in many developing
    countries (He et al., 2014) The annual agricultural irrigation water shortage
    exceeds three thousand M (million) cubic meters, and approximately one hundred
    M mu of irrigated area is not irrigated due to the lack of water in China (Li
    et al., 2014). On the other hand, the utilization ratio of irrigation water is
    low in China, and the effective utilization index of the entire region is less
    than 40% (Chen et al., 2014). In order to produce more food under limited resources,
    such as water and soil, it is necessary to achieve clean production by efficient
    water-saving technologies. To achieve precise irrigation, many investigators have
    tested crop water demand prediction methods. The fuzzy prediction method predicts
    water quality results to ensure the use of high quality water for crop production
    (Nadiri et al., 2018). The multi-scale relevance vector regression method decomposes
    the historical time series of the daily water supply into different scales to
    realize the accurate prediction of urban daily water demand (Eslamian et al.,
    2016). A parallel global optimization model was proposed to optimize the hyper
    parameters of support vector machine (SVM) regression and to provide accurate
    water demand prediction in a short-term range (Ghalehkhondabi et al., 2017). Although
    each water demand prediction method has its own advantages, there are disadvantages
    that cannot be eliminated under certain conditions. With the development of computer
    technology, artificial neural networks can effectively improve these situations.
    The artificial neural network is an algorithmic mathematical model that mimics
    the behavioral characteristics of animal neural networks and processes distributed
    parallel information (Taghavifar et al., 2016). The application of neural networks
    is mostly concentrated in the fields of urban management, meteorology, and resource
    monitoring. The data sources in these fields are relatively simple to obtain,
    and the implementation departments are sufficiently funded. The water company
    combines the neural network technology and a Fourier time series process to construct
    a near-real water demand model, which strengthens the management of the water
    resources (Brentan et al., 2017). According to the historical monthly rainfall
    and climate index, a rainfall prediction model based on a mixed wavelet neural
    network was established, which improved the accuracy of the monthly rainfall forecast
    in Australia (He et al., 2015). The Korea Meteorological Administration has established
    an effective deep learning neural network model using remote sensing satellite
    data, which can quickly realize soil drought on the Korean Peninsula (Lee et al.,
    2019). In cases of an irregular relationship between the input and output layers
    of the neuron, and a sufficient sample size of the training, the artificial neural
    network algorithm can completely solve the problem of the disordered relations
    in a wide range of fields (Feng et al., 2016). Because the farmland environment
    is complex and changeable, it is difficult to obtain environmental information,
    so the neural network technology is seldomly used in agriculture. This study used
    wireless sensing technology to remotely collect and transmit field environmental
    information and the BP neural network method to predict the water demand of field
    crops and to improve the shortcomings of the traditional BP neural network that
    employed the Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm. Several studies reported improvements
    in the irrigation of field crops. Soil dynamics during the growth of each crop
    under conditions of reclaimed drip irrigation have been investigated. It was found
    that the shortening of the irrigation period and the increasing of the drip irrigation
    depth improved the crop yield and the efficient use of water (Lu et al., 2016).
    The overall irrigation uniformity of the irrigation system was also improved by
    optimizing the structural design of the nozzle (Ji et al., 2017). Combining photovoltaic
    technology with irrigation pump design, the problems of large consumption energy
    and low efficiency of the traditional irrigation pump were improved (Hossain et
    al., 2015). For studies on irrigation nozzles and pumps, it is very profitable
    to improve the irrigation of field crops, but there are issues relating to prolonged
    research periods and high promotion costs. This study will optimize the design
    of the most basic pipe network layout, explore the optimal layout form of pipe
    network, and improve the uniformity of irrigation. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Analysis of the water requirement law for field crops Wheat, maize, and rice are
    the main field crops suitable for growth in China. Crops at different stages of
    growth require different amounts of water. This is determined by the meteorological
    conditions, crop characteristics, soil properties, and agricultural technical
    measures in the current season. This study accumulated water demand data from
    field crops for each reproductive period from many years of research at the Tongzhou
    Experimental Station (39°42′14.44″N, 116°41′20.07″E). The experimental station
    was situated in a continental monsoon climate zone. It was affected by winter
    and summer monsoons, and it had the characteristics of drought and wind conditions
    during the spring, heat and rain conditions during the summer, bright conditions
    during the autumn, and cold and dry conditions during the winter. The annual average
    temperature was 11.3 °C, and the precipitation was approximately 620 mm. The most
    widely used current crop water demand calculation was the Penman-FAO formula.
    This formula can calculate the crop water demand with standard meteorological
    data with high accuracy and good comparability (Liu et al., 2017). In this study,
    the water demand of the crop was estimated by the Penman-FAO formula using the
    previous year''s meteorological data recorded by the experimental station. The
    freshwater used for irrigation completely conformed to the water quality standards
    for farmland irrigation in China. The trend of changes in the water demand for
    the main field crops of spring wheat, summer maize, and summer rice are shown
    in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (246KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Changing demand of field crops for water. The changing demand of
    field crops for water showed an increasing trend, followed by a decreasing trend.
    At the early stages of crop growth, the seedlings grew slowly, and the water demand
    was low. After the growth of the plants and expansion of the root system, the
    water demand increased sharply, peaking at the middle and late stages of fertility.
    At the late stages of crop growth, the plant stems and leaves withered, and the
    water demand decreased. During the cold winter months when metabolic processes
    and enzymatic reactions were suppressed, the water demand was low. 2.2. Analysis
    of environmental factors in the field Crops have specific requirements, including
    light, temperature, water, fertilizer, gases, and other environmental factors,
    for growth (Biernath et al., 2011). In this study, the effects of these environmental
    factors on the water demand of field crops were analyzed in view of the fact that
    this information may provide new insights on improving crop production. Environmental
    factors that affected the water demand of field crops are shown in Fig. 2. Download

    Common environmental factors in the field. (a) Temperature indirectly affected
    the uptake of water by affecting leaf transpiration in plants. With increasing
    temperatures, enzymatic reactions accelerated, and the water demand increased.
    Only in this way can field crops meet the need for normal metabolic activities.
    Furthermore, the effect of temperature on leaf transpiration increased with the
    increase of water in the soil. (b) Water in the soil also affected the demand
    of field crops for water. Soils are graded according to their ability to retain
    moisture, namely, minimum humidity, maximum humidity, and optimum humidity (Jemai
    et al., 2013). At the most suitable humidity range, crop growth was robust. At
    the lowest and highest humidity ranges, enzymatic activity and plant growth was
    reduced or halted. (c) Light intensity is a manifestation of solar radiation.
    The longer the exposure time of the field crops to solar radiation, the higher
    the temperature of the crops and soil and the higher the rate of leaf transpiration,
    which increased the demand for water. Solar radiation also increased the kinetic
    energy of the water in the field crops, thereby activating the water molecules
    and increasing their diffusion. (d) Electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil is
    a measurement of the total concentration of soluble minerals. High conductivity
    was indicative of a high concentration of soluble minerals. Reverse osmosis occurred
    when the electrical conductivity of the soil matrix was too high, which replaced
    the water in the roots and turned the root tips dry or brown. Fluctuating moisture
    levels further worsened the high salt content, thereby causing serious damage
    to the roots and affecting their ability to absorb water and nutrients. (e) Other
    factors included the carbon dioxide concentration, wind speed, and soil pH. The
    carbon dioxide concentration induced a significant increase in the number of stomata,
    thereby increasing the rate of leaf transpiration and the demand for water. Wind
    speed increased the airflow, which intensified the diffusion of water molecules,
    the evaporation of soil water, and the transpiration of water from leaves. It
    also increased the demand for water. The soil pH affected the concentration of
    nutrients and indirectly affected the absorption of water by the roots of the
    field crops. 2.3. Study on the environmental factor acquisition and transmission
    scheme in the field Excluding the environmental factors that had little effects
    on the water demand of field crops, and taking into consideration the hardware
    constraints of the test base, this experiment used a sensor-integrated instrument
    developed by us to measure the soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, air
    temperature, and light intensity in the field (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res

    The collected environmental data was transmitted to the cloud server via wireless
    sensor technology, a general packet wireless service, and the Internet, which
    allowed the data to be viewed by real-time monitoring of the field environment
    (Xiao et al., 2017). The data transmission scheme was carried out using ZigBee
    and GPRS wireless transmission methods (Fig. 4). The ZigBee wireless sensor network
    used the 2.4 GHz direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) physical layer frequency
    band to support a rate of 250 kb/s in the air. If the transmission distance was
    long, it was expanded with multiple ZigBee routers. The GPRS wireless sensor network
    was mainly used for data transmission between the aggregation terminal and the
    server. The coordinator was connected to a computer through a wireless communication
    protocol, and the collected real-time environmental data was uploaded to the web
    terminal server. Download : Download high-res image (422KB) Download : Download

    test of the packet loss rate for sensor acquisition and transmission In the actual
    field layout, the environment was relatively harsh, and the long-term unattended,
    data transmission distance was far, so this study tested the remote transmission
    loss rate of the sensors in the experimental field. The test results are shown

    in Table 1, the sensor had a large packet loss rate in the months of March and
    April, and the packet loss rate of the soil moisture sensor and the soil EC value
    sensor reached 39.02%. At the test field, the soil moisture sensor and the soil
    EC value sensor were scattered on the ground and failed to be correctly inserted
    into the ground. After re-commissioning, the packet loss rate of the four sensors
    was significantly reduced, which met the stability and reliability of the wireless
    transmission requirements. Each sensor was arranged for eight in the field to
    ensure that the sensor was not contaminated and did not cause system errors. 3.
    Prediction model of water demand for field crops 3.1. Fusion processing of collected
    data Accurate and reliable data collection ensures the precise prediction of water
    demand in the field. Data is often discontinuous due to the variety and the large
    amount of data collected. The joint Kalman filter algorithm uses the principle
    of information allocation to realize the optimal synthesis of multi-sensor information,
    so that the entire system has both high precision and certain fault tolerance,
    which ensures the best possible performance. Therefore, we adopted fusion processing
    and used the joint Kalman filter algorithm (Fig. 5), which calculates the magnitude
    of the data immediately after the sensor node obtains the data (the data remains
    unprocessed before applying the joint Kalman filter algorithm). This method can
    effectively eliminate the abnormal values and discontinuities in the wireless
    sensor measurements to generate accurate and reliable data. Download : Download

    processing structure. After selecting the appropriate joint Kalman filter algorithm,
    the fusion process goes through three stages. (a) Setting thresholds for the environmental
    parameters: The optimal humidity for field crop growth was in the range of 50–70%.
    For example, the soil moisture content was measured, and the value was set as
    the threshold for data fusion processing. If the collected data was not within
    the threshold range, the targeted culling of the data was not fused. If the collected
    data was within the threshold range, the data was de-noised by the Kalman filter
    algorithm, and then transmitted to the end of the aggregation. (b) Constructing
    the joint Kalman filtering mathematical model (S. J. Majumdar et al., 2001): The
    local state of the filter was expressed as Eq. (1): (1) The local measurement
    was expressed as Eq. (2): (2) was the time-varying state transition matrix, was
    the state vector at time k, and was the system interference matrix. was the model
    noise vector. It was considered as Gaussian white noise with zero mean and a variance
    matrix of . In the formula, was the observation vector at time k, was the observation
    matrix, and was the measurement noise vector. The local filter algorithm was expressed
    as Eqs. (3), (4), (5), (6), (7)). (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Eqs. (3), (4), (5), (6),
    (7)) represent the recursion calculation method of the local filter. was the gain
    matrix at the moment k+1, was the filter value of the covariance matrix of the
    state vector at the moment k+1, and was the state filter value at the moment k+1.
    Eqs. (8), (9)) represent the main filter algorithms. Xm and Pm are the final global
    filtering values. (8) (9) (c) Reprocessing of the weighted average fusion data:
    After filtering the data, we used the weighted average algorithm to carry out
    the two data fusion. The weighted average method was expressed as Eq. (10): (10)
    zi was the data value requiring weighted fusion, wi was the corresponding weight,
    and y was the weighted average value, which was the final data transmitted by
    the soil moisture sensor. Utilizing the same data fusion processing process, the
    fused soil moisture, air temperature, light intensity, and soil EC values were
    obtained. The fused data were transferred to the server database to construct
    the subsequent water demand prediction model. 3.2. Construction of the BP neural
    network water demand prediction model based on L-M improvement To address the
    lack of irrigation quantity control in the planting of field crops, this study
    applied a more appropriate BP neural network method to predict the field crop
    water demand on the basis of the combined Kalman Filter Fusion processing of the
    multi-sensor acquired and monitoring data. In light of the shortcomings of the
    traditional BP neural network algorithm, which included a slow convergence speed,
    an easy to fall into local minimum, and a difficulty in determining the optimized
    network structure, we constructed an improved BP neural network water demand prediction
    model based on L-M algorithm optimization (Kermani et al., 2005). The objective
    function of the L-M improved algorithm was expressed as Eq. (11): (11) The gradient
    formula of f(x) was expressed as Eqs. (12), (13)): (12) (13) The weight adjustment
    formula of the L-M algorithm was expressed as Eq. (14): (14) In Eq. (14), e was
    the error vector, J was the Jacobi matrix of error for the weight differential,
    and it was a scalar. Upon its increase, it approached the steepest descent method
    with a slower learning rate. Upon its decrease to zero, the algorithm became a
    smooth harmonic between the Gauss-Newton methods. The BP neural network, which
    was markedly improved by the L-M algorithm, reduced the oscillation, increased
    the convergence of the network, and optimized the connection weights and thresholds
    between the layers. The improved BP algorithm that processed the flow by the L-M
    is shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (305KB) Download : Download

    design of the BP network based on L-M improvement In this study, we used MATLAB
    to normalize the input data. On the basis of the normalized data range, the S
    and PURELINE functions were selected as the transfer functions between the layers,
    and TRAINLM was selected as the training function. NEWFF was used to establish
    the prediction model for the water demand of the field crops. The complete BP

    maize, and it was harvested from May 18th to September 24th for a total of 130
    days. Therefore, we used maize to construct the BP neural network structure. The
    light intensity, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and air temperature
    was collected and used as the neurons of the input layer of the BP network. Thus,
    the number of neurons in the input layer was four. During the irrigation test,
    the amount of irrigation water was determined according to the crop water demand
    calculated by the Penman-FAO formula. The water demand of the field crops was
    used as the nerve element of the output layer of the BP network input layer, so
    the number of neurons in the output layer was one. The data are shown in Table
    2. Table 2. Training sample of maize growth period (partial data). Collection

    141 68 1497 30.1 214 Because the sample training data had maximal and minimal
    values, the linear function was used to normalize the data to the same dimension
    in this study. The normalized formula was expressed as Eq. (15): (15) The sample
    values ranged from 0.1 to 0.9, and the reference value fell within this range.
    Thus, the TANSIG function was adopted to determine the transfer function of the
    input layer of the BP network. At present, there is no best method for determining
    the precise number of hidden layer neurons. Based on the Kolmogorov theorem, this
    study calculated the range of the number of neurons of the hidden layer in combination
    with the known number of input layers and output layer neurons (Ismailov, 2014).
    The verification was trained one by one in this range to determine the optimal
    number of hidden layer neurons. The initial calculation range of the number of
    neurons in the hidden layer was between 2 and 13. The trial and error method was
    used to determine the number of neurons in the hidden layer (Table 3). Table 3.

    and the mean variance was the lowest when the number of hidden layer neurons was
    8. Thus, the number of hidden layer elements in the BP neural network was 8, and
    the structure of the BP neural network with 4-8-1 in the process of maize growth
    was determined (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (40KB) Download :

    full-size image Fig. 9. BP neural network training information. Fig. 9 shows that
    the BP neural network model based on the L-M improvement had fewer training iterations,
    a faster convergence rate, and samples with smaller errors. The mean square error
    (MSE) value was 0.00857724, and the overall network structure training effect
    was good. In addition, correlation and regression analyses of the BP neural network
    model were based on the L-M improvement (Fig. 9(d)). The correlation coefficient
    between the BP neural network output and target output in the maize growth period
    was 0.98963, and the corresponding water demand prediction model in the maize
    growth period showed high precision. A new set of data verified the predicted
    and actual irrigation values. The collection time was from July 2, 2018 to July
    31, 2018. This period belonged to the jointing stage of maize, as the field irrigation
    time was longer. The field environmental acquisition indicators were light intensity,
    soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and air temperature, and they were
    collected at 10:00 a.m. each day. The new data was imported into the model for
    calculation, and comparisons between the water demand prediction value and the
    actual field irrigation value are shown in Table 4. The simulation results are
    shown in Fig. 10. To predict the water demand in the jointing stage of maize,
    the maximum relative error was 11.47%. The minimum relative error was 0.1%. The
    average relative error was 2.11%. The correlation coefficient R2 was 0.963. Thus,
    the predicted water demand was accurate and reliable. Table 4. New data collected

    prediction value and the actual field irrigation value of maize. In practical
    applications, the input parameters of the crop water demand prediction model were
    the environmental parameters of the field. The input parameters in this study
    were light intensity, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and air temperature.
    The output parameter of the model was the crop water requirement. In order to
    know the water demand of the crop in the next period, it was necessary to input
    the environmental parameters corresponding to the next time, so the field had
    to be equipped with the environmental data acquisition equipment. This will slightly
    increase the cost of crop production. Regardless, the established water demand
    model can be applied to areas with stable climates. For fields with too many climate
    differences or for those that are too far away from the experimental site, it
    will be necessary to re-collect the field data of the area for modeling to achieve
    the forecasted crop water requirement according to local conditions. 5. Optimization
    analysis of the irrigation scheme based on water demand forecasting 5.1. Irrigation
    process design Water is a physiological need of all field crops, and irrigation
    represents the amount of water applied to field crops. Theoretically, the amount
    of irrigation should equal the predicted water demand. Due to the hierarchical
    layout of the irrigation pipe network, there was a loss in irrigation, and the
    amount of water delivered to the roots of the field crops was smaller than the
    predicted amount in the field. The optimized irrigation process is shown in Fig.

    Fig. 11. Field irrigation process based on water demand prediction. The BP neural
    network water demand prediction model was used to calculate the predicted value,
    which served as the reference. The manual or automatic irrigation mode was selected.
    Taking into account the loss of head during the irrigation process, we set the
    irrigation amount to 110% of the predicted water demand based on expert or empirical
    values. For the manual irrigation mode, the irrigation volume was manually entered,
    and then the irrigation valve was opened. For the automatic mode, it was necessary
    to determine whether the current water demand value was greater than the historical
    water demand value. If the historical water demand value was greater, the irrigation
    amount was automatically generated, and then the irrigation valve was opened.
    If the historical water demand value was smaller, the system continued to compare
    the current water demand value with the historical water demand value. The status
    of the water volume predicted the value. The irrigation value was closed when
    the controlled irrigation amount was reached. 5.2. Drip irrigation pipe network
    planning optimization Drip irrigation is presently used in field settings. Based
    on the area and aspect ratio of the irrigated field, we scaled the drip irrigation
    pipe network structure and used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to
    simulate the shapes of a comb, fish bone and the letter H (Fig. 12). The three
    drip irrigation pipe networks were arranged on a flat field, and the water flow
    was under equal gravity conditions in the irrigation pipe. Thereafter, we analyzed
    the changes in the velocity and pressure of the water flow in the irrigation pipes,
    compared the energy loss of the three irrigation pipe layouts, and selected the
    best drip irrigation pipe network layout for planning and optimization. Download

    Three types of drip irrigation pipe networks. 6. Results and discussion Three
    types of drip irrigation pipe network layouts were selected for CFD analysis of
    the equal proportional scaling structure. The inlet speed was 3 m/s, the main
    stream diameter was 5 mm, and the outlet fluid conditions were set to static pressure.
    The tributary diameter was 3 mm, the eight outlets were numbered according to
    the distance from the entrance, and the mesh partition unit was a tetrahedron.
    The three irrigation units were meshed using ANSYS software. The meshing effect

    irrigation units were simulated using the (SST) k – ω turbulence model. The velocity
    vector was calculated, and the velocity cloud and pressure cloud maps of the water
    flow in the three layouts were generated (Fig. 14). The velocity vector direction
    of the comb-shaped pipe network was the worst and that of the H-shaped pipe network
    was the best. With regard to the velocity, the high-speed concentration area of
    the fish bone-shaped pipe network was the largest, and that of the H-shaped pipe
    network was the smallest. With regard to the pressure, the number of negative
    pressure zones in the comb-shaped pipe network was the largest, and that of the
    H-shaped pipe network was the smallest. Download : Download high-res image (355KB)

    of the eight outlets were linearly fitted and analyzed (Fig. 15). Fig. 15 shows
    that the slope and residual norm of the velocity fitting equation at the exit
    of fish bone-shaped pipe network was the largest, indicating that the velocity
    uniformity of the eight outlets was the worst. Furthermore, the slope and residual
    norm of the velocity fitting equation at the exit of the H-shaped pipe network
    was the smallest, indicating that the velocity uniformity of the eight outlets
    was the best. In terms of the pressure variations, the slope of the pressure fitting
    equation at the outlet of the comb-shaped pipe network and the residual norm was
    the largest, indicating that the pressure uniformity at the eight outlets was
    the worst. The pressure at the outlet of the H-shaped pipe network was 0, indicating
    that the pressure uniformity at the eight outlets was the same. Download : Download

    outlet velocity and pressure. For internal flow fluid and outlet velocity analyses
    of the three types of pipe network layouts, the velocity vector direction of the
    H-shaped pipe network was consistent, the high-speed concentrated area was small,
    and the number of negative pressure zones was also small, which reduced energy
    consumption during irrigation. At the same time, the uniformity of the velocity
    and pressure at the outlet of H-shaped pipe network was good, which better guaranteed
    the scheduled irrigation and improved its efficiency. Because the experimental
    field belonged to the flat terrain, the drip irrigation pipe network with the
    H-shaped arrangement was more suitable for field crop irrigation in the flat field
    area. For field crop irrigation in the hilly fields and hillside topography in
    southern China, the advantages of the H-shaped drip irrigation pipe network layout
    need to be verified. 7. Conclusion With the increasing demand for field crop production,
    the demand for agricultural water is gradually increasing. To address the issue
    of supply and demand, the Chinese government has promulgated the 13 No 1 Central
    Document, which requires water-saving irrigation as a major strategic move. In
    light of this, we proposed precision irrigation as a sustainable water-saving
    approach for the production of field crops in China focusing on water demand prediction
    and irrigation scheme optimization. This study showed that the remarkable R amount
    of 0.98963 was obtained for the water demand prediction model based on the BP
    neural network. The mean square error (MSE) value was 0.00857724. Thus, the model
    can be applied to regions with stable climates, and it has a good application
    effect. For fields with too many climate differences or for those that are too
    far away from the experimental site, it is necessary to re-collect the field data
    of the area for modeling to achieve the forecasted crop water requirement according
    to local conditions. The velocity vector direction of the H-shaped pipe network
    was consistent, and the high-speed concentrated area and the negative pressure
    zones were small, which reduced energy consumption during irrigation. The uniformity
    of the velocity and pressure at the outlet of H-shaped pipe network was good,
    indicating that it could better guarantee the scheduled irrigation effect and
    improve the irrigation efficiency. It can be applied to flat terrains in most
    parts of China. For field crop irrigation in the hilly fields and hillside topography
    in southern China, the advantages of H-shaped drip irrigation pipe network layout
    need to be verified. How to make use of the limited farmland to meet the increasing
    food demand of mankind at the lowest environmental cost is key to solving today''s
    problem of food scarcity in the world. The application of the BP neural network
    and CFD technology has shown great potential in solving the problem of precision
    irrigation and pipe network optimization. The results of the optimal design of
    the irrigation pipe network obtained from the CFD technology are also exploratory.
    To achieve the clean production of field crops, further research should be carried
    out to evaluate the amount of application as well as to introduce advanced unmanned
    aerial vehicle, spectral, and image recognition technologies. Acknowledgements

    \ resources need of the country. Precision Agriculture \n(PA) with Internet of\
    \ Things and Wireless Sensor Network is a transformation from traditional farming\
    \ to smart farming. \nWireless sensor networks and Internet of Things are considered\
    \ as drivers to develop system which can change agriculture \nsector from manual\
    \ to automatic. Advancement in the technology have pushed the growth of precision\
    \ agriculture to very large \nextent despite of several challenges faced in this\
    \ area. System for precision agriculture relies on hardware components mainly\
    \ \nwireless sensors which act as a source for gathering of real time data. Depending\
    \ upon the real time date retrieved by sensors \nautomation in agriculture is\
    \ done by adopting decision-based system. With Precision agriculture productivity\

    \ \n  \n1. Introduction  \nIndia has 16% of world papulation but have 4% of world’s\
    \ fresh water resources out of which 80% is used \nfor agriculture [1]. India\
    \ is known as agricultural country as 80% of its rural papulation have agriculture\
    \ as their \nsource of livelihood [2]. Many states of India have their agriculture\
    \ totally dependent on rainfall due to very less \navailability of freshwater.\
    \ This shortage of freshwater supply demands paradigm shift to productivity per\
    \ unit of \nwater. In various economic surveys done in past five years it is indicated\
    \ that adoption of advancement in \ntechnologies is required to make agriculture\
    \ sector sustainable for small and marginal farmers. Climatic changes \nthat are\
    \ affecting country in various ways, are going to lower farmer’s income further\
    \ by 25%. Three factors \nunder climate change pointed are decline in average\
    \ rainfall, rise in temperature and more dry days. India’s 73.2 \nmillion hectares\
    \ area is still unirrigated area and only rainfall dependent out of 141.4 million\
    \ hectares net sown \narea. Economic Survey alerted and recommended the requirement\
    \ for “dramatic” improvement in irrigation by \ninvolving new technologies [3].\
    \ In traditional farming irrigation is either done by manual observation of farmer\
    \ \nor it is scheduled irrigation. Additionally, water overuse can cause water\
    \ shortage, often occurs in areas of \nirrigation agriculture, and harms the environment.\
    \ Present scenario demands novel technology for increasing the \ncrop productivity,\
    \ and a technology to reduce the water consumption for irrigation. This is clearly\
    \ indicating a \ntransformation of traditional farming to Precision agriculture.\
    \ Precision Agriculture (PA) not only increases crop \nyield and revenues but\
    \ also involves methods which are very environment friendly. Precision agriculture\
    \ is a way \nof farming which is done by considering all the elements related\
    \ to soil moisture and temperature, environment \ndetails like temperature, humidity\
    \ and rate of evaporation measured by technology-based devices. Precision \nagriculture\
    \ is done more precisely on the basis of what is required, when is required and\
    \ where is required in the \nfarm. Precision farming is a technique of farming\
    \ that changes the use of pesticides and fertilizers to evaluate the \nvariation\
    \ in the growth conditions within the agriculture field. This way of practice\
    \ is termed as Site Specific \nManagement (SSM) [4]. This way it reduces the amount\
    \ of chemicals released into the environment. Precision \nagriculture also helps\
    \ in reducing the requirement of man power which further helps farmers to have\
    \ more \neconomic benefits. Advancement in Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics,\
    \ Artificial Intelligence and Internet of \nthings are very helpful to attain\
    \ Precision agriculture. This review paper is focused on Internet of things and\
    \ \nvarious techniques used in this field to agriculture technology based. \n\
    \  2. Precision Agriculture \nPrecision agriculture is management of farming on\
    \ basis of observation, measurement and decision-based \nsystem. First revolution\
    \ of precision agriculture started with use machinery in place of manpower and\
    \ farming \nwith help of animals. This revolution happened in early 19s (1900-1930).\
    \ Second wave started with green \nrevolution which enhanced agriculture on the\
    \ basis genetics which led to precise plantation. Presently, third wave \nof revolution\
    \ is going on which came into implementation in 1980 with the advanced technologies\
    \ in agriculture \n[5]. The main focus of the review article is to study various\
    \ methods opted by different researchers in past five \nyears for smart farming.\
    \ Various technologies that are helping different researchers are Big Data Analytics,\
    \ Cloud \nComputing, Internet of Things, Wireless sensor network, Artificial intelligence,\
    \ Image processing using \nRana Gill  a, and Dr. Paras Chawla b \n \n132  \nComputer\
    \ vision and many more. These technologies are helping to transform traditional\
    \ farming to precision \nagriculture at very fast pace. Various technologies used\
    \ in precision agriculture are shown below in figure1 [6]. \n \nFig. 1.  Overview\
    \ of Precision Agriculture Technologies \nThis article is framed to cover only\
    \ those research article which Internet of things based. The survey presents \n\
    the idea of Precision agriculture with various innovations from its cause, various\
    \ technologies and their up-\ngradations ideas. Precision Agriculture utilizes\
    \ Internet of things (IoT) arrangements to increase productivity \nwhile reducing\
    \ water consumption, manpower required and saving environment. In the early stages,\
    \ Precision \nagriculture consisted mostly of map-based technologies using geo\
    \ statistical methods such as GIS and satellite \nbased remote sensing. And main\
    \ focus was to apply to control fertilizer use. Earlier sensors were not commonly\
    \ \nused because of high cost, unreliable or unavailable for necessary applications.\
    \ Precision agriculture got started \nin its third wave during 1980s but till\
    \ early 2000s not adopted by many farmers. The key obstacles to the adoption \n\
    of such approaches were the lack of technology, lack of scientific evidence, no\
    \ training and high cost [7]. \nDecreased sensors cost and rapid Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) and Big data growth lead to development and testing \nof more PA system.\
    \ IoT works in form of cycle that firstly do monitoring with the help of sensor,\
    \ analysis of \ninformation gathered and then control [8]. Further by involving\
    \ Big data Analytics and machine learning decision \nmaking system can be designed\
    \ [9].  \n2.1 Internet of Things \nIn agriculture the Internet of Things is about\
    \ cameras, sensors and other smart devices to get data from every \naction in\
    \ farm. Internet of things helps to build smart farming in various forms like\
    \ sensing, watermanagement to \nincrease crop yield, determine fertizer requirement,\
    \ finding optimal time for planatation and harveting and \nweather conditions.\
    \ IoT is a type of enviornment in which objects can transmit data over internet\
    \ without or with \nminimal human interventation [10]. The IoT is designed around\
    \ various wireless radio standards which are \nresponsible for interaction of\
    \ different devices with each other through the Internet. It comprises many standards\
    \ \nlike Zigbee, Bluetooth, LoWPAN, Wi-Fi ,NFC, Z WAVE, RFID, and so on. Physical\
    \ object which collects and \nprocesses data that it receives about the enviornment\
    \ [11]. These objects are built with sensors, actuators, \nmicrocontrollers and\
    \ transceivers. The irrigation requirements can easily be automated by the IoT-\
    \ driven decision \nsupport system (DSS). In [22] authors proposed system to transmit\
    \ information through the internet with the help \nof internet of things The IoT\
    \ allows devices to control remotely or sense physical environmental factors using\
    \ \nsensor nodes. The user interface is generated with the help of an Android\
    \ app. The data gathered by the sensor \nnodes propagates following tree topology\
    \ to reach the base station. Arduino UNO and nodeMCU are used for \ntransmission\
    \ and soring the data collected to the cloud. Developed Android app enables the\
    \ access of an \ninformation uploaded to the cloud.  \nVarious technologies are\
    \ growing under internet of things and many methods are proposed and implemented\
    \ \nby various researchers in recent years. \n 2.1.1 Wireless Sensor Network \
    \ \nWireless sensor Networks help in shift from traditional farming to smart farming.\
    \ Research on Precision \nagriculture from basic climate information, soil information\
    \ to decision support system for irrigation are \ndependent on collection of data\
    \ by wireless sensors. The wireless sensor system not only improves crop \nproductivity\
    \ but also helps in saving environment in various forms [12].  A WSN usually consists\
    \ of many multi- \nfunctional sensor nodes that are deployed in a interested field.\
    \ With the recent advancements these nodes are of \nlow cost, less power consumption\
    \ and small in size. In spite of miniature structure these nodes are provisioned\
    \ \nwith sensors, microcontrollers, and radio transceivers. These nodes have capability\
    \ to sense the data, process it \nand capable to communicate it. These nodes are\
    \ capable to communicate over short distance via wireless mode \nTh\ne \nMo\n\

    \ \n133  \nof communication. Wireless communication standards plays an important\
    \ role for normal functioning of wireless \nsensor network. Various techniques\
    \ are designed at physical layer and protocols are followed at higher layers for\
    \ \neffective working of wireless sensor network. Nodes are generally categorises\
    \ as a source node and  a sink or \ngateway node. The collection of data is done\
    \ by source node and receiving of data is by sink or gateway node. In \nterms\
    \ of computational power sink nodes have higher power in comparison to a source\
    \ node. While choosing \nwireless nodes constraints faced are size, data rate,\
    \ memory and power consumption. In [13] comparison of sensor \nnodes used in precision\
    \ agriculture is done with their specification and it is considered that MICA2\
    \ is more \nsuitable due to its capability to connect with many sensors  with\
    \ help of its large expansion connectors. In recent \nmany ways are opted by different\
    \ researchers to apply wireless sensor network to agriculture. In [14] method\
    \ \nproposed to monitor agriculture environment was based on smart wireless sensor\
    \ network. They design an \narchitecture by deploying various nodes in the agriculture\
    \ area. Then collected data was analysed and displaying \nit to end user. Similarly,\
    \ In [15] authors  proposed a technique which applies on top surface of the soil\
    \ in two \ndomains namely time and space to monitor variation in soil moisture\
    \ content. This experiment has conducted by \nconsidering twenty seven different\
    \ locations where wireless sensor nodes have deployed. To collect real-time \n\
    data multi hope configuration has been used. In [16] paper has wireless sensor\
    \ network based smart system used \nin a red bayberry greenhouse. A smart system\
    \ is designed using temperature sensors and soil moisture. This \nsystem monitor\
    \ the humidity ,temperature and illumination in the greenhouse. In [17] authors\
    \ proposed wireless \nsensor networks based system in potato farm which monitors\
    \ individual crop requirements. The farmers can easily \nrecognise the different\
    \ requirements of crop ,fertilizers use and need of irrigation. The article presented\
    \ a model \nfor irrigation management to figure out agricultural parameters using\
    \ intelligent humidity sensors and \nmathematical calculations on the basis of\
    \ received input. In [18] authors  presented smart precision agriculture \nsystem\
    \ using IoT technology and wireless sensor network . This system has designed\
    \ automated irrigation system. \nComparison of scheduled irrigation in which irrigation\
    \ is done at specific times with automatic irrigation system \nbased on  moisture\
    \ sensors, temperature, and humidity. Two irrigation methods are compared and\
    \ it is found that \nautomatic irrigation has better efficiency in terms of water\
    \ consumption. In [19] proposed method is implemented \nby dividing the agricultural\
    \ land in for regions and three different sensors namely temperature, humidity\
    \ and soil \nmoisture sensor. Data collection is done by these sensor nodes and\
    \ transmitted through other nodes and gateways \nto server. Data received at server\
    \ is analysed and displayed in an application in GUI that can be made available\
    \ \nin mobile application and on the related website. In [20] authors developed\
    \ IoT-enabled wireless sensor network \nenvironment to monitor soil and environmental\
    \ parameters which are used to schedule irrigation on the basis of \nwater requirements.\
    \ Developed robust mechanism using interpolation technique for making soil moisture\
    \ content \ndistribution map. Method  made distribution map  by measuring soil\
    \ moisture content at different nine positions \nof the agricultural land. Structural\
    \ similarity index (SSIM) mechanisms was adopted to control irrigation valves\
    \ \ndepending on zone-specific irrigation control commands. In [21] a wireless\
    \ drip irrigation system was presented \nby deploying soil moisture sensors. An\
    \ implementation of a WSN was realized for wireless managed irrigation \nsolution\
    \ and real time monitoring of soil water content. Data collection is done with\
    \ the help of solar powered \nbased wireless acquisition stations to automate\
    \ an irrigation. With this system design monitoring of water content \nwas done.\
    \ It is clear from above reviewed papers that proposed systems use multiple sensors\
    \ nodes to make \nagriculture more precise. The design of the system is selected\
    \ depending on various features that fulfil the \nrequirement for low cost , less\
    \ power consumption, less water consumption, reduced manpower and secure \nwireless\
    \ communication between these nodes [23].  \nIn the agriculture sector wireless\
    \ sensor networks are being used to develop smart irrigation systems, smart \n\
    fertilization systems, crop health monitoring, early crop disease detection and\
    \ smart pest control systems.  \n  2.1.2 IoT Connectivity \nIn IoT objects can\
    \ talk and this is possible only through their connectivity to each other and\
    \ to the outside \nworld. Due to the rapid growth in WSN technologies and IoT\
    \ devices several wireless communication protocols \nare brought in use. These\
    \ protocols have their own specifications depending on various factors like data\
    \ rate, \nbandwidth, free channels, , battery life and cost [24]. Commonly used\
    \ protocol for IoT connectivity in agriculture \nsector are Zigbee, Bluetooth,\
    \ 6LoWPAN, RFID, Wi-Fi and Lora WAN.  ZigBee is a wireless protocol commonly \n\
    used in precision agriculture applications like smart irrigation systems and smart\
    \ greenhouses [25]. In [26], \nauthors presented a smart irrigation system in\
    \ which communication is handled by the ZigBee module. This \nsystem used two\
    \ nodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node where sensor node was comprised\
    \ of soil moisture \nsensors, which were used to monitor the water level in the\
    \ soil and the actuator module used to take required \nactions on basis of the\
    \ water content of the soil. ZigBee protocol handled the whole communication part\
    \ of the \nsystem. In [27] wireless greenhouse sensors based on CC2420 and Zigbee.\
    \ In [28] greenhouse environment \nmonitoring system using three sensors namely\
    \ light intensity sensor, air temperature sensor and humidity sensor \nwas designed.\
    \ The system monitoring is Wi-Fi based which converts TTL signal from the sensor\
    \ to the Wi-Fi \nsignal to be transmitted to the server. In this framework physical\
    \ devices are connected to Wi-Fi network to \nmonitor and control greenhouse environment.\
    \ Similarly, In another smart agriculture system proposed in [29] \nWi-Fi protocols\
    \ were used. In this paper system is designed using Raspberry Pi   and multiple\
    \ sensors used for \ndata collection. The transmission of this data to the cloud\
    \ is done using Wi-Fi protocols.  Indu and S.R.N. [30] \nproposed a GSM(Global\
    \ system for mobile communication) based system to control irrigation. The system\
    \ \ndesigned is used to set the irrigation time depending on the data collected\
    \ by temperature and humidity sensors \nwhich helps to irrigate automatically\
    \ when unattended. Communication between the end user and system is \nRana Gill\
    \  a, and Dr. Paras Chawla b \n \n134  \nestablished via short messaging service\
    \ (SMS) on GSM network. In [31], a proposed system used smart phone \nusing Bluetooth\
    \ to collect the data from sensors deployed in the farm. Sensors used in the system\
    \ are soil \ntemperature sensor and soil moisture sensor. In [32] a smartphone\
    \ App is designed which enables the Wi-Fi \nconnection of the smartphone creating\
    \ an access point to a router node. This node is connected through the Zigbee\
    \ \nprotocol to a gateway that controls the irrigation pump. In [33], authors\
    \ presented wireless sensor network to \nmonitor the soil properties of the farm\
    \ by using a 6LoWPAN. 4G cellular technology is also considered as a good \nchoice\
    \ in underground wireless sensor networks [34]. Common IoT applications which\
    \ use RFID are security, \nmedical, smart shopping and smart agriculture. RFID\
    \ based smart irrigation system was presented in [35] which \nused soil moisture\
    \ and soil temperature sensors for controlling valve of irrigation pump. An information\
    \ collected \nby these sensors is transmitted to the cloud based on RFID wireless\
    \ communication protocols, with the help of \nwhich user can control a water pump.\
    \  \n  3. Precision Agriculture Challenges \nPrecision agriculture is in use from\
    \ last few decades to increase crop productivity by keeping low cost and \nless\
    \ human intervention. But still very limited farmers have adopted these techniques\
    \ due to several challenges. \nAs Precision agriculture relies on different sensors\
    \ which have certain limitations like deployment, development \ncost and maintenance\
    \ cost. So this hardware cost is main challenge in precision agriculture. Atmospheric\
    \ \ndisturbances also cause interference in wireless communication channels which\
    \ can further interrupt \ncommunication between wireless nodes and cloud. In Precision\
    \ agriculture systems large amounts of data get \ngenerated which need storage\
    \ and data analysis. New facilities and software platforms are in demand for \n\
    management of data. Literacy and connectivity are another important factors that\
    \ affects the adoption of smart \nfarming. The main challenge that is acting as\
    \ an obstruction in growth of precision agriculture is interoperability. \n 4.\
    \ Conclusion and Future scope \nPrecision agriculture with involvement of technologies\
    \ like IoT and wireless sensor networks helps to increase \nyield and productivity\
    \ with resource optimization. Most of the research articles in this field indicates\
    \ that precision \nagriculture is about sustainability and decision support systems.\
    \ Precision agriculture includes multiple \nparameters like temperature, soil\
    \ moisture, light intensity, humidity, soil nutrients, etc. Many challenges are\
    \ also \ninvolved in the system developed for precision agriculture. New software\
    \ platforms and advanced technologies \ncan further help in development of smart\
    \ agriculture. \nReferences \nA. C. Jose, “Improving home automation security;\

    \ (A.R.O.)\nAbstract: With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural\
    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\
    \ developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends\non the\
    \ farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with\
    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\
    \ ground sensors to the compute nodes in a\ncost-effective way by keeping the\
    \ data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In\nthis regard,\
    \ this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed\
    \ in\nprecision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with\
    \ respect to heavy metal in\nagricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly,\
    \ this manuscript illustrates the processing of data\ngenerated from the sensors.\
    \ In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from\ncloud computing\
    \ has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model\n\
    of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efﬁcient ofﬂoading\
    \ of data with smooth\nworkﬂow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims\
    \ to open a new corridor for the farming\nsector in developing nations by tackling\
    \ challenges and providing substantial consideration.\nKeywords: food security;\
    \ precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture; heavy metal;\nwireless\
    \ sensors; edge computing\n1. Introduction\nThe agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n2 of 37\n\
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\
    Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration rate [69].\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\
    \ such as heavy metal toxics. In addition, the next\nsubsection also highlights\
    \ the various wireless nodes and the associated microcontroller\nand transceiver.\n\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\
    tion. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate to\
    \ track and\ncollect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized\
    \ mode by\nsending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g.,\
    \ through a gateway). A\nbroad variety of application-speciﬁc limitations is included\
    \ in the project, design, prototype,\nand use of a WSN.\nThe BTnode is a Bluetooth-based\
    \ radio module and microcontroller for autonomous\nwireless communication [159].\
    \ BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which\ncan be conﬁgured on\
    \ the basis of application speciﬁc requirement. BTnode can be utilized\nwith several\
    \ peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising\n\
    factor of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface.\
    \ A pictorial\ndescription of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises\
    \ an Atmel ATmega128L\nmicrocontroller with on-chip memory and peripherals [160].\
    \ The microcontroller demon-\nstrates an 8-bit RISC core delivering up to 8 MIPS\
    \ at a maximum of 8 MHz. The on-chip\nmemory comprises a programmable in-built\
    \ 128 KB of ﬂash memory along with 4 KB of\nstatic RAM. Other integrated peripherals\
    \ consist of JTAG for debugging, timers, counters,\npulse-width modulation, and\
    \ 10-bit analog-to-digital converter.\nFigure 6. (a) Pictorial description of\
    \ BTnode. (b) Illustration of BTnode [159].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n17 of\

    \ Epic\nis shown in Figure 7. SensorNet platforms, like most embedded systems,\
    \ are tightly\ncoupled to their applications and this can also be incorporated\
    \ over parallel programming\nparadigm to enhance processing and reduce execution\
    \ time [161,162]. A key aspect of Epic\nis the support of prototyping and reusability\
    \ using composable hardware architecture.\nThe research and development of Epic\

    \ it suitable to implement user-centric studies. The research and development\n\
    of Irene Mote was carried out at Computer Science Division, University of California,\n\
    Berkeley, in 2009 [163–165]. Figure 8 shows the pictorial representation and illustration\
    \ of\nIrene Mote.\nFigure 8. Pictorial description and illustration of Irene Mote\

    \ and is equipped\nwith a universally usable sensor and actuator platform [169,170].\
    \ Figure 10 pictorially\nrepresents the Preon32 sensor. Preon32 is incorporated\
    \ with Cortex-M3 controller which is\ncompatible with IEEE 802.15.4 radio frequency\
    \ module. In addition, this module enables\ndevelopers to develop the wireless\
    \ module codes using an object-oriented programming\nlanguage like Java [169].\
    \ It also demonstrates the functionalities of external interfaces, i.e.,\nUSB,\
    \ CAN, and SPI, etc. [164,169].\nFigure 10. Preon32 sensor [170].\nThe Mica2 Mote\
    \ is shown in Figure 11. These motes are CrossBow Technology’s mote\ntechnology\
    \ of the second and third century. In combination with the CC1000/CC2420\nRF Module,\
    \ Mica2 and MicaZ use the Atmega128L controllers [171]. With the interface\nAgriculture\
    \ 2021, 11, 475\n19 of 37\nsupport for the link to the mote, the Mica2/MicaZ are\
    \ ﬁtted with moisture, temperature,\nand light sensors [162]. These motes also\
    \ measure barometric pressure, seismic waves,\netc. [172–174].\nFigure 11. Mica2\
    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\
    \ for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix,\nthread, and C programming environment\
    \ and is built using a hybrid programming model\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n20\
    \ of 37\nwhich allows programming, both event-driven and thread-driven. Some of\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\
    will also be possible to determine whether the treated wastewater is suitable\
    \ for irrigation at\na given point in time and what are the relevant crops on\
    \ which the treated wastewater can\nbe used, depending upon its composition [212].\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\
    \ expense of\ndelivering these services to the farmers. The government lacks substantial\
    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ for real-time monitoring of ﬁeld water level would greatly\nfacilitate the application\
    \ of alternate wetting and drying (AWD), an irrigation water management\ntechnique\
    \ proven to result to signiﬁcant water savings and reduced methane emissions in\
    \ lowland\nrice production systems. However, most of the commercially available\
    \ wireless sensors are generally\ncostly. This study developed a low-cost wireless\
    \ sensor that can perform real-time monitoring of\nwater depth and surface temperature\
    \ in lowland rice ﬁelds under an AWD irrigation regime. The\nsensor is composed\
    \ mainly of an ultrasonic depth sensor, a waterproof temperature sensor, a humidity\n\
    sensor, and a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller enclosed in a PVC cap that can be\
    \ mounted in AWD\npipes. The sensor was tested under laboratory, pseudo-ﬁeld conditions\
    \ and actual ﬁeld conditions.\nResults showed a relatively high degree of agreement\
    \ between sensor and manual measurements\nof water depth under all testing conditions,\
    \ with the error ranging from only 5.2% to 6.6% and\nRMSE of 5.0 mm to 13.5 mm.\
    \ The performance of the low-cost sensor also proved to be comparable\nwith that\

    \ and higher\nprecision. The wireless sensor developed in this study can provide\
    \ a low-cost alternative to the\nhigh-cost and high-end sensors and other commercially\
    \ available counterparts for efﬁcient irrigation\nwater management in lowland\
    \ crop production systems during water-scarce conditions induced by\nclimate change\
    \ and climate variability.\nKeywords: low-cost wireless sensor; alternate wetting\
    \ and drying; irrigation water management\n1. Introduction\nLowland rice irrigation\
    \ systems are known to consume a considerable amount of\nfreshwater resources,\
    \ comprising a 34–43% share of the world’s total irrigation water\nand 24–30%\
    \ of the world’s developed freshwater resources [1]. Rice cultivation is also\n\
    identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant source of methane emissions (CH4) due to anaerobic process\n\
    brought about by its ﬂooding nature, accounting for about 10% of the global non-CO2\n\
    emissions in agriculture [2]. In the face of climate uncertainties and hydrological\
    \ extremes,\nit is therefore imperative that we adopt efﬁcient water management\
    \ practices in countering\nwater scarcity issues to carry on with the production\
    \ of food staple of about half of the\nglobal population [3]. Among the many alternative\
    \ water saving techniques developed\nis the alternate wetting and drying (AWD)\
    \ technology, a form of irrigation management\nwhere the ﬁeld water level is being\
    \ brought to a water level threshold in the soil subsurface,\nwith 15 cm being\
    \ the safe maximum, before triggering another irrigation event [4]. The\nWater\

    Water 2022, 14, 4128\n2 of 17\nAWD has been proven to be effective in reducing\
    \ irrigation water consumption without\nsigniﬁcant yield compensations [5–7].\
    \ It was also reported to reduce CH4 emissions [8–14],\nand is therefore considered\
    \ as a promising option in mitigating global warming potential\nfrom rice cultivation.\n\
    Aside from the increased water productivity and environmental beneﬁts, the appli-\n\
    cation of the AWD irrigation has also been known to reduce labor requirements\
    \ with less\nfrequent irrigation [15], although the tradeoff brings about the\
    \ challenge in constantly\nmonitoring the ﬁeld water level, often done manually,\
    \ to ensure that the level will never get\nbelow the safe threshold. The advent\
    \ of sensor technology and its application in irrigation\nhas greatly alleviated\
    \ this challenge by enabling remote monitoring. Recent developments\nin real-time\
    \ monitoring of ﬁeld water level have aided farmers and researchers alike in\n\
    coming up with sound and efﬁcient irrigation water management plans and decisions.\n\
    Wireless sensors applicable for irrigation water management in rice ﬁelds have\
    \ evolved\nin recent years. Most of the previously developed sensors are capable\
    \ of monitoring ﬁeld\nwater level [16–19], together with soil moisture [20,21]\
    \ and other climatic variables [22,23].\nThe developed technologies greatly vary\
    \ in the usage of sensor types, communication\nprotocols, and system architecture.\
    \ While a number of wireless sensors have been devel-\noped, most of them are\
    \ costly, especially those that make use of high-end hardware and\ncutting-edge\
    \ technologies. Other sensor development studies of the low-end type, on the\n\
    other hand, did not include rigorous sensor testing or published sensor performance\
    \ results,\nthus failing to unravel potential problems associated with ﬁeld implementation.\
    \ Some\nother sensors are not user-friendly such that widespread adoption may\
    \ become a challenge.\nWith the availability of open-source software, different\
    \ sensor types and wireless communi-\ncation protocols, the opportunities remain\
    \ vast in coming up with a variety of options for\naffordable, user-friendly,\
    \ and effective monitoring systems for real-time water information.\nThis study\
    \ aimed to develop an alternative to existing costly sensors for real-time\nmonitoring\
    \ of water level in lowland crop production systems employing AWD. This\npaper\
    \ presents the details of the sensor development and rigorous testing under laboratory,\n\
    pseudo-ﬁeld, and actual ﬁeld conditions. Ultimately, the sensors developed in\
    \ this study\nare intended to facilitate the wider application of AWD in lowland\
    \ crop production systems\nin order to address issues of water scarcity and inequitable\
    \ water distribution induced by\nclimate change and climate variability.\n2. Materials\

    \ The low-cost sensor is composed mainly of four sensor\nmodules: HC-SR04 ultrasonic\
    \ distance sensor, DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor,\nDHT11 temperature/humidity\
    \ sensor, and the microSD card adapter module. Data from\nthe sensor modules are\
    \ integrated by the ESP8266 microcontroller which sends data to\nthe online database\
    \ through Wi-Fi. The sensor unit was also equipped with two Li ion\nbatteries,\
    \ a solar charger, and two mini solar panels. Figure 1 shows the connection of\
    \ the\nsensor circuitry.\nWater 2022, 14, 4128\n3 of 17\nWater 2022, 14, x FOR\

    \ periodically ponded with water of about 6 cm deep whenever the\nsurface water\
    \ recedes to the soil surface. Two low-cost sensors were tested consecutively,\n\
    with each test taking place for at least a week. Manual measurements were also\
    \ taken\nhourly, at the same time the sensor data is transmitted to the cloud.\
    \ Adequate manually\nobserved data were collected during the test run to achieve\
    \ decent comparisons. The test\nWater 2022, 14, 4128\n8 of 17\nrun was performed\
    \ in an open space where the sensor can sufﬁciently access a reliable\ninternet\
    \ connection and experience no physical obstruction from sunlight. Sensor data\
    \ and\nmanual observations were then compared and plotted through time.\n2.2.2.\
    \ Pseudo-Field Test\nA 2 m × 1.5 m × 0.9 m micropaddy plot, as shown in Figure\
    \ 6b, was established to\nserve as a test site for the low-cost sensor. The plot\
    \ is situated inside the campus of the\nUniversity of the Philippines Los Baños,\
    \ with sufﬁcient exposure to sunlight, managed\nwith suitable pest control management,\
    \ and has adequate access to the water distribution\nsystem. The borders of the\
    \ micropaddy were completely sealed and made up of reinforced\nconcrete. The plot\
    \ soil structure was designed to resemble actual paddy ﬁeld settings.\nThe soil\
    \ proﬁle was composed of several layers: a 15 cm-thick loose clay soil at the\
    \ top,\nfollowed by a 30 cm deep compacted clay layer, and a 5 cm-thick gravel\
    \ at the very bottom.\nA drainage pipe was also equipped at the bottom corner\
    \ of the micropaddy box to enable\nsoil-water percolation, so as to simulate the\
    \ water level ﬂuctuations in the actual paddy ﬁeld\nconditions. The drainage pipe\
    \ also facilitated the release of excess water during excessive\nrainfall occurrences.\
    \ Two AWD pipes were installed in the plot. One was used for manual\nobservation\
    \ while the other one was for automated measurement. Prior observations\nsuggested\
    \ that the ultrasonic sensor no longer performs reliably when mounted on pipes\n\
    with lengths beyond 30 cm. This could most likely be due to the tendency of sound\
    \ waves\nto bounce off on the sides of the pipe. When the ultrasonic transmitter\
    \ is activated, the\nsound signal is being thrown at a certain beam angle whose\
    \ edges can get in contact with\nthe pipe perimeter. When this happens, the distance\
    \ measured is the traversed distance\nmade by the sound wave between the sensor\
    \ and the point of contact, which completely\nmisrepresents the ﬁeld water level.\
    \ Manual water level measurements were taken relative\nto the top of the pipe,\
    \ similar to how the low-cost sensor measures the water level depths.\nDuring\
    \ the implementation of the AWD irrigation, two sets of test runs were com-\n\
    pleted using two different units of low-cost sensors. One was performed during\
    \ the early\nwet season (June to July) while the other test was executed during\
    \ the early dry season\n(November to December). Each test run comprised about\
    \ 15 days’ worth of observation\ndata. Since the sensor is not ﬂood-proof, it\
    \ was elevated at 15 cm above the soil surface as a\nprecautionary measure. Despite\
    \ the occurrences of frequent rainfall and the application of\nmanual irrigation,\
    \ sufﬁcient drying cycles were achieved nonetheless to enable testing of\nthe\
    \ sensor performance under the AWD irrigation regime in this setup.\n2.3. Actual\
    \ Field Deployment\nThe actual ﬁeld deployment was performed in one of the paddy\
    \ ﬁelds in a rice\nproduction area located in Brgy. San Roque, Victoria, Laguna,\
    \ Philippines, situated 700 m\nfrom Laguna Lake. The area is characterized by\
    \ predominantly clayey soils, and has an\nintensive production of rice that is\
    \ regularly cultivated during the wet and dry cropping\nseasons. The rice ﬁeld\
    \ is irrigated using a shallow tube well (STW). The application of\nAWD is more\
    \ compelling in this system as the farmers can greatly reduce fuel costs in STW\n\
    pumping through less frequent irrigation during the dry cropping season. The ﬁeld\
    \ setup\nwas composed of a 14 × 44 m2 basin plot. Five AWD pipes equipped with\
    \ low-cost sensors\nwere evenly spaced along the plot’s middle horizontal transect\
    \ in line with the irrigation\ninlet. The manually observed pipe was installed\
    \ in a highly accessible location within the\nplot, about a meter away from the\
    \ bund to avoid measurement bias. A rain gauge was\nalso installed in the ﬁeld\
    \ to monitor water inputs in the basin aside from irrigation water.\nThe sensors\
    \ were set to read water level data for every hour using Wi-Fi, while manual\n\
    observations were made twice a day, i.e., at 8:00 am and 2:00 pm. A Wi-Fi modem\
    \ and\na 5 km-range Wi-Fi extender powered up by batteries were installed in the\
    \ pump house\nlocated 30 m away from the plot. The sensor deployment was continuous\
    \ within two weeks,\nexcept during the three consecutive days of a storm that\
    \ transpired within the experimental\nperiod. Figure 6c shows a photo of the sensor\
    \ testing done under actual ﬁeld conditions.\nWater 2022, 14, 4128\n9 of 17\n\
    2.4. Performance Comparison between the Low-Cost Sensor and the High-End Sensor\n\
    After several test runs, the performance of the low-cost sensor was compared with\n\
    a commercially available high-end sensor (Submersible Water Level Transducer).\
    \ This\ntest was done under pseudo-ﬁeld conditions during the dry cropping season.\
    \ The high-\nend sensor considered was a submersible probe that estimates water\
    \ level based on the\nhydrostatic pressure. It was initially calibrated in a 1\
    \ L graduated cylinder by subjecting the\nsensor under different water level heads,\
    \ both in descending and ascending manner, until\na representative calibration\
    \ equation was obtained. The low-cost sensor and a high-end\nsensor were deployed\
    \ simultaneously in separate AWD pipes in the same micropaddy plot.\nA separate\
    \ AWD pipe was also allotted for manual measurements. Observation time lasted\n\
    for approximately 10 days. Several drying cycles were achieved in the micropaddy\
    \ plot\nover the observation period to generate sufﬁcient number of data points\
    \ for comparison\npurposes under both wetting and drying conditions in the micropaddy\
    \ plot.\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nThe performance of the low-cost sensor was\
    \ evaluated using various statistical indices\nsuch as percentage error, coefﬁcient\
    \ of determination R2, and root mean square error\n(RMSE). The distribution of\
    \ errors was also analyzed. Preliminary analysis using the\nShapiro–Wilk test\
    \ showed that the error distribution between sensor and manual readings\nwere\
    \ nonuniform in most cases. Thus, the Gaussian kernel density function (KDF) was\n\
    used in generating the probability curve of error distribution. Gaussian KDF estimates\n\
    the probability density function of random variables in a nonparametric way. The\
    \ mode\nwas used as a more appropriate representation of central tendency, which\
    \ was estimated\nby determining the maxima of the KDF curve. Other statistical\
    \ parameters used were\nthe standard deviation (σ) in assessing the data dispersion\
    \ and sensor precision, and the\narithmetic mean error (µ) in determining the\
    \ measurement bias.\nAdditional analysis was also made in an attempt to estimate\
    \ the optimum number of\nlow-cost sensors within the rice basin during the actual\
    \ ﬁeld test. The equation used was\nN =\n\x12CV\nε\n\x132\n(1)\nwhere N is the\
    \ optimum sensor density, CV is the coefﬁcient of variation of sensor values,\n\
    and ε is the maximum allowable percentage of error. This simple optimization equation\n\
    is similarly used in optimizing the number of rain gauges in a catchment basin.\
    \ The\nestimation of ﬁeld water level in a paddy ﬁeld basin and precipitation\
    \ in catchments were\ntaken in a similar context since both parameters are hydrologic\
    \ in nature, have perimetrical\nboundaries, and require at least a millimeter\
    \ range of accuracy.\n3. Results and Discussion\nThe following sections present\
    \ the test results under different conditions in which the\nsensors were subjected\
    \ in laboratory, pseudo-ﬁeld, and actual ﬁeld. To enhance clarity, the\nlow-cost\
    \ sensors were labeled with a number to identify the sensor unit being referred\
    \ to in\nthe discussion.\n3.1. Laboratory Test Condition\nResults from the laboratory\
    \ tests are presented in Figures 7 and 8. Sensor 1 exhibited\nerror of 3.28% and\
    \ RMSE of 0.46 cm, while sensor 2 had error of 6.62% and RMSE of\n0.42 cm. Correlation\
    \ between manual measurements and sensor measurements proved to\nbe excellent\
    \ for both sensors (R2 = 0.92 for Sensor 1 and R2 = 0.98 for Sensor 2). They also\n\
    displayed the same degree of dispersion (σ = 0.35 cm), signifying that both demonstrate\n\
    similar precision. However, the two sensors exhibited different tendencies when\
    \ estimating\nthe water level. Sensor 1 mostly overestimated the actual values\
    \ with mode Mo = −0.28 cm\nand mean bias error µ = −0.29 cm, while Sensor 2 mostly\
    \ underestimated the actual\nWater 2022, 14, 4128\n10 of 17\nvalues with mode\
    \ Mo = 0.29 cm and mean bias error µ = 0.24 cm. Even though the\nstatistical parameters\
    \ of both sensors were nearly identical in magnitude, both of their\ncentral tendencies\
    \ were on the opposite side of the error distribution. A closer examination\n\
    of the observed and sensor depth values from both test runs (Figures 7 and 8)\
    \ indicates\nthat Sensor 2 measured relatively shallow depths, between 3 cm up\
    \ to 10 cm, compared to\nSensor 1 with water level ranges between 7 cm to 16 cm.\
    \ It is important to note that the\nHC-SR04 ultrasonic water level sensor used\
    \ in fabricating the low-cost sensor measures\ndistances relative to where the\
    \ sensor is located. Since the sensor is mounted at the top\nof the container,\
    \ the reference elevation is the top of the container itself. Shorter sensor\n\
    distance values mean deeper water levels in reference to the soil surface, while\
    \ larger sensor\ndistance values imply the opposite.\n \nferred to in the discussion.\

    \ the same degree of dispersion (σ = 0.35 cm), signifying that both demon-\nstrate\
    \ similar precision. However, the two sensors exhibited different tendencies when\

    \ while Sensor 2 mostly underestimated \nthe actual values with mode Mo = 0.29\

    \ parameters of both sensors were nearly identical in magnitude, both of \ntheir\

    \ between 3 cm up to \n10 cm, compared to Sensor 1 with water level ranges between\
    \ 7 cm to 16 cm. It is im-\nportant to note that the HC-SR04 ultrasonic water\

    \ One investigator claimed these instabilities to be due to the lack of monotonicity,\n\
    an occurrence of miscommunication between the components of the internal circuitry\

    \ consequently results\nin longer travel time of sound, which further results\

    Results of the pseudo-field test runs are presented in Figures 10 and 11. The\

    \ the water level at a high level of accuracy. Comparative-\nly, the statistical\
    \ performance indicators for Sensor 4 were better than for Sensor 3. The \nRMSE\
    \ of Sensor 4 may be deemed acceptable from the practical standpoint. However,\

    \ under laborato-\nry conditions (RMSE = 0.46 cm, σ = 0.35 cm and RMSE = 1.35\
    \ cm). This may largely be \ndue to a relatively greater number of data points\
    \ collected during low water levels, \nwhich comprised a fine portion of the dataset\
    \ used to compare with the sensor values. \nFigure 10 shows an apparent pattern\
    \ of consecutive underestimation of water level val-\nues at deeper levels, which\
    \ is a complete disagreement from the observations in labora-\ntory tests. While\
    \ the internal circuit anomaly affects the sensor accuracy, the presence of \n\
    successive underestimated values is indicative of an involved systematic factor.\
    \ Albeit \nhaving Mo = −0.16 cm, the series of underestimated depths resulted\
    \ in the dispersion of \nerror on the positive side of the error distribution\

    \ may imply a possible problem posed by sed-\niment accumulation at the bottom\
    \ of the pipe in the actual field deployment, as had been \nobserved during the\

    \ side of the error distribution. The error dispersion (σ = 1.15 cm), how-\never,\
    \ may be the combined effect of many elements, including the tendency of the sensor\n\
    itself to overestimate water levels at deeper depths, and the environmental factors\
    \ in the\nactual ﬁeld conditions. It may also be the reﬂection of slight water\
    \ level variation in the\nﬁeld, considering the relative distances and placements\
    \ of the sensors from one another.\nMoreover, a relatively low CV of 4.46% suggests\
    \ that the data variation is highly acceptable.\nUsing the same value of CV and\
    \ assuming a 10% maximum allowable error, the optimum\nnumber of sensors N for\
    \ the plot size considered becomes 0.20, which if rounded up to\na practical value\
    \ of N = 1 suggests that a single sensor is sufﬁcient to monitor the ﬁeld\nwater\

    \ and relatively low RMSE (1.31 cm for high-end and 0.80 cm for low-cost\nsensor).\
    \ Results further revealed that both the low-cost sensor and the high-end sensor\n\
    mostly tend to reﬂect the actual water level, with Mo of 0.03 cm and 0.06 cm,\
    \ respectively.\nBased on the previous sensor tests done, these modes are exceptionally\
    \ accurate. However,\nthe two sensors exhibited different error dispersion, with\
    \ the high-end sensor (σ = 1.11 cm)\nshowing wider spread than the low-cost (σ\
    \ = 0.65 cm). The error dispersion of the high-end\nsensor resulted in less superior\
    \ performance (%Error = 6.86; RMSE = 1.31 cm) than the\nlow-cost (%Error = 5.16;\
    \ RMSE = 0.80 cm). The high-end sensor’s data dispersion may be\ndue to the extreme\
    \ sensitivity of the sensor to pressure changes, particularly in higher water\n\
    levels. The water turbidity may also have a direct inﬂuence on this sensitivity,\
    \ although\nfurther investigations are necessary. On the other hand, there is\
    \ still a tendency for the\nlow-cost sensor to underestimate water level on shallow\
    \ depths, with a local maximum of\n1.10 cm. Nevertheless, Mo = 0.06 cm remains\

    The use of noncontact-type sensors, such as the ultrasonic sensor of the low-cost,\
    \ in\nmeasuring ﬁeld water depths has the advantage in the paddy ﬁeld setting.\
    \ In contrast to the\nprobe type sensors, the low-cost sensor is not prone to\
    \ corrosion and hardware malfunction\ndue to sedimentation problems. This was\
    \ further supported by Chiu and Reba [15] in their\nﬁndings. The low-cost sensor\
    \ also makes use of less wires exposed outside of the sensor\ncase, thus it is\
    \ less likely to be damaged by ﬁeld pests such as rodents. The sensor is also\n\
    easy to use and maintain. The database system and alert messaging services can\
    \ also be\naccessed free for as long as the Wi-Fi connection is available. Affordability\
    \ is also one of the\nlow-cost sensor’s most distinctive advantages over high-end\
    \ sensors.\nWhile the low-cost wireless sensor exhibits several advantages in\
    \ terms of performance\nand costs, it still has a number of limitations. Firstly,\
    \ the low-cost sensor does not have a\nreal-time clock due to limited I/O pins;\
    \ hence, the data encoded in the text ﬁle have no\ndate and time stamps. However,\
    \ manual data sorting can still be done by holding on to\nthe logic of hourly\
    \ sensor reading and comparing the data log entries in the text ﬁle with\nthe\
    \ online database entries. Secondly, the low-cost sensor is Wi-Fi-based, which\
    \ makes the\nsensor range limited. Its application in rice ﬁeld areas situated\
    \ in off-grid communities\nwould therefore pose a challenge. Obviously, the low-cost\
    \ sensor, such as the high-end\nsensors, can only be effective in agricultural\
    \ areas with a power source and Wi-Fi or at\nleast signal extenders. Thirdly,\
    \ the quality of Wi-Fi connection in the ﬁeld may be affected\nby the rice canopy\
    \ if the low-cost sensor is not placed strategically in the ﬁeld. Fourthly,\n\
    the low-cost sensor is not ﬂood-proof, which makes it more viable to use during\
    \ the dry\ncropping season. These identiﬁed limitations could serve as a basis\
    \ for further research\nand development.\n4. Conclusions\nThe low-cost wireless\
    \ sensor developed and tested in this study can provide reliable\ninformation\
    \ of paddy ﬁeld water level in real-time to facilitate the application of AWD\
    \ in\nrice production systems. Laboratory tests and analysis showed that the sensors\
    \ developed\ncan generate accurate readings. The pseudo-ﬁeld test additionally\
    \ revealed the inﬂuence of\nsedimentation and pipe settlement in sensor readings,\
    \ causing measurement offsets from\nmanual observations. When applied under actual\
    \ ﬁeld conditions, the low-cost sensor\nperformed reasonably well from the practical\
    \ standpoint, in spite of several environmental\nfactors affecting the sensor\
    \ accuracy. The performance of the low-cost sensor also proved to\nbe comparable\
    \ with that of the high-end sensor, exhibiting practically similar measurement\n\
    accuracy and higher precision. Considering the low-cost sensor’s tested performance\
    \ and\neconomic edge, it can prove useful in the efﬁcient irrigation water management\
    \ in lowland\nrice crop production systems in developing countries, particularly\
    \ during the dry season\nand under water-scarce conditions as a result of climate\
    \ change and climate variability. Ulti-\nmately, the low-cost sensor can serve\
    \ as a tool for climate change adaptation and mitigation\nstrategies in lowland\
    \ rice crop production systems through the AWD technology.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction In China, at present, irrigation is carried
    out in many areas in the agricultural production process, and irrigation method
    is still dominated by diffusion irrigation, so the water resource consumption
    is very huge and the overall utilization rate is not high. Agriculture occupies
    a large proportion of water in China’s industrial and agricultural production.
    The total amount of water used for agriculture accounts for 70% of the country’s
    total water consumption. Therefore, it has become a long-term and arduous task
    to increase the effective utilization rate of irrigation water, improve soil environment
    and crop yield, and become the key to the development of agriculture in China
    at the present stage. With strong support from the government, some areas have
    begun to implement automatic irrigation systems, which play an important role
    in saving time, manpower and cost in agricultural production. At the same time
    automatic irrigation system also has the same outstanding contribution to the
    flower planting industry, the future application prospect is very broad. At present,
    people hope to have a green living environment, many people will plant a variety
    of flowers in the home, to achieve the goal of improving indoor air quality. At
    present, plant vegetable on the balcony also very welcome, such people can afforest
    the environment in the home again can eat the green healthy vegetable that oneself
    grows in the home. Yet the hectic pace of life often makes office workers miss
    out. Especially when we meet the holidays or visit the elderly relatives, flowers
    and vegetables are not watered in time, people often see a withered after returning
    from a long holiday. Therefore, people urgently need a self-made intelligent irrigation
    device to timely solve the irrigation problem of crops such as flowers and vegetables
    [1]. At present, the automatic control of irrigation system in China is still
    immature. In addition, the connection accessories and water valve required by
    the intelligent irrigation system are all substitute products, and the compatibility
    of the whole irrigation system is poor. In this design, the single-chip computer
    control system is added to the traditional irrigation system. Through accurate
    measurement to conduct watering, real-time soil moisture detection can be achieved
    perfectly, and the system can determine whether watering is needed according to
    the measured humidity. If the test results show that the soil is about to run
    out of water, the system will automatically start watering, ensuring soil moisture
    and keeping the plants growing normally. MCU is small in size, but powerful in
    function and very low in power consumption. It can expand various sensors for
    different control. MCU can carry out the development of various types. 2 Design
    Background 2.1 Development of IoT Technology The Internet of Things [2] literally
    means the Internet is connected to things. The Internet of things was proposed
    in this century, and the main principle is to connect other sensors via radio
    frequency identification (RFID) [3] to form a distributed network. With the Internet
    as the core, the world Internet of things is an extended application of the Internet,
    realizing multi-network communication and achieving the connection between things
    and things, people and things. With the constant development and maturity of IoT
    technology, IoT technology is called the third wave of the information industry,
    and is one of the greatest technologies in this century. At present, the development
    of IoT has been involved in all aspects of our life, including agriculture, education,
    medical care, transportation and so on. 2.2 Agricultural Internet of Things and
    Intelligent Irrigation Agricultural Internet of things (IoT) is a technology that
    brings convenience to agricultural production on the basis of the Internet of
    things, which is also a technology that technology changes the world. Agriculture
    is the foundation of human survival, and how to expand agricultural production
    is a research topic of tireless efforts of all countries. The growth of crops
    needs to be taken care of carefully, but the large area of farmland is difficult
    to be managed manually. At this time, the introduction of IoT technology can greatly
    improve the efficiency, reduce human cost and finally improve the production of
    crops. The development and use of the Internet of things has brought great changes
    to agricultural development, especially intelligent irrigation systems for farmland.
    The concept of intelligent irrigation have been proposed for many years, the main
    is a micro controller, sensor, automatic watering and other parts, is the collection
    many kinds of technology management system, at present our country’s intelligent
    irrigation system is still in the preliminary stage of development, a lot of technology
    is not mature enough, in recent years, some developed countries have been introduced
    into China the advanced irrigation control devices, but due to various factors
    such as high price, the maintenance difficulties, it is mainly used in institutions
    of higher learning, scientific research units and agricultural demonstration zone,
    and is not in conformity with the Chinese characteristics of the application of
    soil [4]. Therefore, it is very important for China to perfect the control of
    plant planting environment through scientific and technological means. It is inevitable
    for future development to replace manpower with low-cost and powerful control
    system. 2.3 Intelligent Irrigation System of Balcony Flowers Based on Internet
    of Things In the development of the Internet of things technology [5] and intelligent
    greenhouse irrigation systems, inspired by the ideas of the Internet of things
    and abstracted model of intelligent greenhouse irrigation system, the study design
    a set of balcony flowers intelligent irrigation system, using the sensor measurement
    of soil moisture and temperature, the proper irrigation by microcontroller control
    irrigation system, to ensure that the plant enough moisture is appropriate, the
    system can not only guarantee the optimal growth of plants, also can maximum level
    of saving water [6]. 3 System Design 3.1 Overall System Planning The intelligent
    balcony flower irrigation system based on the Internet of things takes MSP430F5438A
    single chip computer [7] as the core micro controller, including the lower machine
    part and the upper machine part. The lower part mainly includes information acquisition
    system and irrigation control system. As shown in Fig. 1, the information collection
    system mainly consists of soil temperature and humidity sensor and collection
    card, which is responsible for the collection of various data to prepare for the
    later control. Irrigation control is mainly composed of LED display module, electromagnetic
    valve, pump, MSP430 MCU module and GPRS module. The upper computer is mainly composed
    of server and client. Fig. 1. Overall system structure diagram Full size image
    3.2 Main Controller Microcontroller, namely microcontroller, is the most core
    part of the system design. Therefore, choosing appropriate microcontroller is
    the primary task of the design. At present, the most common microcontroller is
    the 51 series. Although the functions of the 51-series MCU have been very perfect
    at present, there are still some deficiencies. The internal hardware resources
    of the 51-series MCU are relatively few and the power consumption is relatively
    large. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the peripheral circuits to achieve
    the purpose of users. Based on the design for real-time acquisition of flower
    soil data, considering the actual power consumption and specific functions, a
    relatively low power microcontroller was selected for design. The manufacturer
    of MSP430 series MCU is Texas instruments (TI), a famous microprocessor company.
    MSP430 has the characteristics of ultra-low power consumption, and the power supply
    voltage is 1.8–3.6 v [8]. By compared with other microcontroller, MSP430 MCU integrates
    a variety of functional modules, including 3 16-bit timers, analog comparator,
    12 DAC, a 12 bit ADC, analog comparator, DMA controller and so on, also including,
    asynchronous I/O ports, I2C bus to accept/send device (UART), serial peripheral
    interface (SPI) three multi-function serial interface, the watchdog timer use
    watchdog (WDT) & constant ramp/LCD drive, USB hardware multiplier, 2 KB–10 KB
    of RAM, and a variety of the interrupt function. The single chip microcomputer
    can be programmed in time online. Only when the single chip microcomputer is connected
    with the JTAG simulator, the program can be simulated and debugged in time. This
    technology can save a lot of development time and improve efficiency for development.
    The program after debugging through JTAG can be directly downloaded to the FLASH
    memory of the single chip. The four wire system is adopted, and the specific pin
    interface is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. The interface way of JTAG Full size image
    3.3 Information Acquisition System 3.3.1 Acquisition Card DAM-3000 DAM-3000 supports
    the EIA-485 communication protocol, which USES the bidirectional balanced circuit
    standard to achieve true multi-point two-way communication. The DAM-3000 can connect
    8 different signal sources, support 8 different signals, read the voltage or current
    signal generated by the sensor, and convert the data that the user wants to measure
    through the 16 bit ADC on the DAM-3000, which satisfies the diversity of the sensor.
    The eight channels of DAM-3000 can be respectively set as different data acquisition
    modules, while one module can be achieved through DAM-3000, saving hardware costs.
    DAM-3000 is applicable to various working environments, and the working temperature
    of the product module is −10 ~+70°. DAM-3000 series of modules are all made of
    industrial-grade components, and the products can work at the limit temperature
    of −40 ~+85°. At the same time, 10–30 VDC power input range is provided, which
    has very high reliability and security, meeting the field needs of various applications.
    In addition, excellent control software is built into the modules, and users can
    easily use the software to control the system I/O modules. 3.3.2 The Sensor In
    normal growth of crops, air temperature and humidity, as an important environmental
    factor, play a very important role. Plants cannot grow without water, sunlight
    and inorganic salts, and the proper temperature is an important factor, but the
    growth of plant temperature and humidity are not fixed in a value, but there is
    one of the most suitable growth temperature, minimum and maximum temperature between
    a best temperature, in the best temperature range is most suitable for plant growth
    and reproduction of [9]. At the same time, soil moisture and crop can grow normally
    important environment factor, the soil humidity is small, if enough abundance
    of soil water content, then plants will have enough water to participate in all
    metabolism, especially the transpiration of water is plentiful, can moments for
    plants absorb nutrients from the soil, the growth of plants can be better. However,
    if the humidity in the air is too high in the environment where the plant grows,
    the biological activities inside the plant will be restricted, resulting in the
    growth limitation. If the relative humidity is too low, the soil will become dry
    and even the atmosphere will become dry. When the temperature is higher and the
    water is less, the plant will start its own protection system to protect the water
    in the body from evaporation and thus stop growing. In conclusion, we can understand
    how important temperature and humidity are to the growth of plants. Air temperature
    and humidity and soil moisture (also known as soil moisture content) are two important
    preconditions for automatic irrigation system. Therefore, a sensor for measuring
    air temperature and humidity and two soil moisture sensors for measuring humidity
    are designed in this design. The measurement sensor selected in this system design
    is a sensor based on FDR frequency domain reflection technology. High-frequency
    electronic technology is widely used in soil moisture measurement [10], and has
    become one of the most popular humidity measurement methods in the world at present
    due to its high-precision and high-sensitivity characteristics [11]. Its measurement
    distance is that electromagnetic pulse will have different frequency in soil with
    different water content, and the proportion of water in the total volume can be
    obtained by measuring the frequency, so as to reflect the soil moisture and measure
    the volume percentage of soil moisture, so as to obtain the soil temperature and
    humidity status through the inversion of a certain corresponding relation. 3.4
    GPRS Signal Transmission Module GPRS communication technology relative to its
    bricks and networking communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, radio
    frequency communication technology such as RF and WIFI, GPRS communication technology
    the most suitable for use in a sudden, intermittent or frequent small amounts
    of data transmission, and the communication technology to support the data transfer
    rate will be higher, in the practical application of limit peak of 115 kbps, can
    also be applied to the occasional big data transmission. GPRS communication technology
    is a wireless communication transmission technology based on TCP/IP protocol [12].
    GPRS system is mainly composed of the main entity, logical structure, protocol
    structure and channel of GPRS network. In practical operation, the data transmitted
    by GPRS module has two parts, one is the measured data, which belongs to user
    data, and the other is the control signaling to control and provide transmission
    support for user data. The main function of the GPRS communication module is to
    set up the data transmission channel between the upper computer and the lower
    computer to complete information processing communication [13]. Core chip adopts
    H7210 DTU. The modules of H7200 series have high reliability and wide range of
    use, and are the best choice for wireless communication of many systems [14].
    As the most commonly used wireless communication module, its internal built-in
    PPP and TCP/IP protocol stack, to meet most of the wireless communication protocol
    requirements; Can support fixed IP address and domain name; There are three different
    communication modes: TCP, UDP and SMS. Able to support private networks using
    mobile operator APN; In order to ensure the network patency and reduce power consumption,
    it also has idle offline and timed offline functions; SMS number support international
    area code and local number two modes; Debugging information can be set via a serial
    port. 3.5 Irrigation System Design Irrigation systems are divided into manual
    and automatic systems. The control circuit mainly controls the opening and closing
    of the pump by relay. When the system works, the soil moisture sensor begins to
    detect the current soil moisture [15]. The data measured by the soil moisture
    sensor is converted into digital signals and transmitted to the microcomputer
    through AD conversion. MCU compares the acquisition value with the set value.
    When the collected value is less than the humidity lower limit set, the control
    relay is connected to the pump to water the flowers and plants. When the pump
    is turned on, if the measured value is greater than the set humidity upper limit
    or reaches the maximum watering time, the pump is closed [16, 17]. In the watering
    process, if the measured value of soil temperature and humidity is greater than
    the set value of humidity upper limit, the control relay closes the water pump.
    Its workflow is shown in Fig. 3. When switched to manual, the relay is automatically
    closed and the pump is closed for manual watering. Fig. 3. Workflow diagrams Full
    size image 4 The System Test Due to the limitations of time and conditions in
    the system design, field testing and debugging were not carried out. All tests
    and debugging were carried out in the laboratory. Experiments were conducted through
    the established simulation model: (1) In the display module of the system, the
    upper and lower limits of humidity, watering duration and other relevant parameters
    are set manually, which gives the water demand of flowers and plants. Then, the
    command is transmitted to the downward machine to test whether the water pump
    can be opened normally for irrigation and shut down automatically after irrigation
    is completed. (2) The soil moisture sensor is inserted into the dry soil to test
    whether the water pump can be automatically opened for irrigation, and then inserted
    into the wet soil to test whether the water pump can automatically shut off irrigation.
    (3) After power on, the system can automatically detect the soil temperature and
    humidity, and timely control the water pump for irrigation according to the collected
    data. After the design is completed, the system is tested and debugged through
    the actual test. The actual test results show that the system designed in this
    design can work normally and independently, and the effect is good. It achieves
    the expected design effect and can effectively conduct intelligent irrigation.
    5 Conclusion In the system design, based on consulting a large number of relevant
    data and documents, and combining the actual requirement of the design to carry
    on the design, encountered many problems during, but have been conducted to solve
    the guidance of the teacher carefully, after two months of efforts finally according
    to the design requirements expected only irrigation system are designed. The whole
    system can be divided into two main parts, one is the measurement and control
    of the machine, the other is for display and artificial control of PC, to achieve
    the intelligent control of the system, MSP430F5438A microcontroller as the microcontroller
    in the system, solved the normal most of the crops can’t timely watering flowers
    of life’s problems, and can according to different soil moisture data were collected
    during different water irrigation, let flower growing in a proper soil temperature
    and humidity environment. References Sun, Q., Ma X.: A simple economical and practical

    \  \n \n \n7 \n \nAbstract \nIn recent years, the Smart City concept has grown\
    \ in popularity, and a \nsignificant number of cities around the world have adopted\
    \ smart city \nstrategies. Smart and sustainable cities are an emerging urban\
    \ \ndevelopment approach due to their immense potential to improve \nenvironmental\
    \ sustainability. The Smart City concept is based on \ncollecting, analyzing,\
    \ and displaying a large amount of data and \ninformation concerning urban systems\
    \ and subsystems. As time goes by, \nthe capacity of smart cities for generating\
    \ digital information has grown \nexponentially. However, this digital information\
    \ is heterogeneous, \nmassive, collected from different sources, generated in\
    \ different formats, \nand in most cases not structured, which exacerbates the\
    \ situation of \nextracting valuable knowledge from data. Therefore, it is fundamental\
    \ \nto handle the significant volumes of heterogeneous sensed data and to \nintegrate\
    \ such data along with information and analysis tools into a \ncomprehensive platform.\
    \  This can ensure the security, efficiency, and \nperformance of the different\
    \ Smart City tasks. A comprehensive \nsoftware platform could provide services\
    \ such as facilities for \napplication development, integration of heterogeneous\
    \ data sources, \ndeployment, and management to ease the construction of sophisticated\
    \ \nSmart Cities’ applications. In this context, the work begins with a concise\
    \ \ndescription of the concept of smart city and the technologies involved in\
    \ \nit. It addresses the development of an urban data platform along with \nhow\
    \ to obtain and integrate information from sensors and other data \nsources, in\
    \ order to provide aggregated and intelligent views of raw data \nto support various\
    \ domains within the city; in our case, smart mobility. \nThe platform architecture\
    \ is implemented following a five-layer model \nthat considers elements from perception,\
    \ sensing to data management, \nprocessing, and visualization. With the aim of\
    \ evaluating the efficiency \nof the developed platform, three different use cases\
    \ are described and \nanalyzed, which have been implemented in the city of Pamplona,\
    \ Spain, \n \nVIII \n \nas vertical services linked to the platform: intelligent\
    \ urban mobility-bike \nhandling, bike-2-bike communication, and restricted vehicle\
    \ access zone \ncontrol system. Ultimately, this work provides an experiment to\
    \ assess \ndifferent long-range wireless communication technologies to enable\
    \ \ntheir implementation within an urban environment.\n \n7 \n \nAcknowledgments\

    \ my supervisors, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues \nDr. Peio Lopez Iturri,\
    \ D. Imanol Picallo, and Dr. Hicham Klaina from \n“Luis Mercader” Lab for their\
    \ wonderful collaboration, support, and for \ntheir help to facilitate everything\
    \ during my research. \nFurthermore, yet importantly, I owe my deepest gratitude\
    \ to my \nfather, Mr. Jamal Al-Rahamneh, and my mother, Mrs. Ikram Hiyasat. \n\
    Their constant love and support keep me motivated and confident. My \naccomplishments\
    \ and successes are because they believed in me. My \ndeepest thanks to my sisters\
    \ and brother, who keep me grounded, \nremind me of what is important in life,\
    \ and always support me in this \nadventure. I am forever thankful for the unconditional\
    \ love and support \nfrom every one of them throughout the entire thesis process\
    \ and every \nday. To my family, I give everything, including this. Similarly,\
    \ other \nrelatives are also subjects to special thanks for their inspiration\
    \ and \ncooperation in my study. \n \n \n \n \nVIII \n \nOn the other hand, I\
    \ would like to thank all who helped facilitate my \nresearch stay at CSIRO, Melbourne,\
    \ Australia, and make that dream \ncome true. I acquired new skills, explored\
    \ my strengths and interests, \nand expanded my horizons. It was an experience\
    \ that I will always \nremember. \nIn addition, I would not forget to thank the\
    \ Pamplona City Council \nand Asociación Navarra de Informática Municipal (ANIMSA)\
    \ for their \ncollaboration in defining the functionality of the City App.  \n\
    Similarly, I would like to thank Dr. Jesús Villadangos Alonso, Mikel \nDíaz Noain,\
    \ and Almudena Ochoa Láinez for their collaboration and \nhelp.  \nLikewise, for\
    \ all whose supported me here in Spain, my friend, \ncolleagues, and above all\
    \ for Spain and their people, that country that \nmade me see the life and the\
    \ world in a different way. It has been an \nunforgettable experience. \nFinally,\
    \ this work was partially supported by the European Union’s \nHorizon 2020 Research\

    \ of my heart... THANKS!!! \n \n \n9 \n \nChapter 1  \n \n1 Introduction \n \n\
    \ \nITIES are the world's most rapidly expanding type of \nhabitation; nearly\
    \ 50% of humanity currently lives in cities. The \nUnited Nations (UN) projected\
    \ that 66% of the world \npopulation is estimated to be living in cities by 2050\
    \ [1]. Most of this \nurbanization is expected to be occurring in developing,\
    \ and emerging \neconomies where the infrastructure to support basic societal\
    \ needs such \nas clean water, food, energy, and sanitation are currently lacking.\
    \ \nIn this era, a large portion of the world’s resources are preoccupied by \n\
    cities; as a fact in modern world, 75% of the total energy is consumed by \nthe\
    \ cities [2]. Urban areas account for 67 % of global energy demand and \nconsume\
    \ 40 % of total global energy. This perpetual energy consumption \ngenerates nearly\
    \ 80% of the greenhouse gases that cause unfathomable \nadverse effects on the\
    \ environment [1] [3] [4]. \nIn anticipation of this rapid growth in urbanization\
    \ and the impending \necological impacts, the United Nations has established ‘The\
    \ 2030 \nSustainable Development Agenda’, listing 17 Sustainable Development \n\
    Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets for the period 2015–2030 [5][6][7][8]. \nAmong the\
    \ 17 goals, the first seven goals (No poverty; Zero hunger; \nGood health and\
    \ well-being; Quality education; gender equality; Clean \nwater and sanitation;\
    \ Affordable and clean energy) are an extension of \nUnited Nation’s Millennium\
    \ Developments Goals (MDGs); the other \nnewly introduced goals cover inclusiveness\
    \ (Decent work and economic \nC \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n10 \n \ngrowth; Industry,\
    \ innovation, and infrastructure; Reduce inequality) \nand sustainability and\
    \ urbanization (Sustainable cities and communities; \nResponsible consumption\
    \ and production; Climate action; Life under \nwater; Life on land; Peace, justice,\
    \ and strong institutions; Partnership \nfor the goals) [9]. Together, these SDGs\
    \ aim to end poverty, protect the \nplanet, and ensure peace and prosperity for\
    \ all. \n In a related context, the “The World in 2050” report presents six key\
    \ \ntransformations needed to achieve the SDGs in a manageable way, based \non\
    \ the major drivers of societal change, including human capacity, \nconsumption\
    \ and production, decarburization, and the digital \nrevolution [10]. These are:\
    \ \n1. Sustainable development is a societal challenge rather than an \nenvironmental\
    \ one. Human capacity needs to be substantially \nimproved through healthcare\
    \ and education – leading to higher \nincomes and better environmental decisions.\
    \ \n2. The need to reduce demand and adopt a circular economic \napproach, allowing\
    \ us to do more with fewer resources – \nresponsible consumption and production\
    \ cut across several \nother transitions. \n3. The energy system could be decarbonized\
    \ around 2050 through \nthe use of energy efficiency, more renewable, and electrification.\
    \ \n4. Increasing agricultural productivity and reducing meat \nconsumption is\
    \ necessary to ensure that everyone has access to \nnutritious food and clean\
    \ water while also safeguarding the \necosystem and the oceans. \n5. Smart cities:\
    \ Transforming our settlement patterns will benefit \nthe world population and\

    smart\" infrastructure. \n \n \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n11 \n \n6. The digital\
    \ revolution requires science, technology, and \ninnovation to support sustainable\
    \ development. It is unclear \nhow the Information Technology revolution will\
    \ be used in the \nfuture – society may choose to continue present trends or may\
    \ \ndecide to assert societal control over them. \nFigure 1.1 summarizes six key\
    \ transformations needed to achieve the \nSDGs. \n \n \nFigure 1.1: six key transformations\
    \ needed to achieve the SDGs (Source:[10]). \nIn the field of urban development,\
    \ sustainability has long been \nregarded as the prevailing paradigm. Urban sustainability\
    \ principles \nhave guided urban and metropolitan development to achieve higher\
    \ \nsocial, economic, and environmental sustainability standards. The \nprimary\
    \ objectives are to reduce urban carbon footprint and greenhouse \ngas emissions\
    \ by concentrating on resource and energy usage \nthroughout the construction,\
    \ operation, and maintenance of the built \nenvironment in cities. The goals implicitly\
    \ guided practical measures in \nenergy conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable\
    \ energy \ngeneration, which are all three aspects of 100% renewable energy \n\
    generation. Sustainability played a major role in the emergence of cities. \n\
    Chapter 1 - Introduction \n12 \n \nSustainable development of urban areas is a\
    \ key challenge for the \nfuture. It is necessary to introduce new, efficient,\
    \ and user-friendly \ntechnologies and services, in particular in the areas of\
    \ transport, energy, \nand information and communication technologies (ICT). It\
    \ is essential to \napply integrated solutions in terms of research and development\
    \ of \nadvanced technological solutions and deployment. \nAlthough urban sustainability\
    \ principles are important, they are \ninsufficient to assist cities in preparing\
    \ for a future transition to achieve \nsustainable development and become smart\
    \ sustainable cities. It will \nrequire the use of information and ICT and other\
    \ methods to enhance \nthe quality of life, the efficiency of city operation,\
    \ and service delivery. \nICT can help to improve energy efficiency in buildings,\
    \ transportation, \nand street lighting, among other things. It could also make\
    \ integrating \nlocally generated renewable energy into the power grid easier.\
    \ More \nimportantly, to encourage citizens to make more efficient and supportive\
    \ \nuse of municipal resources. \nThe majority of smart city proposals consist\
    \ of four main attributes i.e., \nsustainability, Quality of Life (QoL), urbanization,\
    \ and smartness [2][11]. \nFew sub-attributes are concerned under each attribute,\
    \ as illustrated in \nFigure 1.2. Pollution and waste, infrastructure and governance,\
    \ energy \nand climate change, economics, social issues, and health are the sub-\n\
    attributes that come under sustainability. The ability of a city to uphold \n\
    the balance of the eco system in all aspects, while serving and performing \n\
    city operations is known as the sustainability. The emotional and \nfinancial\
    \ well-being of urban citizens indicates the QoL improvement. \nUrbanization attribute\
    \ focuses on infrastructural, technological, \ngoverning aspects of the transformation\
    \ from rural environment to \nurban environment, and economical. The smartness\
    \ is defined as the \ndesire to improve the social, environmental, and economic\
    \ benchmarks \nof the city and its inhabitants. \n \nChapter 1 - Introduction\
    \ \n13 \n \n \nFigure 1.2: Main attributes of a Smart City (Source: [11]). \n\
    The European Commission launched the Smart Cities (SCs) strategy \nunder the Horizon\
    \ 2020 research and innovation program to support \ninitiatives that represent\
    \ an advance in the sustainability of its cities [12]. \nHorizon 2020 is the biggest\
    \ ever EU Research and Innovation \nprogramme with approximately €80 billion of\
    \ funding available over 7 \nyears (2014 to 2020) – not to mention the private\
    \ investment that this \nmoney will attract. It promises more breakthroughs, discoveries,\
    \ and \nworld-firsts by carrying great ideas from the lab to the market. The main\
    \ \naim of this project is to assist the use of smart urban technologies through\
    \ \nbringing cities together, businesses, and citizens to exhibit business’ \n\
    models and solutions that can be leveled up and reproduced. This would \nresult\
    \ in having smarter and more sustainable ecosystem. The city of \nPamplona (Spain)\
    \ [13], is one of seven European cities (Tampere \n(Finland), Trento (Italy) -\
    \ Lighthouse cities, which they will serve as a \nbasis prior to developing the\
    \ replication strategy suitable for other cities \ntermed as “follower cities”;\
    \ Cluj-Napoca (Romania), Derry (Ireland), \nKozani (Greece), and  Litomerice (Czech\
    \ Republic)) taking part in the \nSTARDUST project; which is one of the seventeen\
    \ Smart Cities and \nCommunities Lighthouse projects [14]. The challenges that\
    \ the city of \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n14 \n \nPamplona prioritized are related\
    \ to sustainability, mobility, and energy, \nwhich may not be that important in\
    \ other cities. The collaboration \nprovides valuable experiences, including testing\
    \ and validation \ntechnical solutions, innovative business models, and delivers\
    \ blueprints \nthat can be replicated in other European cities, and supports cities\
    \ in \ntheir transformation into smart cities. In this way, Pamplona cans avoid\
    \ \ninvesting in costly and expensive platform development from scratch. \nFurthermore,\
    \ Pamplona cans obtain a complete review of the strengths \nand weaknesses of\
    \ the available technologies that used by other cities in \nthe STARDUST project.\
    \  \nThe STARDUST project aims to develop urban solutions and integrate \nthe\
    \ domains of buildings, mobility, and efficient energy in order to pave \nthe\
    \ way towards a low carbon, highly efficient, intelligent, and citizen-\noriented\
    \ cities. through ICT as illustrated in Figure 1.3. The aim to be \nachieved is\
    \ to test and validate these solutions allowing their rapid \nimplementation in\
    \ the market.  \n \nFigure 1.3: Stardust project key elements. \nThe STARDUST\
    \ project demonstrates how the proper integration of \nthese actions, jointly\
    \ with other non-technical measures, can provide an \neffective platform for encouraging\
    \ citizen participation. Through a \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n15 \n \nrevolutionary\
    \ productive model based on eco-innovation technologies, \nsharing information\
    \ from different inputs and citizen collaboration \nwould improve citizens' quality\
    \ of life while improving local economies. \nIn this perspective, the transformation\
    \ of public transport towards more \nsustainable vehicles is a significant feature\
    \ to improve, among others, air \nquality and noise pollution in cities. \nDifferent\
    \ definitions in the literature have been used to define SCs \nconsidering various\
    \ aspects and perspectives. Harrison et al. [15], have \nproposed a popular definition\
    \ states that a SC connects physical, social, \nbusiness, and ICT infrastructure\
    \ to uplift the intelligence of the city. \nWang et al. [16], Zanella et al. [17],\
    \ Belissent et al. [18], and Ianuale et \nal. [19],  have developed a comprehensive\
    \ definition states that SCs are \nurban areas that use ICTs to support several\
    \ metropolitan areas and \nservices, such as governance, to develop a supportive\
    \ process for urban \nplanning and mobility, which aims not only to provide on-demand\
    \ \nservices, but also to adapt some services and an environment that deals \n\
    with pollution and energy efficiency issues. \nKondepudi et al. [20], have sat\
    \ another comprehensive definition \nstates that SC is defined as an advanced\
    \ modern city that utilizes ICT \nand other technologies to improve QoL, competitiveness,\
    \ operational \nefficacy of urban services, while ensuring the resource availability\
    \ for \npresent and future generations in terms of social, economic, and \nenvironmental\
    \ aspects. \nThe functional definition to SC is a \" integrated system of systems\"\
    \ or \n“fusion of functional systems”, that incorporates a set of smart systems,\
    \ \nincluding smart transportation and mobility, smart lighting systems, \nsmart\
    \ building and automation systems, water treatment and supply, \nsecurity and\
    \ access control systems, disaster and emergency \nmanagement systems, smart grids,\
    \ and renewable energy, the urban \nagenda (cultural and leisure activities...),\
    \ the tourist offer and even more; \nto enhance performance efficiency of regular\
    \ city operations and quality \nof services (QoS) provided to urban citizens as\
    \ shown in Figure 1.4. \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n16 \n \n \nFigure 1.4: Smart\
    \ city system of systems(Source: [21]). \nThe utmost goal of initial SC is to\
    \ enhance the QoL of urban citizens \nby reducing the contradiction between demand\
    \ and supply in various \nfunctionalities [17]. In order to accommodate QoL demands\
    \ and fulfill \nthe intense needs of urbanization, modern SCs focus on sustainable\
    \ and \nefficient solutions for energy management, transportation, health care,\
    \ \ngovernance, and many other areas [22]. \nSCs aim to improve the use of public\
    \ resources, improve the QoS \nprovided to residents, reduce government operational\
    \ expenditure, and \ninvolve citizens in the smooth operation and efficiency of\
    \ their city. The \nSCs which are built on top of wide-ranging Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) \nsystems, are rapidly expanding around the world and offer an excellent\
    \ \nopportunity in a variety of cross-domain sectors [23]. \nIoT is defined as\
    \ a network of heterogeneous, Internet-connected \nphysical objects, including\
    \ devices, sensors, actuators or systems \n(\"things/objects\") that can be remotely\
    \ accessed over the Internet, collect \nand exchange information (\"data\") that\
    \ can be analyzed and aggregated \nto monitor, maintain, and improve processes\
    \ to deliver products and \nsolutions (“services”) to consumers [17]. IoT is a\
    \ representation of the \nphysical world that enables both physical and virtual\
    \ interaction \nbetween devices and users [24]. IoT-enabled applications are rapidly\
    \ \nbeing developed in many domains, such as energy management, \nChapter 1 -\
    \ Introduction \n17 \n \nbuilding management, waste management, traffic control,\
    \ mobility, \nhealth care, assisted living, and many others. Therefore, the IoT\
    \ is \nconsidered a key enabler for smart and sustainable cities [25][26][27].\
    \ In \nChapter 2, we provide a comprehensive vision of the IoT, and the \ntechnologies\
    \ involved in it. \nIn fact, most cities have the basic requirements to become\
    \ SCs such as, \nICT infrastructure, and IoT applications, but the difference\
    \ between \nthem is the degree/grade of intelligence/smartness that they seek\
    \ to \nreach, and the problems/challenges that each city is trying to find \n\
    solutions to. Even though the SC concept is widely accepted and \npractically\
    \ implemented in the real world, the high-speed development \nand adaptation of\
    \ the IoT applications in SC domains have resulted in \nthe emergence of heterogeneous\
    \ IoT architectures, standards, middle-\nwares, and applications. This heterogeneity\
    \ (from hardware to \napplication level) is a challenge that needs to be highlighted\
    \ in order to \nensure seamless harmony between the various SC domains, allowing\
    \ \neffective data exchange between them, thereby achieving greater \nefficiency\
    \ in the services provided by these domains. \nTo overcome these challenges, SCs\
    \ need to figure out how to use the \nadvanced technologies gathered under the\
    \ IoT umbrella to subsidize \nsynchronization between the three elements of SCs:\
    \ 1)\"objects\", 2) \"data\", \nand 3) \"services\" [28][29][30], as shown in\
    \ Figure 1.5. \n \nObjects: The \"objects\" in the IoT system consist of enormous\
    \ \ndevices such as sensors, cars, thermostats, industrial robots, \ntablets,\
    \ and smartphones. These devices could be connected \nanytime and wherever. They\
    \ have a high degree of \nheterogeneity in terms of the communication resources\
    \ of \ndevices, protocols, technologies, and hardware, which leads to \ndifferent\
    \ types and formats of data depending on the purpose \nfor which they are used.\
    \ The “objects” represent IoT integration \nof the physical with virtual systems.\
    \ \n \nData: The “data” in the IoT system is heterogeneous, massive, \nChapter\
    \ 1 - Introduction \n18 \n \ncollected from different sources, generated in different\
    \ formats, \nand in most cases not structured, which exacerbates the situation\
    \ \nas shown in Figure 1.5. Therefore, the highly dynamic nature of \nSC requires\
    \ sophisticated, advanced insights that are data-\ndriven, flexible, and adaptable\
    \ to harmoniously cope with the \nhighly dynamic heterogeneous environment and\
    \ decentralized \nintelligence for the management of multi-agent systems. \n\
    \ \nServices: that provide customizable and scalable value \npropositions to observe\
    \ the dynamic environment, support \napplication development, informed decision-making\
    \ and \nprovide effective services accordingly. These services cover \nfields\
    \ such as transportation (smart road Networks, connected \nvehicles, and smart\
    \ public transport), public utilities (smart \nelectricity, water, and gas distribution),\
    \ education, health and \nsocial care, public safety. \n \n \nFigure 1.5: Three\
    \ elements of SCs (Source: Author, [31], [32], and [33]).  \nChapter 1 - Introduction\
    \ \n19 \n \nOn the other hand, the systems that control and operate today’s cities\
    \ \nand communities typically function mainly in a siloed manner, with little\
    \ \nor no connectivity to other systems, as shown in Figure 1.6.  \n \nFigure\
    \ 1.6: Siloed IoT Applications (Source: [34]). \nCities do not function in such\
    \ a siloed fashion. The occurrence of an \nevent in one system can affect the\
    \ occurrence of an event in another \nsystem throughout the city. Drainage and\
    \ flood control systems can \nimpact both emergency management and traffic management\
    \ systems. \nThe power systems in the city have a critical impact on almost every\
    \ role. \nWhen power usage peaks on hot days, how may a city use its energy \n\
    management systems, intelligent building controls, or lighting controls \nto reduce\
    \ peak load? By monitoring and analyzing the usage of city \nassets, the government\
    \ can adequately distribute the assets to improve \noperational efficiencies.\
    \ \nBasic services provided by the underlying software infrastructure are \nrequired\
    \ to integrate these domains into a complete and consistent \nsolution. Figure\
    \ 1.7 shows the smart domains for Smart Cities. \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n\
    20 \n \n \nFigure 1.7: Smart domains for Smart Cities (Source: Author and [35]).\
    \  \nTo overcome these challenges and promote the development of SCs, \nthe primary\
    \ focus should be on the accessibility of objects and services, \nand to build\
    \ an architecture that enables multiple information sources to \nbe integrated\
    \ into a single framework by reusing infrastructure, data, \nand services [36][37][38][39].\
    \  \nIn this sense, overcoming market fragmentation and achieving \ninteroperability\
    \ between established SC silos through global standards \nand interworking mechanisms\
    \ are critical to the successful adoption of \nsmart cities [17][40][41].   \n\
    A comprehensive software platform could provide such services, \nincluding \n\
    facilities \nfor \napplication \ndevelopment, \nintegration, \ndeployment, and\
    \ management to ease the construction of sophisticated \nSCs applications. \n\
    A Smart City Platform (SCP) is an open and interoperable system that \ncan securely\
    \ consume heterogeneous data and events from a wide range \nof subsystems and\
    \ data sources throughout the city and deliver \nmeaningful insights and results-oriented\
    \ recommendations to city \nmanagers, partner organizations, and the general public\
    \ as shown in \nFigure 1.8.  \n \n \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n21 \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 1.8: Schematic diagram of Smart City Platform (Source: Author, [42], \nand [43]).\
    \ \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n22 \n \nSCP serves to unify data and information\
    \ from the many-siloed \nsystems. The SCP provides a standard mechanism for visualizing\
    \ and \nmanaging data, and most importantly, optimizes overall city operations.\
    \ \nOwner-operators and end-users are beginning to realize the value of \nunified\
    \ SCP. The SCP can provide seamless access to data across \nmultiple systems and\
    \ operating domains to create a harmonious and \nholistic view of the overall\
    \ performance and state of the city and its \nvarious functions.  \nHowever, many\
    \ challenging issues still need to be addressed before a \nhighly effective platform\
    \ for SCs can be created, including the following: \nenabling \ninteroperability\
    \ \nbetween \na \ncity’s \nmultiple \nsystems, \nguaranteeing citizens’ privacy,\
    \ managing large amounts of data, \nsupporting the required scalability, and dealing\
    \ with a large variety of \nsensors. \n \n1.1 \nObjectives  \nThe motivation of\
    \ this thesis is to propose an integrated solution to \nunify siloed smart IoT\
    \ systems within the city, including smart \ntransportation, smart buildings,\
    \ environmental sensing, and many more, \ninto a single, open, and interoperable\
    \ environment; an SCP can securely \nmanage and analyze heterogeneous data across\
    \ domains and can deliver \nmeaningful insights and outcome-driven recommendations\
    \ to city \nmanagers, partner organizations, and the public. In this sense, the\
    \ \nthesis's contribution focuses on the study of the essential requirements,\
    \ \nfunctionalities, information technology infrastructure, ICT, and \narchitecture\
    \ required for successfully developing such a comprehensive \nSC ecosystem platform.\
    \ It provides context for the massive array of data. \nIt turns these data into\
    \ actionable, contextualized information to achieve \nbetter, sustainable outcomes\
    \ that can be used to reduce energy \nconsumption and operational costs and inform\
    \ planning and \npolicymaking while improving citizens' overall safety and quality\
    \ of life. \nThe desired goals of this dissertation are: \nChapter 1 - Introduction\
    \ \n23 \n \n \nTo propose an architecture for a Smart City Ecosystem Platform\
    \ \nas a supportive infrastructure in the development of an SC, \nwhere people,\
    \ processes, policies, technology, and other \nenablers work together to deliver\
    \ a set of outcomes. It allows the \nintegration of diverse sensors, machines,\
    \ people, vehicles, and \nother devices across a wide range of applications and\
    \ usage \ncircumstances. The interoperability process between the \nplatform and\
    \ these heterogeneous components will be taken \ninto account to ensure a smooth\
    \ integration, regardless of data \nformats or standards, through open standards,\
    \ open APIs, open \ndocumentation, and accessible open data models. Finally, the\
    \ \nplatform design will ensure reliability, scalability, service \nquality, security,\
    \ and compliance. \n \nTo evaluate the enabling networking technologies, protocols,\
    \ \ncharacteristics, and requirements for opportunistic data \ngathering and data\
    \ exchange with respect to smart cities \napplications.  \n \nTo provide/introduce\
    \ intelligent urban mobility solutions to \ncitizens as vertical services linked\
    \ to the platform, in which all \ndata collected, processed, and related to mobility\
    \ is provided by \nthe platform in an accessible way for sustainable and intelligent\
    \ \nmobility that reduces unnecessary journeys and allows for better \nuse and\
    \ exploitation of roads. \n \nTo engage citizens and external stakeholders through\
    \ \nworkshops, \nco-creation \nactivities, \nearly \ninvolvement, \nhackathons,\
    \ open data, etc., is an open-ended task (Co-\nresponsibility between citizens\
    \ and administrations). \nA schematic description of the elements analyzed within\
    \ this work is \ndepicted in Figure 1.9. \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n24 \n \n\
    \ \nFigure 1.9: Schematic description of the thesis objectives. \n1.2 \nRelated\
    \ work \nThe advent of the IoT has led to an increasingly broad range of sensors,\
    \ \ncomputing technologies, and services, which has led to many new SCP \nofferings.\
    \ We will analyze some of the most relevant contributions in the \nfield of SCPs.\
    \ \nKazmi et al. [44], have presented a VITAL (Virtualized programmable \nInTerfAces\
    \ for innovative cost-effective IoT depLoyments) platform for \nmodeling heterogeneous\
    \ IoT data streams to overcome the challenge of \nheterogeneity. The main objective\
    \ of the VITAL platform is to facilitate \nthe development process of cross-platform\
    \ and cross-context IoT based \napplications for smart cities. The VITAL platform\
    \ uses linked data \nstandards for modelling and accessing data including Resource\
    \ \nDescription Framework (RDF) as a basic data model, JSON-LD as the \ndata format,\
    \ and ontologies to specify the data in a formal way. This \nallows VITAL applications\
    \ to integrate other data sources in the Web, \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n25\
    \ \n \nresulting in a large and varied set of usable data items. The European\
    \ \nPlatform for Intelligent Cities (EPIC) project proposes a complete IoT \n\
    Middleware to facilitate the use and management of Wireless Sensor \nNetworks\
    \ (WSN) [45]. This middleware aims to deal with the \nheterogeneity, \ninteroperability,\
    \ \nscalability, \nextensibility, \nand \nreconfigurability problems in a WSN.\
    \ \nValencia Smart City (VLCi) [46] is a platform launched in 2014 by the \nCity\
    \ Council of Valencia, Spain. VLCi arose from the need of improving \nthe efficiency\
    \ of public services provided by the City Hall and to \npromote the Valencia innovation\
    \ environment. Such a platform can \nprovide information based on 350 indicators,\
    \ including data related to \ntraffic, street lighting, gardens, local police,\
    \ pollution levels, etc. VLCi \nsupports several types of information such as\
    \ unstructured, structured, \nand geo-referenced data coming from citizens' smartphones,\
    \ sensors \nscattered throughout the city, and external systems. The platform\
    \ also \nallows generating several types of reports, querying, and analyzing data,\
    \ \nand visualizing information about the city at real-time through a \ndashboard.\
    \ Sanchez et al. [47], have presented the deployment and \nexperimentation  the\
    \ testbed architecture of the IoT experimentation \nfacility being deployed at\
    \ Santander city, Spain; SmartSantander. The \nplatform is capable of processing\
    \ a wide range of of information, \nincluding data about traffic conditions, temperature,\
    \ CO2 emissions, \nhumidity, and luminosity. Currently, the project has placed\
    \ more than \n20,000 sensors in the city. With  a  close  concept  to  the SmartSantander\
    \  \nis  the  Oulo  Smart  City [48] (Oulu,  Northern Finland) and CitySense \n\
    [49] (Cambridge, USA).  UrbanSense [50] is deployed in the city of Porto, \nPortugal,\
    \ and collects key environ-mental data from sensors, such as air \nquality parameters,\
    \ solar radiation, noise, precipitation and wind speed \nand direction. City of\
    \ Things [51] (Antwerp, Belgium), a city-wide open \ntestbed infrastructure, considers\
    \ the use of LoRa technology to allow \nexperiments at the network, data and user\
    \ levels. Zanella et al in [17] \npresented a Padova Smart City project; a proof-of-concept\
    \ deployment \nChapter 1 - Introduction \n26 \n \nof an IoT island to create a\
    \ sensor network in the city of Padova, Italy. \nUsing more than 300 sensors,\
    \ the platform collects environmental data, \nsuch as CO2 emissions and air temperature\
    \ and monitors streetlights. A \nfeature highlighted in this platform is the use\
    \ of common protocols and \ndata formats to allow interoperability among multiple\
    \ city systems.   \n BIG IoT [52] is an EU H2020 project that aims at enabling\
    \ the \nemergence of cross-standard, cross-platform, and cross-domain IoT \nservices\
    \ and applications. Civitas [53] is a middleware that addresses \nsome challenges\
    \ related to the development of applications for smart \ncities, such as scalability,\
    \ heterogeneity, geolocation information, and \nprivacy issues. The platform is\
    \ composed by several core nodes \nproviding relevant services to the city. A\
    \ core node can be maintained \nby either public or private institutions interested\
    \ in providing services to \nthe city and/or taking advantage of the data produced\
    \ by it. Civitas also \nenables entities (citizens, companies, public institutions,\
    \ etc.) and \nphysical devices to connect to the platform to consume and share\
    \ \ninformation relevant to the city, as well as to combine them with \ninformation\
    \ regarding the physical space of the city. In addition, Civitas \nsupports features\
    \ such as processing audio and video streams, publish-\nsubscribe based communication\
    \ and complex events. Vilajosana et \nal. [54], have proposed a generic and conceptual\
    \ platform to support \nheterogeneous smart city applications. All interaction\
    \ between \napplications and the platform is performed through APIs based on Web\
    \ \nservices. \nThe \nproposed \narchitecture \nencompasses \ncomponents \nrepresenting\
    \ sensors and actuators, components for real-time data \nstorage and historical\
    \ data, etc. \nTei and Gurgen [55], have proposed a two-layer architecture to\
    \ collect \ndata from the WSN and manage the sensors and actuators in the city\
    \ \nnetwork. The first layer, \"Sensors and Actuators Layer,\" is responsible\
    \ \nfor handling data from the WSN. The \"IoT Kernel\" Layer, the second \nlayer,\
    \ supervises and monitors the network of sensors and actuators. The \nwork based\
    \ on ClouT [56]; a collaborative project jointly funded by the \nChapter 1 - Introduction\
    \ \n27 \n \n7th Framework Programme of the European Commission and by the \nNational\
    \ Institute of Information and Communications Technology of \nJapan. \nElmangoush\
    \ et al. [57], have presented Open Machine Type \nCommunications (OpenMTC); a\
    \ Machine-To-Machine (M2M) based \ncommunication platform for Smart Cities. Its\
    \ goal is to enable effective \ncommunication among a large number of devices\
    \ by connecting them to \na variety of services. The platform accomplishes this\
    \ by supporting \nstandard interfaces to many types of devices, real-time data/event\
    \ \nprocessing mechanisms, and easy application development via a \nsoftware development\
    \ kit. De Amicis et al. [58], have presented i-SCOPE \n(Interoperable Smart City\
    \ services through an Open Platform for urban \nEcosystems) is a platform that\
    \ provides three types of services to SCs \nincluding enhancing citizen inclusion\
    \ and mobility with routing systems \nand barrier signaling in the city; optimizing\
    \ energy consumption; and \nenvironmental control. \n \nThingWorx [59] is another\
    \ IoT platform that facilitates the \ndevelopment of Smart City applications and\
    \ has already been adopted \nby many corporations. As part of the IoT/cloud convergence,\
    \ the \nOpenIoT (Open Source cloud solution for Internet of Things) is an open-\n\

    covered, begin with the IoT, its current architectural trends, and \nthe IoT protocols\
    \ used as part of our performance evaluation of the SCP \nand smart mobility.\
    \ \n2.1 \nIntroduction  \nIoT is one of the most talked-about and disputed topics\
    \ in today's ICT, \nand it is gaining ground rapidly in the scenario of wireless\
    \ \ncommunications. The term IoT was first coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 \nin\
    \ the context of supply chain management [62]. The Auto-ID Labs [63], \na global\
    \ network of academic research laboratories in the field of \nnetworked RFID and\
    \ new sensing technologies, is credited with coining \nthe term \"Internet of\
    \ Things.\", and have been targeted to architect the \nIoT, together with EPCglobal\
    \ [64]. The basic idea behind this concept is \nthe ubiquitous presence around\
    \ us of a variety of objects or things – such \nas sensors, RFID tags, actuators,\
    \ Smartphones, and so on – that, through \nunique addressing schemes, are able\
    \ to interact with one another and \ncollaborate with their neighbors to achieve\
    \ common goals [65][66]. \nA radical development of the current Internet into\
    \ a network of \ninterconnected objects that not only gathers data from the environment\
    \ \n(sensing) \nand \ninteracts \nwith \nthe \nphysical \nworld \n(actuation/command/control),\
    \ but also uses existing Internet standards \nto provide services for information\
    \ transfer, analysis, applications, and \nT \nChapter 2 - Background \n31 \n \n\
    communications.  \nAtzori et al.  [66], have identified that the IoT can be realized\
    \ in three \nmodels—internet-oriented (middleware), things-oriented (sensors),\
    \ and \nsemantic-oriented (knowledge), as seen in Figure 2.1. \n \n \nFigure 2.1:\
    \ Three models of Internet of Things (Source:[66]). \nForrester [18] defined IoT\
    \ as a smart environment that uses \ninformation and communications technologies\
    \ to make the critical \ninfrastructure components and services of a city’s administration,\
    \ \neducation, healthcare, public safety, real estate, transportation and \nutilities\
    \ more aware, interactive, and efficient. \nThe \"Web of Things\" is another vision\
    \ associated with the IoT, in \nwhich Web standards are re-used to connect and\
    \ integrate everyday-life \nobjects containing an embedded device or computer\
    \ into the Web [67]. \nSo, based on the above, the IoT is a network of heterogeneous,\
    \ \ninterrelated, and internet-connected of connected things, sensors, \nChapter\
    \ 2 - Background \n32 \n \nactuators, and other smart technologies, that can collect\
    \ and exchange \ndata via the Internet and allowing for person to- person and\
    \ object-to-\nobject communication. \n2.2 \nIoT Architecture \nThe IoT includes\
    \ an increasing number of smart, interconnected \ngadgets and sensors that are\
    \ frequently nonintrusive, transparent, where \nthe communication between these\
    \ devices, as well as with connected \nservices, should occur at any time and\
    \ in any location, and it is frequently \ndone wirelessly and autonomously. Services\
    \ become far more \nfragmented and sophisticated. As a result, IoT architecture\
    \ is essential to \nmanage the complexity. In this sense, architecture refers\
    \ to a framework \nthat specifies the physical components of a network, as well\
    \ as their \nfunctional organization and configuration, operational rules and\
    \ \nprocedures, and data formats used in its operation. The key qualities of \n\
    a sustainable IoT ecosystem are functionality, scalability, availability, \nmaintainability,\
    \ and cost-effectiveness, which are all provided by the IoT \narchitecture. \n\
    There is no broadly agreed-upon architecture for the IoT, different \nresearchers\
    \ have proposed various architectures, and the basic model is \na 3-layer architecture\
    \ consisting of the Application, Network, and \nPerception Layers [68][69]. The\
    \ three-layer architecture defines the core \nconcept of the IoT; however, it\
    \ is insufficient for IoT research because it \nfrequently concentrates on smaller\
    \ details. The five-layer architecture \nthat additionally includes the Middleware\
    \ and Business layers \nconsidered as the best-proposed architecture of IoT, especially\
    \ when the \nproject is carried out using a variety of cutting-edge technology\
    \ and a \nwide range of applications [69][70]. The five layers are perception,\
    \ \ntransport, middleware, application, and business layers, as shown in \nFigure\
    \ 2.2. \n \nChapter 2 - Background \n33 \n \n \n    Figure 2.2: IoT layered architecture.\
    \   \nThe perception layer is responsible for sensing and gathering \ninformation\
    \ about the environment, and then pass data to another layer \nso that some actions\
    \ can be taken based on that information. The network \nlayer is responsible for\
    \ communication between perception and \nmiddleware layer, and for data transmission\
    \ using networking \ntechnologies. The middleware layer is where the data that\
    \ comes from \nthe network layer is stored, processed and analyzed.  The application\
    \ \nlayer; manages all application processes based on the information \nobtained\
    \ from the middleware layer. The business layer; manages the \nwhole IoT system,\
    \ including applications, business and profit models, \nand users’ privacy. It\
    \ involves making flowcharts, graphs, analysis of \nresults, and how device can\
    \ be improved, etc. \nWe describe next the most important components and architectural\
    \ \nelements in the IoT, as described and categorized in the extensive \nsurveys\
    \ performed by Gubbi et al. [71], Li et al.  [72], Atzori et al. [66], \nSalman\
    \ et al. [73], Santa et al. [74], Mekki et al. [75], and Al-Fuqaha et al. \n[76].\
    \ \nChapter 2 - Background \n34 \n \n2.2.1 \nPerception layer \nThe perception\
    \ layer is the physical layer and exists at the lowest level \nof the IoT Architecture,\
    \ which begins with the \"things\" themselves. The \nlayer consists of different\
    \ types of sensors (i.e. RFID, QR code, Infrared, \ncameras, etc.) devices. This\
    \ layer generally in a smart environment \nscenario cope with overall device management,\
    \ such as device \nidentification and data gathering by each sort of sensor device.\
    \ The \ngathered information can be location, wind speed, temperature, pH \nlevel,\
    \ humidity, air quality, amount of dust in the air, etc. This gathered \ninformation\
    \ transmits through the Network layer for its secure \ncommunication toward middleware\
    \ layer. \n2.2.2 \nCommunication/Transmission Layer \nThe communication layer\
    \ integrates several layers of the Open \nSystems Interconnection (OSI) seven-layer\
    \ model for data networks [73]. \nThe OSI network model is a network model developed\
    \ by the \nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) [77]. OSI’s \n\
    functions are divided into seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, \nTransport,\
    \ Session, Presentation, and Application Layer. Each layer \nprovides unique and\
    \ redundant protection to address security issues \nand potential risks related\
    \ to data intrusion, manipulation, destruction, \nand so on.  \nThree of OSI’s\
    \ layers are playing a significant role in communication \nand data transmission,\
    \ which are the data link layer, network layer, and \nsession layer: \n \nData\
    \ link layer: The data link layer connects IoT elements, either \ntwo sensors\
    \ or a sensor, and a gateway device that connects a set \nof sensors to the Internet.\
    \ It aims to provide functional and \nprocedural means to transfer data between\
    \ network entities, \ndetect, and possibly correct errors in the Physical Layer.\
    \ The \ndata link layer is divided into two sub-layers based on the \nChapter\
    \ 2 - Background \n35 \n \narchitecture used in the IEEE 802 Project (Institute\
    \ of Electrical \nand Electronics Engineers): logical link control (LLC) and media\
    \ \naccess control (MAC) [78]. It defines many wired and wireless \nlocal area\
    \ networking (LAN) technologies, including Ethernet \nand IEEE 802.11 (“wireless\
    \ Ethernet” or “Wi-Fi”) [79]. IEEE 802 \nis now the home of several wireless network\
    \ standardization \nprojects that use its highly successful development system[80].\
    \ \n \nNetwork Layer: The Network Layer describes the functions of \ninternetworks.\
    \ It manages the subnet's functions, deciding \nwhich physical path data should\
    \ take based on network \nconditions, service priority, and other criteria. It\
    \ makes the \ntraffic decisions, traffic control, fragmentation, and logical \n\
    addressing. The Network Layer is also in charge of relaying and \nrouting data\
    \ across as many concatenated networks as necessary \nwhile maintaining the quality-of-service\
    \ parameters requested \nby the Transport Layer. \n \nTransport/session layers:\
    \ The session layer protocols enable \nmessaging among various elements of the\
    \ IoT communication \nsubsystem and ensures reliable and efficient communication\
    \ \nbetween network devices. The Transport Layer aims to provide \ntransparent\
    \ transfer of data between end systems. As a result, \nthe upper layers relieve\
    \ themselves from any concern of not \nreceiving reliable and cost-effective data\
    \ delivery. It has \nconnection oriented and connectionless protocols, which are\
    \ \nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram \nProtocol (UDP) respectively.\
    \ TCP provides reliability and data \nmanagement services while UDP does not.\
    \ \n2.2.2.1 IoT Data link Protocols \nThis section discusses the data link layer\
    \ protocols and standards. The \ndiscussion includes physical (PHY) and MAC layer\
    \ protocols, which are \ncombined by most standards. \nChapter 2 - Background\
    \ \n36 \n \n2.2.2.1.1 \nBluetooth Classic  \nThe Bluetooth Classic radio, also\
    \ known as Bluetooth Basic \nRate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR), is a low-power\
    \ radio that streams \ndata over 79 channels in the 2.4GHz unlicensed industrial,\
    \ scientific, and \nmedical (ISM) frequency band[81][82]. It uses the specification\
    \ of the \nIEEE 802.15.1 standard. Bluetooth BR/EDR supports point-to-point \n\
    device communication and uses to enable data transfer applications and \nwireless\
    \ audio streaming. It has become the standard radio protocol \nbehind wireless\
    \ speakers, headphones, and in-car entertainment \nsystems. \n2.2.2.1.2 Bluetooth\
    \ Low Energy \nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE), also known as Bluetooth Smart, was\
    \ \ndefined for the first time in 2010 by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group\
    \ \n(SIG) as part of the Bluetooth 4.0 specification, and it has emerged as a\
    \ \npowerful low-power wireless technology transmitting data over 40 \nchannels\
    \ in the 2.4GHz unlicensed ISM frequency band [83][84][85]. BLE \nsupports various\
    \ communication topologies, ranging from point-to-\npoint to broadcast and, most\
    \ recently, mesh, allowing for establishing \nreliable, large-scale device networks[82].\
    \ Furthermore, the Internet \nEngineering Task Force (IETF) has developed the\
    \ adaptation layer to \nsupport Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over BLE, which\
    \ facilitates the \nconnectivity of BLE devices to the IoT [86]. BLE has achieved\
    \ a dominant \nposition in smartphones by leveraging standard Bluetooth circuitry\
    \ to a \nconsiderable extent [84]. This allows smartphones to communicate with\
    \ \nother devices such as sensors, actuators, and wearables via low-energy \n\
    communication, as shown in Figure 2.3. BLE is widely employed as a \npositioning\
    \ technology to meet the growing need for high accuracy \nindoor location services.\
    \ \nChapter 2 - Background \n37 \n \n \nFigure 2.3: BLE Key features and applications\
    \ (Source:[87]).  \n2.2.2.1.3 IEEE 802.11ah \nIEEE 802.11ah or Wi-Fi HaLow is\
    \ the least overhead version of IEEE \n802.11 standards, which is lightweight\
    \ to meet IoT needs. The original \nWiFi standards (IEEE 802.11) are unsuitable\
    \ for IoT applications due to \ntheir frame overhead and high-power consumption.\
    \ Hence, IEEE 802.11 \nworking group initiated the 802.11ah task group to develop\
    \ a standard \nthat supports low overhead, power-friendly communication suitable\
    \ for \nsensors and motes. The 802.11ah can be used for various purposes, \nincluding\
    \ a very large sensor network, as depicted in Figure 2.4, \nincreasing the range\
    \ of hotspots and outdoors Wi-Fi that can be used for \ncellular traffic offloading.\
    \ \n \nFigure 2.4: 802.11ah Network Model (Source: [88]). \nChapter 2 - Background\
    \ \n38 \n \n2.2.2.1.4 IEEE 802.15.4 \nIEEE 802.15.4 is a data link standard that\
    \ is commonly used in the \nMAC layer. The standard specifies the frame format,\
    \ headers, \ndestination, and source addresses and identifies how nodes can \n\
    communicate with each other. The traditional frame formats used in \nnetworking\
    \ are not suitable for power-constrained IoT devices. IEEE \n802.15.4e was created\
    \ in 2008 to extend IEEE 802.15.4 and support low-\npower communication. It uses\
    \ time synchronization and channel \nhopping to enable high-reliability, low-cost\
    \ communication in IoT data \nlinks. \n Figure 2.5 shows the various layers of\
    \ the  ZigBee wireless technology \narchitecture the relationship of the  IEEE\
    \  802.15.4  standard to the  \nZigBee alliance  MAC  layer protocol model. \n\
    \ \nFigure 2.5: IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee architecture reference (Source: Author\
    \ \nand [89]).  \nChapter 2 - Background \n39 \n \n2.2.2.1.5 WirelessHART \nWirelessHART\
    \ is a MAC layer standard that works on top of IEEE \n802.15.4 PHY and uses time\
    \ division multiple access (TDMA) in its MAC. \nIt meets some fundamental requirements,\
    \ including easy use and \ndeployment, self-organizing and self-healing, being\
    \ flexible to support \ndifferent applications, and being scalable, reliable,\
    \ and secure. \nWirelessHART encrypts messages and verifies their integrity using\
    \ \nadvanced encryption algorithms. As a result, it is more secure and \ntrustworthy\
    \ than others. Its architecture consists of a network manager, \nsecurity manager,\
    \ and gateway to connect the wireless network to the \nwired networks, such as\
    \ field devices, access points, routers, and \nadapters. The standard offers end-to-end,\
    \ per-hop, or peer-to-peer \nsecurity mechanisms. End-to-end security mechanisms\
    \ enforce security \nfrom sources to destinations, while per-hop mechanisms only\
    \ secure it \nto the next hop. Figure 2.6 illustrates an example of a WirelessHART\
    \ \nnetwork. \n \nFigure 2.6: WirelessHART network for smart water meters (Source:[90]).\
    \ \nHowever, WirelessHART does not support dynamic and mobile large-\nscale networks\
    \ due to a centralized network management scheme which \nChapter 2 - Background\
    \ \n40 \n \nlimits flexibility, not being, therefore, a dominant \nstandard. \n\
    WirelessHART does not meet the strict and stringent QoS requirements \nof industrial\
    \ systems. For example, it does not guarantee end-to-end \nwireless communication\
    \ delay tolerance capacity [91][92]. \n2.2.2.1.6 Z-Wave \nZ-Wave is a low-power\
    \ MAC protocol that was originally developed \nfor home automation but is now\
    \ widely utilized in IoT applications such \nas smart homes and small commercial\
    \ domains, as shown in Figure 2.7. \nIt supports point-to-point communication\
    \ over a distance of up to 30 \nmeters and is ideal for sending short messages.\
    \ In addition to tiny ACK \n(Acknowledgement) messages for reliable transmission,\
    \ Z-Wave \nincorporates Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance\
    \ \n(CSMA/CA) for media access. It has a master/slave architecture, with the \n\
    master controlling the slaves, sending them commands, and managing \nthe network's\
    \ schedule.  Z-Wave has a number of limitations, mainly its \ndata transmission\
    \ speed, which is 100 Kbps unlike Wi-Fi and Bluetooth \ntechnologies, its limited\
    \ number of nodes, unlike Zigbee, while limiting \nthe number of allowed hubs\
    \ to four, and its topology structure, which \nsupports only a tree topology structure,\
    \ makes it a legacy technology. \n \nFigure 2.7: Z-Wave Mesh Routing (Source:[93]).\
    \  \n2.2.2.1.7 \nZigBee Smart Energy \nZigBee is one of the most commonly used\
    \ standards in IoT dedicated \nto medium-range communication in smart homes, remote\
    \ controls, and \nChapter 2 - Background \n41 \n \nhealthcare systems, as shown\
    \ in Figure 2.8. Its networking topologies \ninclude peer-to-peer, or cluster-tree,\
    \ and star. A coordinator controls the \nnetwork, located at the center of a star\
    \ topology. It is the root of a tree or \ncluster topology and anywhere in the\
    \ peer-to-peer topology. The ZigBee \nstandard defines two stack profiles: ZigBee\
    \ and ZigBee Pro. ZigBee Pro \noffers more features, including scalability using\
    \ stochastic address \nassignment, security using symmetric-key exchange, and\
    \ better \nperformance using efficient many-to-one routing mechanisms. \n \nFigure\
    \ 2.8: ZigBee Smart Energy wireless communication and automation \n(Source: Author,\
    \ [94], and [95]).  \n2.2.2.1.8 DASH7 \nDASH7 is a new wireless communication\
    \ protocol for active RFID \ndevices that operates in industrial scientific medical\
    \ (ISM) band, which \nis globally available In comparison to traditional ZigBee,\
    \ DASH7 is \nprimarily intended for scalable, long-range outdoor coverage with\
    \ a \nhigher data rate. It is a low-cost solution that supports encryption and\
    \ \nChapter 2 - Background \n42 \n \nIPv6 addressing. It supports a master/slave\
    \ architecture and is designed \nfor lightweight, burst, asynchronous, and transitive\
    \ traffic, making it \nsuitable for IoT. Figure 2.9 illustrates a Smart Parking\
    \ system using \nDASH7 technology. \n \nFigure 2.9: Smart Parking application\
    \ and DASH7 network architecture \n(Source: [96]).  \nHowever, DASH7 has a smaller\
    \ coverage range than LoRa, since, in \nLoRa, only one gateway can cover between\
    \ 2-5 km in urban and up to 15 \nkm in rural, whereas, in DASH7, one gateway can\
    \ cover up to 1 km [97]. \nFurthermore, DASH7 requires more power consumption\
    \ than \nLoRaWAN because the transmission method used by end-devices is \nbased\
    \ on CSMA/CA method. This method is inappropriate for \nlarge/active networks;\
    \ latency will increase as the network expands \nrapidly[98]. Therefore, it is\
    \ no longer a dominant standard. \n \nChapter 2 - Background \n43 \n \n2.2.2.1.9\
    \ LPWAN \nLow-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) is a wireless wide area \nnetwork\
    \ technology that is designed and used to interconnect low-\nbandwidth, battery-powered\
    \ devices with low bit rates over long \nranges[75]. In both licensed and unlicensed\
    \ frequency bandwidth, many \nLPWAN technologies have emerged. Among them, Sigfox,\
    \ LoRa, and \nMIoTy are today’s leading emergent technologies that involve many\
    \ \ntechnical differences. \n \nLoRa \nLong-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN)\
    \ is a MAC layer \nprotocol standardized by LoRa-Alliance and built on top of\
    \ modulation \nof LoRa wireless technology [99]. LoRaWAN is a non-cellular form\
    \ of \nLPWAN technologies designed for IoT applications with power saving, \n\
    low cost, mobility, security, and bidirectional communication \nrequirements.\
    \ The bidirectional communication is provided by the chirp \nspread spectrum (CSS)\
    \ modulation that spreads a narrow-band signal \nover a wider channel bandwidth.\
    \ The resulting signal has low noise \nlevels, enabling high interference resilience,\
    \ and is difficult to detect or \njam [100][75]. LoRaWAN is adaptable for rural\
    \ or indoor IoT \napplications, such as Smart farms, vaccine cold chain monitoring\
    \ and \nSmart Bikes. Figure 2.10 shows the different modes offered by \nLoRa/LoRaWAN\
    \ to build a network. \n \n \nFigure 2.10: Public and Private LoRaWAN modes (Source:[101]).\
    \ \n \n \nChapter 2 - Background \n44 \n \n \nSigfox \nSigfox is a private LPWAN\
    \ network operator that offers an end-to-\nend IoT connectivity solution based\
    \ on its patented technologies. It \noperates on multiple bands relying on the\
    \ geographic location. Sigfox \noperates at 868 MHz ISM in Europe and in North\
    \ America at 900 MHz \nISM. It offers energy-efficient connectivity and low bit\
    \ rates over long-\nrange communication. There is a daily restriction of 140 messages\
    \ sent \nover the uplink. Each uplink message can have a payload of up to 12 \n\
    bytes in length. However, the number of messages over the downlink is \nlimited\
    \ to four messages per day, which means the acknowledgment of \nevery uplink message\
    \ is not supported. Each downlink message has a \nmaximum payload length of eight\
    \ bytes. Figure 2.11 illustrates the \ncommunication via Sigfox protocol. \n \n\

    \ that requires operation over a longer range \ncan possibly access Global System\
    \ for Mobile communications \n(GSM)/3G/4G cellular network capabilities. Although\
    \ the cellular \nnetwork is clearly capable of sending high quantities of data\
    \ (especially \n4G), power consumption and cost could be an unavoidable limitation\
    \ for \nmany of its applications [105][106]. Although, it can still be appropriate\
    \ \nfor sensor-based low-bandwidth-data applications that need very low \namounts\
    \ of data to be exchanged over the Internet. Thus, emerging \ntechnologies such\

    \ Rel-18) will play a critical role in expanding \nboth the availability and the\
    \ applicability of 5G (5th generation), \nespecially in the areas of Industrial\
    \ Internet of Things (IIoT), Intelligent \ntransportation \nsystems \n(ITS) \n\
    and \nvehicle-to-anything \n(V2X) \ncommunications. \n \nLTE Cat-M1 \nLTE Cat-M1\
    \ (M stands for Machine type communication) is a versatile \nLow Power Wide Area\
    \ Networking (LPWAN) technology; specifically \ndesigned for IoT and M2M communications\
    \ [110]. It is designed to \nreduce cost and complexity by 50% compared to LTE\
    \ CAT1. Cat-M1 \noperates at 1.4 MHz bandwidth and supports full voice functionality\
    \ via \nVoice over LTE (VoLTE), along with full mobility and in-vehicle hand-\n\
    over [111], as shown in Figure 2.13. The major reason for its use in the \nautomotive\
    \ sector or other IoT-based applications is its extended range \nand deep penetration\
    \ in buildings and basements. It also supports PSM \n– sends an acknowledgement\
    \ before going to sleep, and then sends \nchecks along with data (if any) to the\
    \ network. The network would send \ndata, if any. \n \nFigure 2.13: Features and\

    \ \n47 \n \n \nNB-IoT \nNarrow Band IoT, also known as (Cat-NB1), is an LPWAN\
    \ cellular \ntechnology specified in Release 13 of the 3rd generation partnership\
    \ \nproject (3GPP) in June 2016 [113]. NB-IoT can coexist with GSM and LTE \n\
    under licensed frequency bands (e.g., 700 MHz, 800 MHz, and 900 MHz). \nNB-IoT\
    \ uses Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) modulation \ncompared to LTE radios.\
    \ NB-IoT occupies a frequency bandwidth of 180 \nkHz, which corresponds to one\
    \ resource block in GSM and LTE \ntransmission [114]. NB-IoT reduces the LTE protocol\
    \ functionalities to \nthe minimum, and it was optimized to small and infrequent\
    \ data \nmessages, and avoids the features not required for the IoT applications.\
    \ \nTherefore, the end devices require only a small amount of battery, \nmaking\
    \ the protocol cost-efficient. This standard focuses specifically on \nindoor\
    \ coverage, low cost, long battery life, and enabling a large number \nof connected\
    \ devices, but it has an added disadvantage in that it does not \nsupport VoLTE\
    \ and mobility. With NB-IoT, sensor data is directly \ntransmitted to the main\
    \ server, and thus we will not require gateways. \nFigure 2.14 illustrates the\
    \ features and the main areas of NB-IoT usage. \n \n Figure 2.14: Features and\

    \ \n2.2.2.2 IoT Network Layer Protocols \nThis section highlights part of the\
    \ IoT routing protocol and standards \nthat handle the transfer of packets from\
    \ source to destination. \n2.2.2.2.1 6LowPan \nThe IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless\
    \ Personal Area Network \n(6LoWPAN) is a standard developed by the Internet-Engineering\
    \ Task \nForce (IETF) 6LoWPAN working group in 2007. It is the specification of\
    \ \nmapping services required by the IPv6 over LoWPANs to maintain an \nIPv6 network.\
    \ The 6LoWPAN specifications allow many features, \nincluding different length\
    \ addresses, different networking topologies, \nlow bandwidth, low power consumption,\
    \ cost-efficient, scalable \nChapter 2 - Background \n49 \n \nnetworks, mobility,\
    \ reliability, and long sleep times, as shown in Figure \n2.15. The 6LoWPAN standard\
    \ provides header compression to reduce \nthe transmission overhead, fragmentation\
    \ to meet the IPv6 Maximum \nTransmission Unit (MTU) requirement, and forwarding\
    \ to link-layer to \nsupport multi-hop delivery. \n \nFigure 2.15: 6LowPan Architecture\
    \ (Source:[117]).  \nNevertheless, one of 6LoWPAN's disadvantages is that it has\
    \ a \nrelatively long overhead which highly limits the size of payload within\
    \ \nan IEEE 802.15.4 frame [118]. In addition, it has a small packet size, low\
    \ \nbandwidth (250/4/20 kbps) aside from other mesh topology drawbacks \n[119].\
    \ \n2.2.2.2.2 RPL \nRouting Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is\
    \ an IPv6 \nrouting protocol that is standardized for the IoT by IETF [120][121].\
    \ It \nsupports all MAC layer protocols and some other protocols that are not\
    \ \ndesigned for IoT. RPL was designed to meet the most basic routing \nrequirements\
    \ through building a robust topology over lossy links. RPL \nforms a tree-like\
    \ topology, which is based on a different optimizing \nprocess called Objective\
    \ Function (OF). RPL is based on destination-\noriented directed-acyclic graphs\
    \ (DODAG) that have only one route \nfrom each leaf node to the root through which\
    \ all the traffic from the leaf \nnode will be routed to. This routing protocol\
    \ supports simple and \nChapter 2 - Background \n50 \n \ncomplex traffic models\
    \ like multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint and \npoint-to-point as shown\
    \ in Figure 2.16. \n \nFigure 2.16: Routing in RPL. Existing routes are shown\
    \ next to the network \nnodes (Source:[122]). \n2.2.2.3 \nIoT Session Layer Protocols\
    \ \nThis section review several IoT session layer protocols used for \nmessage\
    \ passing and standardized by different standardization \norganizations. TCP and\
    \ UDP are the dominant protocols at the transport \nlayer for most applications,\
    \ including IoT. However, several message \ndistribution functions are required\
    \ depending on IoT application \nrequirements. These functions should be implemented\
    \ in interoperable \nstandard ways. These are the so-called “Session Layer” protocols\
    \ that are \ndescribed in this section. \nChapter 2 - Background \n51 \n \n2.2.2.3.1\
    \ MQTT \nThe Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a standard from \nthe\
    \ Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information \nStandards (OASIS).\
    \ MQTT aims at connecting embedded devices and \nnetworks with applications and\
    \ middleware. MQTT is built on top of the \nTCP protocol. It delivers messages\
    \ through three levels of QoS. The \nconnection operation uses a routing mechanism\
    \ (one-to-one, one-to-\nmany, many-to-many) and enables MQTT as an optimal connection\
    \ \nprotocol for the IoT and M2M.  MQTT simply consists of three \ncomponents:\
    \ subscriber, publisher, and broker as shown in Figure 2.17. \nThe publish/subscribe\
    \ pattern provides transition flexibility and \nsimplicity of implementation.\
    \ An interested device would register as a \nsubscriber for specific topics in\
    \ order for it to be informed by the broker \nwhen publishers publish topics of\
    \ interest. Also, Therefore, the MQTT \nprotocol represents an ideal messaging\
    \ protocol for the IoT and M2M \ncommunications and it is suitable for resource\
    \ constrained devices that \nin unreliable or low bandwidth networks. \n \nFigure\
    \ 2.17: MQTT publish/subscribe to topics (Source:[123]). \n2.2.2.3.2 CoAP \nThe\
    \ constrained application protocol (CoAP) is session layer protocol \ndesigned\
    \ in the IETF constrained RESTful environment (Core) working \ngroup \nto \nprovide\
    \ \nlow \noverhead \nRESTful \n(HTTP) \ninterface. \nChapter 2 - Background \n\
    52 \n \nRepresentational state transfer (REST) is the standard interface that\
    \ is \nextensively used in today’s web applications. REST is a more \nstraightforward\
    \ mechanism for clients and servers to exchange data over \nHTTP. However, REST\
    \ has a significant overhead and power \nconsumption, which makes it unsuitable\
    \ for IoT platforms. CoAP is \ndesigned to solve the REST problems and enable\
    \ IoT tiny devices with \nlow power, computation, and communication capabilities\
    \ to use \nRESTful services while meeting their requirements. CoAP architecture\
    \ is \ndivided into two main sublayers: messaging and request/response, as \n\
    shown in Figure 2.18. The messaging sublayer is responsible for the \nreliability\
    \ and duplication of messages, whereas the request/ response \nsublayer is responsible\
    \ for communication. \n \nFigure 2.18: CoAP architecture (Source:[124]). \n2.2.2.3.3\
    \ Comparative analysis of MQTT and CoAP protocols  \nThis section presents a comparative\
    \ analysis of the three widely \naccepted and emerging messaging protocols for\
    \ IoT systems MQTT, \nCoAP, and HTTP, based on several criteria to introduce their\
    \ \ncharacteristics comparatively. This complete comparative study is \nshown\

    \ Layer \nThe \nmiddleware \nlayer \nenables \ninteractions \nbetween \nIoT \n\
    heterogeneous devices by providing a connectivity layer used by \nconnected objects\
    \ and the application layers that provide services in the \nIoT applications.\
    \ The middleware layer performs different technical \nprocesses, including publish/subscribe\
    \ models, data ingestion and \nstream processing, data storage and processing,\
    \ information extraction, \nservice-oriented architectures, semantic models, and\
    \ context awareness \n[126]. Middleware supports protocols, services, and APIs\
    \ (Application \nProgram Interfaces), providing a standardized environment that\
    \ bridges \nthe differences in devices, networks, and applications that need to\
    \ \ninteract in the IoT. The functionalities provided by middleware can span \n\
    a wide range of the elements of the IoT, from simple device connectivity \nto\
    \ advanced messaging and data analytics models. Several challenges \nare being\
    \ addressed related to requirements like scalability, security, and \ninteroperability.\
    \ Using cloud computing makes the platform easily \nscalable to meet changing\
    \ demand for IT resources, covering resources. \nIt covers two main types of scalabilities:\
    \ horizontal and vertical scaling, \nwhich provides highly customizable infrastructure\
    \ according to \nnecessity, leading cloud service providers or an on-premises\
    \ \ninfrastructure \noffer \nauto-scaling \nservice, \nwhich \nmonitors \nthe\
    \ \nperformance of applications and automatically adjusts the capacity to \nmaintain\
    \ steady and predictable performance. Furthermore, Cloud-\nHealth technologies\
    \ can manage many elements of scalability across one \ncloud or multiple clouds.\
    \ \n2.2.3.1 \nData ingestion and stream processing \nData ingestion is the process\
    \ of getting data from its source to its home \nsystem as efficiently and correctly\
    \ as possible [127]. This has always been \na significant issue, and has been\
    \ targeted by many previous research \ninitiatives, such as data integration,\
    \ deduplication, integrity constraint \nmaintenance, and bulk data loading. Data\
    \ ingestion is frequently \nChapter 2 - Background \n55 \n \ndiscussed under the\
    \ name of Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL). \n2.2.3.1.1 Apache NiFi \nApache\
    \ NiFi is an open-source software, which is developed as a tool \nfor application\
    \ developers to connect various systems together [128]. It \nhas the Dataflow\
    \ feature, which users can specify the connection path of \nthe system by dragging\
    \ them into a pipeline that can clearly show the \nconnection path of the tools\
    \ in the system. In addition, Apache NiFi is \ndesigned to work fast with an ability\
    \ to support large systems, and to be \nused with a variety of systems. Figure\
    \ 2.20 illustrates the Apache NiFi \ncore concepts and NiFi dataflow.  \n \n \n\
    Figure 2.20: NiFi core concept (top) (Source: Author and [129]), NiFi \nDataflow\
    \ automation (bottom) (Source:[130]). \n2.2.3.1.2 Apache Kafka \nApache Kafka\
    \ [131] is an open-source developed by LinkedIn, which \nused as a message distribution\
    \ center in the system designing for a fast, \nflexible, and easy to structure\
    \ system with data security feature. Due to \nits cluster function, it makes the\
    \ system resistant to damage, can support \nChapter 2 - Background \n56 \n \n\
    many forms of data, like data transmission in messages, such as \nmessages, logs,\
    \ events etc. Therefore, Apache Kafka is the first tool that \ndevelopers tend\
    \ to look for and apply for the system design with a large \namount of data transmission\
    \ and need for high data security. Figure 2.21 \nillustrates the architecture\
    \ of Apache Kafka. \n \nFigure 2.21: Apache Kafka Architecture (Source:[132]).\
    \  \n2.2.3.2 \nData storage, processing, and analytics \nThe data generated by\
    \ sensor nodes in the IoT has a massive volume \nquickly, and it is heterogeneous.\
    \ The variations of such data can be \nclassified as structured or unstructured\
    \ data. Therefore, we need a data \nstorage platform that can store and manage\
    \ structured and unstructured \ndata efficiently. SQL and NoSQL are a technology\
    \ widely used as back-\nend media storage. One of the most significant differences\
    \ between \nNoSQL and RDBMS (Relational Data Management System) are that \nNoSQL\
    \ systems separate data storage and management. At the same \ntime, the RDBMS\
    \ tries to satisfy both. NoSQL systems are schema-free. \nThe data stored in NoSQL\
    \ systems do not need to have a pre-defined \ndata model nor need to fit well\
    \ into relational tables. This feature entrusts \nstoring heterogeneous data with\
    \ greater flexibility. \nChapter 2 - Background \n57 \n \n2.2.3.2.1 MongoDB \n\
    MongoDB is an open-source document-based, cross-platform NoSQL \nDatabase, having\
    \ features like scalability, high availability, and high \nperformance. It is\
    \ developed using C++ and stores data in JSON format \n[133][134]. It can be used\
    \ to store Big Data. MongoDB possesses the \nfollowing characteristics, built-in\
    \ failover and replication, native sharing \nand horizontal scalability, support\
    \ map/reduce, and real-time \naggregation on huge data. Figure 2.22 illustrates\
    \ the data mode in \nRDBMS and MongoDB.  \n \nFigure 2.22: The Data model in RDBMS\
    \ and MongoDB (Source:[135]). \n2.2.4 \nApplication Layer \nThe application layer\
    \ is responsible for inclusive applications \nmanagement based on the processed\
    \ information in the Middleware \nlayer and delivering solutions to end-users.\
    \ It enables device-to-device \nand human-to-device interactions reliably and\
    \ robustly. The IoT \napplications can be smart health, Smart City, Smart Home,\
    \ smart \ntransportation, autonomous vehicles. \n2.2.5 \nBusiness and Visualization\
    \ Layer \nThe business and visualization layer manages the overall IoT system\
    \ \nactivities and services. The responsibilities of this layer are to build a\
    \ \nChapter 2 - Background \n58 \n \nbusiness model, graphs, flowcharts, and many\
    \ more, based on the \nreceived data from the Application layer. It is also supposed\
    \ to design, \nanalyze, implement, evaluate, monitor, and develop IoT system-related\
    \ \nelements. The Business Layer allows decision-making processes to be \nsupported\
    \ by adequate data analysis processes. In addition, monitoring \nand management\
    \ of the underlying four layers is achieved at this layer. \nMoreover, this layer\
    \ compares the output of each layer with the expected \noutput to enhance services\
    \ and maintain users’ privacy. Figure 2.23 \nillustrate a screenshot of the most\
    \ popular data visualization and \ndashboards tools.  \n \nFigure 2.23: Grafana,\
    \ Kibana, Splunk, and Zabdash tools screens \n(Source:[136]). \n2.3 \nReal Scenario\
    \ of IoT Reference Architecture  \nCisco proposed a seven-layer Reference Model\
    \ supported by 20 \ncompanies and the Industrial Internet Consortium that provides\
    \ a \nguideline and architectural taxonomy for IoT implementations [137]. \nThe\
    \ reference Model composes of seven distinct layers of different \nactivities\
    \ that are conducted in a vertical slice of a typical IoT system as \nshown in\
    \ Figure 2.24. The vertical slice refers to the fact that the system \nincorporates\
    \ all 3 tiers of the systems (Constrained Devices or “Things”, \nEdge, Cloud).\
    \ While the typical architecture implies that layer1 is at the \nChapter 2 - Background\
    \ \n59 \n \n“Things” tier, layers 2 and 3 at the Edge tier and layer 4 to 7 at\
    \ the Cloud \ntier, the Edge computing paradigm pushes functionality from layer\
    \ 4 to \n7 down to layer 3. \n \nFigure 2.24: The IoT Reference Model by Cisco\
    \ (Source:[137]).  \n2.4 \nSecurity in IoT \nSecurity and privacy are responsible\
    \ for authenticity, confidentiality, \nand non-repudiation. Security can be implemented\
    \ in two ways: secure \nhigh-level peer communication, which enables the higher\
    \ layer to \ncommunicate among peers securely and abstractly, and secure topology\
    \ \nmanagement, which deals with the authentication of new peers, \npermissions\
    \ to access the network, and protection of routing information \nexchanged in\
    \ the network. Security has been considered in all the \nfunctional blocks of\
    \ the existing IoT middleware, from the user level \napplication to the various\
    \ parts of the functional blocks [138], to build a \ntrustworthy design [139].\
    \ Other approaches to implement security and \nprivacy in IoT-middleware are semantic\
    \ ontology-based approaches to \nbuild a universal trust management system [140],\
    \ device authentication \n[141], integrity service and access control [142]. \n\

    3.1 \nIntroduction  \nWireless communications are employed when high levels of\
    \ user \nmobility, ubiquity and very large sensor node deployments are \nconsidered.\
    \ In this case, different wireless communication systems can \nbe \nemployed,\
    \ \ndepending \non \ncoverage/capacity \nrequirements, \nbandwidth needs, energy\
    \ consumption and form factor restrictions, \nT \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation\
    \ of Wireless Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms\
    \ \n61 \n \namong others. Wireless communication systems can be classified as\
    \ a \nfunction of their coverage range, spanning from wide area connectivity \n\
    (mainly public land mobile networks), short range communications \n(wireless body\
    \ area networks and personal area networks), high-\ncapacity local area networks\
    \ given by Wireless Local Area Networks \n(WLAN), and mid to long range low capacity\
    \ and low energy wireless \nsensor networks. The election of the specific systems\
    \ is given mainly by \ncoverage/capacity relations (i.e., transceiver distance\
    \ range as a function \nof receiver sensitivity, which is at the same time dependent\
    \ on \ntransmission bit rate and overall interference levels), as well by inherent\
    \ \nform factor, cost, and reduced energy capabilities. The surrounding \nenvironment\
    \ determines wireless channel performance, given by line of \nsight/non line of\
    \ sight propagation conditions, the existence of strong \nmultipath components\
    \ and channel dynamic effects, such as Doppler \nshift, particularly in vehicular\
    \ communications. \n3.2 \nEvolution of Wireless Technologies for a Smart \nCities\
    \ \nIn this section, we compare the different wireless communication \ntechnologies\
    \ \nand \ninvestigate \nthe \ndifferent \nnetworking \nand \ncommunication requirements\
    \ of the various smart city applications and \nthe protocols that can be used\
    \ to connect the components used to support \nsuch applications [75][147][148].\
    \ \nWithin the SC framework described, different systems can be \nconsidered as\
    \ a function of coverage/capacity, energy consumption, \nform factor, cost and\
    \ mobility requirements. In this sense, public land \nmobile network systems,\
    \ such as 4G NB-IoT or LTE Cat M or 5G machine \ntype communications can be employed,\
    \ low power wide area networks \nsuch as ZigBee, LoRa/LoRaWAN or Sigfox; wireless\
    \ local area networks, \nwith focus on IoT specific protocols such as IEEE 802.11\
    \ ah. In order to \nevaluate wireless technology adoption in the SC of Pamplona,\
    \ initial \ncoverage/capacity estimations have been performed. To this extent,\
    \ it is \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks\
    \ for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n62 \n \nworth noting that the\
    \ main urban region of Pamplona has an \napproximate surface of approximately\
    \ 24 km2, with a population (2020) \nof 204.000 inhabitants and an interaction\
    \ region with surrounding \nmunicipalities (which share common transportation,\
    \ water distribution \nand waste management systems) of 33 km2 and a total of\
    \ 350.000 \ninhabitants. Elevation heights can be divided in two main regions:\
    \ \nwithin the city center of Pamplona (in the range of 435 m to 465m) and \n\
    the interaction region, surrounding the city center, with lower heights \n(in\
    \ the range of 405 m to 435 m). This leads to maximum link distances \nof 7 km,\
    \ with variable partial obstruction conditions. A view of the \nregion under analysis\
    \ is depicted in Figure 3.1. \n \nFigure 3.1: Delimitation of the Smart City of\
    \ Pamplona and the SC \ninteraction region. Maximum wireless link lengths are\
    \ in the range of 7. \nCoverage/capacity estimations have been obtained, by considering\
    \ \nradio propagation losses employing COST 231 model, considering mid- \nrange\
    \ propagation to street angles (i.e., 35º to 55º). Different transceiver \nmodels\
    \ have been considered for the case of LoRa/LoRaWAN (with \nsensitivity ranges\
    \ in the order of -117 dBm to -148 dBm), depicted in \nFigure 3.2, and the cases\
    \ in which ZigBee (2.4GHz), NB-IoT, IEEE \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation\

    \ \n63 \n \n802.11ah and LTE Cat M transceivers are employed, depicted in Figure\
    \ \n3.3. From the results, it can be seen that coverage ranges extend from \n\
    300m to over 2.4 km links, depending on the system under consideration. \nThe\
    \ use of LoRa/LoRaWAN exhibits in general the longest ranges in \nterms of coverage,\
    \ which can provide an optimal solution if low BW is \nrequired (a usual consideration\
    \ in the case of telemetry applications, \nwhich is the case for example for environmental\
    \ sensing within the \nPamplona SC platform, water meter indication or EV battery\
    \ status \nwithin electric bus lines, among others). In the case of higher BW\
    \ \nrequirements, joint communication capabilities are foreseen with 802.11 \n\
    n/ac and future 802.11 ah/ax (which is the case for video transmissions \nin the\
    \ case of controlled zone parking within the city center of Pamplona, \nfor example).\

    \ 3.3: Coverage/capacity estimations, for different ZigBee, NB-IoT and \nLTE Cat\
    \ M transceiver nodes. \nThe desire to have a low-cost, far-reaching access network\
    \ has led to \nthe development of a first pilot deployment of a LoRa network,\
    \ which \ninitially collects environmental data (temperature, humidity, sunshine,\
    \ \netc.), environmental, light, noise and radio pollution data, and \ninformation\
    \ on the occupation and use of certain municipal resources \nsuch as bicycle parking\
    \ facilities. This network can then be used for \nmunicipal solid waste collection\
    \ by monitoring waste and recycling bins. \nThis network can subsequently be used\
    \ for the collection of solid urban \nwaste by monitoring rubbish and recycling\
    \ containers, for monitoring \nthe occupation of roads and pavements using vehicle\
    \ and pedestrian \ncounters (PIR, radar, etc.). \nThe location of the network\
    \ infrastructure is conditioned by the \nlocation and height of the municipal\
    \ buildings and the terrain and can \nbe used to monitor the security of the buildings\
    \ themselves. \n \n \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication\
    \ Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n65 \n \n3.2.1 \nCriteria\
    \ for Comparison Wireless Communication \nProtocols \nThis section underlines\
    \ a group of criteria that are considerable on the \nprocess of selecting an appropriate\
    \ wireless communication protocol \n[149][150][75][148][151]. \n \nBandwidth:\
    \ The increase in bandwidth affects power \nconsumption and reach, making bandwidth\
    \ an essential \nconsideration when selecting a wireless communication \nprotocol\
    \ for data transmission. \n \nEnergy Efficiency: One of the crucial aspects of\
    \ selecting \na wireless communication protocol for an IoT node is \nenergy consumption.\
    \ Minimizing the amount of time that \nIoT node is active, reducing the transmission\
    \ time, \nconstant and activity of IoT node has led to significant \nsavings in\
    \ energy efficiency. \n \nReliability: It guarantees a successful transfer of\
    \ data to \nthe destination as quickly as possible. Increased reliability \nis\
    \ directly proportional to increased bandwidth, so \nreliability is an important\
    \ criterion to consider when \nselecting a wireless communication protocol. \n\
     \nMobility: Another important feature of smart city \napplications is mobility.\
    \ Smart grids, gas pipeline \nmonitoring and smart water networks are examples\
    \ of \nlow or medium-mobility systems. Other systems, such as \nsmart transportation,\
    \ have a high level of mobility. As a \nresult, networking protocols used to connect\
    \ smart city \nsystems with medium to high mobility must be robust \nand adapt\
    \ well to node mobility without consuming too \nmuch bandwidth on control messages\
    \ and related \nprocessing to readjust to changes in the network topology. \n\
    Chapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks for \nSmart\
    \ Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n66 \n \n \nSecurity: Depending on the\
    \ criticality of the service and \nthe information stored, systems require a certain\
    \ level of \nsecurity. \nMonitoring \nof \nlighting, \nenvironmental \nconditions,\
    \ noise and light pollution or automatic \nirrigation systems are low security\
    \ level systems. In \ncontrast, smart grid applications, the monitoring of \n\
    energy poverty in housing or water consumption require \nhigh security due to\
    \ the sensitivity of the data and the \ncriticality of the functions performed.\
    \ \nIn the case of IoT applications, wireless communication systems in \nprinciple\
    \ need to provide service to a large number of devices, with \nlow/moderate transmission\
    \ rates, low cost and low energy consumption. \nWithin the array of different\
    \ wireless communication systems, several \nof them are candidates in order to\
    \ support IoT, such as NB-IoT/LTE Cat-\nM in the case of Public Land Mobile Network\
    \ (PLMN), BLE in the case \nof Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and LPWAN standards\
    \ in the \ncase of WSN, such as ZigBee or LoRa/LoRaWAN, among others. The \nspecification\
    \ and characteristics for these system are described in Table \n3.1, Table 3.2,\
    \ and Table 3.3  [75][152][147][153][148][154][155][156][157]. \n \nChapter 3\

    \ Wireless Communication Technologies \nEvaluation Experimental Results Using\
    \ LoRaWAN and \nSigfox Network \nIn order to assess different long-range wireless\
    \ communication \ntechnologies for their implementation in urban environments,\
    \ a \nmeasurement campaign has been carried out within an urban test \nscenario\
    \ in the city of Pamplona. For that purpose, SigFox and \nLoRaWAN technologies\
    \ have been chosen, both operating at 868 MHz \nfrequency band. Figure 3.4, shows\
    \ the employed hardware. \nFigure 3.4: Employed LoRaWAN and SigFox hardware for\
    \ measurements. \nOn the one hand, the The Thing Newtwork (TTN) LoRaWAN \nGateway\
    \ from The Things Networks and the Dragino LoRa shield with \nGPS mounted on an\
    \ Arduino UNO board have been employed to assess \nLoRaWAN technology. The TTN\
    \ Gateway has been deployed within the \nElectric, Electronic and Communications\
    \ Engineering Department \nbuilding of the Public University of Navarre (UPNA),\
    \ and it is \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks\
    \ for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n71 \n \nrepresented by a blue\
    \ circle named “G” in Figure 3.5. The gateway has \nbeen located on the second\
    \ floor, near a window, in order to increase link \nvisibility. On the other hand,\
    \ the Arduino MKR FOX 1200 device has \nbeen used for SigFox technology assessment.\
    \ In this case, no gateway \ndeployment is needed since SigFox alliance provides\
    \ the network \ninfrastructure and coverage, so unlike LoRaWAN, there is no need\
    \ to \nestablish \nand \nmaintain \nthe \nwireless \ncommunication \nnetwork \n\
    infrastructure. \n \nFigure 3.5: LoRaWAN measurements results. Green: No packet\
    \ losses. \nYellow: some packet losses. Red: All packets lost. \nChapter 3 - Performance\
    \ Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart\
    \ City-Platforms \n72 \n \nFigure 3.6 shows a map where the UPNA campus is delimited\
    \ by \nyellow lines. The LoRaWAN gateway location is represented by the blue \n\
    circle, and the 26 measurement points where the mote based on Dragino \nLoRa shield\
    \ has been deployed are shown with different colors. Green \ncolor represents\
    \ that no packet has been lost in the communication; \nyellow color means that\
    \ some packets have been lost; and red color that \nall packets have been lost.\
    \ For each measurement point, 4 packets have \nbeen transmitted from the mote\
    \ to the TTN gateway. The packets have \nbeen sent every 30s, which is the shortest\
    \ interval between packets \nallowed by LoRaWAN. The equivalent measurement set\
    \ for the case of \nSigFox setup is depicted in Figure 3.6. \n \nFigure 3.6: SigFox\
    \ measurements results. Green: No packet losses. Yellow: \nsome packet losses.\
    \ Red: All packets lost. \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication\
    \ Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n73 \n \nFigure 3.7\
    \ presents the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the \npackets received\
    \ by the gateway and stored in the cloud. Note that in \nsome ‘Green’ cases (e.g.\
    \ 14), less than 4 points are seen in the graph, but \nfour packets were received:\
    \ different packets with the same RSSI value \nare represented by the same point\
    \ in the graph. As it can be seen, the \nGateway covers a wide area of the surrounding\
    \ of the UPNA campus, \nbut the high elevation zone (marked in yellow in Figure\
    \ 3.5, which is \nhigher than the tallest building of the University) causes great\
    \ losses in \nthe communication with the nodes deployed across the hill, even\
    \ for \nshort distances from the Gateway (e.g., measurement points 2 and 4). It\
    \ \nis worth noting that the coverage would be expected to be better if the \n\
    Gateway could be deployed in higher levels. All these results and facts \nshow\
    \ that even the LoRaWAN technology is an interesting one in order \nto cover wide\
    \ urban zones, the deployment of the Gateway and the \noverall radio planning\
    \ tasks have a great impact in the performance of \nthe network. \n \nFigure 3.7:\
    \ RSSI values for LoRaWAN measurements (left) and SigFox \nmeasurements (right).\
    \ \nThe same measurements have been taken for the case of SigFox \ntechnology.\
    \ As mentioned, in this case, no network infrastructure is \nneeded to be deployed.\
    \ Therefore, only the Arduino MKR FOX 1200 \nmote has been deployed in the same\
    \ 26 measurement points. Again, 4 \npackets have sent in every point, with 30s\
    \ interval time. In this case, all \nthe packets have been successfully received\
    \ and stored in the cloud. \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication\
    \ Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n74 \n \nSigFox shows\
    \ better performance within this urban environment in \nterms of coverage, with\
    \ no infrastructure deployment requirements. \nHowever, control on wireless communication\
    \ network by the user isn´t \nenabled and per node costs arise in the use and\
    \ operation of the system. \nIn relation with system scalability as related to\
    \ wireless network \ncapabilities, in the case of LoRaWan, the limitation in the\
    \ number of \nconnected devices is given mainly by the handling capability of\
    \ each one \nof the gateways provided within the service area under analysis,\
    \ as well \nas by interference thresholds (in the case of simultaneous transmissions).\
    \ \nIn this way, several thousands of transceivers can be handled by each \ngateway\
    \ in the case of non-simultaneous transmissions, providing \nfeasible wireless\
    \ connectivity in different urban/city related applications. \n3.3 \n     Use\
    \ cases  \n3.3.1 \nBike-to-Bike Wireless Communication  \nCycling has emerged\
    \ as one of the most sustainable means of urban \ntravel due to its flexibility,\
    \ low costs, reduced carbon emissions, \nimproved traffic, and mobility in cities.\
    \ Bikes can play an important role \nin achieving sustainability for cities, through\
    \ a set of data that can be got \nduring their movement within the city if they\
    \ have a set of requirements, \nsuch as internet connection, besides a set of\
    \ sensors. Vehicle-to-Vehicle \n(V2V) communication is becoming a reality standard.\
    \ Non-motorized \nvehicles, such as bikes, are expected to participate in V2V\
    \ and Vehicle-\nTo-Everything (V2X) networking alongside cars and trucks, although\
    \ \nthey have gotten significantly less attention. \nHowever, current communication\
    \ techniques between bikes, bike-to-\nstation, and the transmission of data from\
    \ bikes over the Internet depend \non communication technologies including LTE,\
    \ LoRa, LoRaWAN, and \nNB-IoT. The use of cellular communication networks (3G\
    \ or 4G) is \nlimited by the overhead generated by subscriber management, which\
    \ \nthey must do for each client connecting to their network. Each bike \nwould\
    \ be run and managed like a mobile phone or smartphone client, \nChapter 3 - Performance\
    \ Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart\
    \ City-Platforms \n75 \n \nmaking the operation of such an infrastructure inefficient.\
    \ The \ntransceiver module on the bike would have to be equipped with a \nSubscriber\
    \ Identity Module (SIM) card, which again drives hardware \nand operating costs.\
    \ In addition, these technologies have a high-power \nconsumption. \nOther existing\
    \ infrastructures, such as WLANs, are available in cities \nin public areas, but\
    \ lack continuous coverage. Ouyang et al. in [158] have \ndiscussed a network\
    \ infrastructure that assumes network nodes in \npublic places with a high frequency\
    \ of  bikes crossing. This concept of an \nad hoc network requires network nodes\
    \ or stations throughout the \ncoverage area, and bikes will be out of reception\
    \ between station's cells. \nWireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs), whose solutions\
    \ are \nwidely developed by the IEEE 802.15 Working Group, and emerging \ntrends\
    \ in LPWAN play an important role in connecting bikes [159] [160]. \nThis opens\
    \ an opportunity to design a data communication network that \nperfectly suits/adapted\
    \ to the dynamic movement of bikes. Bikes will be \nequipped with a wireless communication\
    \ module and a set of sensors \nfor sensing environmental parameters, such as\
    \ measuring temperature, \nhumidity, etc., and transmitting the information in\
    \ the form of messages \nto other bikes in the network. The packets with the information\
    \ will \ntravel from one bike to the other until it reaches a coordinator node,\
    \ then \nthe packets of sensory data are converted into Internet Protocol (IP)\
    \ \npackets for sending to the cloud server through internet connectivity. \n\
    The advantage of such an ad-hoc network is the absence of any dedicated \nand\
    \ static network nodes, making it cost effective, and robust. The more \nbikes\
    \ are in a certain area, the amount of data to be communicated is \nrising; but\
    \ at the same time, the capacity of the network increases with \neach bike added.\
    \ \nIn this section, we analyze and experimentally evaluate Bike-to-Bike \n(Bi2Bi)\
    \ wireless communication in different urban scenarios, considering \nfull topo-morphological\
    \ characteristics of urban environments by means \nof deterministic 3D Ray Launching\
    \ hybrid simulations. Communication \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless\

    \ \nand data exchange between bikes relies on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, \nand\
    \ specifically, on ZigBee. We have evaluated range, throughput, and \npacket loss\
    \ ratio for different scenarios. In order to simulate results, we \nhave employed\
    \ an in-house 3D-RL simulation tool. The architecture and \nimplementation of\
    \ the system are described in Chapter 4. A schematic \ndescription of the contribution\
    \ within this work is depicted in Figure 3.8. \n \n \nFigure 3.8: Schematic description\
    \ of the contribution. \n3.3.1.1 Related work \nDuring recent years, several researchers\
    \ have come up with ideas for \na network of bikes that exchange information among\
    \ themselves. They \nhave also evaluated which wireless network technology is\
    \ appropriate \nto achieve that connection.  Eisenman et al. [161] have introduced\
    \ a \nproject called \"BikeNet\" based on mobile operators’ infrastructure with\
    \ \nGSM subscriber modules for the bikes. The BikeNet was unpromising \ndue to\
    \ the high charges for operating the network. Isemann et al. [162], \nhave proposed\
    \ a chaotic ad-hoc network for data messaging for bikes, \nindependent from 3rd\
    \ party network infrastructures. The proposed \ncommunication network requires\
    \ a minimum number of active bikes to \nmake an RF link to the following bike;\
    \ otherwise, the bikes are isolated.  \nSantos et al. [163] have evaluated in\
    \ less power-intensive wireless \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless\
    \ Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n77 \n\
    \ \ntechnologies for Bi2Bi connectivity operating in the 2.4GHz ISM band. \nThe\
    \ relative positioning of bikes and antenna orientation affect the link \nperformance.\
    \ \nMunicio et al. [164] have presented a solution that relied on ANT+ \nwireless\
    \ technology to communicate with the different bike sensors, and \n6TiSCH, which\
    \ builds the long-range 6LoWPAN network of bikes. \nThe specific characteristics\
    \ of bike to infrastructure as well as of Bi2Bi \nconnectivity require to consider\
    \ the impact in terms of wireless channel \nbehavior and hence, overall system\
    \ performance. Experimental \ncharacterization of Bi2Bi communication links has\
    \ been presented in \n[163], considering different WLAN, 802.15.4 CrossBow nodes\
    \ and \nBluetooth transceivers, all of them operating in 2.4GHz frequency bands.\
    \ \nThe experimental setup considered constant separation between bikes of \n\
    1m and as scenarios, an empty parking lot as well as an urban pedestrian \narea.\
    \ A cooperative bike communication system is described in [165], in \nwhich bike\
    \ groups, in the form of platoons, are interconnected by means \nZigBee nodes,\
    \ where a brief analysis of wireless communications is \npresented. The impact\
    \ of the bike structure as well as the location of the \ntransceiver antennas\
    \ has been described in [166], considering 6 different \nantenna locations within\
    \ the bike frame. Specific antennas have also \nbeen considered for the integration\
    \ of wireless sensor network \ncapabilities within bikes, by embedding a helical\
    \ antenna within the bike \nframe, considering frequencies of operation in the\
    \ 170MHz or the \n430MHz bands [162]. Wireless connectivity in order to enable\
    \ vulnerable \nroad user detection involving the detection of bikes is described\
    \ in [167], \nwhere the radiation diagrams for vehicles and bikes as well experimental\
    \ \nvalues of RSSI distributions have been obtained, considering operating \n\
    frequencies in the 2.4 GHz bands. Wireless characterization has also been \nperformed\
    \ for other bike related applications, such as the integration of \nRFID chips\

    \ between bikes \nin different sub-urban scenarios where bikes are commonly present.\
    \ \nFirst, the algorithm employed for deterministic radio propagation \nChapter\

    \ with Smart City-Platforms \n81 \n \nanalysis is presented. Then, simulation\
    \ results for the scenarios under \nanalysis are shown. And finally, wireless\
    \ communication quality \nexperiments for several use cases are presented. \n\
    A. 3D RAY Launching Technique \nThe design of accurate propagation models for\
    \ realistic wireless \nvehicular communications, and Bi2Bi communications in particular,\
    \ \nmust take into account unique characteristics such as the antenna \nplacement\
    \ and the characteristics of different surrounding environments \n[174]. Urban\
    \ environments encompass a wide variety of scenarios which \nare characterized\
    \ by the combinations of different objects and elements \nsuch as buildings, pedestrians,\
    \ urban furniture, vegetation and different \nkind of vehicles (buses, cars, trucks,\
    \ bikes, scooters, motorcycles, etc.). In \nthe same way, their size and density\
    \ have a great impact on the \npropagation of wireless signals [175]. Propagation\
    \ phenomena such as \nreflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering, as well\
    \ as the Non-Line-\nof-Sight (NLoS) and Quasi-Line-of-Sight (QLoS) situations\
    \ make this \nkind of scenarios very complex in terms of radio propagation. Besides,\
    \ \nthe mobility of the elements within these scenarios changes the radio \npropagation\
    \ conditions continuously, being the main challenge for \nchannel modeling in\
    \ vehicular communications, and extensively, in \nBi2Bi communications. \nIn general,\
    \ channel modeling approaches are classified as Empirical, \nStochastic, Geometry-based\
    \ stochastic or deterministic [176]. Unlike \nempirical and stochastic models,\
    \ deterministic models provide an \naccurate modeling of all the elements within\
    \ the specific scenario under \nanalysis [177], making them the most accurate\
    \ option for radio planning \ntasks of urban and sub-urban environments [178][179].\
    \ In the literature, \nmany V2V propagation models and channel simulators can\
    \ be found \n[180][181], but further investigations are needed regarding the Bi2Bi\
    \ \nwireless communications. \nWith the aim of analyzing the Bi2Bi channel in\
    \ urban scenarios, an in-\nhouse developed deterministic 3D-RL simulation tool\
    \ has been \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks\
    \ for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n82 \n \nemployed in this work.\
    \ The detailed operating mode of this \ndeterministic algorithm can be accessed\
    \ in [182], and it is based on the \ncreation of complete 3D scenarios, where\
    \ the complete volume is meshed \ninto a fixed number of cuboids. The transmitter\
    \ antennas and their \ncharacteristics are the input parameters of the algorithm.\
    \ Then, rays are \nlaunched \nform \nthe \ntransmitter \nfollowing \na \ncombination\
    \ \nof \nelectromagnetic theory and equations based on Geometrical Optics (GO)\
    \ \nand Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD). The propagation \nparameters\
    \ are calculated along the path of each ray, which interacts \nwith all the elements\
    \ within the scenario, creating radio propagation \nphenomena such as reflection,\
    \ refraction, and diffraction. These \ncharacteristics, added to the implementation\
    \ of the material properties \nof all the elements within the scenario (conductivity\
    \ and permittivity) \nlead to an efficient and robust technique already employed\
    \ and \nvalidated in many different environments, including large urban \nenvironments[183][184].\
    \ \nThe next two subsections present the radio propagation analysis \nperformed\
    \ for ZigBee wireless communication between bikes in two \ndifferent environments\
    \ where bikes are usually present. First, a \nUniversity campus has been assessed,\
    \ and then, a common urban \nscenario. The campus environment presents some building,\
    \ empty \nspaces and many vegetation elements. Furthermore, the urban scenario\
    \ \ncontains narrower spaces between buildings and higher density of \nobstacles,\
    \ such as cars. Finally, empirical evaluation for both scenarios is \npresented,\
    \ using ZigBee-based transceivers. \nB. Bi2Bi Communication in University Campus\
    \ Environment \nNowadays, many students and academic staff use bikes to go to\
    \ the \nuniversity. Thus, a Bi2Bi radio link estimation at a university campus\
    \ is \nimportant. In this context, a 3D Ray Launching scenario replicating the\
    \ \ncampus of the Public University of Navarre in Spain has been created to \n\
    study the feasibility of the proposed Bi2Bi communication system in \nChapter\
    \ 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility\
    \ with Smart City-Platforms \n83 \n \nuniversity campus environment. The created\
    \ scenario of the campus is \nillustrated in Figure 3.9.  \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \n\
    \ \n(c) \nFigure 3.9 : (a) Top view, (b) 3D view, and (c) transmitter at location\
    \ 1 within \nthe created university campus scenario.  \nThe dimensions of the\
    \ scenario are 590 m of length, 290 m of width \nand 30 m of height, resulting\
    \ in a volume of 5.1 million m3. The existing \nelements and materials at the\
    \ campus such as trees, foliage, grass, \nstreetlights, baskets, benches, cars\
    \ and buildings were all taken into \naccount while simulating the presented scenario.\
    \ Moreover, since the \ndielectric properties of any material depend on the radio\
    \ frequency, \ntemperature and humidity levels, the dielectric properties of the\
    \ \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks for\
    \ \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n84 \n \nmaterials used in the presented\
    \ scenario were taken from [185] for a \nconsidered humidity level of 20% and\
    \ a Temperature of 20 ºC. Table 3.5 \ndepicts the dielectric properties of these\
    \ materials. \nTABLE 3.5: MATERIAL PROPERTIES FOR THE 3D RAY LAUNCHING SIMULATION.\

    \ the transmitter was placed on the front \npart of the bike at three different\
    \ locations, as illustrated in Figure 3.9 (a). \nThe purpose of choosing these\
    \ locations is to estimate the radio coverage \nunder LoS and NLoS Bi2Bi links.\
    \ One of the main advantages of the 3D-\nRL code is the ability to perform analysis\
    \ at any location in the three-axis \nwithin the 3D scenario. Figure 3.10 shows\
    \ the estimated RF power \ndistribution planes at 2.41 GHz for the transmitter\
    \ placed at the three \nlocations at 1.15 m from the ground level. \nFigure 3.10\
    \ shows that one bike can cover the half of the campus. \nMoreover, it is shown\
    \ that higher radio coverage is offered by bikes \nplaced at locations 2 and 3\
    \ due to the low buildings density. However, \nthe bike at location 1 is surrounded\
    \ by buildings, resulting in signal \nattenuations. \nIt can be observed in Figure\
    \ 3.10 (a) that a reliable Bi2iB \ncommunication can reach 150 m radius from the\
    \ transmitter bike at \nlocation 1. For a transmitter placed at location 2, high\
    \ link quality is \noffered at 180 m radius, as illustrated in Figure 3.10 (b).\
    \ Finally, From \nFigure 3.10 (c), it is demonstrated that a Bi2Bi communication\
    \ can reach \n200 m for a transmitter placed at location 3. \n \n \nChapter 3\

    \ to be taken into account for a reliable \nBi2Bi communication is the urban scenario,\
    \ which is a complex \nenvironment with high buildings, vegetation and vehicles\
    \ density levels. \nIn this context, the 3D Ray Launching algorithm has been used\
    \ to \nperform radio coverage estimation for Bi2Bi communication in urban \nscenario.\

    \ Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility\
    \ with Smart City-Platforms \n87 \n \nThe presented scenario in Figure 3.11 is\
    \ a replica of a real part of the \ncity of Pamplona in Spain. The created scenario\
    \ has dimensions of 510 m \nin length, 285 m in width and 50 m in height, resulting\
    \ in a total volume \nof 7,267,500 m3. The scenario is created considering all\
    \ the existing \ncomponents in the real scenario such as bikes, buildings, trees,\
    \ \nstreetlights, vehicles, human body, baskets, benches and all the metallic\
    \ \nelements, as it is illustrated in Figure 3.11 (c). The dielectric properties\
    \ of \nthese components are those of Table 3.5. \nThe created urban scenarios\
    \ have been simulated using cuboids size \nof X = 6 m, Y = 6 m and Z = 2m. The\
    \ angular resolution of both vertical \nand horizontal ray launching is ∆θ = ∆φ\
    \ = 1°. Diffractions have been \ntaken into account in this scenario and the number\
    \ of the defined \nreflections until extinction is 6. The transmitter bikes have\
    \ been placed \nat three different locations, as it is shown in Figure 3.11 (a).\
    \ The purpose \nof choosing these locations is to estimate the radio coverage\
    \ under \ndifferent density levels. \nThe estimated RF power distribution planes\
    \ at 2.41 GHz for the \ntransmitter placed at the three locations at 1.15 m from\
    \ the ground level \nare illustrated in presented in Figure 3.12. \nIt can be\
    \ observed in Figure 3.12, that the received power levels are \nhigher than the\
    \ receiver’s sensitivity threshold at large areas \nsurrounding the transmitters\
    \ located at the three locations. Moreover, it \nis shown that higher radio coverage\
    \ is offered by bikes placed at \nlocations 1 and 2 due to the low buildings’\
    \ density. However, the bike at \nlocation 3 is surrounded by buildings, resulting\
    \ in signal attenuations. \nFrom Figure 3.12 (a), it can be seen that a reliable\
    \ Bi2Bi communication \ncan reach 200 m radius from the transmitter bike at location\
    \ 1. For a \ntransmitter placed at location 2, high link quality is offered at\
    \ 190 m \nradius, as illustrated in Figure 3.12 (b). Finally, From Figure 3.12\
    \ (c), it is \ndemonstrated that a Bi2Bi communication can reach 150 m for a \n\
    transmitter placed at location 3. \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless\

    \ \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n89 \n \nD. Experimental Evaluation\
    \ \nThis subsection presents several experiments with ZigBee modules set \non\
    \ the bikes. The aim of these experiments is to study the performance \nof the\
    \ wireless communication between two moving bikes, in terms of \npacket losses.\
    \ For that purpose, two different scenarios have been tested. \nOn one hand, a\
    \ path along a wide sub-urban environment has been \nmeasured, which contains\
    \ different zones with different types of \nbuildings and urban furniture. In\
    \ addition, the path has significant \naltitude changes (see Figure 3.13 -a-).\
    \ On the other hand, the second \nsuburban scenario is specific one: a University\
    \ campus (see Figure 3.13 \nb, -c-). This scenario corresponds to the scenario\
    \ simulated with the 3D \nRL (see Figure 3.11). \n \nFigure 3.13: (a) Path 1;\
    \ (b) Path 2; (c) Path3. \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication\
    \ Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n90 \n \nFigure 3.13\
    \ shows the Bi2Bi measurements carried out using the IEEE \n802.15.4 modules for\
    \ path 1 (Figure 3.13 a) in a sub-urban area and paths \n2 (Figure 3.13 b) and\
    \ 3 (Figure 3.13 c) on the UPNA university campus. \nIn Figure 3.13 (a), and Figure\
    \ 3.13 (b), the first bike (transmitter) is 10m \nahead of the second bike (receiver).\
    \ In the case of Figure 3.13 (c), the bikes \n(transmitter and receiver) go in\
    \ opposite directions around the UPNA \nLibrary building. For all the cases, a\
    \ packet has been sent every 5 \nseconds. It is worth noting that this value of\
    \ 5 seconds has been chosen \nin order to test the ZigBee-based dynamic wireless\
    \ link between bicycles \nunder difficult conditions (ZigBee technology was designed\
    \ to deploy \nmonitoring WSNs with low data rates). \nFigure 3.14 summarizes the\
    \ Packet Error Rate per path where the \nhighest rate of packets lost is obtained\
    \ on path 1 due to the obstacles and \nelevation profile of the suburban scenario.\
    \ In the case of paths 2 and 3, \nthe Packet Error Rate is similar. \n \nFigure\
    \ 3.14: Packet Error rate per path. \nFigure 3.15 shows the RSSI for each received\
    \ packet for three paths \n(Figure 3.15 -a-, and Figure 3.15 -b-) where the lost\
    \ packets have been \nreflected with a level below the sensitivity of the devices\
    \ that is -100 \ndBm. As can be seen in the results shown in Figure 3.14, 30 to\
    \ 40% of \npacket losses is a significant value, but it is very important to note\
    \ that \nthe measurements correspond to a dynamic wireless link, where both \n\
    bikes are moving along paths that go by a changing environment. Thus, \nthe main\
    \ reason for such losses is the changing environment itself. For \nexample, the\
    \ Library Building present in the campus scenario (Figure \n \n \n(a) \n \n  \
    \   (b) \n  \n         (c) \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication\
    \ Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n91 \n \n3.13 -b-,\
    \ -c-) is the responsible of most of the lost packets due to the \nshadowing effect\
    \ that creates when the two bikes are in NLoS situation. \nThis effect can be\
    \ clearly seen in the results shown in Figure 3.15 b, \nwhere the packets lost\
    \ due to the building effect are indicated. In the \nsame way, the graph also\
    \ shows how very few packets are lost when \nthere is no building between the\
    \ bikes (NLoS situation). The same effect \ncan be seen in the results from Figure\
    \ 3.15 a, with zones with high losses \nand zones with no losses. \n \nFigure\
    \ 3.15: Received Signal Strength for (a) Path 1; (b) Path2 and 3. \nChapter 3\
    \ - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility\
    \ with Smart City-Platforms \n92 \n \nIn the presented work, the estimated received\
    \ power levels using the \n3D-RL algorithms are not compared to the ZigBee commercial\
    \ nodes \nRSSI for multiple reasons. First of all, the RSSI is based on the radio\
    \ signal \npower amount measurement. It is only an indication of the RF energy\
    \ \ndetected at the antenna port. The RSSI reported may include energy from \n\
    background noise and interferences, resulting in high signal strength \nvalues.\
    \ In some complex scenarios, it is possible to measure high RSSI \nvalues and\
    \ still have communication errors. Thus, The RSSI is an \napproximation for signal\
    \ strength received on an antenna and not for \nlink reliability estimation. It\
    \ only gives an indication of the received \npower. For this purpose, the received\
    \ power levels are estimated in the \nproposed scenarios for a more accurate RF\
    \ analysis. Moreover, the \nmeasured RSSI levels are often less accurate than\
    \ the received power \nlevels, with an estimated error between 1 dB and 10 dB,\
    \ and more \ndepending on the hardware used [186]. \nThe use of LPWAN systems\
    \ operating within ISM bands provides \nflexibility in terms of rapid deployment\
    \ and adoption, but are also \nsubject to inherent limitations such as interference.\
    \ The 2.4 GHz \nspectrum can exhibit high levels of background interference, owing\
    \ to \nmultiple sources such as intra-system, inter-system or external \ninterference\
    \ sources. In this sense, considering the employed \ntransmission bit rates and\
    \ the expected density of bike users as \ncompared with the total amount of potential\
    \ users (e.g., static users \nconnected to 2.4GHz WLAN or BT/BLE connections,\
    \ or pre-existent \nwireless sensor networks for telemetry/telecontrol purposes\
    \ within the \nurban infrastructure), in the pilot case described in this work,\
    \ \ninterference levels are within the usual interference background levels \n\
    within the urban area of Pamplona (i.e., spectral density values in the 0-\n6GHz\
    \ range in the order of -100 dBm/Hz to -95 dBm/Hz). This leads in \ngeneral to\
    \ normal operation in terms of packet error rate. However, a \nlarger increase\
    \ in device density, leading from dense to ultra-dense \ntransceiver environments\
    \ can lead to an increase in the background \nnoise level and hence to degradation\
    \ in system operation. In this sense, \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of\
    \ Wireless Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms\
    \ \n93 \n \nintensive coverage/capacity analysis is compulsory in order to \n\
    adequately characterize traffic distribution as well as to map \ninterference,\
    \ in order to consider alternative options, such as LPWAN \noperating within other\
    \ frequency bands, or the use of other systems such \nas IEEE 802.11 ah (sub 1\

    \ of 5g NR FR1 \ntransceivers. This is a topic that is currently under analysis\
    \ will be \ndiscussed in future works. \n3.3.2 \nIntelligent SDN-Based multi-protocol\
    \ selector for IoT-\nenabled NMT networks \nThis section introduces an intelligent\
    \ SDN-Based multi-protocol \nselector for IoT-enabled Non-Motorized Transportation\
    \ (NMT) \nnetworks. The principal purpose of this work is to give the mobile nodes\
    \ \nwithin the IoT-enabled NMT networks the flexibility to choose the \nappropriate\
    \ wireless communication protocol from among several \nprotocols they have for\
    \ transmitting information, according to a set of \ncriteria; such as battery\
    \ lifetime, data size, and priority of the packet in \norder for most important\
    \ data to pass first. \nNMT is a form of commuter that relies not on an engine\
    \ or a motor for \nmovement. NMT comprises bicycle and small-wheeled transport\
    \ such as \nkick scooters and skateboards [187]. Integrating NMT into the IoT\
    \ \nsystem provides a high benefit to cities, especially those seeking \nsustainable\
    \ development and transforming into smart cities. IoT-enabled \nNMT could become\
    \ one of the primary resources for dynamic \ninformation such as atmospheric (weather,\
    \ humidity, or temperature) \nand air quality information during its movement\
    \ in/within different \nparts of the city; besides, it has zero carbon emissions.\
    \ \nHowever, several challenges facing wireless communications are to be \naddressed\
    \ to deliver this information to the destination effectively, \nincluding data\
    \ rate, communication range, energy efficiency, diverse \nquality-of-service,\
    \ and selecting the suitable wireless communication \nChapter 3 - Performance\
    \ Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart\
    \ City-Platforms \n94 \n \nprotocol. An essential key pillar of an application's\
    \ success or failure is \nchoosing the appropriate wireless communication protocol\
    \ in a given \nsituation. This would mostly be effective as unsuitable wireless\
    \ \ntechnology can hamstring critical aspects of the performance of the \napplication,\
    \ and thus, it becomes unusable. Software-Defined \nNetworking (SDN) emerged as\
    \ an intelligent networking solution that \nuses dynamic software programs to\
    \ make communication management \neasier and to improve network performance, especially\
    \ in access \nnetworks [188]. The SDN separates the control logic from the sensor\
    \ \nnodes, making it a suitable solution for the inflexible management of \nWSNs.\
    \ \nSeveral literature works have discussed how to deal with \nmultiprotocol wireless\
    \ communication in heterogeneous networks. An \napproach based on fuzzy logic\
    \ is proposed in [189], where it takes QoS \nmeasurements of the trajectories\
    \ between origin and destination as input \nparameters and determines the weights\
    \ of all trajectories. Gao and \nChang have introduced in [190] a scalable and\
    \ flexible communication \nprotocol that serves as a bridge between the Internet\
    \ and numerous \nheterogeneous wireless networks. Kang et al. have proposed in\
    \ [191] a \nself-configurable gateway that detects and configures smart things\
    \ in \nreal time over wireless networks. Bonaiuto et al. have presented in [192]\
    \ \na system for elite sports applications based on a wireless sensor network\
    \ \nconsisting of peripheral nodes (up to eight) that communicate with the \n\
    user and collect data through a Wi-Fi connection, and a master node. \nKim et\
    \ al. have proposed in [193] an access gateway for the network \nenvironment of\
    \ the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), where it manages the \ntraffic of incoming data\
    \ to the In-vehicle Network (IVN) and the traffic \nof outgoing data to the IoV.\
    \ The gateways suffer difficulties since they \nare pre-configured, rely on vendor-specific\
    \ APIs, and are restricted to \njust authorized devices and policies  \nChapter\

    \ with Smart City-Platforms \n95 \n \n3.3.2.1 System Architecture  \nThe intelligent\
    \ SDN-Based multi-protocol wireless communication \nselector aims to give the\
    \ mobile nodes within the IoT-enabled NMT \nnetworks \nthe \nflexibility \nto\
    \ \nchoose \nthe \nappropriate \nwireless \ncommunication protocol from among\
    \ several wireless protocol modules \nthat they have for transmitting information,\
    \ according to a set of criteria \nsuch as bandwidth, energy consumption, and\
    \ reliability as mentioned \nbefore in Section 4.1.1, which are considerable on\
    \ the process of selecting \nan appropriate wireless communication protocol. The\
    \ mobile node (in \nour case is IoT-enabled NMT) is equipped with several wireless\
    \ \ncommunication modules, in addition to various types of sensors as \nshown\
    \ in Figure 3.16.  \n \nFigure 3.16: IoT-enabled NMT system description.  \nEach\
    \ of them is responsible for collecting data and detecting the \nchanges in the\
    \ environment, and then responding to some output in the \nother system. The SDN-Based\
    \ multi-protocol wireless communication \nselector organizes the process of sending\
    \ this data based on a set of rules \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless\
    \ Communication Networks for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n96 \n\
    \ \nstored in a knowledge base, which will be used by a fuzzy logic control \n\

    \ data and selecting the appropriate wireless communication \nprotocol that corresponds\
    \ to the characteristics of that data. The main \ncharacteristics of each technology\

    \ \n \nFigure 3.17: IoT-enabled NMT System architecture. \n3.3.2.2 \nSystem Implementation\
    \ \nThis section briefly introduces the fuzzy logic control system, semantic \n\
    reasoner and demonstrates how we integrate a system like that into a \nmobile\
    \ IoT node for better wireless communication protocol selection. \nThis would\
    \ lead to better network traffic management to meet QoS \nrequirements for various\
    \ services. \nA. Fuzzy Logic Control System \nThe fuzzy logic is defined as sort\
    \ of multivalued logic that is quite \nsimilar to human thinking than the traditional\
    \ logical system. A fuzzy \nlogic control system transforms linguistic control\
    \ strategies into an \nexpert knowledge-based automatic control technique [194].\
    \ Fuzzy logic \ncontrol system consist of three stages: 1) fuzzification, 2) fuzzy\
    \ inference, \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication Networks\
    \ for \nSmart Mobility with Smart City-Platforms \n97 \n \nand 3) defuzzification.\
    \ [189]. There are three functions in the \nfuzzification phase: a) measurement\
    \ of the input variable values, b) The \ntransformation of input data into linguistic\
    \ values that can be used as \nfuzzy set labels, c) scale mapping of input values\
    \ in the appropriate \nuniverse of discourse. A fuzzy logic controlling system's\
    \ brain is the \nfuzzy inference logic phase. This stage models human decision-making\
    \ \nbased on fuzzy concepts. Fuzzy control is inferred using fuzzy \nimplication\
    \ and fuzzy logic's inference procedures. In the defuzzification \nstep, a variety\
    \ of output parameters are translated into a corresponding \ndiscourse, and a\
    \ non-fuzzy control action is generated from a fuzzy \ncontrol action inferred.\
    \ \nB. Semantic Reasoner  \nSemantic reasoners are software applications that\
    \ can response \nquestions or calculate deductions, reasonable consequences using\
    \ \nontologies-based logical knowledge bases [195]. An ontology is a formal \n\
    description of the application domain's notions, relationships, and \nindividuals\
    \ [196]. Ontologies are widely used to represent knowledge, \nemphasis on the\
    \ integration of information, the reuse of components, \nand the discovery of\
    \ latent knowledge, among other things. They are \nexpressed with the standard\
    \ language; Web Ontology Language (OWL \n2) [197]. OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full\
    \ are three increasingly \nexpressive sublanguages of the OWL [198]. OWL DL is\
    \ a type of \ndescription logic that is extremely expressive with a RDF syntax.\
    \ \nDescription Logics (DLs) are a type of knowledge representation \nformalism\
    \ that is based on classes (concepts)[199]. One of the reasoners \nthat deal with\
    \ extensions of classical DLs is fuzzyDL, an extension to \nclassical DLs with\
    \ the goal of dealing with fuzzy / vague / imprecise \nconcepts [200]. The combination\
    \ of fuzzy logic with DLs or ontologies \nmakes it possible to represent imprecise\
    \ knowledge and to perform \napproximate reasoning. \n \n \nChapter 3 - Performance\

    \ City-Platforms \n98 \n \nC. System functionality \nThe SDN-based multi-protocol\
    \ selector is responsible for selecting the \nmost \nappropriate \nwireless \n\
    communication \nprotocol \nfor \ndata \ntransmission according to several rules.\
    \ This considers the type of data, \nits size, its importance, and the characteristics\
    \ of each protocol to ensure \nthe fulfillment of specific QoS requirements. The\
    \ characteristics of each \ncommunication protocol listed in Table 3.1, Table\
    \ 3.2, and Table 3.3 are \npreloaded to the SDN-based multi-protocol selector,\
    \ along with sensory \ndata type, size, sensor reading time interval, and degree\
    \ of importance. \nThe SDN-based multi-protocol selector receives data for the\
    \ input \nparameters and fuzzifies them based on the associated function of the\
    \ \ncorresponding input variables using the defined fuzzy logic control \nsystem.\
    \ \nFor instance, information such as videos, audio, and thermal imaging \nhas\
    \ a massive size and needs a high bandwidth communication protocol \nfor transmitting.\
    \ Also, with non-motorized transportation, there is no \nneed for real-time processing,\
    \ as in autonomous vehicles and drones. \nTherefore, these data will be marked\
    \ as not important data, and it will \nbe queued until the mobile nod is near\
    \ a public Wi-Fi hot-spot to \ntransmit them. On the other hand, dynamic information\
    \ such as \natmospheric (weather, humidity, or temperature) and air quality \n\
    information does not require a high bandwidth communication protocol \nfor transmitting,\
    \ but this information needs to be transmitted over fixed \nperiods of time, which\
    \ means a higher rate of energy consumption, due \nto the need to active (wake)\
    \ the node. Therefore, the SDN-based multi-\nprotocol selector should choose a\
    \ communication protocol that has a low \nenergy consumption and at the same time\
    \ has a low bandwidth. In other \ncases, such as a fall detected, it requires\
    \ the SDN-based multi-protocol \nselector to use all available resources and select\
    \ the highly reliable \ncommunication protocol to transmit the alert message as\
    \ shown in \nFigure 3.18. \nChapter 3 - Performance Evaluation of Wireless Communication\

    \ 3.18: Fuzzy Inference Process. \nSemantic technologies are used in this work\
    \ to describe the context of \nthe IoT-enabled NMT network as well as the mobile\
    \ node with its \ncharacteristics and capacity. The reasoner uses the information\
    \ available \nfrom the characterization of each radio interface and the occupancy\
    \ \nlevels of each of the QoS queues we have defined (urgent, streaming, \nirrelevant...).\
    \ These (crisp) ontologies are stored in a fuzzy knowledge \nbase (KB). fuzzyDL\
    \ enables for the importation of OWL Lite queries to \nmake it easy to represent\
    \ fuzzy KBs. It also uses a fuzzy element to \nestimate the occupancy of the queues.\

    \ intelligent urban mobility-bike handling, \nbike-2-bike communication, and restricted\
    \ vehicle access zone control \nsystem. The content of this chapter has been published\
    \ in \n[143][144][145][146]. \n4.1 \nIntroduction \nToday, there is a requirement\
    \ for a long-term method of developing \nsustainable cities by managing the life\
    \ cycles of cities through improving \neconomic performance over the entire life\
    \ cycle. It provides \nopportunities by introducing healthy competition in terms\
    \ of online \nservices like waste management, education, healthcare,  transportation\
    \ \nsystems, safety and many more [201][202]. The SC concept is based on \nT \n\
    Chapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith\
    \ City-Platforms \n101 \n \nthe collection of data and information from large\
    \ areas such as urban \ninfrastructures (water, energy, telecommunication, transport),\
    \ urban \nservices (administrative, education, municipal waste, culture, health,\
    \ \nsport, property), buildings use and consumption, and other data such as \n\
    those related to the air quality, congestion, urban incidents, weather, \nsecurity\
    \ and economic activity. The challenge of managing the massive \namounts of data\
    \ generated by IoT-based sensors and systems, however, \nis a primary one that\
    \ end users and vendors alike must address. \nSCPs are unified frameworks for\
    \ city operation and services that allow \nsensing, data fusion and integration,\
    \ communication, customizable \nservice providing, and intelligent decision-making,\
    \ among others. The \nSCPs provide a set of different real-time data visualization\
    \ and control \npanels that help manage the city effectively and make it easier\
    \ for \nresidents to access and understand the information available. This \n\
    allows citizens to feel an integral part of the city and actively participate\
    \ \nin its sustainability and energy efficiency, since citizens can see for \n\
    themselves the impact of their behavior on the city as a whole.  \n Different\
    \ issues must be addressed by SCPs in relation with:  \n \nScalable and standardized\
    \ data model, working with \nheterogeneous data sources. \n \nInformation management\
    \ with different levels of security \nand protection. \n \nCapability of providing\
    \ useful and innovative services and \nmechanisms for interaction with third parties.\
    \ \n \nAnalyze information, extract knowledge and optimize \nprocess flows. \n\
     \nPromotion of energy sustainability (mobility and self-\nconsumption), \n\
    \ \nTechnological independence of organizations, \n \nUse and support of smart\
    \ contracts, ensuring transparency \nwith citizens. \nCurrently, few municipalities\
    \ have platforms or systems for real time \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable\
    \ Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n102 \n \nmonitoring\
    \ and subsequent inference of urban process parameters. The \ncommonly employed\
    \ strategy is data collection, offline analysis, and \naction, followed by system\
    \ adjustments and repetition of the whole \nprocess. Based on that, this chapter\
    \ discuss the development and \nevaluation of our prototype for a SCP as a supportive\
    \ infrastructure for \nthe development of a SC, address the challenges that facing\
    \ the \ndevelopment of SCP, and to demonstrate the benefits of open data and \n\
    open platforms for SC adoption. In addition, we present an integrated \nsolution\
    \ for sensor systems and environmental sensing as a vertical \nservice linked\
    \ to the platform, which enables smart services using open \ndata, in our case\
    \ smart mobility. \n4.2 \nCity Platforms as Service Enablers \nThe challenge is\
    \ given by the fact that the IoT systems collect \nincreasingly significant amounts\
    \ of data. Without a context, the data is \nmeaningless and rarely effectively\
    \ leveraged because of the difficulties \nin interpreting data models and efficient\
    \ linking of data across \ndistributed systems. Therefore, the platform deals\
    \ with most of the \navailable information that comes from the different sector\
    \ applications \nand IoT systems in the city – in our example, the city of Pamplona,\
    \ Spain \n[203].  \nSCP can be described as system that: 1) ingest heterogeneous\
    \ data \nharvested from different sources (open data, IoT devices, citizen’s \n\
    information…), 2) a tool to provide city data (energy, transport, \ncrowdsourced\
    \ data…) sharing and integration, 3) an efficient tool to \nmap, store and provide\
    \ useful management dashboards, as illustrated in \nFigure 4.1.  \nChapter 4 -\
    \ Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms\
    \ \n103 \n \n \nFigure 4.1: Schematic description of the smart city platform.\
    \ \nSCP requires several essentials to ensure its efficient operation. SCP \n\
    needs to enable data coordination, provide customizable integral \nservices, favor\
    \ the creation of business activity, develop innovative \napplications and services,\
    \ and enable urban planning and the evaluation \nof new policies (such as smart\
    \ urban mobility, healthy habits, citizen \nawareness, among others). SCP must\
    \ focus on citizens and be the catalyst \nthat allows the flow of information\
    \ and service to and for the citizen. \nUltimately, SCP should emerge as an infrastructure\
    \ that will conform the \ncitizen-administration relationship, allowing not only\
    \ the efficient \nconclusion of administrative procedures or the provision of\
    \ services \nadapted to the needs of users. It will also offer an efficient and\
    \ effective \nmechanism for auditing and granting transparency of administrations.\
    \ \nThe platforms should allow citizens to see how their behavior affects the\
    \ \nwelfare of the city, as a vehicle to raise awareness among them that \nmunicipal\
    \ management begins with the citizens themselves.  \n4.2.1 \nRelated work  \n\
    Although many proposals have been made in the field of SCPs, we \nwill now analyze\
    \ some of the most relevant contributions in this field. \nChapter 4 - Enabling\
    \ Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n\
    104 \n \nZanella et al. introduced in [17] the need for these platforms to include\
    \ \na large number of diverse end systems, providing open access to \ndifferent\
    \ digital services. The provision of services and backing to third \nparties require\
    \ to give proactive and relevant support to citizens with \nservices capable of\
    \ creating and managing digital identities [204]. The \nreuse of the functionalities\
    \ of legacy systems and applications by \nadapting them to new architectures has\
    \ been described in [205]. The \nanalysis in the provision of multiple data sources\
    \ related to smart city \nservices consumers and the impact of data simplification\
    \ is described in \n[206], whereas providing distributed frameworks for service\
    \ discovery \ndoes in [207]. \nCommon and interoperable data model definition,\
    \ as well as \ninteroperability are addressed in [208], where a modular approach\
    \ to \nachieve interoperability is presented. Cross-platform interoperability\
    \ for \nsensors is addressed in [209], whereas in the case of [25], the interaction\
    \ \nis performed by means of adaptive semantic adapters. The \nstandardization\
    \ issue is addressed in [210], where the ISO 37120 \nstandard for city services\
    \ and quality of life is suggested as unified \nframework for smart city dashboards;\
    \ and [211], where a summary of \nsmart city standardization is presented. \n\
    The relevance of fog computing for sustainable smart cities is \naddressed in\
    \ [212], which discusses the challenges an issues of fog-based \nIoT environments,\
    \ highlights main applications of fog computing and \ndiscusses various caching\
    \ techniques in the IoT era, even considering \nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\
    \ and AI/ML techniques and \ntechnologies. \nSmart contracts are currently an\
    \ interesting object of study, as they \nmake possible interesting interrelations\
    \ among smart cities, and between \nthese and their citizens. Ekiden [213] leverages\
    \ a novel architecture that \nseparates consensus from execution, enabling efficient\
    \ Trusted \nExecution Environments (backed confidentiality) preserving smart \n\
    contracts and high scalability, while [214] analyzes the need of a \nChapter 4\
    \ - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms\
    \ \n105 \n \ndistributed network formed among cities, allowing the integration\
    \ of \ndistributed electric energy into the power grid. \nSecurity and personal\
    \ data management, preserving policies and \nregulations related with personal\
    \ data protection, are addressed in \n[215][216][217][218]. Privacy as well as\
    \ security aspects have to be \nconsidered [215] granting an end-to-end secure\
    \ solutions and \nenvironments where personal data, in transit or/and storage,\
    \ remains \nunder the full control of the users. The efforts to standardize security\
    \ \nsolutions for the IoT ecosystem initially introduced in [218] focused on \n\
    communication security solutions for IoT, and their standardization, but \nit\
    \ also applications, data custody and services.  Protecting information is \n\
    crucial and specific security mechanisms must be designed and \nimplemented [217].\
    \ Blockchain techniques have also been considered to \nbuild secure and reliable\
    \ data sharing platform among multiple data \nproviders, where IoT data is encrypted\
    \ and then recorded on a \ndistributed ledger [218]. \nRegarding the comparison\
    \ with other smart cities in terms of the \ntechnologies used in the different\
    \ layers by the different cities, and the \nmajor components in other SCPs; the\
    \ challenge in this regard is the \nmajority of these projects are not open/open-source,\
    \ so the information \navailable about the components and technologies used is\
    \ limited and in \nmost cases is not accessible. Furthermore, factors such as\
    \ climate, terrain, \ninfrastructure, in addition to cities worldwide have vastly\
    \ differing \nbackgrounds, priorities, capabilities, culture, strengths, and objectives,\
    \ \nmake the comparison process difficult because each model was built \nbased\
    \ on these factors, which differ from one city to another.  In this case, \nthe\

    \ Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n107 \n \n4.2.2 \nCity Platform Architecture\
    \ Design  \nThe definition of the architecture of a SCP must be as generic as\
    \ \npossible, achieving the maximum possible interoperability, scalability, \n\
    efficiency, and simplicity. Figure 4.2 depicts the different layers and \ncomponents\
    \ that a SCP must include. The lower level is referred to data \nacquisition.\
    \ The next higher level refers to the flow of the data acquired \nat the lower\
    \ level (data adaptation, information standardization, \ninformation source and\
    \ destination flows…). The third level refers to the \nstorage, analysis and processing\
    \ of this data; and finally, the upper level \nrefers to the provision of services\
    \ to third parties, system monitoring, the \npresentation of control panels, etc.\
    \ \n \n \nFigure 4.2: Schematic description of the city platform layer architecture.\
    \ \nThe proposed prototype of the city platform is structured in five main \n\
    layers, namely, perception layer, communication layer, data acquisition \nlayer,\
    \ data management layer and application services and visualization \nlayer, as\
    \ shown in Figure 4.3.  \n \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal\
    \ Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n108 \n \n \nFigure 4.3: The Platform\
    \ architecture.  \nThe perception layer consists of physical objects, which are\
    \ monitored \nby sensor and actuator devices, having as main objective the collection\
    \ \nof sensor data and command actuation. The Data Acquisition layer is \ncomposed\
    \ of several communication technologies such as LoRaWAN \n[227], Sigfox [75],\
    \ broadband cellular network technology, etc. To \ntransmit sensory data and commands\
    \ between the upper layers and the \nperception layer. Chapter 3 presents a comparative\
    \ analysis for different \nwireless technologies.  \nThe Data Acquisition layer\
    \ includes protocols and software \ncomponents for data acquisition (e.g., MQTT\
    \ [228], Kafka [131], and NiFi \n[229]) are the key characteristic of this layer,\
    \ in addition to security and \ndevice management functions. The FIWARE IoT Agent\
    \ GE also belongs \nto this layer as it translates the internal FIWARE data representation\
    \ in \nJSON from/to devices. The Data Management layer includes software \ncomponents\
    \ responsible for data streaming, data storage, processing and \ndistribution\
    \ based on one of FIWARE GEs (Orion).  The Application \nServices and Visualization\
    \ Layer is responsible for information \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services\
    \ for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n109 \n \npresentation,\
    \ exchange, and use. \nThis architecture offers adequate scalability, since it\
    \ allows the \nmunicipal managers to define the platform's service catalog (either\
    \ \nincorporation or cancelation of services) as required. In this sense, \nscalability\
    \ is achieved in three dimensions. The first is the possibility of \ndefining\
    \ and offering new services and functionalities, or the possibility \nof cancelling\
    \ them, as the situation requires. The second dimension is the \nuse of mechanisms\
    \ for publishing services and access to the platform \nthrough a REST API and\
    \ JSON files, which allow adequate accessibility \nto the platform while maintaining\
    \ adequate distributed performance. \nFinally, the implementation of the platform\
    \ in a virtualized system, \nwhich allows to adapt the operative instances of\
    \ each component to the \nneeds of each moment. \n4.2.3 \nCity Platform Implementation\
    \  \nIn this section, we highlight the techniques, tools, and services used to\
    \ \ndesign and implement the city platform in order to evaluate the \nperformance\
    \ of data flow components; sources, transformations, and \ndestinations between\
    \ the different layers of the SCP. In this sense, we \npresent several use cases\
    \ for intelligent mobility as vertical services \nlinked to the SCP. \nThe development\
    \ of a real city platform poses many challenges when \nintegrating some legacy\
    \ information systems and their associated \nservices, into the service catalog.\
    \ Many of the services provided use \ninformation delivered in non-standardized\
    \ formats, require specific \ncommunication protocols, or even use third-party\
    \ proprietary formats. \nThis implies the need to have a layered architecture\
    \ that allows the \nintroduction of adapters and parsers that guarantee the necessary\
    \ \nstandardization and easy maintenance of the platform as shown in Fig. \nFigure\
    \ 4.4. The viability of the platform is therefore directly conditioned \nby its\
    \ scalability, ease of maintenance, standardization, the semantic \nefficiency\
    \ of its data model and its accessibility.  \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable\
    \ Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n110 \n \n \n\
    Figure 4.4: The Platform implementation. \nTo ensure the proper operation of this\
    \ architecture, it is compulsory to \nhave a suitable data model that guarantees\
    \ the semantic integrity of the \nsystem and allows the transformation of data\
    \ into information, and later \ninto knowledge. It is far from frequent that SCPs\
    \ share the same data \nmodel. Therefore, obtaining the data model is a complex\
    \ task in \nadministrations, which have multiple systems and information sources\
    \ \nthat have been implemented at different times and for different \npurposes,\
    \ but which coexist in an unstable balance. In fact, the lack of \nstandardization\
    \ at this level is one of the main causes of the difficulties \nobserved \nwhen\
    \ \nexchanging \ninformation \nbetween \nsiloed \nIoT applications, cities, institutions\
    \ or even companies or organizations \nproviding services. The data standardization\
    \ and context information \nmanagement provide the ability to integrate existing\
    \ services, different \ntechnologies, and protocols, introduce new third-party\
    \ services or \napplications, and extend applications' interoperability. \nThe\
    \ European Union (EU) is making a major effort to make FIWARE \n[230] the tool\
    \ to support global interoperability. FIWARE is a vast \necosystem \nproviding\
    \ \nstandardized \nAPIs \nused \nin \nopen-source \nimplementations of Generic\
    \ Enablers (GEs) based on open specifications. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable\
    \ Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n111 \n \nFIWARE\
    \ has now turned into a foundation focused on the high-level \ndata interoperation\
    \ of IoT and other systems using a Context \nInformation model extended from the\
    \ Open Mobile Alliance Next-\nGeneration Service Interface (NGSI) 9/10 standard\
    \ [231][232][233]. \nProbably one of FIWARE's most useful contributions is its\
    \ data modeling \ngiven by the Context Information Management API NGSI-LD (LD\
    \ \nstands for linked data), which supports linked data, property graphs, \nand\
    \ semantics (JSON-LD). Data Models play a crucial role because they \ndefine the\
    \ harmonized representation formats and semantics that will be \nused by applications\
    \ both to consume and to publish data. Figure 4.5 \nshows the three main concepts\
    \ of NGSI data model. \n \nFigure 4.5: NGSI data model. \nThe NGSI-LD is designed\
    \ to allow cross-domain sharing while \npreserving the need to enable restrictions\
    \ based on General Data \nProtection Regulation (GDPR), privacy, security, or\
    \ licensing concerns. \nThe NGSI-LD defines a simple way to send or request data\
    \ using a \nserialization format (JSON-LD), which is already well known to many\
    \ \nsoftware developers, enabling its rapid adoption. \nFIWARE provides a set\
    \ of data models and makes them available to \nsoftware developers to be used\
    \ wherever they want, but with \ncompliance to FIWARE NGSI version 2 and NGSI-LD\
    \ to enable data \nportability for different applications including, Smart Cities,\
    \ Smart \nAgrifood, Smart Environment, Smart Sensoring, Smart Energy, Smart \n\
    Water and other domains. Each one of these domains consists of several \n“Topics”\
    \ including Alert, Streetlighting, Transportation, Urban \nMobility, and many\
    \ more as shown in Figure 4.6. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for\
    \ Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n112 \n \n \nFigure 4.6: Part\
    \ of FIWARE data models for several domains (Source: \nAuthor and [234]). \nAs\
    \ can be seen from Figure 4.6, “Smart Cities” data models include \nseveral data\
    \ models related to SC domains, including data models for \nbuildings, parking,\
    \ parks and gardens, point of interest, transportation, \nurban mobility, weather\
    \ and waste management. These models have \nbeen devised to be as generic as possible,\
    \ thus allowing to deal with \ndifferent scenarios. For instance, transportation\
    \ harmonized data models \ndescribe the main entities involved with smart applications\
    \ that deal \nwith transportation issues. This set of entities is primarily associated\
    \ \nwith the vehicles and SC vertical segments and related IoT applications. \n\
    “EVChargingStation” one of these entities that represents a public \ncharging\
    \ station supplying energy to electrical vehicles. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable\
    \ Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n113 \n \nFigure\
    \ 4.7 shows a snapshot of NGSI-LD representation of this entity. \n \nFigure 4.7:\
    \ NGSI-LD representation of “EVChargingStation” entity \n(Source:[235]). \nAs\
    \ Figure 4.4 shows, services like NiFi are used to automate the data \nflow among\
    \ different information systems and components. While \nstream-processing tools\
    \ such as Apache Kafka and Spark stream allow \nto handle and transform real-time\
    \ data feeds, minimizing latency and \nmaximizing data throughput. In addition,\
    \ the platform has an adequate \nmechanism for data ingestion, transformation,\
    \ and storage. Data \ningestion can occur synchronously or asynchronously, from\
    \ very \nheterogeneous sources and in large volumes. For this reason, it is \n\
    mandatory to standardize the data model as much as possible and to \ntransform\
    \ data before its storage. The NiFi process provides the means \nChapter 4 - Enabling\
    \ Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n\
    114 \n \nto take a given stream of data in JSON format and transform it to the\
    \ \nFIWARE model. The normalized and standardized data are then \ntransmitted\
    \ to the FIWARE Orion context broker to perform the data \nstorage with the support\
    \ of the Cygnus component (see Figure 4.8). \n \nFigure 4.8: Streaming data transformation.\
    \ \n Data storage follows the NGSI data model and can be performed \neither into\
    \ relational or non-relational databases. If requires, distributed \nfile systems\
    \ as HDPS can also be used. \nFurthermore, context information management provides\
    \ the exchange \nof cross-cutting context information, to be used in SC use cases,\
    \ \nparticularly scalability and extensibility. The NGSI version 2 is an open,\
    \ \nRESTful API that allows providers to export data, using JSON \nrepresentations,\
    \ of different nature and origin uniformly. Therefore, the \nplatform provides\
    \ a set of APIs to software developers and third-party \napplications to interact\
    \ with data, thus, to accelerate the development of \nsmart solutions.  \nFinally,\
    \ cloud-based solutions such as those provided by Google, \nAzure or Amazon, make\
    \ the platform easily scalable to meet changing \ndemand for IT resources. They\
    \ cover two main types of scalability: \nhorizontal and vertical scaling, which\
    \ provides highly customizable \ninfrastructure according to necessity. Thus,\
    \ leading cloud service \nproviders or an on-premises infrastructure offer auto-scaling\
    \ service, \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility\
    \ \nwith City-Platforms \n115 \n \nwhich monitors the performance of applications\
    \ and automatically \nadjusts the capacity to maintain steady and predictable\
    \ performance. \nFurthermore, CloudHealth technologies provide the ability to\
    \ manage \nmany elements of scalability across one cloud or multiple clouds. \n\
    4.3 \nUses Cases \nThis section presents a set of vertical services linked to\
    \ the platform.  \nEach one of the smart cities projects define its own key performance\
    \ \nindicators (KPIs) in the context of smart sustainable cities (SSCs). The \n\
    International Telecommunication Union (ITU)[236], provides the KPIs \n(Recommendation\
    \ \nITU- \nY.4900/L.1600, \nT \nY.4901/L.1601, \nand \nY.4902/L.1602) related\
    \ to ICT adoption and use in the context of SSCs. In \nour case, the KPIs of the\
    \ STARDUST project focus on Carbon dioxide \n(CO2) emission reduction in the domain\
    \ of building and district, energy \nand E-mobility, Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission\
    \ reduction in the \ndomain of E-mobility, improve the interoperability between\
    \ systems, \nand quality of open data in the domain of ICT.  \nIn this phase of\
    \ the Stardust project, we can validate and evaluate the \nsuccess by comparing\
    \ the results of previous data with current data. \nSince the comparison of the\
    \ results with other cities within the same \nproject (Stardust) takes place in\
    \ 2023, two years after the end of the \nevaluation phase, which was in 2021.\
    \ \n4.3.1 \nCustomizable Multi-modal Urban Mobility \nWe conceive multimodal smart\
    \ mobility as a customized and on-\ndemand service provided to users to solve\
    \ their mobility needs \neffectively and efficiently. For example, it will be\
    \ more helpful to the \nresidents with respiratory diseases if they know which\
    \ parts of the city \nhave the highest air pollution to avoid these areas during\
    \ their mobility. \nIn addition to meeting the individual criteria of each user,\
    \ the mobility \nservice will seek to promote sustainable mobility and minimize\
    \ the \nimpact of the carbon footprint. For example, information related to \n\
    Chapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith\
    \ City-Platforms \n116 \n \nElectric Vehicles (EV) charging stations such as location,\
    \ charging speed, \nconnector type, and availability contribute to saving time,\
    \ avoiding \ntraffic congestion and reducing pollution. \nIn this section, we\
    \ present one of the applications linked to our urban \ndata platform for the\
    \ SC. We introduce a customizable multimodal \nurban mobility, which is one of\
    \ the many benefits of open data and urban \ndata platform for smart city development.\
    \ It is an integrated solution for \nseveral sensing systems, open data generated\
    \ by city domains \n(government, health, environment, transportation, etc.), which\
    \ enables \nexperimentation with applications and services in order to enhance\
    \ their \noperation, being one of them smart urban mobility, as illustrated \n\
    in Figure 4.9. \n \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal\
    \ Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n117 \n \nFigure 4.9: Interoperability\
    \ between several service domains in a smart city \nof Pamplona. \nThe idea is\
    \ to use the data produced from IoT systems as well as from \nother sectors to\
    \ create urban mobility solutions that are more \ncomfortable, efficient, and\
    \ take into account environmental and societal \nconstraints.  \nThis information\
    \ contains, for example, the schedule for bus and \ntrains, the availability of\
    \ public parking among the town, the warnings \nthat come from the municipal government,\
    \ and the traffic jam \ninformation that comes from provincial traffic offices,\
    \ among others. \nData garbage and import from logical sources is performed \n\
    automatically by a set of specific bots that update the information \nautomatically\
    \ with the programmed frequency to the platform. As the \nmunicipal services schedule\
    \ any cultural, institutional, sport, social, \neducational, environmental or\
    \ safety (pollution, traffic…) activity or \nevent, the information is automatically\
    \ uploaded to the platform so that \nit can be available for the mobility services\
    \ to offer an adequate service. \n After subsequent data processing and handling,\
    \ interoperable context \ninformation is generated according to relevant contexts\
    \ for smart \napplications in proper formal definitions. Finally, the extracted\
    \ \nknowledge is used to build the decision-making process and, at the same \n\
    time, to provide information to the end-user, as shown in Figure \n4.10.  Figure\
    \ 4.11, shows the data flow of the information.  \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable\

    122 \n \n4.3.1.2 Data Model \nThis subsection presents the data model of the intelligent\
    \ urban \nmobility service. Figure 4.12 illustrates the implemented semantic model\
    \ \n(ontology). The idea is to make use of the huge amount of data, obtained \n\
    from the different sectors within the smart city system, to provide a new \nurban\
    \ mobility service to the user. The challenge lies on the fact that this \namount\
    \ of data comes with different data types and formats, so there is \na need to\
    \ build a knowledge base as a semantic representation to convert \nand formalize\
    \ it from unintelligible format to a textual and meaningful \nformat. This can\
    \ be achieved by building semantic reasoning and \nrepresentation that facilitates\
    \ the perception of multiple data sources as \nmeaningful. Therefore, building\
    \ an ontology is to enhance the system \nperformance by describing the different\
    \ formats and data types more \nknowledgeably and better representing the data\
    \ context.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal\
    \ Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n123 \n \n \nFigure 4.12: Semantic model\
    \ of the multimodal smart mobility. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services\
    \ for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n124 \n \nTo provide customizable\
    \ multimodal service to citizens, the platform \noffers a REST API to allow third-party\
    \ applications, which will be \ndescribed later. Figure 4.13 describes the behavior\
    \ and data flow of the \nsmart mobility service. The query engine manages the\
    \ interaction \nbetween data and knowledge and provides, with the aid of the REST\
    \ \nAPI, the information required to the third-party apps. \n \n \nFigure 4.13:\
    \ Multimodal smart mobility service schema.  \nThe REST API allows third-party\
    \ Apps to interact with the smart \nmobility service. The engine receives the\
    \ requests (JSON format), builds \nthe appropriate SPARQL queries and executes\
    \ them against the \nknowledge base obtaining a set of RDF triplets, which describe\
    \ the \nconceptual model. The engine takes into account both the customized \n\
    parameters included into the request and the triplets recovered, and \nprovides\
    \ a JSON file with the results, which is submitted to the App. \nFinally, the\
    \ third-party App receives the response in JSON format (also \navailable in XML\
    \ format if required) and then displays the information. \nChapter 4 - Enabling\
    \ Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n\
    125 \n \n4.3.1.3 \nData Source  \nTo offer such a customize mobility, the system\
    \ has to deal with a \nheterogeneous data source as shown in Figure 4.14. \n \n\
    Figure 4.14: Data sources of multimodal smart mobility system.  \nWe acquired\
    \ the environmental factors from three major sources. The \nfirst one is AEMET\
    \ (Agencia Estatal de Meteorología, Spain's \nmeteorological \nagency) \n[253].\
    \ \nIt \nprovides \nopen \ndata \nabout \nmeteorological and climatological information.\
    \ This information \nincludes weather forecasting, warnings, announcements, and\
    \ public \nattention. Figure 4.15 illustrates a snapshot of the JSON file that\
    \ we \nimported from the AEMET’s web service to acquire meteorological \ninformation.\
    \ \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \n\
    with City-Platforms \n126 \n \n \nFigure 4.15: A snapshot of meteorological information\
    \ in JSON format.  \nThe second source of the environmental factors is SITNA (Sistema\
    \ de \nInformación Territorial de Navarra) [254]. SITNA provides information \n\
    including \nvarious \ntopics: \northophotos, \ncartography, \nfacilities, \nhydrography,\
    \ culture, environment, infrastructures, and so on. Figure \n4.16 shows a snapshot\
    \ of two GeoJSON files from SITNA that have \ninformation regarding taxi stands\
    \ and municipal parks which including \n(ID, type, coordination, etc.). We used\
    \ this information to provide a set \nof mobility options depending on the user\
    \ preferences. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart\
    \ Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n127 \n \n \nFigure 4.16: A snapshot of territorial\
    \ information in GeoJSON format. \nThe third source of the environmental factors\
    \ is the information \nprovided by the Government of Navarre concerning air quality\
    \ control \n[255] and meteorology [256]. \nWe also obtained the General Transit\
    \ Feed Specification (GTFS) \ninformation from the Regional Urban Transport -\
    \ Transporte Urbano \nComarcal (TCC) [257]. Figure 4.17 shows a snapshot of the\
    \ real time \nGTFS in JSON format. \n \n Figure 4.17: A snapshot of real-time\
    \ GTFS \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility\
    \ \nwith City-Platforms \n128 \n \nWith respect to crowd counting, we used a Wi-Fi\
    \ RSSI (Received \nSignal Strength Indicator) - based crowd counting system implemented\
    \ \nin-house to estimate the number of people in a crowd at a certain area. \n\
    So, depending on estimates, the system avoids the routes of these \novercrowded\
    \ locations, which contributes to reducing traffic congestion \nand shortening\
    \ the trip time. The working principle of Wi-Fi RSSI- based \ncrowd counting system\
    \ is based on reading the strength of the Wi-Fi \nsignal from the user’s mobile.\
    \ In this way, the system does not need any \nkind of registration or pairing\
    \ to work, ensuring that the privacy of the \nuser is not violated. Figure 4.18\
    \ illustrates the heat map of the number of \nWi-Fi access points and Figure 4.19\
    \ illustrates the heat map of the RSSI \nvalues received during a journey in the\
    \ city of Pamplona. \n \nFigure 4.18: Heat map of number of Wi-Fi access points\
    \ found within \n300m2. \n \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal\

    \ case from the Public University of Navarre (UPNA) to the \nUniversity of Navarra\
    \ (UNAV). The route in red color represents the \nbicycle route, whereas the one\
    \ in blue color is for the urban bus route. \nThe mobility proposal can include\
    \ intermodality if desired. In this case, \nthe system considers the possibility\
    \ of booking a guarded parking slot \nor that the folded bicycle can be transported\
    \ in the bus. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart\
    \ Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n130 \n \n \nFigure 4.20: Data visualization\
    \ of several recommended routes from UPNA \nto UNAV. \n4.3.2 \nBi2Bi Communication\
    \ \nCycling is the most sustainable means of urban travel, practical for \nmost\
    \ short and medium-distance trips - commute to and from work and \nschool, shopping,\
    \ visiting friends – and for leisure and exercise. Cycling \nhas emerged as one\
    \ of the most important alternative modes of transport \nbecause of its flexibility,\
    \ low costs, reduced personal carbon and \ncollective footprint, improved traffic\
    \ flow, and mobility in cities, as well \nas potential contributions to the development\
    \ of more sustainable cities. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for\
    \ Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n131 \n \nThe IoT-Enabled bike,\
    \ equipped with sensors and processing devices, \nwould enable dynamic transmission\
    \ and reception of crucial \ninformation to support new mobility optimization\
    \ services, improve \nexisting service quality, and provide additional services\
    \ such as \nenvironmental monitoring, safety emergency services, and point of\
    \ \ninterest. \nIn this section, we analyze Bi2Bi communication and cooperation\
    \ \ntowards sustainable smart mobility, providing a tool based on the city \n\
    platform to monitor and understand the impact of mobility at both city \nand citizen\
    \ level and to provide accurate information on carbon footprint \nreduction. \n\
    In Chapter 3, we analyzed and experimentally evaluate the \nperformance of Bi2Bi\
    \ wireless communication in various urban \nscenarios. \n4.3.2.1 \nSystem Architecture\
    \ \nA. Hardware Architecture \nThe hardware architecture is divided in two layers:\
    \ perception layer \nand communication layer as shown in Figure 4.21. \n \nFigure\
    \ 4.21: Hardware Architecture. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for\
    \ Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n132 \n \n \nPerception Layer\
    \  \nThe perception layer is the physical layer that is generally in a smart \n\
    environment scenario, to cope with the sensing and gathering of \ninformation\
    \ about the environment. The gathered information can be \nlocation, temperature,\
    \ humidity, air quality, etc. This gathered \ninformation transmits through the\
    \ communication layer toward the \nupper layer. \n \nCommunication Layer \nThe\
    \ Communication layer handles the connectivity, message routing \namong remote\
    \ devices, and routing between devices and the upper \nlayers, further details\
    \ have been presented in chapter 3. \nB. Software Architecture \nThe software\
    \ architecture is divided into three layers: sensor data \nacquisition layer,\
    \ management, and visualization, as shown in Figure \n4.22. \n \nFigure 4.22:\
    \ Software architecture. \n \n \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for\
    \ Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n133 \n \n \nData Acquisition\
    \ Layer \nThe Data Acquisition layer is composed of several communication \nprotocols\
    \ and software components for data acquisition such as the \nMQTT - it is a publish-subscribe,\
    \ lightweight network protocol to \ntransfer messages between devices- to transmit\
    \ sensory data and \ncommands between the upper layers and the perception layer.\
    \ \n \nData Management Layer \nThe Data Management layer acts as an intermediate\
    \ layer between the \nIoT devices that gather data and the applications accessing\
    \ the data for \nanalysis purposes and services. The sensory data comes from the\
    \ \nacquisition layer with varying formats and structures. Therefore, the \ndata\
    \ management layer pre-processes the data to handle missing data, \nremove redundancies,\
    \ and integrate data from different sources into a \nunified schema before being\
    \ committed to storage. The storage of data is \nperforming in relational or non-relational\
    \ databases or both of them. \n \nApplication Services and Data Visualization\
    \ Layer \nThe application layer uses the data that stored, aggregated, filtered,\
    \ \nand processed in the previous layer to provide services including \nanalytics,\
    \ reporting, and device control to end users. \n4.3.2.2 \nSYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION\
    \ \nThis section describes the hardware, software, components, and tools \nused\
    \ to implement the system. The hardware part represents the mobile \nIoT node\
    \ (in our case, the bike) that supports sensing, data gathering, \nexchanging\
    \ data between bikes, and then sending it to the back-end \nserver. The second\
    \ part is the software part, where the collected data is \nstored and processed\
    \ to be later displayed on the client web portal. \nA. Hardware Implementation\
    \ \nThe hardware and wireless technology used in the implementation \nphase for\
    \ the mobile IoT nodes is outlined in this section. Figure 4.23, \nChapter 4 -\

    \ hardware implementation. \n \nMobile IoT Node  \nThe mobile IoT node is composed\
    \ of a microcontroller board, a \nwireless network module, GPS module, power source,\
    \ and a set of \nsensors to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature,\
    \ \nhumidity, and different types of gases to monitor the air quality. All of\
    \ \nthem placed on a box attached to the bike as shown in Figure 4.24. \n \nChapter\

    \ SPI, I2C. To obtain \nthe humidity level from the environment, we used 808H5V5\
    \ humidity \nsensor. The MCP9700A sensor used to monitor the temperature. The\
    \ \nTGS2442 sensor used to measure the changes in concentration of Carbon \nMonoxide\
    \ (CO). The MiCS-2610 sensor used to measure the variation of \nthe Ozone (O3)\
    \ concentration. The MiCS-2710 sensor used to measure \nthe presence of concentrations\
    \ of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). The MQ-136 \nsensor used to detect the Sulfur Dioxide\
    \ (SO2) in the air. The Waspmote \nGPS module is used to track and map bike movements\
    \ within the city. \nThe tracking and mapping feature can also be used to recover\
    \ stolen \nbikes. It can also examine and analyze the behavior of bikers in terms\
    \ of \nthe most frequently used tracks by them, which has an impact on \ninfrastructure\
    \ improvements. Transferring data from an IoT node to the \nnext layer is done\
    \ through an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless network module to \nsend all sensor measurements\
    \ to the server over a MQTT protocol. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services\
    \ for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n136 \n \nB. Software Implementation\
    \ \nThis section outlines the development tools and technologies used in \nthe\
    \ implementation phase for the Bi2Bi system. Figure 4.25 illustrates the \nimplementation\
    \ components. \n \n \nFigure 4.25: Bi2Bi system Implementation Components. \n\
     \nBackend IoT \nIn this layer, we have used Node.js to build a server application\
    \ to \ncreate a private Mosca MQTT broker to handle all the messages from the\
    \ \nclients (Mobile IoT Nodes) and re-routing them to their appropriate \ndestinations.\
    \ Also, the server application processes the coming data and \nact as a data access\
    \ layer for saving and retrieving data in/from the \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable\
    \ Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n137 \n \ndatabases.\
    \ We have used two types of databases. The first is a relational \ndatabase; MySQL,\
    \ an open-source relational database management \nsystem. The second is a non-relational\
    \ database; MongoDB, an open-\nsource document-oriented database as shown in Figure\
    \ 4.26. \n \nFigure 4.26: Snapshot of sensory data stored in different databases:\
    \ a) \nMongoDB, b) MySQL. \nThe mobile IoT node connects to the broker, and it\
    \ can subscribe to \nany message “topic” in the broker. The coordinator of the\
    \ mobile IoT \nnode publishes its sensor readings as messages, besides other readings\
    \ \nit has received from the router nodes to the broker under the topic \n“IoTNodeData”.\
    \ Once the data arrived at the broker, the server \napplication processes this\
    \ data, extracts the information, and saves \nsensor data into the database. The\
    \ connection between the node and \nbroker can be a plain TCP/IP connection or\
    \ an encrypted TLS connection \nfor sensitive messages. \n \nApplication and\
    \ Data Visualization  \nThe application layer uses Grafana, a multi-platform open-source\
    \ \nanalytics, and an interactive visualization web application. Grafana \nconsumes\
    \ the data stored in MongoDB and MySQL to visualize it in a \ngraphical representation\
    \ as shown in Figure 4.27. As it can be seen, the \ndashboard offers several panels;\
    \ each of these panels displays a \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services\
    \ for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n138 \n \ngraphical representation\
    \ of the data set. Figure 4.28 shows the historical \nair-quality data, while\
    \ Figure 4.29 shows the historical temperature \nmeasurements. \n \nFigure 4.27:\
    \ Grafana main dashboard. \n \n \nFigure 4.28: Historical air-quality data. \n\

    \ city center of Pamplona. \n4.3.3 \nInteraction with Third-Party Systems \nInteraction\
    \ with third-party systems is provided by means of Swagger \n[258], an Interface\
    \ Description Language (IDL) for describing RESTful \nAPIs expressed using JSON.\
    \ The REST API follows the OpenAPI 3.0 \nspecification [259] and uses the JWT\
    \ (JSON Web Token), based on the \nRFC 7519 standard, to define a compact and\
    \ self-contained way of \nsecurely transmitting information between parties as\
    \ a JSON object. This \ninformation can be verified and trusted because it is\
    \ digitally signed. \nOne of the main features of JWT is that it does not need\
    \ to store the \ntokens into a database on the server or support an authentication\
    \ service. \nAn example of query may be: \nGET \nhttps://XXX.XXX.XXX/events?id_types=8,12,14&idZone=SouthEast&inclu\n\
    deTraffic=true&dateFrom=2020-11-12&dateTo=2020-12-31 \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable\
    \ Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n141 \n \n \n\
    Obtaining as result a JSON file including all the information available \nthat\
    \ satisfies the conditions of the query. Swagger provides the needed \ntransparency\
    \ in order to interact with the remote service with a minimal \namount of implementation\
    \ logic. This makes it relatively easy to develop \nand deploy new services and\
    \ applications based on the mobility service \nabove described and the support\
    \ of the city platform. \n4.3.3.1 \nPamplona CityApp \nWe present the “Pamplona\
    \ City App,” a mobile application that \nallows, among other things, citizens\
    \ to organize their routes according \nto their interests, monitor their carbon\
    \ footprint and know the impact of \ntheir mobility on the city. It aims to encourage\
    \ citizens to use sustainable \ntransportation modes by showing the percentage\
    \ of CO2 reduction \ncompared to the use of vehicles using fossil fuels. In addition,\
    \ noise \npollution is also reduced. \nIn our case, the Pamplona CityApp, providing\
    \ a tool based on the city \nplatform to monitor and understand the impact of\
    \ mobility at both city \nand citizen level and to provide accurate information\
    \ on carbon footprint \nreduction. The CityApp developed within the framework\
    \ of the \nSTARDUST [14] project, allows people to organize their routes according\
    \ \nto their interests, answering questions such as: which route do I have to\
    \ \ntake to visit the Museum of Navarra between 10 and 12 in the morning, \neat\
    \ in a vegetarian restaurant and go to a jazz concert starting at 8 in the \n\
    afternoon. When generating the route, the app even takes into account \nsome of\
    \ the user's own requirements, such as, for example, taking into \naccount that\
    \ user has a pollen allergy to avoid passing close to heavily \nwooded areas.\
    \ In case of cycling the route, the app shows the locations \nand availability\
    \ of the bike parking (known as igloos), analyzes the CO2 \nreduction compared\
    \ to the use of vehicles using fossil fuels and shows \nthe citizen's contribution\
    \ to the sustainability of the city. \nThe app has an initial screen (Figure 4.33\
    \ -a-) which shows, in addition \nto relevant tourist information, information\
    \ on sustainable mobility and \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for\
    \ Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n142 \n \nenergy efficiency\
    \ in the city (results of the H2020 European STARDUST \nproject). The services\
    \ include a set of preselected filters that limits the \nscope of the search,\
    \ and a complete and customizable search tool for \nevents, locations and mobility\
    \ proposals. A highly demanded service is \nthe planning of routes in the city\
    \ related to the San Fermines: “Pamplona \nen San Fermines”. Also noteworthy is\
    \ the monitoring service to monitor \nthe carbon footprint and to improve the\
    \ sustainability of the city. \nWhen one of the services is selected (Figure 4.33b\
    \ corresponds to the \ncase of Pamplona in San Fermines), the app shows the different\
    \ geolocated \nelements that the user can access. In case of being interested\
    \ in the \nevents, the user can select this option and, for a given date, view\
    \ the \nevents on the map. \nThe user can organize his route in the city taking\
    \ into account the \ngeolocated events and his interests. In this case, by selecting\
    \ the \n“TODOS” option (Figure 4.34a), the user can view information on each \n\
    event (Figure 4.34b) and select those events that interest him (Figure \n4.34c).\
    \ When selecting several events, the app proposes you to make a \nroute, which\
    \ is created by clicking on the “Create Route” button. The \nresult is a route\
    \ that passes through the different events and that can be \nselected to be carried\
    \ out in different means of transport. The route can \nbe viewed by the user on\
    \ Google Maps by clicking on the \"Start Route\" \nbutton (Figure 4.34d). By pressing\
    \ this button, the app locally saves \ninformation about the user's interests,\
    \ which are considered when \nproviding him information about events.  \n \nChapter\
    \ 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms\
    \ \n143 \n \n  \n \nFigure 4.33: Geolocated city services and events with Pamplona’s\
    \ CityApp. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility\
    \ \nwith City-Platforms \n144 \n \n \n \nFigure 4.34: Select geolocated events\
    \ and create a route using CityApp. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services\
    \ for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n145 \n \nIn addition,\
    \ the app indicates the level of emissions that are reduced if \nthe route is\
    \ carried out on foot or by bike (Figure 4.35).  \n \nFigure 4.35: The level of\
    \ CO2 emissions that are reduced by walking. \nThe collaborative system here described\
    \ allows collecting data from \ncitizens in order to know the state of the city\
    \ (noise, electromagnetic and \nair pollution), and at the same time to know the\
    \ mobility patterns and \nhabits of the citizens. This information makes it possible\
    \ to know the \ncarbon footprint of citizens' travel and to actively promote policies\
    \ to \nreduce this footprint. With the help of this application, citizens have\
    \ an \ninteresting help to manage their mobility and synchronize it with the \n\
    events and situation of the city, but they can also know their personal \nand\
    \ collective contribution to the goal of sustainable development. In the \nChapter\
    \ 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms\
    \ \n146 \n \nsame way, decision-makers can know the degree of involvement of \n\
    citizens and can promote the right policies to minimize the carbon \nfootprint\
    \ of their city. Four important stakeholders are clearly identified: \nthe user\
    \ of the city app, the other citizens, the city council and the \ncompany that\
    \ manages the shared bicycles. Each of these stakeholders \nobtains relevant information\
    \ for the planning of resources and activities, \nand also obtains information\
    \ on the sustainability of their activities \nindividually, and in relation to\
    \ other citizens. Figure 4.36 shows the \ncarbon footprint information provided\
    \ to the user, but the App also \nprovides information on the user's relative\
    \ contribution to the common \ntarget over time. \nThe information about the user's\
    \ interests is kept as local information \nand is not shared with third parties,\
    \ ensuring the privacy of the \ninformation. Furthermore, the app shows the user\
    \ the reduced amount \nof personal and collective carbon footprint depending on\
    \ the mode of \ntransport.  \n \nFigure 4.36: Reduced personal carbon footprint.\
    \ \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal Smart Mobility \n\
    with City-Platforms \n147 \n \n4.3.4 \nZAC SYSTEM \nIn order to provide insight\
    \ in relation with the system developed, a \nspecific case study is presented\
    \ in this section. The ZAC (Restricted \nAccess Zone - Zona de ACceso restringido)\
    \ is a traffic-restricted area \nlocated in the middle of the city of Pamplona,\
    \ in the so-called Old Town. \nThe streets which are part of the restricted traffic\
    \ zone are mainly \npedestrian, with the goal of preserving freedom of transit\
    \ and safety of \npedestrians and cyclists. The aim of ZAC is to reduce the volume\
    \ of \nmotor vehicles on the streets of the Old Town, guaranteeing greater \n\
    urban quality in the area by improving the aesthetics and reducing the \nnoise\
    \ and smoke generated by motor vehicles. This area is monitored \nand controlled\
    \ by cameras distributed across the entrances to the ZAC, \nin order to enforce\
    \ access to authorized users. The authorized users are \nthose who can only enter\
    \ by their private cars, whereas the bicycles are \nexempt from requesting authorization.\
    \ Therefore, we used the data that \ncome from the ZAC system in our intelligent\
    \ mobility application to \navoid passing into this area in the absence of a permit\
    \ for that or to \nrecommend the use of bicycles in case the location of the destination\
    \ is \ninside this area. \nFigure 4.37 depicts the ontology implemented in linked-data\
    \ and \nNGSI-LD standard in the ZAC system to control the entrance of vehicles\
    \ \nto the restricted zones in the Old Town. \n \n \nFigure 4.37: Combined data\
    \ Exchange – ZAC system. \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services for Multimodal\
    \ Smart Mobility \nwith City-Platforms \n148 \n \nFigure 4.38 illustrates the\
    \ dashboard of the ZAC system used by the \ncity council of Pamplona. Built from\
    \ the data provided by the city \nplatform using the interactive visualization\
    \ tool Grafana, the dashboard \npresents information about the restricted zone\
    \ such as the number of \nvehicles that entered, the average of daily stay time,\
    \ vehicle registration \nplates, presence/absence of transit permit, the level\
    \ of air pollution, \nvehicle entry/departure time, the stay time for each vehicle,\
    \ and many \nother details. \nThe ZAC use case presents coverage/capacity requirements\
    \ given by \ncommunication links that can span up to 1 km, with very low \ncommunication\
    \ \ntransmission \nrates. \nIn \nthis \nsense, \nLWPAN \ncommunication protocols\
    \ provide adequate service in terms of \nscalability, power consumption, coverage\
    \ and bit rate requirements.  \n \nChapter 4 - Enabling Customizable Services\

    \   \n \n5 Conclusions and Future \nWork \n \n \n IS chapter presents the main\
    \ conclusions obtained throughout \nthe investigation, which, in turn, are based\
    \ on the scientific \npublications achieved as products of this research. In addition,\
    \ \nit highlights the future work that can be developed from this research.  \n\
    5.1 \nConclusion \nIn conclusion, this work summarizes key points of the digital\
    \ \ntransformation taking place in cities and their endeavor to benefit from \n\
    it towards transforming into SCs to make the lives of citizens more \ncomfortable\
    \ and safer and provide a better governance system. We \nprovided a brief explanation\
    \ of smart cities' concepts and technologies \nthat are involved under this concept,\
    \ the components of a SC, and the \nservices provided by them, and their impact\
    \ on the city's sustainable \ndevelopment, providing insight in relation with\
    \ the project/vision of the \nPamplona Smart City within the STARDUST framework;\
    \ an EU H2020 \nSCs project. We have also provided the required background in\
    \ \ntechnologies, concepts, solutions, and requirements relevant to the smart\
    \ \ncities’ paradigm requiring IoT. We have also presented an evaluation \nand\
    \ classification of available and most applicable wireless technologies \nfor\
    \ SCs. Further, we highlight the wireless communication protocols \nT \nChapter\
    \ 4 - Conclusions and Future Work \n151 \n \ncharacteristics and requirements\
    \ for data collection and exchange in SC \napplications. We have discussed the\
    \ development of an urban data \nplatform as a supportive infrastructure in the\
    \ development of a SC. A \nrange of functionalities are addressed including obtaining\
    \ information \nfrom the environment through sensors or open data sources or other\
    \ \nalternative sources fulfilling security and privacy requirements. In order\
    \ \nto fulfill interoperability requirements, the obtained data are normalized\
    \ \nto the NGSI format, translating from the formats, and different protocols\
    \ \nof the data source to the platform data models. The normalized data is \n\
    then distributed to the various vertical services linked to the platform, in \n\
    our case the urban mobility. The platform architecture is implemented \nfollowing\
    \ a five-layer model that considers elements from perception, \nsensing to data\
    \ management, processing, and visualization. In order to \nevaluate the performance\
    \ of the platform, three different use cases are \ndescribed, which have been\
    \ implemented in the city of Pamplona, Spain, \nas vertical services linked to\
    \ the platform: intelligent urban mobility-bike \nhandling, vehicle access zone\
    \ control system and Bi2Bi communication. \nThe Bi2Bi communication system integrated\
    \ within the multi-modal SCP \nof the city of Pamplona, with the aim of enhancing\
    \ transportation and \ntransit within the urban surroundings of the city, following\
    \ a holistic \napproach from the physical layer to the impact on end user application\
    \ \nand interaction. In this sense, wireless channel characterization for the\
    \ \nbike links has been performed with full 3D Ray Launching simulation \ntechnique\
    \ implemented in-house and optimized in order to handle large \nscenarios with\
    \ full topo-morphological considerations, which enables \nthe viability analysis\
    \ in the use of LPWAN technologies, such as ZigBee \nand LoRa/LoRaWAN in order\
    \ to provide interactive capabilities. \nEvaluation results have been obtained\
    \ in relation with range, \nthroughput, and packet loss ratio for different urban\
    \ scenarios within the \nmunicipality of the city of Pamplona. Wireless communication\
    \ quality \nexperiments for several use cases are presented, considering different\
    \ \nlink types and conditions. As a use case, the “Pamplona CityApp” has \nChapter\
    \ 4 - Conclusions and Future Work \n152 \n \nbeen developed, which is a mobile\
    \ application for sustainable mobility \nin which people can organize their routes\
    \ according to their interests, \ncan know and monitor the personal and collective\
    \ carbon footprint, \nenforcing sustainable mobility and energy efficiency in\
    \ the city. The \nproposed \nplatform \nenables \nservices \naimed \ntowards \n\
    different \nstakeholders, such as bike users, bike platform service providers,\
    \ \nlocal/regional authorities and the general public. \n5.2 \nFuture work  \n\
    The COVID-19 crisis emphasized the need to invest in connectivity \ninfrastructure\
    \ and solutions that improve the efficiency of e-\ngovernments and alleviate public\
    \ health and safety concerns. The \ndemand for online interactions with government\
    \ agencies/departments \nhas also increased because of the movement to electronic\
    \ transactions \nand electronic signatures. In addition, the necessity for safe\
    \ and secure \ntransport grew to make systems safer by providing real-time warnings\
    \ \nabout crowding, access problems, or delays to help people make better \ninformed\
    \ public travel decisions. Therefore, the SCP must be capable of \ndealing with\
    \ this amount of data effectively and securely to meet users' \nneeds. Here we\
    \ present a list of various future research directions that \ncan be pursued in\
    \ order to continue the work started in this thesis, \ncomprising: \n \nBig Data\
    \ Processing:  By implementing a generic, scalable \nand evolvable Big Data architecture\
    \ that enables both \nstreaming and historical data processing. In addition, \n\
    providing a reusable service that can support the \nrequirements of several customer\
    \ applications. As one of the \nmain objectives of SCP development is to share\
    \ \ncomputational resources and reusable services across \nmultiple applications.\
    \ More specifically, big data services \nwill be crucial for future SCs, as they\
    \ could potentially \nintegrate a large amount of data from different sources\
    \ that \nChapter 4 - Conclusions and Future Work \n153 \n \nneed to be processed\
    \ promptly to provide valuable results \nfor cities. \n \nFederated Learning:\
    \ The most common methods for \noptimizing traffic control in SCs are Sensing\
    \ as a Service \n(S2aaS) and Mobile Crowdsensing. Mobile Crowdsensing is \nan\
    \ emerging, effective, non-dedicated paradigm in SCs \nsensing. It is cost-effective,\
    \ highly scalable, and has \nenormous mobility [260]. Mobile Crowdsensing allows\
    \ \nindividuals to participate in a sensing event by providing \ndata through\
    \ their sensor-enabled mobile devices [261]. \nData is often processed using machine\
    \ learning, deep \nlearning, and statistical methods to generate a trend, \ndecision-making\
    \ or conclusion. Mobile Crowdsensing faces \nchallenges by using the devices of\
    \ users for sensing. Users \nare exposed to potential privacy and personal information\
    \ \nleaks. The goal is to provide a machine learning framework \nthat complies\
    \ with data privacy, security, and regulatory \nrequirements, allowing AI systems\
    \ to make better use of the \ndata [262]. Federated Learning is essentially a\
    \ distributed \nmachine \nlearning \ntechnology \nor \nmachine \nlearning \nframework.\
    \ Federated Learning is a novel concept that aims \nto solve the privacy and security\
    \ issues encountered in the \nprocess of data collection, while still complying\
    \ with laws \nand regulations, such as GDPR [263]. \n5.3 \nList of Publications\

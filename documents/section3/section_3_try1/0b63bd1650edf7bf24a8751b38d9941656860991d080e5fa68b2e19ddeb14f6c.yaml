    Security 1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) enables physical items to
    connect and exchange data with other devices and systems using sensors, software,
    and other technologies over the Internet [1,2]. IoT allows items to sense, think,
    interact, and learn from each other, creating new possibilities for services in
    various domains, such as smart homes [3], smart healthcare systems [4], [5], [6],
    [7], industrial automation [8], intelligent transportation [9], resource management
    [10], energy management [11], smart cities [12], and cybersecurity [13]. Moreover,
    IoT offers numerous services such as storing, computation, and communication that
    leverage emerging technologies [14]. These developments expand the variety and
    volume of data derived from these IoT applications and form a large and complex
    problem space that poses many challenges to handling these data and finding accurate
    solutions in recent years. According to Google Trends, scientists and researchers
    frequently investigate and propose various methods to address IoT challenges and
    deliver effective solutions for different objectives and applications. Fig. 1
    illustrates the popularity of the IoT topic from 2004 to the end of 2023. Fig.
    2(a) shows the worldwide search interests in the IoT topic ranging from grey to
    blue, in which the grey color indicates no data available or interest in IoT.
    The blue color ranges from high to low search interests, with darker shades representing
    higher search interests and lighter shades indicating lower search interests in
    IoT. In addition, Fig. 2(b) shows regions with the most search interests in the
    IoT topic based on data extracted from Google Trends. Download : Download high-res

    the IoT topic. Although IoT networks have become ubiquitous to different extents,
    such as smart cities, healthcare, farming, and manufacturing applications [15],
    [16], [17], they still face significant security challenges that need to protect
    the network of connected devices, such as sensors, cameras, and vehicles, from
    cyberattacks [18,19]. Therefore, security solutions such as implementing strong
    authentication and authorization, encrypting data and communications, and securing
    communications protocols and channels are needed to ensure IoT networks [20],
    [21], [22], [23]. The prevailing research indicates that IoT requires a powerful
    paradigm to explore the complex search space efficiently and extract valuable
    insights for enhancing efficiency, competitiveness, productivity, decision-making,
    and quality of life in IoT-based applications [24,25]. IoT problems pose challenges
    such as large and dynamic search spaces [26], multiple objectives and constraints
    [27], uncertainty and noise [28], high computational complexity [29], and high
    dimensionality [30], [31], [32]. The adaptability and robustness of metaheuristic
    algorithms make them a successful paradigm for coping with such challenges of
    IoT problems and searching for near-optimal solutions in a sensible time [33].
    There are five main groups of metaheuristic algorithms [34]: evolutionary-based,
    which simulates the biological evolution and genetic variation processes [35],
    [36], [37]; mathematical and physic-based, which performs mathematical concepts
    and physical laws [38,39]; human-based, which imitates human intelligence, creativity,
    and social activities [40,41]; and swarm-based, which mimics the collective behavior
    of insects [41], [42], [43], [44], terrestrial animals [45], [46], [47], aquatic
    animals [48,49], and birds [50], [51], [52], [53]. Although these algorithms effectively
    solve optimization problems [41,[54], [55], [56]], they have weaknesses, such
    as low population diversity and imbalance issues [57], [58], [59], [60]. Hence,
    they are often enhanced by hybridizing with other algorithms [61], [62], [63],
    [64], [65], improving their search strategies [66,67], adapting their parameters
    and oerators [66,68,69], and using archive mechanisms [70]. Uniyal et al. [71]
    reviewed and mathematically evaluated the nature-inspired optimization methods
    that developed over time and were inspired by natural phenomena. Moreover, Kumar
    et al. [72] presented a comprehensive overview of the widely used and studied
    metaheuristic optimization methods and nature-inspired algorithms. Among them,
    swarm-based optimization categories are adopted or improved to solve the challenging
    issues in IoT-based applications [24,73,74]. Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) [45] is
    a prominent technique based on swarm intelligence that formulated the social construction
    of grey wolves to search the solution space. The GWO has a simple form and few
    control parameters, making it a candidate for solving various optimization problems
    and has attracted much attention from researchers [75]. GWO is widely applied
    to system reliability optimization [76], especially for nuclear power plant safety
    systems [77] and life support systems in space capsules [78]. Fig. 3 shows the
    distribution of GWO citations per year over time, revealing a remarkable growth
    curve from 144 in 2015 to 3425 in 2023. This exponential increase in citations
    indicates the increasing popularity of the algorithm and its great importance
    in solving various optimization problems. Accordingly, as Fig. 3 shows, in the
    same fashion, applying GWO in different IoT applications [79], [80], [81], [82]
    has increased since its introduction. Download : Download high-res image (154KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The annual citation count of GWO.
    GWO is implemented in the smart home application to optimize the energy consumption
    for thermostats, lighting, and security systems [83]. GWO is successfully used
    for path planning in the smart city application to determine the optimal path
    for unmanned delivery robots by considering the distance, traffic, and obstacles
    [84,85]. Moreover, GWO in IoT healthcare applications used as IoT-enabled healthcare
    monitoring devices to diagnose disease at an early stage [86], [87], [88], IoT-based
    healthcare devices to optimize the design and performance of wearable sensors
    [86,89], and healthcare transformation to improve the efficiency, quality, accessibility,
    and affordability of healthcare service [90]. Sharma et al. [91] investigated
    how artificial intelligence, blockchain, and IoT can improve smart healthcare
    and telemedicine systems. They also address security and privacy issues, electronic
    health record storage, service quality and safety, and intelligent healthcare
    and telemedicine cloud computing platforms. GWO in agriculture IoT applications
    are used for autonomous robot path planning to find optimal paths by considering
    the distance, obstacles, and crop yield [85], smart irrigation to optimize the
    water distribution and fertilizer [92], and crop disease detection to analyze
    the images from drones and IoT-enabled sensors to diagnose crop diseases [93].
    GWO in manufacturing IoT applications applied for task scheduling to schedule
    the tasks by considering the processing time, date, and resource availability
    [94], resource allocation to assign the resources by evaluating the demand, cost,
    and quality [95], and machine control to control the machines by considering the
    energy consumption [96], performance [97], and maintenance [98]. These applications
    reveal that GWO can offer a reasonable convergence rate, accuracy, and robustness
    for IoT problems with large-scale data, high-dimensional features, and complex
    objectives. However, GWO still suffers drawbacks such as poor search strategies,
    low population diversity, and early convergence in these applications [99], [100],
    [101]. These deficiencies motivate researchers to enhance GWO by improving it
    with novel methods or search strategies, hybridizing it with other optimizers,
    and adapting its control parameters [83,[102], [103], [104]]. Some possible ways
    to improve GWO using the most well-known methods such as quantum computing [105],
    [106], [107], chaotic maps [108], [109], [110], Lévy flight [111], [112], [113],
    fuzzy hierarchical operator [114], and opposition-based learning [115], [116],
    [117], [118]. GWO can also be integrated with other optimizers such as particle
    swarm optimization motivated by the collective motion of particles [119], [120],
    [121], ant colony optimization inspired by ants [122,123], genetic algorithm [124,125],
    sine cosine algorithm [126], [127], [128], harmony search algorithm [129,130],
    or invasive weed optimization [131] that can balance its strengths and weaknesses
    and improve its convergence speed and solution diversity [132], [133], [134].
    Moreover, GWO can be affected by its control parameters, such as A, a, r1, r2,
    and C, or the population size that can influence its performance and robustness
    and need proper tuning or adaptation [135], [136], [137]. As shown above, GWOs,
    including the canonical GWO, its variants, and its improvements and hybrids, impact
    growing IoT development which is the main reason to devote this study to systematically
    reviewing applying GWOs in different IoT applications. This systematic paper follows
    the modified PRISMA guidelines [138] for conducting and reporting systematic reviews
    and meta-analyses. It consists of three primary stages: identification, evaluation,
    and reporting. The first phase defines the target search problems based on suitable
    keywords and alternative synonyms, and then 693 papers from January 2014 to the
    end of 2023 are extracted from diverse databases. The evaluation phase employs
    the Rayyan tool [139] and consists of three screening steps to select eligible
    papers. The first step filters out 421 high-quality papers by eliminating duplicates
    and papers from non-scholarly or low-quality journals. The screening phase checks
    the scope of the reputable papers and extracts 101 related papers by reading their
    titles and abstracts. Then, the third screening step extracts 50 eligible papers
    by full-text reading and inclusion criteria defined in this study. Finally, in
    the reporting phase, we carefully study the 50 eligible papers to review and explain
    critical themes related to applying GWOs in different IoT applications. In addition,
    we suggest some future research directions in the conclusion section. 2. The canonical
    grey wolf optimizer (GWO) Wolves typically form groups of 5–12 individuals. They
    are top predators with a rigid social order of alpha, beta, omega, and gamma ranks.
    The alpha makes most of the decisions for the pack, such as hunting, sleeping,
    waking, etc. The beta is the deputy leader and helps the grey wolf alpha make
    decisions and lead the pack activities while overseeing the subordinate wolves.
    The omega is the bottom-ranked wolf and must obey all the other higher-ranking
    wolves. The delta is the lowest level in the order and follows the alphas and
    betas but dominates the omega. This behavior motivated Mirjalili et al. [45] to
    propose a grey wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) to find the best answer for continuous
    and engineering optimization problems. Fig. 4 shows how the wolves’ population
    changes its location. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download : Download

    The best solution is the alpha, which is indicated with α; the following two best
    solutions are beta, which is specified with β and delta δ, and the rest are omega,
    which is marked with ω. The social hierarchy mechanism is based on these ranks.
    2.2. Encircling prey mechanism The encircling prey mechanism of grey wolves during
    their hunting behavior is mathematically modeled in Eq. (1), where is the current
    position and is the next position of the ith grey wolf, the prey position shown
    with , and is the coefficient is computed using Eq. (2) and vector distance is
    calculated using Eq. (3). (1) (2) (3) (4) Vector in Eq. (2) linearly reduces in
    the range 2 to 0, and the vector is a random value from 0 to 1. in Eq. (3) is
    obtained using Eq. (4) and is random values between intervals 0–1. 2.3. Hunting
    mechanism The hunting mechanism modeled grey wolves'' locating and surrounding
    behavior when chasing their target. The alpha often guides the hunt, and the beta
    and delta wolves sometimes participate in the hunt. Thus, the omega wolves are
    forced to change their locations according to the location of the best search
    agents, which are the first three best solutions kept so far. Eq. (5) illustrates
    the hunting mechanism where position vectors and are computed using Eqs. (6)–(8)
    respectively. (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) In Eqs. (6)–(8), , , and denoted the
    three best positions obtained in tth iteration t. Parameters , , and are calculated
    through Eq. (2), and distance vectors , , and are computed using Eqs. (9)–(11).
    , , and denoted in Eqs. (9)–(11) are obtained by Eq. (4). 2.4. Attacking prey
    mechanism (Exploitation strategy) The attacking prey mechanism intensifies the
    exploitation ability by attacking the prey by setting the values of vectors ,
    , and . When |A| is less than one, the wolves are compelled to chase the prey,
    and the wolves'' next location can be anywhere between their present location
    and the prey''s location. 2.5. Searching for prey mechanism (Exploration strategy)
    The wolves separate to rummage around for prey and merge to assault prey, utilizing
    the looking-for-prey component. The values of parameters , , and with greater
    than one or smaller than −1, the wolves scatter away from the prey. When |A| >
    1 powers the wolves to wander from the prey to ideally discover a fitter prey.
    Furthermore, coefficient C generates random numbers for exploration not only in
    the initial emphasis but also in the final cycles. The flowchart of the GWO algorithm
    is shown in Fig. 5, where the grey wolves'' position is reorganized by two main
    steps: initialization and optimization process. The GWO algorithm starts by randomly
    placing N wolves in the look space and calculating their fitness values in the
    initialization step. Then, the optimization process is begun through predefined
    iterations. In each iteration, first, the control parameters'' initial values
    are calculated by Eqs. (2) and (4). Next, the locations of the top three wolves
    (Xα, Xβ, and Xδ) are identified. Then, Eqs. (6)–(8) are used to compute the new
    values for vectors X1 (t), X2 (t), and X3 (t), and Eqs. (9)–(11) are used to compute
    Dα (t), Dβ (t), and Dδ (t). Next, Eq. (5) is used to update the location of each
    wolf X (t), the new wolf positions'' fitness value is calculated, and a new place
    is chosen between the current and the new ones by a greedy selection. The iterations
    continue until the iteration limit is reached. These iterations are repeated until
    the maximum number of iterations is satisfied. Ultimately, the wolf with the highest
    fitness value is the optimal or near-optimal solution the algorithm can find.

    Fig. 5. The flowchart of the GWO. 3. Prior studies on applying metaheuristic algorithms
    in IoT applications The IoT has grown tremendously with the increasing integration
    of interconnected smart devices and sensors across numerous applications. Extensive
    research has been conducted to explore the capabilities and address the challenges
    associated with IoT technology. Given the immense scale and ongoing enhancements
    in IoT advancements, it is critical to systematically review the different techniques
    proposed for solving the various challenges in this domain. Therefore, several
    review studies have been published to assess the state of the art. These review
    studies are vital in identifying trends, applications, research gaps, and guidance
    for future work. Shan and Yaqoob [140] provided a comprehensive IoT overview covering
    protocols, technologies, applications, and related issues. It emphasizes the integration
    of various technologies to enable autonomous applications and discusses the development
    of IoT in terms of Internet, smartphone, and machine-to-machine technologies.
    The paper explores IoT architecture, technical aspects, and its relationship with
    emerging technologies. Laghari et al. [141] explored the utilization of IoT technologies
    in cloud and fog computing, along with their applications and security aspects.
    They focused on the design and development of IoT architecture, incorporating
    sensors in the context of 6G. Additionally, they delve into the existing research,
    propose solutions, and highlight open issues for future investigation in IoT.
    The emergence of diverse applications across various domains has brought forth
    numerous security concerns, including protecting devices and networks, addressing
    security threats in IoT networks, and efficiently managing resource-limited IoT
    networks. Several security solutions, such as web application protectors and intrusion
    detection systems (IDS), have been proposed to address the IoT scalability and
    security challenges. Thakkar and Lohiya [142] conducted a survey of IDS for IoT,
    covering the literature from 2015 to 2019. They examined different strategies
    for placing IDS within the IoT architecture and analyzed various intrusion detection
    techniques, including deep learning algorithms and machine learning. Additionally,
    their paper addresses security concerns and challenges specific to IoT networks.
    Furthermore, the integration of metaheuristic algorithms in IoT has gained significant
    attention. Metaheuristic algorithms offer powerful optimization techniques for
    solving complex problems in IoT applications. These algorithms have shown remarkable
    capabilities in addressing challenges such as network optimization, resource allocation,
    energy efficiency, and routing in IoT systems. As a result, numerous review papers
    have explored the integration of metaheuristic algorithms in the IoT domain. These
    papers focus on applying metaheuristic algorithms to tackle the unique challenges
    posed by IoT, providing comprehensive analyses of their effectiveness and limitations.
    By highlighting the advancements and methodologies employed in these studies,
    these review papers offer invaluable insights into the prospective advantages
    and upcoming trajectories of leveraging metaheuristic algorithms in the IoT landscape.
    Zedadra et al. [143] investigated the technical components of swarm intelligence
    algorithms (SI) and their potential application in IoT-based systems. It begins
    by examining existing SI algorithms and their primary applications. Subsequently,
    it investigates IoT-based systems that utilize SI algorithms. Finally, the study
    discusses emerging trends that bridge the gap between SI and IoT-based systems.
    Sun et al. [144] presented a comprehensive review of SI algorithms and their applications
    in the IoT. It explored SI-enabled applications in wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    and discussed research challenges in that domain. Additionally, the paper explored
    SI applications in other areas of the IoT, such as UAV-aided wireless networks.
    It compared various SI-based algorithms for selecting cluster head routing protocols
    in WSN applications, summarizing their validation platforms, parameter selection,
    advantages, and limitations. They also surveyed other state-of-the-art SI algorithms
    in IoT applications and provided insights into potential future development directions.
    Sharma et al. [24] systematically reviewed metaheuristic algorithms employed in
    IoT applications. It classified existing metaheuristic algorithms and highlighted
    their applications in IoT systems. Their paper also presented current research
    questions to inspire further exploration and discussed emerging trends in IoT,
    offering potential future directions. Abualigah et al. [145] conducted a thorough
    review of SI algorithms and their use in solving the main problems of the IoT.
    SI algorithms, which emulate the hunting behavior of agent communities, demonstrate
    desirable qualities such as flexibility, resilience, dissemination, and scalability,
    making them well-suited for IoT requirements. Their paper provided an overview
    of SI-based algorithms employed in the IoT domain to tackle its key challenges.
    The methods are classified based on the specific SI algorithm used, namely bee
    colony optimization (ABC), ant colony optimization (ACO), and particle swarm optimization
    (PSO). These algorithms were examined about three primary concerns within the
    IoT landscape: routing protocols and selection of cluster heads, power management,
    and data management. 4. Methodology of systematic review We explain in this section
    the methodology of our systematic review to select the eligible papers in which
    GWOs, including the canonical GWO, its variants, improvements, and hybrids, were
    applied in different IoT applications. We follow the adopted PRISMA methodology
    [138] for systematic reviews and meta-analyses to choose an eligible set of papers
    for full-text reading within three main phases: identification, evaluation, and
    reporting. The systematic review''s methodology and details are presented in Table
    1. Table 1. The adapted methodology and its details used in the systematic review.
    4.1. Identification phase This phase has two steps. First, we define the final
    search problems based on suitable queries, and next, we extract the related documents
    from different databases. The target search problems are determined based on keywords
    and alternative synonyms, including \" GWO and IoT, GWO and Internet of things,
    Grey Wolf and IoT, Grey Wolf and Internet of things.\" From 2014, the introduction
    of GWO, to the end of 2023, these keywords were used to search the Google Scholar
    database, resulting in 693 documents. Fig. 6 shows the variety and distribution
    of documents identified in this phase based on different publications, such as
    journals, books, and dissertations. Most of the publications are journal articles
    (421 papers, 60 %), followed by conference and symposium papers (106 papers, 15
    %) and disreputable documents (151 papers, 22 %). Only a few publications are
    books and book chapters (11 papers, 2 %) and dissertations (four papers, about
    1 %). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. The variety of identified documents. 4.2. Evaluation phase This
    phase consists of three screening steps. First, duplicates and non-academic documents
    published by conferences, non-Scopus indexed journals, books, and dissertations
    are removed from the 693 papers, leaving 421 reputable papers. Second, the title
    and abstract of these reputable papers are scanned to investigate their scope
    and select only those that have applied GWOs in different IoT applications, resulting
    in 101 related papers. The third step is to examine and study the full text of
    these 101 related papers, and those that meet the following inclusion criteria
    are selected for analysis, resulting in 46 papers. C1. Papers published from 2014
    to the end of 2023. C2. Papers written in English languages C3. Papers from credible
    journals. C4. Papers are attentive to applying GWOs in IoT applications as the
    study scope. Finally, the references of 46 papers are investigated based on inclusion
    criteria to find more eligible articles, resulting in a final set of 50 GWOs in
    IoT applications. 4.3. Reporting phase In this phase, we use Rayyan to select
    50 papers that meet the criteria [139] and are first classified by seven publishers:
    Elsevier (15), Springer (13), WILEY (5), Taylor & Francis (2), IEEE (11), MDPI
    (3), and Hindawi (1). Then, the eligible papers are qualitatively analyzed and
    reviewed into four main categories: IoT development, commercial IoT, consumer
    IoT, and industrial IoT. 5. Different types of the Internet of Things The IoT
    describes a vast network of physical devices equipped with sensors, software,
    and internet connectivity [146]. The IoT development class includes contributions
    such as reducing power consumption, optimal positioning, finding the optimal path,
    enhancing load balancing, and resource allocation. Considering the generic IoT
    architecture shown in Fig. 7 [147], IoT development extends and makes IoT more
    applicable, mostly in sensing, network, and data processing layers. Commercial
    IoT, consumer IoT, and industrial IoT classes are applied in the application layer.
    The commercial IoT class includes usages in the healthcare and transport industries,
    such as smart pacemakers and monitoring systems. The consumer IoT class uses every
    day such as home appliances, voice assistance, and light fixtures. Commercial
    IoT mainly supports industrial applications in manufacturing and energy, such
    as digital control systems, smart agriculture, and industrial big data [146,148].

    benefits, it also poses challenges that must be tackled to achieve optimal performance.
    Evaluating IoT platforms with multiple considerations can be formulated as a multi-criteria
    decision-making problem [149]; since it has various preferences and criteria,
    different techniques exist to evaluate IoT platforms [150]. The commercial IoT
    class has challenges such as improving data transmission, diagnosing IoT wearable
    medical devices, and monitoring patients. Key challenges in the consumer IoT class
    include energy consumption reduction, smart device scheduling, and service quality
    enhancement. Industrial IoT networks face issues like optimal sensor placement,
    efficient data analytics, and minimizing network latency [148]. Furthermore, several
    problems arise in developing IoT networks, such as finding optimal routing paths,
    clustering devices, placing sensors, and allocating resources [151,152]. Traditional
    optimization techniques are often insufficient to handle the complexity and scale
    of large IoT networks, and metaheuristic algorithms have proven that they are
    powerful in searching for global optima in complex systems [153]. These algorithms
    can provide significant advantages over traditional optimization algorithms, particularly
    in cases where the search space is high-dimensional or non-linear. By applying
    metaheuristic algorithms, IoT networks can be optimized to function more efficiently
    and effectively. This adaptation can result in significant cost savings, improved
    performance, and increased network reliability. As such, the use of metaheuristic
    algorithms in IoT networks is rapidly gaining popularity, and these techniques
    will likely continue to play a critical role in developing next-generation IoT
    systems [33]. Metaheuristic algorithms with effective mechanisms can enable them
    to find near-optimal solutions for complex and large-scale problems in a reasonable
    time [154], [155], [156], [157]. They can effortlessly adapt to problems with
    low computational complexity [158], [159], [160], [161]. They are valuable for
    IoT applications such as routing, clustering, and data analysis. They optimize
    the data transmission paths among IoT devices, considering factors like energy
    consumption, latency, reliability, and security. They improve the network''s scalability,
    efficiency, and performance by clustering IoT devices based on proximity, similarity,
    or functionality. Metaheuristic algorithms can process and analyze the massive
    amount of data generated by IoT devices, such as sensor readings, images, or videos,
    using techniques like feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, or classification.
    The grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a prominent metaheuristic algorithm with high
    performance and robustness in solving various optimization problems. GWO is a
    simple and powerful metaheuristic algorithm for solving IoT optimization problems,
    such as resource allocation, energy efficiency, network routing, sensor placement,
    security, and fault detection [96,99]. GWO offers a powerful tool to improve the
    security of IoT, contributing to the reliability and resilience of smart cities
    and other IoT-enabled applications [97,162]. The GWO can detect and mitigate potential
    vulnerabilities, identify anomalous behavior, and proactively respond to emerging
    threats within IoT networks. Fig. 9 visualizes the key challenges faced in the
    realm of IoT. The GWO is a viable solution for addressing these challenges. By
    leveraging GWO, IoT applications can optimize resource allocation, enhance energy
    efficiency, improve network routing and traffic flow, optimize sensor placement,
    strengthen security measures, and facilitate fault detection. The following sections

    gravitational GWO, sending data through multiple paths in IoT applications. The
    fractional gravitational search algorithm selects the cluster heads, and the FGGWO
    algorithm creates many directions from the origin to the end. The experimental
    results indicate that the fractional gravitational search algorithm and FGGWO
    perform better than some contender algorithms. Aziz et al. [164] put forward a
    highly effective multi-hop cluster-based aggregation scheme, which employs hybrid
    compressive sensing (EMCA-CS) to carry out data gathering in IoT-based heterogeneous
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The introduction of EMCA-CS significantly prolongs
    the network''s lifespan and diminishes the reconstruction error by integrating
    compressive sensing and routing protocols. EMCA-CS leverages the GWO algorithm
    to approximate the most optimal route for the cluster head and base station. Furthermore,
    the paper proposes utilizing the GWO algorithm for compressive sensing matrix
    optimization to find the matrix with the minimum error. Haddadpajouh et al. [100]
    announced a multi-kernel support vector machine employing the GWO to detect malware
    in IoT cloud-edge gateways. The GWO algorithm identifies the most suitable characteristics
    distinguishing malicious and benign applications, subsequently assessing these
    extracted features through a multi-kernel SVM classifier. The performance of the
    multi-kernel SVM classifier surpassed that of the compared classifiers in terms
    of accuracy and computational expense. Davahli et al. [165] employed a fusion
    of genetic algorithm and grey wolf optimizer (GA–GWO) to fabricate a sophisticated
    and efficient intrusion detection system tailored explicitly for wireless networks
    in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. The GA–GWO algorithm selects informative
    traffic features to reduce the dimensionality of the extensive wireless network
    traffic by choosing traffic features that provide valuable information. Shorman
    et al. [97] presented an unsupervised evolutionary technique for detecting IoT
    botnet attacks from compromised IoT devices. This approach implements a GWO to
    fine-tune the hyperparameters of the one-class support vector machine and identify
    the most compelling features for characterizing the IoT botnet issue. Chouhan
    et al. [166] suggested TSGWO, a tunicate swarm GWO, for multi-path routing in
    WSNs with IoT support. TSGWO performs the multi-path routing process, where the
    shortest path is chosen as the best one. Jeniffer et al. [167] suggested OHGHE,
    an optimal homomorphic scheme with hybrid heat transfer search and GWO. OHGHE
    chooses an optimal key with the largest key-breaking size to encrypt sensitive
    data and fix the existing flaws. The OHGHE scheme uses an adaptive convolutional
    kernel-based artificial neural network with Aquila algorithm optimization to sort
    IoT data into sensitive and non-sensitive. The results indicate that OHGHE can
    achieve longer key-breaking time, faster encryption/decryption time, and less
    memory for encryption and decryption. Ojha et al. [168] suggested an intelligent
    data routing method for WSNs with multi-objective GWO to avoid early network failure
    and improve lifetime performance. This mechanism divides the entire network into
    clusters of the most suitable sizes and subsequently determines the most optimal
    rendezvous points. The mobile sink effectively acquires data from sensor nodes
    through the ideal route to each rendezvous point. This mechanism could improve
    the network performance and prevent premature death than the compared algorithms.
    Dev et al. [169] introduced an overtaker-assisted wolf update (OA-WU) as a clustering
    technique by hybridizing a rider optimization algorithm and GWO to enhance lifetime
    in IoT by selecting the optimal radius for the cluster head. The findings of their
    study reveal that the implementation of OA-WU resulted in notable improvements
    in energy preservation and convergence rate within a short period. Pingale et
    al. [170] introduced a routing protocol for IoT networks based on a hybrid optimization
    algorithm called SFG, which combines sunflower and grey wolf optimization techniques.
    The protocol starts by simulating the IoT network and creating multiple paths
    for routing. Then, it uses the SFG algorithm to choose the optimal way, considering
    various criteria such as delay, energy, throughput, and network lifetime. The
    experimental results demonstrated that the SFG algorithm performed better than
    some existing methods on these metrics. Jena et al. [171] formulated a synchronized
    cyber-physical assault within an IoT-enabled intelligent power network, accounting
    for the constraints on intruder reachability. This predicament was subsequently
    addressed by employing a binary GWO algorithm. The findings presented in this
    study, pertain to the IEEE 14, 30, and 57 bus benchmark power systems demonstrate
    the efficacy of disrupting the state estimation process by optimizing attack cost.
    Keserwani et al. [83] introduced a well-balanced model for intrusion detection,
    namely the GWO-PSO-RF IDS model, which serves as an intelligent algorithm for
    identifying different attacks in IoT networks through the utilization of GWO,
    particle swarm optimization, and a random forest model. The balanced GWO-PSO-RF
    IDS model incorporates a hybrid approach involving GWO and PSO to extract pertinent
    features from IoT networks. Then, the RF model classifies the extracted features
    to detect attacks. According to the experimental results, this model outperformed
    the other algorithms in solving the biasing problem and enhancing the detection
    of less frequent types of attacks. Xu et al. [172] developed a new method for
    estimating the outage probability of IoT networks on mobile devices using a hybrid
    technique called IGWO-Elman. This technique combines an enhanced version of the
    grey wolf optimizer with an Elman neural network. The IGWO employs a modified
    strategy to generate and diversify the initial population of wolves. Then, IGWO
    optimizes the hyperparameters of the Elman neural network. Jaiswal et al. [173]
    applied the GWO algorithm to the node deployment problem to achieve high-quality
    service metrics, such as coverage, connectivity, and network cost. The GWO algorithm
    finds the best locations for sensor nodes in different scenarios, satisfying the
    required coverage and connectivity. Salimian et al. [174] introduced an autonomousIoT
    service placement methodology utilizing the GWO algorithm for deploying IoT applications
    on fog nodes. The findings indicate that this algorithm surpasses competing algorithms
    in achieving a near-optimal deployment of applications on fog nodes. Sarma [175]
    proposed the FAE–GWO–DBN algorithm to identify and detect attacks within the Internet
    of Things context. The FAE–GWO–DBN algorithm optimized the deep belief network''s
    (DBN) hyperparameters by combining Firefly algorithm and GWO to attain satisfactory
    performance when determining the presence of attacks. Agrawal et al. [176] developed
    a new security-enhancing technique for IoT sensor nodes using a hybrid optimization
    algorithm called PSO-GWO, which combines binary particle swarm optimization and
    GWO. The algorithm uses random forest to initialize the population of particles
    and wolves intelligently. Besides, they introduced a new fitness function and
    performance metric. Liu et al. [177] developed a novel clustering method for industrial
    WSNs based on a hybrid optimization technique called QEGWO, which combines quantum
    and GWO. The process enhances the clustering quality of IWSNs by finding the optimal
    cluster configuration, as shown in Fig. 10 [177]. It also uses a new evaluation
    function considering the node energy, cluster distance, and base station distance.
    The method employs a new quantum elite operator to increase the global search
    ability. This operator keeps a quantum probability matrix for each individual
    and updates it with quantum gates during the evolutionary process of the algorithm.

    Fig. 10. Schematic diagram of the QEGWO [177]. Alazab [178] developed a method
    for detecting IoT botnet attacks using a discrete time-varying grey wolf hybrid
    technique. This technique uses a time-dependent function to transform continuous
    spaces into discrete ones. Gupta et al. [179] proposed an enhanced deep reinforcement
    learning model, GMFA-DRL, to improve fog-IoT load-balancing. GMFA-DRL applies
    the GWO and modified moth flame optimization to boost the effectiveness of deep
    reinforcement learning. According to the experimental results, the GMFA-DRL model
    improved the load-balancing performance of the fog-IoT system, achieving better
    Throughput, energy consumption, Latency, and Makespan than other methods. Xu et
    al. [180] proposed a method for reducing energy consumption in IoT networks on
    mobile devices using a hybrid technique called transmit antenna selection and
    amplify-and-forward relaying. In this schema, the exact expressions are first
    derived, and the performance of physical layer security is analyzed. The improved
    grey wolf optimizer (IGWO) algorithm extracts the allocation parameter. Reported
    results indicate that the IGWO obtains better optimization performance than compared
    algorithms regarding precision and convergence speed. Bedi et al. [181] developed
    a method for cluster head selection in wireless body area networks using a hybrid
    technique called MGWOQL, which combines a modified version of the GWO and Q learning.
    The method aims to reduce the energy consumption of clusters by finding the best
    cluster head node. The results show that the MGWOQL can successfully deploy the
    wireless body area networks, resulting in better residual energy, network longevity,
    and path damage. Tong et al. [182] developed a network architecture that combines
    mobile edge computing and satellite-terrestrial integration to support IoT devices
    in performing computation tasks. The paper also presented a novel scheme for inter-satellite
    cooperation, which optimizes task offloading and resource allocation decisions.
    This scheme involves a resource allocation algorithm that uses the Lagrange multiplier
    technique and a task-offloading decision method that uses the GWO. Verma et al.
    [183] developed a clustering method for IoT applications based on a hybrid technique
    called GWO and fuzzy logic, improving wireless sensor networks'' energy efficiency.
    The algorithm uses the GWO to form clusters and a fuzzy inference system to choose
    the cluster heads. The experimental results demonstrated that the protocol significantly
    improved energy efficiency and network lifetime. Seyyedabbasi et al. [184] proposed
    energy-efficient routing methods based on expanded and incremental GWO to find
    optimal paths and data transmission with a minimum cost between the nodes. The
    methods find the best paths and data transfer between nodes, reducing costs. They
    also improve the network quality and lifetime by calculating the best coefficients
    for different factors, such as energy, traffic, distance, buffer, and hop. Dey
    et al. [185] developed a new method for identifying and preventing cyberattacks
    in IoT networks using an intelligent framework for threat detection. This framework
    uses grey wolf optimizer and binary gravitational search algorithms to find the
    best features and apply the decision tree, AdaBoost, and random forests to classify
    threats. Manokaran et al. [186] presented an improved anomaly detection model
    for IoT edge scenarios using the optimized stacked ensemble learning algorithm.
    The paper uses the improved version of GWO to tune the parameters of the ensemble
    learning algorithms. The paper evaluated the model on different datasets and showed
    that it achieved high detection accuracy and generalizability. The paper also
    performed a chi-square statistical test to assess the suitability. To achieve
    efficient resource utilization in IoT networks, the key factors affecting the
    quality of service (QoS) must be determined [187]. By extracting QoS parameters
    from different directions, including cost, response time, energy consumption,
    and resource utilization, Rostami and Bidgholi [187] developed a load-balancing
    method using a multi-objective GWO, optimizing resource allocation to workflows.
    The method uses a framework for task allocation, as shown in Fig. 11 [187]. The
    method assigns tasks to resources based on the multi-objective GWO algorithm,
    which has low complexity, high accuracy, and fast convergence. The method also
    uses a controller to direct traffic to the best resource for user demand while
    maximizing the satisfaction of service providers and infrastructure. Download

    algorithms in IoMT. Bharathi et al. [189] proposed a model named EEPSOC that uses
    particle swarm optimization to improve energy efficiency among IoT devices in
    e-healthcare applications. EEPSOC selects optimal cluster heads that forward sensed
    healthcare data to fog devices and the cloud, reducing energy consumption in data
    transmission. Moreover, the EEPSOC model applies an artificial neural network
    (ANN) in the cloud to classify healthcare data and identify disease severity levels.
    The EEPSOC-ANN model outperformed the other models on the student healthcare dataset.
    Hasnony et al. [188] introduced a fog-based model that combined an adaptive neuro-fuzzy
    inference system (ANFIS) with the hybrid PSO and grey wolf optimizer (PSOGWO)
    algorithm for predicting Parkinson''s disease. The PSOGWO algorithm tunes the
    ANFIS parameters that the leveraged model uses. Moreover, this model uses a chaotic
    tent map to initialize the optimizations and fog computing to collect and analyze
    data at the edge of gateways. The results showed that this model outperforms optimization
    algorithms. Fig. 12 [188] shows the proposed three-layer architecture for IoT-based
    processing and prediction of Parkinson''s disease. The IoT layer collects and
    analyzes data from wearable sensors in real-time. The fog layer stores data locally
    and provides an expert system for user queries and emergency alerts. In IoMT,
    there are various apprehensions regarding security and privacy, including but
    not limited to replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation attacks,
    privileged-insider attacks, remote hijacking, password guessing, denial of service
    (DoS) attacks, and malware attacks pose significant risks. Utilizing machine learning
    algorithms, the IDS detects and classifies attacks; however, the unpredictable
    and ever-changing nature of malevolent assaults poses difficulties when formulating
    scalable remedies. Rm et al. [190] presented a deep neural network (DNN) based
    IDS for the IoMT environment, optimizing and tuning network parameters through
    hyperparameter selection methods. This approach enhanced the promptness of alert
    responses and mitigated the subsequent consequences of unauthorized access to
    confidential cloud-based data storage. The outcomes underscored the model''s efficacy
    in identifying and predicting unforeseen cyberattacks, contributing to the ongoing
    development of IoMT security. Ghorpade et al. [99] introduced a multi-objective
    GWO to strategically locate wireless sensor nodes enabled with IoT technology
    within a parking area. This optimization method incorporates two distinct objective
    functions, one for measuring distance and the other for assessing geometric topology
    constraints. The results show that a multi-objective grey optimizer could minimize
    a localization error compared to the compared algorithms. Ghorpade et al. [191]
    proposed HOFTELM, an IoT-based localization method for smart city applications,
    by combining an extreme learning machine, a fuzzy system, and a modified swarm
    intelligence. Particle swarm grey wolf optimizer was used to identify the moving
    sensor node direction. A fuzzy-weighted centroid optimized the irregular movement
    of nodes. This method outperformed existing algorithms regarding localization
    accuracy, number of localized nodes, and runtime. Human activity recognition (HAR)
    is essential in various applications, including elderly care, assisted living,
    smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. However, the high dimensionality of collected
    data impacts the quality of HAR models. Therefore, Helmi et al. [192] proposed
    a lightweight feature selection method to improve classification. The GBOGWO method
    leveraged gradient-based optimization and GWO to select features. Then, support
    vector machines classified the activities. Experiments showed that GBOGWO achieved
    the most optimal outcomes compared to various optimization algorithms on UCI-HAR
    and WISDM datasets. Kumar et al. [102] proposed a system that uses a deep-learning
    classifier to automatically detects arrhythmia from IoT-based electrocardiogram
    (ECG) signals data. The system processed the ECG signals to generate features
    for classification. A deep convolutional neural network (deep CNN) classifier,
    based on the coyote GWO (Coy-GWO) algorithm, was developed to detect anomalies
    in the ECG signals. The Coy-GWO algorithm combined canines'' social hierarchy
    and hunting experience to update classifier parameters effectively. This Coy-GWO-based
    deep CNN achieved 95 % accuracy, outperforming the compared techniques. Munagala
    et al. [193] proposed a fuzzy-LSTM model for a heart disease monitoring system.
    The fuzzy-LSTM model employs a Harris Hawks optimization to identify the most
    optimal characteristics, which maximize intra-class and minimize inter-class correlation.
    The simulation results showed this model enhance the efficiency of healthcare
    on heart disease and diminish mortality rates. Hashimi et al. [90] hybridized
    GWO and the genetic algorithm (GA) to build an electronic health system that enables
    remote monitoring, diagnosis, and data storage by optimizing and analyzing the
    sensor data for electronic healthcare monitoring. The GWO''s spiral search path
    ensures diversity, while the GA encourages convergence. Support vector machine
    (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers were used to extract and analyze critical information
    from the heart sensor data. The findings demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm
    produces more accurate mining models than canonical GWO and GA for data mining.
    The IoT wearable devices collect heart disease-related data from publicly available
    benchmark sites. Vellameeran and Brindha [86] hybridized a PSO with the GWO (PS-GWO)
    algorithm that obtains features collected from heart disease diagnosis using the
    IoT wearable medical devices. Moreover, the PS-GWO algorithm optimizes the hyperparameters
    of the deep belief network (DBN). The DBN analyzes the selected features to categorize
    and monitor the patients accurately. Mojjada et al. [194] proposed the hybrid
    whale GWO approach to select cluster heads for IoT healthcare devices. This approach
    uses the deep classification model, which identifies patient conditions using
    the data transmitted to the cluster heads. The results reveal that this approach
    could achieve significant accuracy and specificity compared to the techniques.
    Irshad et al. [195] presented a healthcare monitoring platform that utilizes the
    IoT and a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model based on an enhanced GWO
    (IGWO). First, the pertinent features for lung nodule diagnosis was extracted
    using the Tasmanian Devil Optimization algorithm. Then, a DCNN model based on
    IGWO was trained on the optimal features obtained from the IoT platform, and the
    outcomes were stored in the cloud for medical professionals to evaluate. The accuracy
    and efficiency of their model were assessed against state-of-the-art lung cancer
    detection models. 8. Applying GWOs in consumer IoT applications In this section,
    four papers from the final set are reviewed. These papers investigate the use
    of GWOs in IoT applications for everyday use, such as home appliances, voice assistance,
    lightning devices, etc. Table 4 summarizes GWOs applied in Consumer IoT Applications.

    applications of consumer IoT [196]. The power scheduling problem in smart homes
    (PSPSH) is a challenging scheduling problem that falls under the category of NP-hard
    problems. It possesses a search space that is both deep and rugged, mainly due
    to the presence of numerous constraints and objectives. The primary aim of PSPSH
    is to optimize electricity bills, power consumption during peak periods, as well
    as the comfort levels of users. Various optimization techniques have been employed
    to tackle PSPSH, with metaheuristics emerging as the most widely used approach.
    However, it has been observed that metaheuristics exhibit limited effectiveness
    when dealing with large-scale search spaces, so hybridization approaches are used
    to improve their performance. Makhadmeh et al. [25] hybridized a multi-verse optimizer
    (MVO) and GWO to tackle PSPSH efficiently. The proposed method showed high performance
    compared with other methods. Forestiero [197] proposed a heuristic approach to
    constructing a recommender engine within the IoT setting by employing swarm intelligence
    techniques. Vectors derived from the Doc2Vec model, are utilized to represent
    smart objects, and mobile agents associated with these vectors move in a 2D space
    using a bio-inspired flocking model. A rule of similarity, which is founded upon
    vectors, empowers agents to discern akin entities and assemble them collectively.
    This intelligent positioning allows for fast and effective selection operations.
    Rajesh et al. [198] proposed a hybrid method, self-feedback optimization adaptive
    neuro-fuzzy inference system (SFOANFIS), for managing the energy system in smart
    homes using the IoT. The SFOANFIS approach led to the efficient management of
    power and resources in the distribution system by connecting household appliances
    with cloud IoT and collecting demand response data. The results were compared
    with other existing algorithms, provided optimal use of resources, and satisfied
    the overall supply and energy demand. Yin et al. [199] introduced an optimization
    algorithm for power allocation in consumer IoT with decode-and-forward (DF) relaying.
    The algorithm uses a grey wolf optimizer to reduce the outage probability. The
    paper derives mathematical expressions for the outage probability and compares
    the algorithm with others. The paper proves the algorithm can achieve a lower
    outage probability and a faster running time than the different algorithms. 9.
    Applying GWOs in industrial IoT applications This section reviews six eligible
    industrial IoT papers that apply GWOs in different industrial applications, such
    as energy sectors, digital control systems, and intelligent agriculture. Table
    5 summarizes GWOs applied in industrial IoT Applications. Table 5. GWOs applied

    for the mobile sink WSN-based IoT Rathinam et al. [93] presented a Taylor-WWO-based
    GAN (generative adversarial network) approach to detect diseases in the agricultural
    industry. In this method, IoT nodes sense plant leaves and send the data collected
    using fractional gravitational GWO to find the optimal path for data transmission.
    The Taylor-WWO-based GAN approach exhibited enhanced performance in terms of maximum
    accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to previous methodologies. Safaei
    et al. [200] focused on creating optimal value through smart awareness in enterprise
    business service composition for IIoT manufacturing. An integer linear optimization
    model for enterprise service composition (ESC) was proposed using a hybrid multi-objective
    GWO (HGO). The model was evaluated based on four factors and compared with other
    multi-objective optimizations. The proposed model''s Pareto front converged better
    than the others. The results showed that HGO had better convergence and enhanced
    the optimality rate in IIoT manufacturing. Bhookya et al. [201] proposed a system
    for monitoring and controlling the liquid level in a single tank in real time
    using an IoT framework that utilizes a Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID)
    controller with parameters set by an enhanced GWO (mGWO) algorithm. The mGWO algorithm
    optimized the PID controller parameters, and the microcontroller programming and
    interface for the Android application were created using the Arduino integrated
    development environment (IDE). The results showed that the mGWO-based control
    system outperformed Ziegler-Nichols and simple internal model control (SIMC) tuning
    approaches, and the IoT application-based user interface improved the plant''s
    ability to control and monitor its operations with added flexibility. The system
    contributes to the ongoing development of industrial automation. Fog computing
    is becoming a popular model for IoT applications, working alongside cloud computing.
    Nethaji et al. [202] utilized a differential evolution-based GWO algorithm for
    optimal resource management. It incorporated a model for optimal resource allocation
    that combined a stochastic gradient and deep reinforcement learning-based approach.
    This method achieves quality of service (QoS) for end-users by effectively reducing
    energy consumption and managing cache resources. Jagadeesh et al. [203] proposed
    a group key management system based on deep augmented adversarial wolf learning
    named MDROWL-GKM. The goal of this system is to effectively monitor data acquired
    in the IoT, which ensures that network traffic and computational overhead are
    not maximized when a group member joins or leaves. By incorporating an opposition-based
    learning GWO algorithm, the modified deep boosting method overcomes the overload
    problem and improves performance. The efficiency of MDROWL-GKM system was evaluated
    using various criteria, including computation overhead, storage overhead, space
    complexity, access response time, policy setting accuracy, re-evaluation time,
    and communication overhead. The results proved that the MDROWL-GKM model is better
    than other state-of-the-art algorithms. Rajagopal et al. [204] introduced a data
    collection algorithm for WSN in precision agriculture. The algorithm assigned
    rendezvous points and a mobile sink to acquire data from sensor nodes. The algorithm
    also applied a hybrid method based on a metaheuristic algorithm to discover the
    shortest path for the mobile sink. The paper evaluated the algorithm on network
    lifetime, energy consumption, and latency. The paper confirms that the algorithm
    is effective and reliable. 10. Discussion, statistical analyses, and limitations
    This systematic review investigated the research using metaheuristic algorithms
    in IoT, especially the GWO algorithm. This study has provided a comprehensive
    overview of applying GWOs in different IoT applications, including IoT development,
    commercial IoT, consumer IoT, and industrial IoT. We used an adapted PRISMA methodology
    [138] for reviewing, screening, and evaluating the papers published from the introduction
    of GWO in 2014 to the end of 2023, in which GWO has been employed in various IoT
    applications to select the most eligible papers. The adapted methodology encompasses
    three main phases: identification, evaluation, and reporting. First, in the identification
    phase, a thorough search utilizing specified keywords in the Google Scholar database
    yielded 693 papers. Fig. 14 illustrates the dispersion of scholarly papers published
    from 2014 to the end of 2023. Among the 693 papers published during the specified
    period, a notable majority of research efforts, totaling 254 papers published
    in 2023, have been done in applying GWOs in different IoT applications. Download

    used three screening steps and implemented rigorous inclusion criteria during
    the evaluation phase to select the most eligible papers from reputable journals
    published between 2014 and the end of 2023. Out of the initial pool of 693 documents,
    the evaluation phase identified 50 papers as the final set. The first screening
    step removed ten duplicate papers and 262 publications from non-academic sources,
    leaving 421 reputable papers for further analysis. Fig. 15 illustrates the dispersion
    of the reputable papers chosen in the first screening across respectable publishers,
    including Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, MDPI, Hindawi, WILEY, and Taylor & Francis.
    Among these 421 papers, Springer and Elsevier publishers emerge, contributing

    apply GWOs, including the canonical GWO, existing variants, improvements and hybrids
    for different IoT applications. The second screening left 101 related papers for
    full-text reviewing. Fig. 17 shows the distribution of selected associated articles
    in various IoT applications, including IoT development, commercial IoT, consumer

    advantages. First, it allows for a comprehensive and rigorous review of the available
    evidence by systematically searching multiple databases. This broad search strategy
    minimizes the risk of publication bias and ensures a comprehensive literature
    representation. Second, by applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria,
    we aimed to ensure that the selected eligible papers were relevant to the main
    objective of this study. In addition, the approach used in the systematic review
    enabled us to perform a meta-analysis and provide a quantitative summary of the
    available data, increasing the statistical power of our study. Despite its strengths,
    this systematic review has the following limitations. First, this study relies
    solely on literature published in peer-reviewed journals and does not consider
    unpublished studies, such as preprinted papers, that may include potential sources.
    Second, language restrictions were applied, and studies published in languages
    other than English were not included, which could lead to language bias. In addition,
    the quality and limitations of the included studies varied, which may affect the
    strength of the overall conclusions. Moreover, the authors'' subjective decisions
    determined the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction, and quality
    evaluations. 11. Conclusion and future works This systematic review explored the
    eligible papers published by reputable journals in which the author(s) have applied
    GWOs, including the canonical GWO, its existing developed variants, and improvements
    and hybridizations of GWO for tackling optimization problems in different IoT
    applications. The study followed an adapted PRISMA methodology [138] with three
    main phases: identification, evaluation, and reporting. In the identification
    phase, an initial search was performed using appropriate keywords and queries
    to retrieve potentially 693 documents from various databases and sources. In the
    evaluation phase, a three-step screening process was applied to the initial search
    results to identify the eligible final set of papers for analysis and review.
    Strict inclusion criteria were utilized to ensure that only related papers published
    in reputable journals were considered in which GWOs have been applied in different
    IoT applications. The evaluation process reduced the initial pool of over 693
    papers to 50 eligible papers. In the reporting phase, the eligible papers were
    carefully subjected and synthesized to identify key themes related to applying
    GWOs in IoT applications such as IoT development, commercial IoT, consumer IoT,
    and industrial IoT. The review results revealed that GWOs hold significant promise
    in addressing optimization challenges in the IoT domain. Among the 693 papers
    identified on this topic from 2014 to the end of December 2023, a remarkable majority
    of the research efforts, 254 papers, were conducted in 2023. However, 2022 has
    published 15 eligible papers, more than 2023. Springer and Elsevier were prominent
    publishers that have published the most eligible papers. The results showed that
    GWO is a simple yet effective algorithm for addressing optimization problems in
    various IoT domains, including smart cities, healthcare, smart homes, manufacturing,
    agriculture, etc. Researchers have developed numerous GWO variants for IoT applications.
    Key techniques for developing GWO to apply in IoT applications include hybridizing
    with other algorithms, adapting parameter control, and improving search strategy.
    In addition, the review results showed that applying GWOs in IoT has expanded
    mainly IoT development with 28 eligible papers compared to other IoT applications.
    Indian researchers, with 30 eligible papers, have applied GWOs more than other
    researchers worldwide in IoT. We present a thorough and current analysis of how
    different GWO variants and parameters affect IoT problems, such as task scheduling,
    routing, clustering, security, privacy, energy management, load balancing, and
    fault tolerance. We also review hybrid and adaptive GWO methods that can adapt
    to IoT networks'' dynamic and uncertain features, such as network topology, task
    distribution, resource availability, and user demand. We reveal that the GWO algorithm
    can achieve better accuracy, stability, convergence, and diversity outcomes. These
    results suggest that GWO is a promising technique for solving optimization problems
    in IoT networks and can be further enhanced and expanded. This study suggests
    the following direction for future research. - Applying GWO to other problems
    in IoT networks, such as data aggregation, data fusion, data compression, data
    mining, IoT security applications, and data analytics. - Developing effective
    GWO variants by optimizing its parameters to adapt to different optimization problems''
    characteristics in IoT. - Assessing GWO''s scalability and interoperability for
    various IoT architectures, protocols, and applications. - Critical analysis of
    optimization problems in IoT applications to comprehend their features and requirements.
    - Enhancing the GWO''s search capability to efficiently address the search space
    challenges in IoT applications'' problems. - Enhancing the GWO''s search capability
    to efficiently address the search space challenges in IoT applications'' problems.
    - Hybridizing GWO and other advanced algorithms to solve challenging optimization
    issues in IoT applications and developments. - Developing GWO and its variants
    for tackling multi-objective optimization challenges in IoT applications to trade-off
    between optimization metrics, such as energy consumption, latency, reliability,
    and cost. - Analyzing and reviewing other advanced algorithms that can solve optimization

  description: 'Understanding how society can address and mitigate threats to groundwater
    sustainability remains a pressing challenge in the Anthropocene era. This article
    presents the first comprehensive and critical review of coupling Groundwater Models
    and Agent-Based Models (GW-ABMs) to address four key challenges: (1) adequately
    representing human behaviour, (2) capturing spatial and temporal variations, (3)
    integrating two-way feedback loops between social and physical systems, and (4)
    incorporating water governance structures. Our findings indicate a growing effort
    to model bounded rationality in human behaviour (Challenge 1 or C1) and a dominant
    focus on policy applications (C4). Future research should address data scarcity
    issues through Epstein''s Backward approach (C2), capture feedbacks via tele-coupled
    GW-ABMs, and explore other modelling techniques like Analytic Elements Groundwater
    Models (C3). We conclude with recommendations to thrust future GW-ABMs to the
    highest standards, aiming to enhance their acceptance and impact in decision-making
    and policy formulation for sustainable groundwater management.'

    • First comprehensive and critical survey on coupled Agent-Based Groundwater Models
    (GW-ABMs). • We discuss progress around four challenges faced by traditional groundwater
    models (GWMs). • Gaps around theory selection, behavioural data availability,
    and large-scale studies. • Key future research areas include Analytic Elements
    GWMs and Telecoupled GW-ABMs. • We provide actionable recommendations and a curated
    table linking policies to GW-ABMs. Abstract Understanding how society can address
    and mitigate threats to groundwater sustainability remains a pressing challenge
    in the Anthropocene era. This article presents the first comprehensive and critical

    Our findings indicate a growing effort to model bounded rationality in human behaviour

    like Analytic Elements Groundwater Models (C3). We conclude with recommendations
    to thrust future GW-ABMs to the highest standards, aiming to enhance their acceptance
    and impact in decision-making and policy formulation for sustainable groundwater

    1. Introduction Groundwater systems are essential for food and water security,
    ecosystem preservation, and human adaptation to climate change (Margat and Gun,
    2013). They supply approximately 40% of the world’s irrigation and serve as the
    primary drinking water source for over two billion people (Morris et al., 2003,
    Siebert et al., 2010). Current rates of groundwater use, however, are causing
    a rapid depletion of aquifers worldwide (Feng et al., 2013, McGuire, 2017, Rateb
    et al., 2020, Rodell et al., 2009, Scanlon et al., 2012, Scanlon et al., 2023,
    Voss et al., 2013), a situation that has attracted significant media attention,
    including a recent series in the New York Times highlighting the societal and
    policy implications of this global challenge (O’Neill et al., 2023, Rojanasakul
    et al., 2023, Searcey and Erdenesanaa, 2023). These impacts are predicted to intensify
    in the coming decades due to socio-economic development (Bierkens and Wada, 2019)
    and climate change-induced stress (Famiglietti, 2014, Ferroukhi et al., 2015,
    Wada et al., 2010). Concerningly, many of these endangered aquifers support vast
    agricultural regions and major food production areas (Dalin et al., 2019), thereby
    posing a threat to global food security and ‘virtual water’ transfers embedded
    in international food trade (Dalin et al., 2017). Sustainable groundwater management,
    which aims to ensure long-term, dynamic stability in the storage and flow of high-quality
    groundwater through fair, inclusive, and forward-thinking governance (Elshall
    et al., 2020, Gleeson et al., 2020), has emerged as a core challenge of the Anthropocene
    (Falkenmark et al., 2019, Lewis and Maslin, 2015, Rockström et al., 2014, Steffen
    et al., 2011). In this era, groundwater sustainability is impacted and determined
    not only by physical and environmental factors, but equally, and perhaps more
    importantly, by social and economic drivers. Many, if not all of these non-physical
    factors can be traced back to the decisions and behaviours of individuals and
    interest groups that depend on or have a stake in a given groundwater resource
    (An et al., 2021). The study of groundwater sustainability has historically relied
    on groundwater modelling (Anderson et al., 2015a). Groundwater models (GWMs) provide
    information about the volume and the origin of water entering an aquifer, preferential
    flow paths, potential impacts due to groundwater extraction, and a full set of
    hydro-chemical features if solute transport is included as part of the modelling
    framework. As such, they can be used for water resource assessments, sustainable
    yield calculations, environmental impact assessments, and integrated water resource
    management. Among the various computer programs used to model groundwater systems,
    one of the most widely used and globally recognised tools is MODFLOW (Harbaugh,
    2005), a numerical model which has been honed and vetted for almost 30 years (McDonald
    et al., 2003). Numerical codeslike MODFLOW, while adept at simulating the physical
    aspects of groundwater systems, were not originally designed to simulate the non-physical
    drivers of groundwater sustainability, such as individuals’ bounded rationality,
    cognitive biases, learning and memory, adaptability, social interactions, norms,
    and values. ‘Integrated’ modelling tools, including the Water Evaluation and Planning
    System (WEAP) (Yates et al., 2005), AQUATOOL (Andreu et al., 1996), Source IMS
    (Welsh et al., 2013), and MODSIM (Fredericks et al., 1998), while offering clear
    advantages in representing a range of physical processes within a unified framework,
    also do not inherently address these complex human and social drivers. The MODFLOW
    One-Water Hydrologic Flow Model (MF-OWHM) (Boyce, 2020, Hanson et al., 2014) exemplifies
    an integrated hydrologic model that tightly couples groundwater flow, surface-water
    flow, landscape processes, aquifer compaction and subsidence, reservoir operations,
    and conduit (karst) flow. While this coupling results in a numerical modelling
    code capable of addressing fundamental, water-use and sustainability issues, such
    as conjunctive-use and climate-crop-water linkages, it does not encompass the
    actions, learning, and adaptability of a heterogeneous population of water users
    in changing social and physical environments (Gilbert, 2020). Recognising this
    gap, the next section introduces coupled Groundwater Agent-Based Models (GW-ABMs),
    a promising methodological approach that complements traditional groundwater modelling
    by adding a layer of social and behavioural analysis through Agent-Based Modelling,
    thereby offering a more holistic view for groundwater management and sustainability.
    2. Why ABMs? Overcoming challenges of traditional groundwater models An Agent-Based
    Model is a computer simulation methodology in which individual elements of a social
    system are represented as distinct entities within the model (Edmonds and Meyer,
    2017). This ‘bottom-up’ modelling approach offers key advantages. Firstly, it
    enables the nuanced representation of individuals, and their dynamic cross-scale
    interactions within socially and spatially explicit environments (Furtado, 2022).
    Secondly, ABMs provide a platform for interdisciplinary communication and collaboration,
    facilitating the integration of data (empirical and tacit), theories, and methods
    from varied disciplines (Axelrod, 2006). By actively involving academics, public
    stakeholders, and policymakers in the model-building process, this collaborative
    platform can also enhance model credibility and legitimacy, allowing valuable
    knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to be incorporated (Baldwin et al., 2012,
    Basco-Carrera et al., 2017, Elshall et al., 2020). Thirdly, ABMs offer the ability
    to conduct experiments that would otherwise beinfeasible or impractical in real-world
    settings (due to fundamental limitations or challenges) (Gilbert, 2020, Kiel et
    al., 2021). By crafting fine-grained ‘artificial societies’ (Epstein and Axtell,
    1996) within a controlled ‘virtual laboratory’, ABMs provide a safe environment
    to test policy interventions, evaluate potential outcomes, and delineate the space
    of what is possible (Edmonds and Ní Aodha, 2019). In the following, we discuss
    four major challenges (C1-C4) associated with traditional groundwater modelling
    approaches. For each challenge, we: (1) highlight the limitations it imposes on
    the analysis of real-world groundwater sustainability issues, (2) describe how
    ABMs can help mitigate these constraints, and (3) explore the potential benefits
    and opportunities that arise from adopting a coupled GW-ABM modelling perspective
    (see Table 1). Following this, we turn our attention to the difficulties in developing
    and evaluating coupled GW-ABMs, which we frame under a fifth challenge (C5). Table
    1. Description of the four major challenges (C1–C4) associated with traditional
    groundwater modelling methods and the benefits from adopting a coupled GW-ABM
    approach. Challenge Description Benefits of a GW-ABM C1. Representation of human
    behaviour Traditional modelling frameworks often simplify human decision-making
    by assuming idealised incorrect conditions of perfectly rational behaviour. ABMs
    offer the advantage of incorporating a more realistic representation of human
    behaviour by accounting for “bounded rationality” and various influencing factors
    (e.g., environmental, economic, social, and cultural). C2. Diversity of human
    behaviour and temporal aspects Traditional modelling frameworks often fall short
    in capturing human behaviour’s heterogeneity and spatial–temporal variations.
    ABMs offer the advantage of modelling the diverse actors that operate within groundwater
    systems, accounting for their location and dynamic adaptations. C3. Two-way feedback
    loops Traditional modelling frameworks often overlook the complex, time- and location-based
    interconnections between social and groundwater systems. At each time-step, agents
    in an ABM can perceive and respond to hydrological and environmental changes,
    thereby enabling the coupled GW-ABM to capture two-way feedback loops between
    social and groundwater systems. C4. Representation of groundwater governance and
    policy findings Traditional modelling frameworks often lack the capability to
    adequately represent the structures and rules of water governance, as well as
    the institutions that enforce them. ABMs can model the diverse governance structures
    that exist within groundwater systems, accounting for their spatial variations
    and temporal evolution. 2.1. Representation of human behaviour (C1) Traditional
    modelling frameworks often rely on simplifying assumptions that do not adequately
    capture the complex interplay of environmental, economic, social, and cultural
    factors influencing water users’ decisions, and how these factors may interact
    and evolve over time. Such simplifications can lead to idealised conditions of
    “perfect rationality” assumed by homo economicus (economic man) models (Von Neumann
    and Morgenstern, 2004). In this idealised framework, agents are assumed to have
    complete information about the available options, perfect foresight, and the ability
    to solve a complex optimisation problem to identify the option that maximises
    their personal utility. (1) Limitations. In real-world situations, however, humans
    exhibit bounded rationality (Simon, 1956, Simon, 1957, Simon, 1990): they can
    neither access nor fully process all the relevant information for making optimal
    decisions (Aumann, 1997). This limitation is particularly pronounced in the context
    of groundwater management, where water users face both cognitive and informational
    constraints when making decisions related to water use. (2) Mitigation of constraints.
    Agent-Based Modelling allows for the explicit representation of bounded rationality,
    by providing a flexible framework to incorporate cognitive limitations, heuristics
    (Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011), rules of thumb, and biases into the decision-making
    processes of individual agents. When applied to groundwater management, an ABM
    can simulate how groundwater users make decisions based on their specific geographical,
    economic and social circumstances. This flexibilityallows for the accommodation
    of various influencing factors such as social norms and cultural values (e.g.,
    Castilla-Rho et al., 2019, Rojas et al., 2022), economic incentives (e.g., Du
    et al., 2022), and peer pressure (e.g, Liu and Agusdinata, 2021). (3) Potential
    benefits. By incorporating the bounded rationality of water users, an ABM enables
    a more nuanced and realistic representation of human behaviour. When coupled with
    GWMs, this combined approach can provide insights into how individual behaviour
    evolves in response to regulatory changes or environmental pressures, and its
    collective impact on the groundwater system. 2.2. Diversity of human behaviour
    and temporal aspects (C2) Traditional modelling frameworks may not adequately
    represent the diversity (understood as spatial and temporal variation and/or heterogeneity)
    of human behaviour. This challenge mirrors what has been referred to as the “aggregation
    effect” in socio-hydrology (Baldassarre et al., 2019) — the process by which individual
    behaviours, actions, or characteristics are grouped together or “aggregated” to
    provide a simplified representation of the complex socio-hydrological system.
    Focusing on aggregated values, however, might overlook distributions across space
    (e.g., Du et al., 2022) and among distinct social groups (e.g., De Bruijn et al.,
    2023). This might result in models or assessments that are not fully representative
    of the nuanced dynamics of the socio-hydrological system. (1) Limitations. In
    GWMs, this “aggregation” commonly occurs by clustering total water demands, evenly
    distributing pumping rates among users, or using pumping schedules that adhere
    to predetermined trends rather than responding to contextual variables. In contrast,
    in a real-world groundwater system we frequently find a wide array of actors that
    have a stake in a shared water resource (Kaiser et al., 2020), and who learn and
    adapt over time based on interactions with one another and their changing circumstances.
    (2) Mitigation of constraints. Agent-based modelling provides a flexible framework
    to explicitly represent this diversity, including the spatial and temporal variations.
    For example, ABMs can simulate a diverse set of groundwater users (e.g., agricultural,
    domestic, industrial and commercial) with unique characteristics (e.g., water
    demands, or financial resources), distinct preferences (e.g., crop types, water-saving
    technologies, or water sources), and varying perceptions (e.g., risk tolerance,
    environmental awareness, or trust in regulatory bodies). These agents can be programmed
    to learn from prior experiences or new information (e.g., García et al., 2019,
    Giordano et al., 2021, Nouri et al., 2022a), anticipate future trends (e.g., future
    crop prices and precipitation as in Hu et al., 2015a, Hu and Beattie, 2019), and
    modify their behaviours accordingly (e.g., switch to drought-resistant crops (Streefkerk
    et al., 2023), invest in water-efficient technologies (Mauser and Prasch, 2016),
    or switch between alternative water sources (Tamburino et al., 2020). (3) Potential
    benefits. In practice, ABMs offer a flexible framework for simulating the diversity,
    temporal dynamics, and adaptive learning processes among different actors within
    a groundwater system. This, in turn, helps create a more nuanced understanding
    of these complex socio-hydrological systems. 2.3. Two-way feedback loops (C3)
    Traditional modelling frameworks are not designed to capture the full gamut of
    interconnections — or co-evolutionary dynamics (Baldassarre et al., 2019, Sivapalan
    et al., 2012) — that exist between social and groundwater systems (Alam et al.,
    2022). (1) Limitations. Groundwater codes such as MODFLOW are designed to represent
    one-way effects – the impact of water users’ decisions on the water balance (e.g.,
    draw-down of the water table, discharge to a wetland or river, land subsidence,
    etc.) – but not the other way around. Human stressors (such as pumping rates and
    land-use) are thus predetermined and provided as an input for a simulation scenario.
    This practice, however, assumes that hydrological state variables have no impact
    on human decisions (Srinivasan et al., 2016), which may omit critical feedbacks.
    For instance, substantial change in human behaviour follow from reduced groundwater
    availability due to excessive pumping, such as the adoption of water saving technologies
    (e.g., Streefkerk et al., 2023) or more cost-effective water supplies (e.g., Tamburino
    et al., 2020). Models that do not take this feedback into account would project
    the over-exploitation or even depletion of the aquifer due to the selfish behaviour
    of individuals, when this may not necessarily occur (Hardin, 1968, Ostrom, 1990).
    (2) Mitigation of constraints. Coupled GW-ABMs can explicitly accommodate the
    two-way feedback loops between human behaviour and groundwater conditions. In
    practice, this means that agents can simultaneously perceive and react to changes
    in spatially-explicit hydrological and/or environmental conditions, at each time-step
    (Alam et al., 2022). (3) Potential benefits. Having the ability to model these
    two-way feedback loops in a computationally tractable way is critical for developing
    recommendations and policies that are attuned to the interconnected and dynamic
    nature of coupled human-groundwater systems, and is probably one of the main strengths
    of coupling ABMs and groundwater models. 2.4. Representation of groundwater governance
    and policy findings (C4) Traditional modelling frameworks focus on the physical
    dimensions of groundwater flow—they are not specifically designed to explicitly
    represent water governance arrangements, water regulations, and the hierarchy
    of institutions that support and/or enforce them. (1) Limitations. In real-world
    contexts, water users dynamically interact with a nested hierarchy of institutions
    and governance structures (via policies and interventions) that affect their behaviour
    at multiple scales (Lippe et al., 2019). Although tools such as MF-OWHM and WEAP
    attempt to capture the role of certain regulations and governance instruments
    – such as water rights and the administrative controls that mediate the allocation
    of water resources in a catchment – the framework upon which these processes are
    represented is hardwired to the code. Thus, their ability to represent the relevant
    high-level social structures and institutions, along with the multiple stakeholders
    involved with a groundwater resource is not warranted (Castilla-Rho et al., 2019).
    (2) Mitigation of constraints. ABMs have the flexibility to represent a range
    of operational governance structures. To illustrate, consider a hypothetical scenario
    featuring two countries (A and B), each with a unique approach to groundwater
    governance. Country A employs a centralised, top-down model, where the national
    government enforces stringent regulations and oversight. Conversely, Country B
    embraces a decentralised system, allowing local communities to exercise substantial
    control over groundwater resources, within the boundaries of state-level guidelines.
    An ABM can encode these governance structures through different rules and behaviours
    for regulatory agents. In Country A, for example, this agent could be programmed
    to enforce strict extraction quotas whenever groundwater levels fall below defined
    thresholds (e.g., Kuhn et al., 2016), whereas in Country B, multiple water resource
    management agents might implement distinct extraction limits within their own
    jurisdictions, leading to spatially-varying policies across the region (e.g.,
    Du et al., 2022). Furthermore, the ABM can simulate changes in these governance
    structures over time. For instance, if over-extraction persists, the centralised
    agent in Country A may adapt existing quotas based on selected performance targets,
    aligning with the Adaptive Water Management framework (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2012,
    Varady et al., 2016). This adjustment could inform the integration of early-warning
    indicators in real-world planning scenarios (Edmonds and Ní Aodha, 2019). Conversely,
    agents in Country B could fine-tune quotas in response to perceived localised
    drought conditions (Du et al., 2022). In both scenarios, the ABM would enable
    the evaluation of heterogeneous responses to policy interventions, while also
    considering the externalities affecting water users. (3) Potential benefits. Overall,
    GW-ABMs provide a holistic framework to assess the interplay between human behaviour
    and groundwater systems, thereby facilitating the development of adaptive and
    geographically-attuned policies for sustainable groundwater management. 2.5. Methodological
    challenges in model development (C5) The integration of GWMs and ABMs into a unified
    methodological tool offers a powerful approach. However, akin to other modelling
    and simulation endeavours, it also confronts various methodological challenges
    during model development, particularly in ensuring the model’s quality and reliability
    (Manson et al., 2020). Given the distinct intellectual origins of GWMs and ABMs,
    there are contrasting differences in terminologies, standards, and practices.
    To harmonise these aspects, we adopt the ‘Evaludation’ framework as a unified
    methodology for evaluating the quality and reliability of coupled GW-ABMs (Augusiak
    et al., 2014). This framework serves as a lingua franca – a common language that
    bridges the methodological divides between GWMs and ABMs – while also facilitating
    interdisciplinary collaboration and dialogue among researchers, policy-makers,
    and stakeholders. In C5, therefore, we place the spotlight on current practices
    over key aspects of the (coupled) model quality assurance process, throughout
    the iterative modelling cycle (see Section 3.3.6). This enables us to provide
    a comprehensive analysis of current practices in coupled GW-ABMs over these areas,
    emphasising contemporary challenges, innovative solutions, and actionable insights.
    2.6. Objectives, contribution, and guiding review questions Our aim is to present
    the first comprehensive and critical review on integrating traditional groundwater
    models with ABMs, to simulate, explore, and manage groundwater systems, including
    their social, economic, biophysical, and regulatory dimensions. The growing body
    of research in this area signals an expanding interest among researchers and policymakers
    in leveraging this combined modelling framework for sustainable groundwater management.
    This trend is further supported by the wider use of ABMs in interdisciplinary
    areas such as water resources (Kaiser et al., 2020), floods (Zhuo and Han, 2020),
    the food-energy-water nexus (Magliocca, 2020), agricultural policy (Kremmydas
    et al., 2018), fisheries governance (Lindkvist et al., 2020), socio-ecological
    systems (Lippe et al., 2019, Schulze et al., 2017), sustainability research (Aly
    et al., 2022, Shults and Wildman, 2020), and specially policy evaluation (e.g.,
    Edmonds and Ní Aodha, 2019, Gilbert, 2008, Gilbert, 2020, Savin et al., 2023,
    Squazzoni et al., 2020). By synthesising and consolidating key insights from the
    literature on coupled GW-ABMs, our review serves as a seminal text for this methodology
    and a launchpad for practitioners. We identify current research gaps, outlining
    a focused research agenda including various promising avenues for future research
    together with actionable methodological recommendations. In doing so, we hope
    to contribute to the ongoing refinement of this emerging approach, and amplify
    its role in supporting sustainable groundwater management. To achieve the above
    aims and contributions, our review will examine the literature using the following
    guiding review questions (RQs): • RQ1 (Modelling purposes and typologies): What
    is the purpose and what are the issues or questions that have motivated the development
    of GW-ABMs? • RQ2 (C1 - Simplified Representation of human behaviour): What have
    been the subjects and objects of decision-making in coupled GW-ABMs? Which theories
    and levels of rationality have been used to simulate the behaviour and decisions
    of agents? • RQ3 (C2 - Diversity of human behaviour and temporal aspects): Are
    various kinds of agents being simulated? Do agents stand for individual entities
    or are they grouped into clusters? Can agents actively learn and adapt during
    a simulation? • RQ4 (C3 - Two-way feedback loops): How is time and space represented
    in both GWMs and ABMs, and how is consistency in these scales maintained in the
    coupled model? What software is used to develop each model, and how are these
    coupled together? • RQ5 (C4 - Representation of groundwater governance and policy
    findings): How have water governance arrangements, water regulations, and the
    hierarchy of institutions been represented, if at all? What have been the main
    lessons, practical implications, or policy findings derived from GW-ABMs? • RQ6
    (C5 - Methodological challenges in model development): Based on the critical assessment
    of GW-ABMs up-to-date – specifically in terms of best practices for model validation,
    calibration, sensitivity analysis, and documentation – what key lessons and opportunities
    emerge for implementing these coupled models in the future? The paper is organised
    as follows. Section 3 outlines the methodology used for our systematic review
    of GW-ABMs. Section 4 presents the findings of this review. Section 5 builds on
    these results to re-examine and critically evaluate the progress that the coupled
    GW-ABM methodology has achieved in tackling each challenge, highlighting successful
    strategies, identifying gaps/unresolved issues, and suggesting directions for
    future research. Lastly, Section 6 offers concluding remarks. 3. Review methodology
    Fig. 1 details the PRISMA protocol (PRISMA-P Group et al., 2015) employed for
    compiling a comprehensive database of scientific publications coupling groundwater
    and agent-based models. To guarantee thoroughness, comprehensibility, replicability,
    and systematic organisation of this review, we rely on the SALSA framework (Search,
    Appraisal, Synthesis, Analysis), which is commonly used for systematic literature
    reviews (Grant and Booth, 2009, Mengist et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res

    3.1. Step 1 - Search We designed a keyword search to capture all the different
    terminologies and spellings of our main concepts in the scientific literature.
    For the Agent-Based Modelling methodology, we included terms associated to both
    multi-agent systems (multi-agent or multi agent) and individual based systems
    (individual-based or individual based), since authors might use these terms indifferently.
    As our review focuses on groundwater-related issues, we narrowed results through
    the most commonly used terms in groundwater studies (i.e., groundwater or ground
    water or ground-water or hydrogeology or aquifer). Taking into consideration that
    bibliographic databases do not cover journals in the same manner (Waltman, 2016),
    we performed our search using two major scientific databases: Scopus and Clarivate
    Analytics Web of Science (WOS). We then extended our search through Google Scholar
    to capture any other relevant study. We searched over articles’ titles, abstracts
    and the authors’ keywords, and then filtered these results by document type (articles,
    editorial materials and review documents), language (English), and source (Journals).
    We executed the search in September 2023, and obtained a total of 217 records
    which were retrieved and downloaded (106 from Scopus and 105 from WOS, and 6 from
    Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Next, we merged results using Python scripts, through
    which we detected and dropped about half of the documents as duplicates. The resulting
    128 documents were collated into a single database and subjected to further inclusion
    criteria as detailed in the next step. 3.2. Step 2 - Appraisal We examined the
    full-text articles from each record to determine their suitability for the literature
    review according to three criteria that together constrain our analysis to studies
    that have coupled ABMs with GWMs. • Criteria GW — Are groundwater processes explicitly
    modelled? We assessed how each study represented groundwater processes (e.g.,
    using a physical or analytical GWM). If there was no representation of groundwater
    quantity and/or quality processes, we discarded the record from our review. •
    Criteria ABM — Is human behaviour explicitly modelled? We assessed whether the
    model developed in each article considered the explicit simulation of individuals
    (e.g., water users) and their behaviours. If there was no representation of the
    human agency, we discarded the record from our review. • Criteria Complementary
    — If an article presents a model previously covered without introducing new experiments,
    results, or parameterisations, it is placed in a separate database and used as
    a reference, but not included as part of the review. By applying these inclusion
    and exclusion criteria, we identified and eliminated from the corpus those articles
    that were captured through our keyword search but did not align with our research
    focus. From the original 217 records, after the screening process, we were left
    with 60 documents for a comprehensive in-depth review in Section 4 (see Fig. 1).
    3.3. Step 3 - Synthesis We conducted a systematic analysis of the 60 studies based
    on sixreview topics: Modelling Purposes and Typologies (refer to Table A1) and
    the five listed challenges (see Table 2). In the following, we outline their significance
    and describe the methodology employed to assess them. Table 2. Classification

    and Typologies Our assessment started by identifying the purpose and objectives
    motivating the development of GW-ABMs (see RQ1). We adopted (Edmonds et al., 2019)
    classification system as a basis and expanded it to include studies introducing
    new modelling software (refer to Table A1 for detailed definitions of each category).
    Then, we sorted the articles into two general categories of application: Agriculture
    or Water Supply. Studies focusing on different topics were grouped under the Other
    label (e.g., Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage systems). Lastly, since the modelling
    purpose informs the choice of a suitable GWM, we classified each GWM using two
    taxonomies (see Table 2): (1) Type —- physically-driven (relies on processes and
    principles of physics to represent groundwater flows), data-driven (relies on
    relations derived from empirical data to predict physical variables), hybrid (combines
    both previous approaches, such as a physically-based model used to train a data-driven
    model), or Other (any other modelling approach) — and (2) Sub-type — numerical
    (solves the groundwater governing equations through numerical methods), analytical
    (uses simpler forms of the groundwater governing equations to compute physical
    variables), Other (any other modelling approach). 3.3.2. (C1) Representation of
    human behaviour Our second analytical lens sought to determine what have been
    the subjects and objects of decision-making in coupled GW-ABMs, and what has been
    the behavioural underpinning (theoretical basis) and rationality level of the
    simulated artificial agents (see RQ2). For the former, we documented the agent
    types reported in each article and grouped them by the functional categories proposed
    by Kaiser et al. (2020) for ABMs in water resource management. This classification
    included three types of water users (namely, urban/domestic, industrial, and agricultural),
    three types of water providers (namely, regulator, water utility, and reservoir
    manager), any interest group, economic institution, and a category titled other
    to capture any agents not included by the previous classifications. Lastly, to
    assess rationality, we classified each article based on whether the simulated
    individuals make decisions following a fully-rational (i.e., using optimisation-only
    procedures), boundedly rational (i.e., using heuristics under limited knowledge
    and cognitive capacity), or a mixed behaviour (i.e., agents might rely on optimisation,
    but have limited knowledge and cognitive capacities). 3.3.3. (C2) diversity of
    human behaviour and temporal aspects In complex systems, diversity is typically
    defined in three ways. Firstly, as the differences within a specific type or category
    (e.g., the distribution of groundwater entitlements and allocations assigned to
    a population of water users). Secondly, as the differences across types (e.g.,
    the different individuals, groups, institutions, and stakeholders involved in
    water resources management). Thirdly, as the differences in composition, referring
    to how these types are arranged or assembled (Page, 2011). To capture these multiple
    dimensions of diversity and gain insights into how it has been represented in
    coupled GW-ABMs (see RQ3), we defined and used several measures. For diversity
    within an agent type, we investigated whether the primary agent-type simulated
    in each article (i.e., farmers or domestic urban water users for agricultural
    and water supply applications respectively) was aggregated into clusters, groups,
    or super-agents. For diversity across agent types, we used Kaiser et al. (2020)
    classification system. Finally, we did not quantify the diversity of composition
    in our review, since computational experimentation with GW-ABMs always resulted
    in variations of agents and their state variables through defined scenarios. To
    capture the temporal aspect of decision-making, we examined each article to extract
    whether learning or adaptation mechanisms were explicitly simulated and how. Given
    there is no universal agreement in the relevant literature on how to distinguish
    between these two processes (Müller et al., 2013), we assessed both indistinctly.
    3.3.4. (C3) two-way feedback loops To enable a richer discussion on two-way feedback
    loops (see RQ4), we first assessed the spatial and temporal scales, and the software
    used in both GWMs and ABMs. We first classified GWMs based on how they treated
    time (i.e., transient or steady-state approach) and included details on the temporal
    resolution (time-step). Then, we analysed how they treated space, classifying
    them as either Distributed (i.e., the model considers spatial variations in the
    aquifer’s properties), Semi-distributed (i.e., the model divides the spatial domain
    into units that are assumed to be internally homogeneous, but can vary from one
    another), Lumped/Aggregated (i.e., space is treated in an aggregated or averaged
    manner), or Other (any other representation of space), and further documented
    the number of spatial dimensions (namely, 3D, 2D, 1D, or N.A.), the size of the
    cell (if applies), and the total extent. Analogously, for ABMs, we categorised
    them based on whether they included space (spatially-explicit) or not (spatially-implicit),
    and how it was represented (continuously, grid-based, network-based, or through
    a Geographical Information System). In terms of time, however, given agents make
    decisions at varying time scales, we chose not to classify ABMs by a single time
    scale as this could lead to misunderstandings in cross-article comparisons. Lastly,
    we separately recorded the software used to develop the GWM and the ABM in each
    study, and then further classified each article as either proprietary or open-source
    (free) based on the licenses that govern the software used. With all this information,
    we then proceeded to examine the coupling (at the software level) between each
    GWM and ABM as explained below. Coupling standards, frameworks, and initiatives
    aimed at promoting interoperability of developed models in various fields exist
    and are well developed (e.g., The Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI) used in hydrology
    (Harpham et al., 2019) or the Bespoke Framework Generator (BFG) for Climate Models
    (Armstrong et al., 2009)), yet we did not find any records that utilised them.
    During our review, we did notice the use of terms such as loosely, tightly/closely,
    and integrated, to describe the different types of connections between GWMs and
    ABMs. Although this terminology neatly synthesises the coupling level to a single
    category, as highlighted by Bithell and Brasington (2009), it can be ambiguous
    when multiple and simultaneous feedback loops exist. For instance, a GWM might
    be integrated spatially to an ABM (i.e. agents and the simulated physical system
    share the same coordinate system and spatial resolution), whilst simultaneously
    be loosely coupled temporally (i.e., the GWM operates at a different time scale
    than the ABM) to fit a restricted computational budget or to reach numerical stability.
    Resolving this ambiguity would require complete access to the source code of each
    model (which is often lacking), and sufficient disciplinary expertise on each
    type of programming language and software package. Given the effort and nuance
    that would be needed to accomplish this task, we opted for a qualitative assessment
    using Antle et al. (2001) terminology of loosely coupled (i.e., the GWM and ABM
    are executed sequentially, passing information between each other as data files),
    tightly/closely coupled (i.e., relevant processes of the GWM and the ABM are coded
    and linked together on the same programming system), and Integrated (i.e., the
    GWM and the ABM share the same set of drivers and scales, making processes endogenous)
    and informed by our previous evaluation of spatio-temporal scales and software
    used (see Table 2). 3.3.5. (C4) representation of groundwater governance and policy
    findings Groundwater governance can be understood as the framework encompassing
    the processes, interactions, and institutions, in which actors (i.e. government,
    private sector, civil society, academia, etc.) participate and decide on the management
    of groundwater within and across multiple geographic (i.e. sub-national, national,
    transboundary, and global) and institutional/sectoral levels (Villholth and Conti,
    2018). Despite the numerous legal frameworks and policies in place for the regulation
    of groundwater, these often assume that perfect compliance from individuals can
    be achieved at no cost, while compliance and enforcement still remains a major
    global issue (see Holley et al., 2020 and references therein). We began by examining
    the role of actors simulated in coupled GW-ABMs. In this review topic, however,
    we took a closer look at how the compliance behaviours of individuals has been
    represented so far, if at all, and the role of enforcement (from official or unofficial
    parties and institutions). Concurrently, to understand the role of coupled GW-ABMs
    in policy assessment (see RQ5), we categorised which groundwater policies have
    been simulated and assessed to date (refer to Table 4 for a description of each),
    documenting the key findings that emerged from studies and their implications
    for the design and improvement of these policies. 3.3.6. (C5) methodological challenges
    in model development The ‘Evaludation’ framework (Fig. 2) integrates the different
    elements that need to be addressed during model development to establish quality
    and credibility. Among its six elements, we centred our review on four backbone
    components: Model Output Verification (calibration), Model Output Corroboration
    (validation), Model Analysis (through sensitivity analysis), and Model Documentation
    (part of Data Evaluation). This focused approach aimed for an insightful and actionable
    assessment, to highlight best practices, common difficulties, and innovative solutions
    (see RQ6). While both the Conceptual Model Evaluation and Implementation Verification
    elements are also essential for quality assurance, both are particularly difficult
    to assess. The former, with a plethora of methods, is also inherently subjective,
    while the latter requires an understanding and access to the source code and software
    used to develop the coupled model. In the following, we first briefly define each
    element reviewed and contextualise it from the context of groundwater modelling
    and Agent-Based Modelling. Grounded on this comparative explanation, we then present
    our review approach which synthesises our understanding of each element for coupled
    GW-ABMs. During the Model Output Verification stage, a critical assessment is
    performed on how well model outputs (predictions) match (system) observations
    and the role of calibration in obtaining adequate fits (Augusiak et al., 2014).
    In groundwater modelling, this procedure is termedsolving the “inverse problem”,
    as parameter values are estimated and assigned based on measurements of what is
    being modelled (Carrera et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2014). While it has been extensively
    investigated since the early 1970s, this process continues to present significant
    challenges including computational burden due to the requirement of multiple model
    realisations, scale inconsistencies between field measurements and the model’s
    discretisation, and the problems of non-uniqueness, non-existence and non-steadiness
    of solutions (Anderson et al., 2015b, Doherty, 2015). For ABMs, however, the considerable
    amount of individual-level behavioural information that is needed for fine-tuning
    parameters, makes this “calibration” process a major challenge (An et al., 2021).
    Furthermore, given observations of relevant outputs are usually not available,
    parameter values are commonly fit to reproduce instead patterns observed in reality,
    as described in “pattern-oriented parameterisation” (Grimm et al., 2005, Grimm
    and Railsback, 2012, Jakoby et al., 2014). Download : Download high-res image
    (308KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The six elements of the ‘Evaludation’
    framework (see black italics titles) mapped to a simplified representation of
    the modelling cycle (see blue boxes) as presented in the original figure (Augusiak
    et al., 2014), plus the elements analysed during this review (see purple titles).
    Based on these definitions, we first examined whether history matching was performed
    on each GWM and whether this was performed manually or through automated algorithms.
    Then we recorded any efforts to perform parameter fitting to match existing data
    sets or patterns on each ABM. In both cases, to gain further insights into current
    trends, pitfalls, and opportunities, we also examined which parameters were fine-tuned,
    how well model output matched the observations, and how the results were presented.
    With this information, we then classified the ABM and GWM of each record into
    the categories presented on Table 2. Model Output Corroboration refers to the
    comparison of model predictions with independent data and patterns that were not
    used while the model was developed, parameterised, and verified (Augusiak et al.,
    2014). In groundwater modelling this comparison is common practice, despite debates
    suggesting a GWM cannot be completely validated (see Anderson et al., 2015a, Konikow
    and Bredehoeft, 1992 and references therein). For ABMs, however, there is a lack
    of official common standard protocols, resulting in a multitude of available methodologies
    and frameworks (Kang, 2018, Rand and Rust, 2011, Troost et al., 2023). Hence,
    with the aim to understand current practices for coupled GW-ABMs, we examined
    whether any comparison to independent data or patterns was performed and whether
    scholars mentioned any validation attempt in their studies. Based on the techniques
    used for the ABMs in particular, we classified them into (see Table 2): (1) Structural
    Validation — the process of ensuring realism in the conceptual model by analysing
    assumptions and simplifications (Manson, 2002)— (2) Extreme and Sensitivity Tests,
    (3) Participatory Modelling (i.e., relying on workshops, surveys, or other participatory
    techniques (Voinov et al., 2018)), (4) Pattern-Oriented Modelling (Grimm et al.,
    2005), and (5) Empirical Output Validation (North and Macal, 2007, Rand and Rust,
    2011). Model Analysis includes the assessment of how sensitive model outputs are
    to parameter variations, a process known as Sensitivity Analysis (SA) (Saltelli,
    2004). While Uncertainty Analysis (UA) often complements SA for exploring, managing,
    and evaluating uncertainty during Model Analysis (Saltelli et al., 2019, Saltelli,
    2008), we do not cover it in this review. We chose to concentrate solely on SA
    because assessing the diverse uncertainties in data input, model structure, and
    parameter estimation methods is a substantial endeavour which would significantly
    extend the scope and length of this review. Future work should take a specific
    focus on this aspect, and provide the necessary platform to dissect and explore
    it in detail. In terms of Model Analysis, then, we first classified articles based
    on whether they performed or not a SA. We recorded the SA methods used, and categorised
    each article following the classification system shown in Table 3. Firstly, to
    uncover the purpose of each SA (the why), we used the ‘settings’ proposed by Saltelli
    (2004) and Saltelli (2008). Similar to Borgonovo and Plischke (2016), we included
    a Model Building setting to capture those studies aimed to assist in any of the
    various phases of the modelling cycle. Secondly, to understand the implementation
    of each SA (the how), we followed Pianosi et al., 2016, Saltelli et al., 2019
    and Song et al. (2015) to distinguish between quantitative or qualitative techniques,
    and the sampling strategies as either Local or Global. Lastly, we recorded whether
    the input factors and the outcomes measured during the SA, targeted either the
    social system, the physical system, or a combination of both. In terms of Model
    Documentation, transparent description of a model’s structure not only enables
    accurate replication but also fosters seamless communication within and across
    disciplines (Grimm et al., 2020). Given its interdisciplinary nature, a primary
    challenge for GW-ABMs is the establishment of a unified and standard protocol
    that covers every facet of the coupled model development (e.g., conceptualisation,
    parameterisation, analysis, and evaluation). The ODD (Overview, Design concepts,
    Detail) protocol (Grimm et al., 2010) and its successive extensions (Grimm et
    al., 2020, Laatabi et al., 2018, Müller et al., 2013) have become the accepted
    standard for describing ABMs, and now are included within the TRACE protocol (Grimm
    et al., 2014), which documents the different elements defined in the ‘Evaludation’
    framework. Therefore, we first examined the methods that modellers have employed
    to document their coupled GW-ABMs. Then, we specifically extracted information
    as to whether the ODD protocol was used and how extensively, classifying each
    article into one of the following categories: (1) Fully-used (i.e., the entire
    ODD protocol is given), (2) Partially-used (i.e., the protocol is used only for
    guiding the model’s description in the article, but it is not fully covered, neither
    delivered), or (3) Not used (see Table 2). Table 3. Classification system and
    categories used for classifying articles on the Model Analysis element of the
    ‘Evaludation’ framework. Classification Sub-categories and descriptions Purpose
    Factor prioritisation and screening: Aimed to either obtain insights about the
    most important input factors (i.e., the factor prioritisation/ranking setting),
    or find those least influential ones (i.e., the factor fixing/screening setting).
    Model building: Aimed to guide model development in any of the various phases
    of the modelling cycle (e.g., model output corroboration, model output verification,
    etc.), thereby improving the model’s credibility and reliability. Model exploration:
    Aimed to identify critical or interesting regions in the space of the input factors,
    or trace how an output of interest is generated, or study which values of the
    input factors lead to model realisations in a given range of the output space
    (i.e., the factor mapping setting). Other: This category captures any other purpose
    not included in the previous ones. Sampling strategy Local sensitivity analysis
    (LSA): The SA explored how deviations in a single input affect the variability
    of the results while holding all other inputs constant. This includes the traditional
    One-At-A-Time (OAT) design. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA): Explores the whole
    input space, analysing outcome variability both due to single input and interactions
    (Ligmann-Zielinska et al., 2020, Saltelli, 2004). Hybrid: This category captures
    those Sensitivity Analysis that do not fit on the previous ones. Method type Quantitative:
    Each input factor is associated with a quantitative and reproducible evaluation
    of its relative influence, normally through a set of sensitivity indices. Qualitative:
    The sensitivity was assessed qualitatively by visual inspection of model predictions
    or by specific graphs (e.g., tornado plots, scatter visualisations, etc.). Input(s)/Output(s)
    targeteda Physical system: The input factors varied during the SA (or in turn,
    the selected outcomes), were associated with the hydrology or the groundwater
    system (or target outcome measures associated to it). Social system: The input
    factors varied during the SA (or in turn, the selected outcomes), were associated
    with the social system (or target outcome measures associated to it). Both: The
    input factors varied during the SA (or in turn, the selected outcomes), were associated
    with both the groundwater system and the social system (or target outcome measures
    associated to both). a Note we assessed separately the input factors and the output
    measures in terms of which system they target. 3.4. Step 4 - Analysis We conducted
    a thorough review of each article in the corpus, guided by the review topics and
    methodology outlined in Section 3.3. This review resulted in the creation of a
    databasecontaining categorical and multi-nominal variables. To address our research
    questions, we carried out quantitative analyses of these variables, and presented
    the findings through visualisations tailored for multi-dimensional data. 4. Results
    The earliest instance of a coupled GW-ABM dates back to 2003 with the SINUSE model
    (Feuillette et al., 2003). As shown in Fig. 3, GW-ABM applications garnered limited
    attention during the first decade (2003–2013). However, this trend shifted dramatically
    in the subsequent decade (2014–2023), with notable bursts in research activity
    occurring in 2015 and 2019. This upward trajectory indicates a growing scholarly
    interest in this interdisciplinary topic, aligning with prior observations that
    groundwater systems are under-researched and highlighting the potential of ABMs
    to address this gap (see Gorelick and Zheng, 2015). Regarding geographical focus,
    the majority of case studies were situated in catchments in Iran (17), the USA
    (14), China (4), and the Republic of Kiribati (3). Notably, most of these countries
    are grappling with similar threats to groundwater sustainability stemming from
    the combined effect of over-pumping and climate change (see Rodell et al., 2018,
    Wu et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download : Download

    we intentionally leave out of this chart those journals with less than three articles).
    4.1. Modelling purposes and typologies The majority of the reviewed studies focused
    on simulating the behaviours and interactions of either farmers (32 articles,
    53%) or urban water users (10 papers, 17%), with some addressing both (14 papers,
    23%) —refer to the “Agriculture”, “Water Supply”, and “Both” categories depicted
    in Fig. 4-A. As to agriculturally-focused GW-ABMs, we detected several methodological
    innovations and hybrid modelling approaches, aimed to enhance the representation
    of human decision-making such as Bayesian Cognitive Maps (Pope and Gimblett, 2015),
    Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (Mehryar et al., 2019), Fuzzy Inference Systems (Nouri et
    al., 2019), Social Network Analysis (Giordano et al., 2021), and data-driven Directed
    Information Graphs combined with Boosted Regression Trees (Hu et al., 2017). As
    tourban Water Supply, studies have targeted a wide range of issues in managing
    urban groundwater systems, such as the effects of different degrees of urban clustering
    on groundwater levels (Zellner and Reeves, 2012), the relationship between urbanisation
    and water vulnerability to water shortages (Srinivasan et al., 2013), the interactions
    between water supply and water consumer networks and their structural heterogeneities
    (Zhang et al., 2023), and decentralised systems for micro-trading harvested rainwater
    (Bolton and Berglund, 2023). Overall, these studies have deepened our understanding
    of groundwater in urban settings, thereby improving our ability to manage them
    effectively. The remaining 4 articles (7%), classified as “Other”, have investigated
    a range of topics, such as system-level emergent outcomes and feedback between
    groundwater and urban Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage systems (Beernink et al.,
    2022, Jaxa-Rozen et al., 2019), the social impacts of mining (Liu and Agusdinata,
    2021), and the role that changes in natural spring flows may have played on hominin
    movement (Cuthbert et al., 2017). This diversity of applications highlights the
    potential of ABMs in addressing pressing issues that require an acknowledgement
    of the complexities of human behaviour and regulatory institutions. Finally, we
    observed the development of large modelling frameworks designed to integrate the
    multiple aspects of water resources and their multi-scale linkages to other sectors
    into a single computational decision-support tool (García et al., 2019, Martin
    et al., 2016, Mauser and Prasch, 2016, Phetheet et al., 2021, Yoon et al., 2021).
    While these integrated models represent ambitious and long-term endeavours, they
    possess the capabilities to unravel the trade-offs and synergies inherent in groundwater
    management interventions. Consequently, they can facilitate more informed decision-making
    processes that can lead to sustainable pathways. In 47 studies (78% of the corpus),
    GW-ABMs were developed to explore how different modelling assumptions produce
    different outcomes (see Theoretical Exploration on Fig. 4-B and Table A1). Interestingly,
    most of these studies took a policy focus, as 42 of these 47 articles explicitly
    simulated, experimented, and assessed the effects of potential management or policy
    interventions at the group and/or individual-level (see Table 4). Remarkably,
    we identified a total of 16 studies (27%) using a participatory/collaborative
    modelling approach (Voinov et al., 2018) during model development, and a total
    of 3 studies (5%) aimed to build a model that encapsulates a shared understanding
    of a group of people to promote social learning (Reed et al., 2010). This latter
    category has included the development of a novel digital platform that enables
    on-the-fly execution of a coupled GW-ABM (Rojas et al., 2022), and a computer-assisted
    role-playing game aimed to facilitate dialogue (Dray et al., 2007, Perez et al.,
    2003). Download : Download high-res image (249KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. GW-ABM studies were classified based on: A. the general application
    (i.e., Agriculture, Water Supply, Both, or Other), and B. the modelling purpose
    using the criteria put forward by Edmonds et al. (2019). We identified 5 articles
    that introduced new modelling tools and software for developing coupled GW-ABMs.
    Castilla-Rho et al. (2015) unveiled FlowLogo, an interactive NetLogo-based modelling
    environment that deploys the 2D finite-difference solution of the governing equations
    for groundwater flow. Bakarji et al. (2017) offered an extendable and modular
    computational package that combines social, economic, and physical components
    (using the Finite Element Heat and Mass Transfer code). Jaxa-Rozen et al. (2019)
    presented a Python-based architecture coupling NetLogo with MODFLOW/SEAWAT, thereby
    facilitating the exploration of socio-hydrological dynamics involving complex
    subsurface processes. Phetheet et al. (2021) provided the Food-Energy-Water Calculator
    (FEWCalc), an ABM designed to project farm incomes based on crop selection, irrigation
    practices, groundwater availability, renewable energy investment, and historical
    and projected environmental conditions. More recently, De Bruijn et al. (2023)
    introduced the Geographical, Environmental and Behavioural model (GEB), capable
    of simulating millions of individual household agents within independent hydrological
    environments and dynamically linked to the spatially-distributed CWatM hydrological
    model. Although a comprehensive comparison of these tools falls beyond the scope
    of this review, it is important to underscore their pivotal role in expanding
    what is methodologically feasible, and in facilitating and broadening the applicability
    of coupled GW-ABMs to other research and policy-making contexts. In terms of groundwater
    modelling, overall we observed a prevalence of physically-based GWMs (54 studies),
    from which most are numerical in nature (38 articles). These models dominate across
    various modelling purposes. They are, in fact, the exclusive choice for Explanation,
    Illustration, and Social Learning purposes (see Fig. 5). A subset of studies also
    explored hybrid or data-driven approaches, which typically integrate an Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN), trained on a physically-based numerical GWM, to estimate
    groundwater levels (Anbari et al., 2021, Bakhtiari et al., 2020, Elhamian et al.,
    2022, Farhadi et al., 2016). All these approaches, however, have less frequently
    been used, as seen by the sparse entries in Fig. 5, suggesting their potential
    might still be largely unexplored. Finally, while prediction of future impacts
    has been a traditional objective of groundwater models, our review revealed no
    GW-ABMs specifically aimed at this modelling purpose. This absence, however, aligns
    well with acknowledged difficulties of making predictions in complex and wicked
    systems, given the lack of data, the ontological diversity, and the variety of
    algorithmic approaches to simulating human behaviour (Edmonds et al., 2019, Squazzoni
    et al., 2020). Similarly, we detected very limited attention to Groundwater Quality
    issues (5 studies), and no study representing complex coupled processes of flow
    in porous media, chemical reactions, transport and/or heat transfer (e.g., coastal
    saltwater intrusion or energy storage), which concurs with prior findings (see
    Jaxa-Rozen et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res image (264KB) Download

    applications (see Fig. 6-A), although the subjects of decisions are mostly individual
    farmer agents (e.g., Du et al., 2022, Mehryar et al., 2019, Pope and Gimblett,
    2015, Tamburino et al., 2020), studies have also aggregated these up to groups
    or clusters of farmers (e.g., Giordano et al., 2021, Khan and Brown, 2019, Mulligan
    et al., 2014), counties (e.g., Hu et al., 2015b, Hu et al., 2017, Hu and Beattie,
    2019), and even extensive management regions (e.g., Farhadi et al., 2016). We
    also evidenced an extensive range of simulated objects of decisions, both direct
    and indirect, including which crops to plant and grow, how much land to irrigate,
    water use levels and sources (groundwater, surface water and tanker water), irrigation
    scheduling, water trading, and other investment decisions (e.g., adopting renewable
    energy or new irrigation technologies). Urban Water Supply GW-ABMs (see Fig. 6-B)
    have simulated different entities at multiple hierarchical levels, from individual
    consumers, residents, and households (e.g., Bolton and Berglund, 2023, Zhang et
    al., 2023), up to groups of water consumers (e.g., Bakhtiari et al., 2020) and
    entire cities (e.g., Al-Amin et al., 2018). The key simulated decisions regarding
    all these agent types is how to supply water for respective water uses (e.g.,
    piped water, domestic groundwater well, water bought from water tank trucks, domestic
    rainwater tanks, or water trade), and whether to engage in water-related investments
    such as innovation technologies (Mauser and Prasch, 2016) or long-term water infrastructure
    (Srinivasan et al., 2013) . As expected from the classical urban water supply
    problem, public management agencies (e.g., municipalities, state services, provincial
    governments, water utilities, water agencies, etc.), and the role of water utility
    managers is also simulated in almost all these GW-ABMs. Their main role is to
    distribute water for the agents throughout the simulation (e.g., Bakhtiari et
    al., 2020, Lachaut et al., 2022, Yoon et al., 2021), and enact and enforce water
    restrictions (e.g., Al-Amin et al., 2018, Allain et al., 2018, Martin et al.,
    2016). Download : Download high-res image (302KB) Download : Download full-size

    Supply GW-ABMs using the classification system put forward by Kaiser et al. (2020).
    Most GW-ABM studies have aimed to test the effects of potential policy interventions.
    Consequently, a regulatory agency is usually included as an agent, with oversight
    on water rights, water caps, and water allocations (e.g., Anbari et al., 2021,
    Farhadi et al., 2016, Giordano et al., 2021, Nouri et al., 2019), monitoring and
    controlling illegal water withdrawal (e.g., Aghaie et al., 2020a, Aghaie et al.,
    2020b, Castilla-Rho et al., 2019, Rojas et al., 2022), implementing local water
    taxes (e.g., Du et al., 2022), and enacting laws related to the formation and
    operation of water markets (e.g., Nouri et al., 2022a). In Agricultural applications,
    studies have also introduced Interest group agents. These agents have represented
    agricultural institutions that aim to improve irrigation efficiency either by
    disseminating knowledge (De Bruijn et al., 2023) or by offering economic incentives
    (Anbari et al., 2021). They have also represented environmental institutions that
    focus on raising awareness about aquifer over-exploitation (Nouri et al., 2022b)
    or aim to minimise groundwater drawdown (Farhadi et al., 2016). As to the simulated
    agents’ level of rationality in coupled GW-ABMs (Fig. 7), we found a tendency
    towards a boundedly rational behaviour (48% of the corpus), through the inclusion
    of cognitive limitations (e.g., constrained knowledge of the groundwater system,
    limited foresight of environmental conditions or the consequences of their actions,
    finite memory, and different learning/adaptation processes), various biases (e.g.,
    risk aversion, loss aversion, and susceptibility to social influences), and the
    use of heuristics (e.g., imitation and social norms, rules of thumb, and satisficing
    behaviours). Furthermore, when examining the research timeline, we found that
    the first decade (2003–2013) showed an equal preference for both boundedly rational
    and fully-rational agents, each making up 38% of the corpus. However, in the subsequent
    decade (2014–2023), the proportion of studies featuring boundedly rational agents
    (50%) more than doubled those with fully-rational agents (21%). This shift suggests
    a growing effort to more accurately represent human decision-making in coupled
    GW-ABMs. Despite the numerous behavioural theories developed in Social Sciences,
    Behavioural Economics, and other scientific fields, we only detected a few studies
    making explicit use of them to model human decision-making. For instance, the
    Theory of Planned Behaviour (Giordano et al., 2021, Mauser and Prasch, 2016, Zhang
    et al., 2023, Zolfagharipoor and Ahmadi, 2021), Protection Motivation Theory (Streefkerk
    et al., 2023), Dempster–Shafer Belief Theory (Allain et al., 2018, Martin et al.,
    2016), Cultural Theory (Castilla-Rho et al., 2019, Rojas et al., 2022) and Hofstede’s
    Cultural Dimensions Theory (Tamburino et al., 2020). The rest of the studies have
    relied instead on social or behavioural constraints that complement the traditional
    profit-optimisation approach, by using IF-THEN rules (e.g., Mehryar et al., 2019,
    Noël and Cai, 2017, Ohab-Yazdi and Ahmadi, 2018) or Fuzzy rules (e.g., Nouri et
    al., 2019, Nouri et al., 2022b). Other studies have ventured into the application
    and use of Machine Learning techniques (e.g., Bayesian cognitive mapping and boosted
    regression trees) to adequately capture behavioural stochasticity (Hu et al.,
    2017, Pope and Gimblett, 2015). Download : Download high-res image (102KB) Download

    with a model of human behaviour classified as either fully-rational, boundedly
    rational, mixed, or not clear. We present the results for each specific application
    separately (namely, Agriculture, Water Supply, or Other). Note 14 publications
    are classified as both Agriculture and Water Supply. Since these are presented
    in both columns separately in the chart, then the total number of studies presented
    reaches to 74. 4.3. (C2) diversity of human behaviour and temporal aspects With
    our first diversity lens – termed diversity within – we aimed to uncover the level
    of aggregation at which the primary agent-type has been simulated. Overall, we
    evidenced substantially more disaggregation (44 studies or 73% of the corpus).
    However, agriculture applications tend to rely more on aggregated agents (see
    Fig. 8-A) than Water Supply studies (see Fig. 8-B). Quoting the terms employed
    by the scholars, this aggregation is made to fit available data (Hu et al., 2015b,
    Hu et al., 2017, Hu and Beattie, 2019), to reflect independent management areas
    (Nouri et al., 2019, Nouri et al., 2022b, Nouri et al., 2022a) or actual partitions
    in the landscape (Giordano et al., 2021), or to reduce computational time (Elhamian
    et al., 2022, Farhadi et al., 2016). Our analysis under the second lens – termed
    diversity across – uncovered that multiple agent types are commonly simulated
    in the literature. This is evident from the densely interconnected co-occurrence
    network shown in Fig. 9-A, which has a density of 0.81 (note also 65% of the articles
    included more than one agent type). The most frequently represented agent types
    are “Agriculture” under the Water Users class and “Regulator” under the Water
    Providers class (see Fig. 9-B). Notably, the linkages between Agriculture-Regulator
    and Domestic-Water Utility are among the three most frequent, suggesting a thematic
    focus on groundwater regulation in non-urban areas and urban water supply respectively.
    Interestingly, Regulator agents were only introduced in 2015, while Water Utilities
    have been consistently represented since 2003. We hypothesise that the increased
    focus on regulatory agents may stem from growing societal concerns about groundwater
    depletion in the agricultural sector, and related shifts in groundwater policy.

    for A. Agriculture-only applications (i.e., farmers), B. Water Supply-only applications
    (i.e., domestic water users), and C. Both (i.e., either farmers or domestic water
    users are aggregated or not). As to learning and adaptation, we found 30 studies
    (50% of the corpus) explicitly simulating these behavioural processes. These have
    been captured through a “best-mean imitation” heuristic — imitate the strategy
    of whichever neighbour is doing best, exploit the current strategy if better,
    and explore a new strategy occasionally (Castilla-Rho et al., 2019, Rojas et al.,
    2022) —, reinforcement learning — implement the same strategy of the previous
    year, until this strategy proofs to be not satisfactory (Giordano et al., 2021)—,
    bayesian learning (e.g., Hu and Beattie, 2019), and mostly through the agents’
    memories of previous experiences such as attained crop profits (Aghaie et al.,
    2020a, Nouri et al., 2019), crop yields (Tamburino et al., 2020), crop productions
    (Allain et al., 2018), and aquifer conditions (Jaxa-Rozen et al., 2019). The explicit
    inclusion of these mechanisms has allowed agents’ decisions to evolve in response
    to changing circumstances, knowledge, and experiences, which overall provides
    a richer representation of human heterogeneity. Download : Download high-res image

    4.4. (C3) two-way feedback loops The multiple intricate bidirectional feedback
    loops that exist between social and groundwater systems can be conceptualised,
    simulated, and explored through the coupled GW-ABM methodological approach. However,
    linking separate models to enable close interconnections and synchronous exchanges
    of data requires reaching a consistent spatial and temporal scale between the
    models. The representation of space in groundwater models has been prominently
    distributed (38 studies, see blue ribbon in Fig. 10), as scholars have mostly
    relied on physically-based numerical GWMs. In contrast, 8 studies Aggregated the
    aquifer to a single unit (see red ribbon in Fig. 10), by using Analytical methods
    (mostly mass balances). Although these analytical models are computationally less
    demanding compared to physically-based models, they assume that an aquifer responds
    uniformly and instantly to groundwater pumping (Brozović et al., 2010) and thus
    are not able to capture the aquifer’s heterogeneity and the spatially-varying
    responses to human action. In between these two extremes, we detected 6 articles
    using Semi-Distributed GWMs (see purple ribbon in Fig. 10), which divide the aquifer
    into different regions with distinct physical properties (e.g., Darbandsari et
    al., 2020, Moradikian et al., 2022). Remarkably, with the goal of striking a balance
    between efficiency and accuracy, researchers have ventured into the use of Hybrid
    approaches by developing a physically-based distributed model that then trains
    an ANN (e.g., Farhadi et al., 2016) to predict groundwater flows while acknowledging
    space variability. Likewise, other scholars have ventured into the design of Data-Driven
    approaches that either train an ANN from available data (e.g., Anbari et al.,
    2021) or rely on simpler linear regressions (e.g., Phetheet et al., 2021). Since
    in these cases groundwater properties are obtained only at specific locations
    in space (usually around features of interest), the aquifer’s spatial heterogeneity
    is simplified (see yellow ribbon in Fig. 10). Although most studies have considered
    spatial variability in the aquifer system (see Fig. 10), this has been done at
    vastly different levels. For instance, most of the spatially-explicit models (i.e.,
    Distributed or Semi-Distributed) have opted for a 3D model with a cell size in
    the range of to 0,5 , and covering a total geographical area between and 10.000
    (see larger bars on each axis or column in Fig. 11). These results suggest case
    studies have mostly taken a catchment-level focus instead of a regional, national,
    or even global scale, which are also common in the broader groundwater modelling
    literature (e.g., Gleeson et al., 2012, Scanlon et al., 2023, Wada and Bierkens,
    2014). We believe this might be partially due to computational limitations of
    the coupled architectures, and the complexities associated with accessing, designing,
    and further calibrating and validating larger GWMs. Download : Download high-res

    Other) and time (transient or other, and time-step used). Note ribbons are coloured
    based on the treatment of space (third column). In terms of the temporal dimension,
    the reviewed corpus reveals a clear tendency towards the development and use of
    transient GWMs (53 articles or 88% of the corpus, see Fig. 10). Among the Other
    category, the dynamic response of the aquifer has been captured in several ways.
    For instance, Hybrid GWMs have deployed transient physical GWMs to train an ANN
    (e.g., Elhamian et al., 2022), while Data-driven GWMs have relied either on time-series
    data of piezometers (Anbari et al., 2021) or reported groundwater use in time
    (Phetheet et al., 2021). In terms of temporal resolution, we evidenced a considerable
    variability, with 11, 17, and 9 studies relying on daily, monthly, or yearly time-steps
    respectively, while the rest of transient models (16 articles) relying on temporal
    resolutions in between these values (see right column on Fig. 10). We believe
    this variability might respond to the variety of modelling purposes and research
    questions being addressed by scholars, the specific characteristics of the systems,
    computational efficiency, and data availability. Download : Download high-res

    Not Clear or N.C.), the size of the cell (in ), and the total geographical area
    or extent covered by the model (in ). Note ribbons are coloured based on this
    last column (total geographical extent) to display the spatial scale of the study.
    In terms of spatial considerations in ABMs, the majority of the corpus reviewed
    (78%) defined an explicit spatial environment to simulate the positions and movements
    of agents. The spatial dimension thus takes a prominent role in the dynamics of
    these coupled GW-ABM, as the spatial relationships of agents determine their interactions
    and decision-making processes. This feature, however, has been represented in
    various ways. Overall, most of the studies (53%) used grids, which divide the
    spatial environment into cells. We believe this choice is partially influenced
    by the ease of integrating real-world GIS data – as demonstrated by 27% articles
    that integrated geographical maps or satellite imagery – and the consistency this
    design offers with distributed GWMs as a direct linkage can take place between
    the cells of the ABM and the GWM (and vice-versa). However, the choice of grid
    size can significantly affect both computational run-time and simulation outcomes
    (e.g., Jaxa-Rozen et al., 2019). In the corpus we only detected 2 studies (3%)
    that have allowed agents to move freely within a continuous space, by locating
    their agents through a coordinate system ( ) (Bithell and Brasington, 2009, Noël
    and Cai, 2017). Remarkably, 20 studies used a network-based representation, although
    mostly in conjunction with other representation of space (14 articles). These
    networks were used to represent the social relationships between agents (e.g.,
    Castilla-Rho et al., 2019, Darbandsari et al., 2020, De Bruijn et al., 2023, García
    et al., 2019, Mauser and Prasch, 2016, Nouri et al., 2022a), or the buyer-seller
    connections in a formal or informal water market (e.g., Aghaie et al., 2021, Bolton
    and Berglund, 2023). Those studies that relied exclusively on a network to represent
    space (6 studies), deployed either a spatially-explicit node-link distribution
    system (see Avisse et al., 2020, Kuhn et al., 2016, Lachaut et al., 2022, Yoon
    et al., 2021), or a spatially-implicit social network approach (see Moradikian
    et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2023). From the toolkits available for the development
    of ABMs (Abar et al., 2017), scholars have mostly relied on NetLogo, followed
    by Python – through packages such as Mesa (Kazil et al., 2020), Honeybees (De
    Bruijn et al., 2023), and Pynsim (Knox et al., 2018) – and Java (see Fig. 12-A).
    We found similar results over groundwater modelling software (see Fig. 12-B),
    with the physically-based MODFLOW model being the most commonly employed (34%
    of the corpus), followed by NetLogo (mostly through the FlowLogo environment developed
    by Castilla-Rho et al., 2015), and Python (mostly through the FloPy package developed
    by Bakker et al., 2016). These results also highlight a prevalent use of open-source
    over proprietary software in the development of both GWMs and ABMs, accounting
    for 77% and 70% of the corpus respectively (see pie charts in Fig. 12). This trend
    towards open-source is substantiated by various software linkages, such as between
    NetLogo and MODFLOW (Jaxa-Rozen et al., 2019), NetLogo and Python (Jaxa-Rozen
    and Kwakkel, 2018), and Python and MODFLOW (Bakker et al., 2016). This preference
    for open-source platforms may likely stem from their inherent flexibility (allowing
    to tailor software to specific research needs), cost-effectiveness, and transparency
    (critical for verification and replicability). However, this trend may also signal
    that the field is still in a maturing phase. Download : Download high-res image

    if a study relies on multiple software platforms, each instance is counted separately
    in the bar charts, but the study is classified only once in pie charts. The label
    ‘Not Clear’ includes all studies that do not specify the software used, while
    the ‘Other’ category aggregates software that is used in one study or less. In
    regard to the connection between GWMs and ABMs, our review found that only two
    articles allowed a high degree of interaction and feedback between the models.
    These integrated architectures achieved consistent spatial and temporal alignments,
    and shared a unique set of drivers and internal variables and highlight the technical
    complexity required to align spatio-temporal scales and integrate them cohesively
    (Allain et al., 2018, Martin et al., 2016, Mauser and Prasch, 2016). Not all modelling
    purposes, however, require a completely integrated and holistic modelling framework.
    During our review, GWMs and ABMs were instead predominantly closely/tightly coupled
    (48% of the corpus). In these studies, the spatial consistency was achieved by
    either defining a single grid to simulate both physical and social processes,
    as seen in applications using NetLogo (Aghaie et al., 2020a, Aghaie et al., 2020b,
    Aghaie et al., 2021, Castilla-Rho et al., 2015, Liu and Agusdinata, 2021, Zolfagharipoor
    and Ahmadi, 2021) and CORMAS (Dray et al., 2006, Dray et al., 2007, Moglia et
    al., 2010), or by linking the grid of the GWM to ABM grid in a direct one-to-one
    relationship (e.g., see Du et al., 2020, Du et al., 2022, Streefkerk et al., 2023).
    We also observed a clear trend over the last decade (2013–2023) towards loosely
    coupled GW-ABMs (14 articles out of the total 15 in the corpus). Although this
    type of connection can be computationally expensive (see Castilla-Rho et al.,
    2015 and references therein), its flexible modular design can harness powerful
    specialised models like MODFLOW. 4.5. (C4) representation of groundwater governance
    and policy findings Overall, most of the studies took a policy-oriented focus
    (83% of the corpus), in which the effectiveness, efficiency, and the various strengths,
    weaknesses, and limitations of policies were assessed through carefully designed
    simulations (e.g., Du et al., 2020, Du et al., 2022, Mulligan et al., 2014). By
    acknowledging the diversity of the human response (e.g., groundwater use) and
    the multiple interconnections to the groundwater system (e.g., changes on the
    groundwater table), these studies illustrate the potential of coupled GW-ABM in
    informing policy design and implementation (see Table 4 for details of each groundwater
    policy assessed, and Fig. 13 for the distribution of policies studied in function
    of different agent types). For instance, in the design of a groundwater tax, Mulligan
    et al. (2014) showcased how an uniformly applied tax tends to yield sub-optimal
    outcomes both economically and environmentally when tested against a more realistic
    population that includes heterogeneous, short-term-focused, and self-interested
    individuals. Similarly, Du et al. (2020) demonstrated that local hydrological
    conditions (closeness to a stream and depth to groundwater table) can significantly
    affect the performance of a groundwater tax, generating non-linear relationships
    that highlight the need for spatially varied and temporally dynamic policies.
    In a subsequent study, they showed it is feasible to adjust a groundwater tax
    over time (i.e., changing from wet to dry years) and across space (i.e., set differently
    between irrigation districts) to improve hydrological outcomes without adversely
    reducing the total water supply (Du et al., 2022) The simulation of the enforcement
    of water rules by official or unofficial parties, and the resulting compliance
    response of individual water users, has also been explicitly simulated in various
    studies (22% of the corpus). This regulatory issue has been mostly examined in
    relation to the over-extraction of groundwater with respect to defined extraction
    limits (e.g., water rights, water permits, or water allocations). For instance,
    in Kuhn et al. (2016), agricultural agents’ water use was regulated through non-tradable
    water permits that defined the individual allowed abstractions and a Water Allocation
    Plan (WAP) that limited these based on lake water levels. In Castilla-Rho et al.,
    2017, Castilla-Rho et al., 2019, a groundwater constrained system (i.e., allocations
    set as 20% of farmers’ needs) was explored across four levels of regulatory enforcement
    that varied the proportion of monitored farmer agents (10% or 50%) and fine magnitudes
    (10% or 90% of farmers’ profits), over three case studies. Interestingly, in their
    model both a random monitoring style and a risk-based audit system were assessed,
    showing that an increase in the proportion of farmers inspected did not lead to
    substantial increases in compliance. Further, random monitoring proved to be more
    effective at dissuading illegal behaviour than targeted monitoring in all the
    case studies assessed. In a follow-up study Rojas et al. (2022) parameterised
    the same behavioural model (Castilla-Rho et al., 2019) to the Copiapó River Basin
    in Chile, and coupled it to a hydrological model to explore farmers’ compliance
    response against imposed caps on groundwater allocations. In this case study,
    simulation results showed that at least 20% of the groundwater users have to be
    monitored if a cap on groundwater extraction was imposed by the regulator. Aghaie
    et al. (2020b) further expanded the original farmers’ behavioural model by Castilla-Rho
    et al. (2017) (Groundwater Commons Game) to include and simulate a market institution
    that, beyond monitoring, enforcement, and defining the yearly caps over water
    permits, also operated a double-auction groundwater market by pairing buyers-sellers,
    and a water buyback program from the government. By analysing different scenarios
    of monitoring level, they found that the appropriate monitoring and enforcement
    settings can lead to the emergence of a social norm that is enough to discourage
    violation and can bring about a functioning market. Similarly, Nouri et al. (2022b)
    developed a coupled GW-ABM in which agricultural agents were able to over-extract
    groundwater based on their knowledge of the aquifer level and the behaviour of
    their peers. Various regulator agents, on the other end, were simulated to determine
    water rights, and penalise farmers in proportion to the magnitude of their over-exploitation.
    In a follow-up study, Nouri et al. (2022a) showed that when a groundwater cap
    or water trade is included along with a penalty policy, total over-extraction
    increases, as farmer agents tend to take more profit by behaving selfishly and
    trading the over-extracted groundwater volume. Download : Download high-res image

    environmental conservation). 2 Water Market Simulation of the trading of water-related

    groundwater, recharged rainwater, etc.). 9 Water Reallocation Transfer of water
    allocations between different users, often requiring adjustments to legal rights
    or permits. 2 Water Supply Enhancement Measures aimed to increase the available
    water supply for diverse uses (e.g., construction of wastewater treatment facilities,
    or desalination plants). 11 Water Tax Simulation of a groundwater tax (i.e., resource
    fee) that individuals need to pay for each unit of groundwater. 4 Well Placement
    Interventions that change the location and spacing of wells for groundwater extraction.
    2 Lastly, in Du et al., 2020, Du et al., 2022, the cost of groundwater use is
    based on a groundwater tax (price for each unit of groundwater), pumping costs
    (a function of pumping lift), and a penalty fee whenever the aquifer is under
    over-exploitation conditions (that is, the water table decline exceeds an imposed
    limit). Farmer agents rely exclusively on an economic optimisation approach to
    select the most economic water source to irrigate their crops. Their model assumes
    the monitoring of every pumping well in the basin, and the enforcement of policies
    by each regional manager, has no cost. 4.6. (C5) methodological challenges in
    model development In this section, we present findings related to different aspects
    of the ‘Evaludation’ framework as described on Section 3.3.6. i. Model Output
    Verification: Overall, the majority of GWMs reviewed have undergone calibration
    (33 studies or 55% of the corpus), and mostly through automated methodologies
    (23 studies or 70% of the calibrated GWMs) like PEST (Doherty, 2018a, Doherty,
    2018b), rather than iterative manual trial-and-error procedures (3 studies or
    9% of the calibrated GWMs, see Fig. 14). In contrast, most ABMs in the corpus
    lacked a documented ‘calibration’ step (28 studies or 47% of the corpus). Among
    the 23 studies that described a ‘calibration’ process, we found 10 applications
    of the inverse modelling approach (Allain et al., 2018, Darbandsari et al., 2020,
    Kuhn et al., 2016, Lachaut et al., 2022, Martin et al., 2016, Nouri et al., 2019,
    Nouri et al., 2022b, Nouri et al., 2022a, Yoon et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2023).
    Interestingly, 4 studies adopted a Pattern-Oriented approach (García et al., 2019,
    Liu and Agusdinata, 2021, Noël and Cai, 2017, Topping et al., 2012), while 2 made
    use of Participatory workshops for calibration purposes, including developing
    and populating Bayesian cognitive maps for agents (Pope and Gimblett, 2015) and
    calibrating the bidding behaviour of farmer agents in a water market (Straton
    et al., 2009). It is worth noting that surveys (e.g., Al-Amin et al., 2018, Srinivasan
    et al., 2013) and semi-structured questionnaires (e.g., Castilla-Rho et al., 2019,
    Rojas et al., 2022, Streefkerk et al., 2023) have also been used to parameterise
    the initial populations of artificial agents. ii. Model Output Corroboration:
    A total of 27 GWMs (45% of the corpus, see Fig. 15-A) compared simulated with
    observed empirical data (e.g., heads or flows), synthesising results mostly through
    statistical metrics (e.g., RMAE, MAE, Nash-Sutclife coefficient, etc.). Interestingly,
    while the vast majority of these GWMs were grounded in physical processes (23
    studies), 30 physical GWMs did not perform any model output corroboration, which
    suggests there still remains a gap in practice. Download : Download high-res image

    displaying the relative frequency of co-occurrence of model output verification
    efforts over the GWM (see middle categories), and ABM (see right side categories)
    of each study. The left side axis presents the type of methodology used, that
    is, either manual regularisation, or automated (i.e., mathematically performed
    through algorithms). The label ‘Not Clear’ includes all models (GWMs or ABMs)
    where it is not possible to identify how this process takes place nor its results,
    while the category ‘Not mentioned’ groups all models were the term ‘calibration’
    is not mentioned. In a teal-coloured circle we highlight the number of articles
    that performed model output verification on both the ABM and the GWM. In terms
    of ABMs, we found 20 studies (33% of the corpus) explicitly addressing and explaining
    a validation process. Scholars have used a variety of different and complementary
    methods, which included (see Fig. 15-B): (1) Structural Validation (Manson, 2002),
    (2) Extreme and Sensitivity Tests, (3) Participatory Modelling, (4) Pattern-Oriented
    Modelling (Grimm et al., 2005), and (5) Empirical Output Validation (North and
    Macal, 2007, Rand and Rust, 2011). Structural validation, i.e., the process of
    ensuring realism in the conceptual model by analysing assumptions and simplifications,
    was explicitly mentioned in 3 articles. However, this process reflects a conceptual
    evaluation (Bert et al., 2014) rather than the Model Output Corroboration targeted
    in this section. Similarly, extreme and sensitivity tests give insights into model
    behaviour through designed scenarios, thus aligning better to Model Analysis (see
    Fig. 2). For participatory modelling methods, the studies relied on interviews
    (Giordano et al., 2021, Hu et al., 2017), workshops (Allain et al., 2018, García
    et al., 2019, Martin et al., 2016, Moglia et al., 2010), or computer-assisted
    role-playing games to facilitate dialogue (Dray et al., 2007) with diverse experts,
    stakeholders, and technical advisors. Overall, all these studies reported satisfactory
    results from these interactions, which helped build confidence in the model and
    its results. The comparison of ABMs outputs to real-world empirical data formodel
    output corroboration purposes was performed on a total of 8 studies, and encompasseda
    range of methods to compare predicted versus observed values. For example: García
    et al. (2019) assessed the decrease in the number of active farmers, increase
    in average area operated by active farmers, and rise in the number of farms and
    total area operated by tenants through qualitative comparisons; Castilla-Rho et
    al., 2017, Castilla-Rho et al., 2019 used statistical measures (mean, interquartile
    ranges) to compare simulated compliance on water restrictions against observed
    statistics from survey data; Liu and Agusdinata (2021) used qualitative methods
    to compare trends and patterns in simulated social stress against the actual timeline
    of mobilisation events documented in ethnographic studies; Avisse et al. (2020)
    employed correlation coefficients to compare predicted storage levels against
    remote sensing observations over the 1998–2015 period; Noël and Cai (2017) used
    Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Coefficient of Variation (CV) to compare predicted
    long-term average corn yields against county-level historical corn yields; Yoon
    et al. (2021) fitted an ordinary least squares regression to match water consumption
    outputs for urban and agricultural water users with observed data; Zhang et al.
    (2023) applied the RMSE and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficients to compare
    simulated against historical annual water demand data between 2010 and 2018; Beernink
    et al. (2022) benchmarked model outputs against energy demand monitoring data
    of two buildings. These results attest to a clear commitment to model output corroboration,
    albeit to varying degrees and with different methods, both qualitative and quantitative.
    However, nearly half of the studies did not document any validation efforts, highlighting
    a critical need for enhancement in this area. iii. Model Analysis: Overall, 47%
    of the reviewed studies performed a Sensitivity Analysis (see Fig. 16-A), suggesting
    it is a common practice by modellers of coupled GW-ABMs. This prevalence however
    has only appeared recently, as 71% of these studies were published in the last
    5 years. A total of 13 studies relied on local sampling methods (see the LSA tag
    on the second column of Fig. 16-B) despite its documented limitations (see Ligmann-Zielinska
    et al., 2020, Saltelli et al., 2019). Surprisingly, from the 14 studies that deployed
    a global sampling, 8 preferred a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis,
    through a graphical examination of the response surface. The 6 studies that relied
    on global quantitative indices, used the Sobol (Streefkerk et al., 2023), Morris
    (Allain et al., 2018, Jaxa-Rozen et al., 2019, Martin et al., 2016), Latin-Hypercube
    One-At-a-Time (LH-OAT) (Giri et al., 2018), and Polynomial Chaos Expansion variance-based
    decomposition (Hu et al., 2015b) methods. Download : Download high-res image (315KB)

    model output corroboration on both the ABM and the GWM. B. Pie chart presenting
    the distribution of methodologies used for model output corroboration of ABMs.
    The most commonly examined parameters through SA have been related to the Social
    System under study (see third column on Fig. 16-B) (Bolton and Berglund, 2023,
    Liu and Agusdinata, 2021, Streefkerk et al., 2023, Tamburino et al., 2020). Interestingly,
    in terms of outcomes assessed during the SA, scholars have mostly considered both
    the physical and the social systems during their assessments. For instance, Castilla-Rho
    et al. (2019) quantified the effects of increasing monitoring and enforcement
    powers in a catchment by measuring the evolution of mean groundwater depletion,
    cumulative illegal extractions, the average social properties of the population
    (social norms), and overall compliance. Hu et al. (2015b) measured both crop profits
    and total groundwater depletion. Allain et al. (2018) and Martin et al. (2016)
    measured various performance metrics of the physical system (e.g., percolation
    and shallow aquifers content) and of the social system (e.g., daily farmers work
    and crop yields). Khan and Brown (2019) measured farmers’ gains from trading,
    their pumping costs, and the proportion of streamflow violations (i.e., when modelled
    flow falls below target levels in specific cells). These examples demonstrate
    that the coupled GW-ABM methodology can facilitate the identification of critical
    factors that can determine the behaviour and sustainability of a groundwater system,
    and which may exist in the physical system, the social system, or in the dynamic
    interconnections between the two. From the three defined purposes of SA (Factor
    Prioritisation and Screening, Model Building, and Model Exploration, see Fig.
    16-A), most of the studies aimed to explore the dynamic model responses to specified
    variations in a group of input parameters (e.g., Bolton and Berglund, 2023, Feuillette
    et al., 2003, Khan and Brown, 2019). Remarkably, in a total of 7 studies the SA
    was used to guide model development (see Model Building category on Fig. 16-A),
    whereas in 6 studies the SA was used to determine the most or least significant
    input(s) (see Factor Prioritisation and Screening label on Fig. 16-A). These results
    highlight the positive impact of performing SA to increase a GW-ABM model’s credibility
    and reliability. iv. Model Documentation: From the 58 studies reviewed after the
    creation of the ODD in 2006, only 10 fully-used any version of the protocol, while
    6 used the ODD D extension recommended for effectively describing human decision-making
    (Müller et al., 2013). Reviewing these articles’ structures, underlying assumptions,
    theoretical foundations, and the robustness and scopes of their results, was a
    vastly easier task compared to the rest of the corpus, and as such we emphasise
    the critical importance of adopting a common language during model documentation
    efforts. On the other hand, 7 studies used the ODD for guiding the model description
    in the article, but did not deliver the complete protocol (namely, partially-used
    category), while the majority (41 articles) did not use nor mention the protocol
    at all (namely, not-used category). Interestingly, to share their model documentations
    and software, scholars have relied on various platforms such as the COMSES OpenABM
    community-of-practice repository (see Castilla-Rho et al., 2015, Castilla-Rho
    et al., 2019, Mehryar et al., 2019), the HydroShare platform (Khan and Brown,
    2019), the GitHub distribution software (Bakarji et al., 2017, Castilla-Rho et
    al., 2015, De Bruijn et al., 2023, Jaxa-Rozen et al., 2019, Phetheet et al., 2021),
    and other external digital repositories (Avisse et al., 2020, Yoon et al., 2021).
    As with the ODD, however, none of these have received substantial adoption. Download

    5. Discussion In this section we re-examine and critically evaluate the progress
    that the coupled GW-ABM methodology has achieved in tackling each of the challenges
    discussed in Section 2. We highlight current successful strategies, identify gaps
    or unresolved issues, suggest promising directions for future research, and discuss
    the broader implications for policy. Table 5 synthesises this discussion through
    a set of key messages for scholars, practitioners, decision-makers, and stakeholders
    interested in developing and applying coupled GW-ABMs for studying and managing
    groundwater systems. Table 5. Summary of gaps ( ), recommendations (further classified
    as methodological or implementation-focused ), and future research areas ( ) for
    advancing coupled GW-ABMs across challenges. Recommendations and future research
    directions are indented to indicate their association with specific gaps. Challenges
    Gaps , Recommendations , and Future Research Directions C1 Representation of human
    behaviour : Lack of guidance on the rationale for behavioural theory selection
    (why), identification of appropriate contexts (when), and determination of suitable
    application methods (how).  : Adopt the “Human Behaviour - Cognition in Context”
    (HuB-CC) framework (Constantino et al., 2021) for the design, testing, and implementation
    of theoretically robust virtual agents within groundwater systems. C2 Diversity
    of human behaviour and temporal aspects a: Lack of detailed behavioural data to
    represent social heterogeneity.  : Employ the inverse approach (Epstein, 2023)
    to find agents’ specifications and behaviours that can generate specific macro-level
    targets (e.g., patterns, trends, or desirable future outcomes). : Incorporating
    adaptive and learning mechanisms into individual agents remains a challenge, especially
    at the institutional or management level, where applications are notably limited.  :
    Explore the use of artificial intelligence and data science techniques to enable
    agents to learn and adapt.  : Integrate the Institutional Grammar approach to
    GW-ABMs to capture the emergence and dynamics of institutions (e.g., through the
    MAIA framework (Ghorbani et al., 2013)). C3 Two-way feedback loops : Lack of coupled
    GW-ABMs operating at large spatial scales (e.g., multiple catchments or countries,
    up to continents or global-scale).  : Use the Telecoupling framework to develop
    Tele-coupled GW-ABMs.  : Develop and couple a mesh-free Analytic Element Groundwater
    Model to an ABM.  : Generate a tightly coupled GW-ABM using the MODFLOW API. C4
    Representation of groundwater governance and policy findings : While the wider
    regulatory scholarship has developed multiple theories and approaches, a unified
    strategy for ensuring compliance and enforcement is still lacking (Black and Baldwin,
    2010, Gunningham, 2011). The absence of consensus becomes even more problematic
    in the realm of groundwater regulation, where these theories remain also largely
    unexplored and untested (Holley et al., 2020).  : Harness interdisciplinary insights
    from the broader regulatory scholarship to develop a comprehensive framework that
    models the compliance behaviour of water users, and facilitates the simulation
    and evaluation of alternative enforcement strategies employed by regulatory agencies.  :
    Adequately plan and document who (which groups of stakeholders) needs to be involved
    in which steps of the model development and use process, to what extent (level
    of involvement) and how (see useful guidelines on Voinov et al., 2016, Voinov
    et al., 2018). C5 Methodological challenges in model development : In case of
    re-using an existing GWM, critically assess and document the rationale for its
    validity in the context of the new GW-ABM study, specifying any recalibration
    efforts undertaken to ensure the model is fit-for-purpose. a: In situations of
    data scarcity, make use of the Pattern Oriented Modelling framework for inverse
    calibration over known patterns. : Develop guidelines or adopt existing ones for
    Model Output Corroboration (e.g., Troost et al., 2023). : Use global instead of
    local sampling techniques for SA. Document key design decisions, including the
    rationale behind the selection of minimum sampling size and methods for ensuring
    variance stability. Critically assess the adoption of existing systematic frameworks
    for SA (e.g., Borgonovo et al., 2022, Ligmann-Zielinska et al., 2020). : Adopt
    a combined TRACE-ODD D approach for Model Documentation, and make the source code
    of the model available. a The lack of empirical data is transversal to all challenges,
    and as such we highlight it with this symbol. 5.1. (C1) representation of human
    behaviour Our review reveals a growing trend towards the simulation of ‘bounded
    rational’ agents, which more faithfully replicate the complexities of human reasoning
    compared to the purely rational behaviour that is typical of most traditional
    frameworks. However, we found only a few studies that utilise established behavioural
    theories, or that explicitly compare different human decision models (Hu et al.,
    2015b, Hu et al., 2017, Hu and Beattie, 2019). This absence of theoretical grounding
    has also been recognised in other reviews of Agent-Based Modelling applications
    (Alam et al., 2022, Groeneveld et al., 2017, Rounsevell et al., 2012, Zhuo and
    Han, 2020). Given that a key advantage of the Agent-Based Modelling approach is
    its capacity to capture and model human behaviour with the necessary level of
    detail (An et al., 2021), the limited use and evaluation of various behavioural
    theories can potentially undermine the ability of ABMs to uncover emergent patterns,
    feedback loops, and cross-scale interactions. These elements may be crucial for
    the development of robust policies and interventions that can effectively manage
    the complexities and uncertainties inherent in human behaviour. Designing and
    executing an ABM rooted in a behavioural theory is a challenging and resource-intensive
    endeavour that demands numerous considerations, especially when faced with the
    limited time and resources common to real-world management scenarios. Schlüter
    et al. (2017) outlines three key issues to consider. Firstly, accurately mirroring
    behavioural processes requires extensive empirical data. Depending on the selected
    theory, this might encompass spatially-distributed demographic information such
    as socio-economic status, dynamic environmental data such as land and water use,
    and attitudinal metrics capturing preferences, attitudes, and beliefs. Secondly,
    it calls for a multidisciplinary approach, given theories about human behaviour
    are scattered across various specialised domains (e.g., psychology, anthropology,
    political sciences, economics, etc.). Thirdly, theories are often not complete,
    requiring tailored conceptualisations and modelling assumptions when translated
    into computer code for specific problems and applications. This process might
    also entail making explicit assumptions about processes and mechanisms to establish
    clear causal relationships driving human decision-making. Drawing from our own
    experience in developing GW-ABMs, we have pinpointed a crucial impediment in achieving
    a theoretically robust representation of human behaviour within these models.
    Despite various scholars conducting reviews of modelling approaches and techniques
    for simulating human behaviour at diverse decision-making scales (e.g., Kwon and
    Silva, 2020, Müller-Hansen et al., 2017), guidance remains scarce on the rationale
    for theory selection (why), identification of appropriate contexts (when), and
    determination of suitable application methods (how). The Modelling Human Behavior
    (MoHuB) framework (Schlüter et al., 2017) was conceived to address these issues,
    but falls short in capturing dynamic processes and the broader social and biophysical
    context that may sway agents’ decision-making within groundwater systems. To fill
    this gap, a refined version — the Human Behaviour - Cognition in Context framework
    (HuB-CC) — was developed. Grounded in cognitive psychology, HuB-CC aims to encapsulate
    essential features and processes that underlie perception, judgement, and decision-making
    (Constantino et al., 2021). Within the realm of GW-ABMs, the HuB-CC framework
    offers a promising structured approach to ground agents’ decisions on the substantial
    body of theoretical knowledge on human behaviour, thereby addressing critical
    gaps in theory selection and contextual application. By mapping 31 theories from
    behavioural and social sciences to decision-making elements, the framework serves
    as a gateway for more nuanced, theoretically-grounded models in resource management.
    As an illustration, consider a modelling scenario that aims to simulate farmers’
    decisions about groundwater extraction within the confines of regulated quotas
    and a shared resource. Using the mapping proposed by HuB-CC, we can identify a
    suite of theories that encapsulate critical and relevant aspects to this modelling
    scenario, such as Habitual Behaviour (Graybiel, 2008), Embodied Cognition (Wilson,
    2002), Choice Architecture (Johnson et al., 2012), Trust and Reciprocity (Berg
    et al., 1995), Reinforcement Learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998), Social Norms (Bicchieri,
    2005), Attention Restoration Theory (Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989), Affordance Theory
    (Gibson, 1979), Selective Attention (Posner and Petersen, 1990), Psychological
    Risk Dimensions (Fischhoff et al., 1978), and Prospect Theory (Kahneman and Tversky,
    1979). To facilitate the framework’s practical application, we have linked the
    database by Constantino et al. (2021) with current applications in GW-ABMs (see
    Table 6). By doing so, we hope to set the stage for the design, testing, and implementation
    of theoretically robust virtual agents within Agent-Based Models. Table 6. Mapping
    of theories to reviewed GW-ABMs. The first column sorts theories into four classes
    based on how they deviate from traditional rational choice theory: acknowledging
    cognitive constraints, recognising multiple goals, accounting for learning, or

    the structural and conceptual guidelines of the initial framework. 5.2. (C2) diversity
    of human behaviour and temporal aspects Results from this review revealed significant
    advancements in incorporating and simulating social heterogeneity in coupled GW-ABMs,
    as studies predominantly opted to simulate each single individual instead of relying
    on spatial aggregations (see Fig. 8), and also multiple agent types rather than
    a single uniform type (see Fig. 9). These studies, however, also showed that collecting
    the detailed behavioural data required to populate ABMs is still a significant
    challenge. All ABMs examined in this review have followed what is referred to
    as the forward approach (Epstein and Axtell, 1996), where carefully handcrafted
    agents (the micro) are created to represent real-world entities (such as farmers
    or households) and their behaviours (such as water use decisions). These agents
    are then placed within an environment (the groundwater system/aquifer) where they
    interact and make decisions based on specified rules. Researchers then study how
    these agents affect the coupled system (the macro) by exploring its dynamic response
    through relevant performance metrics (e.g., groundwater drawdowns). While insightful,
    this approach poses a significant challenge when data about individual behaviours
    are scarce or incomplete. To address this limitation, the inverse or backward
    problem emerges as a promising approach (Epstein, 2023). Here, the macro-level
    targets are first defined — including patterns, trends, and desirable future outcomes,
    informed or not by empirical data. Then the agents’ behaviours, often guided by
    theory, are allowed to evolve within an evolutionary framework such as genetic
    programming (Gunaratne et al., 2023, Vu et al., 2023). This model discovery process
    results in a rich landscape of possible agents’ behaviours that can generate the
    selected macro-level targets. During our examination of the human diversity challenge,
    we emphasised the essential role that learning and adaptation play in evolving
    individuals’ decisions in response to changing circumstances (e.g., weather, policies,
    social interactions, etc.), and thus steering the dynamics of a groundwater system.
    Accordingly, we analysed whether these dynamic processes have been explicitly
    simulated in coupled GW-ABMs to date, and documented the techniques used by scholars.
    Results indicated a tendency towards the explicit inclusion of learning and adaptation
    mechanisms within GW-ABMs. However, the multitude of methods used to program these
    mechanisms highlights the continuing challenge of including these aspects (Kiel
    et al., 2021, Filatova et al., 2013). To bridge this gap, promising avenues for
    future research are coming from artificial intelligence and data science, such
    as the use of reinforcement learning and convolutional neural networks to equip
    agents with the intelligence of self-learning their behaviour rules directly from
    data (An et al., 2023). We also uncovered that only a few studies have introduced
    management-level agents capable of adapting their policies during a simulation,
    particularly in response to droughts and local hydraulic properties (Du et al.,
    2020, Du et al., 2022). This focus on institutional adaptation is noteworthy because
    Agent-Based Modelling scholarship has often overlooked the role of regulators
    and management institutions (Lippe et al., 2019). Adaptation at this level, however,
    has been advocated for more than a decade, and is at the forefront of modern water
    resources management approaches such as Adaptive Water Management (Pahl-Wostl,
    2006, Pahl-Wostl et al., 2012, Schoeman et al., 2014, Varady et al., 2016) and
    Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) (Haasnoot et al., 2013). To facilitate
    the adoption of management-level adaptation, we propose leveraging the well-established
    Institutional Grammar approach (Crawford and Ostrom, 1995), which decomposes institutions
    into five key elements: Attributes, Deontic, aIm, Conditions, and Or else (ADICO).
    This approach has been refined over the last four decades (Dunlop et al., 2019),
    and has gained significant traction in the Agent-Based Modelling community (Ebenhöh
    and Pahl-Wostl, 2008, Frantz et al., 2016, Ghorbani and Bravo, 2016, Ghorbani
    et al., 2017, Powers et al., 2018, Smajgl et al., 2008), especially for formalising
    institutions related to Common Pool Resource problems (Pitt et al., 2012, Lewis
    and Ekart, 2017, Kurka and Pitt, 2017). The MAIA meta-model framework (Ghorbani
    et al., 2013) builds upon this approach to systematically incorporate institutions
    into ABMs, as demonstrated in recent flood risk management models (Abebe et al.,
    2019). These developments underscore the untapped potential of integrating Institutional
    Grammar into GW-ABMs, a sentiment echoed in recent literature reviews for ABMs
    (Siddiki et al., 2022). By doing so, we can develop more comprehensive policy
    scenarios and explore how institutions evolve within the systems they influence
    (Ghorbani, 2022). Lastly, given the differences between learning and adaptation
    are not universally agreed upon in the literature, future research could expand
    the scope and depth of this review by reviewing each concept separately 5.3. (C3)
    two-way feedback loops Our results showcased a prevalent use of 3D physically-based
    distributed and transient GWMs, along with a grid-based and GIS-backed social
    space in the ABMs. In other words, to date, coupled GW-ABMs have relied on an
    accurately simulated aquifer which dynamically and spatially heterogeneously responds
    to the action of geographically-placed agents, steering their decisions and interactions.
    Although these findings reveal technical and capable models, there are in our
    view exciting future research directions that can bring novel insights into the
    interconnections between groundwater and social systems. Firstly, critical policy
    issues such as climate change, water and food security, operate at spatial scales
    larger than catchments, spanning multiple distant regions in an increasingly interconnected
    world. While there has been a proliferation of continental to global scale studies
    of groundwater systems during the last decade (Gleeson et al., 2020), these studies
    often incorporate human impacts into global hydrological models using a water
    balance approach rather than directly simulating groundwater fluxes and heads
    (Condon et al., 2021). A coupled GW-ABM offers several advantages over this traditional
    approach given its flexible design (Heppenstall et al., 2021), that cater to a
    holistic understanding of the interplay between social and groundwater systems,
    and thus have been proposed in the field of global hydrology (Bierkens, 2015).
    GW-ABMs operating on a large spatial scale (defined for simplicity as above 100.000
    ), however, are exceptionally rare. We believe the absence of coupled GW-ABMs
    operating at large scales can be partially explained by current methodological
    challenges, including model parameterisation demands, uncertainty quantification,
    and the taxing computational costs of such endeavours (Heppenstall et al., 2021,
    Manson et al., 2020). A promising way forward to overcome these challenges has
    emerged in the broader Sustainability Sciences under the tele-coupling framework
    (Kapsar et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2013). This framework provides a hierarchical
    model and a common terminology to identify and understand distant (i.e., “tele”)
    interactions in and among systems. The framework has been used and advocated for
    both water resources (Yang et al., 2016) and groundwater management (Luetkemeier
    et al., 2021), and has been adapted for an Agent-Based Modelling architecture
    (Dou et al., 2020), followed by calls for a new generation of Telecoupled ABMs
    in a recent article (An et al., 2021). By connecting multiple GW-ABMs, it becomes
    possible to simulate, for instance, how water extraction decisions by farmers
    (agents) in one region (sending system) impact the groundwater levels and agricultural
    practices in another region (receiving system), mediated by trade, policies, technology
    transfer, and climatic influences (flows). This telecoupled model would directly
    capture the underlying motivations and interactions of agents (causes) and the
    broader socio-economic and hydrological impacts (effects) within and beyond the
    two main systems (i.e., spillover systems). By gradually expanding the spatial
    scale under a coherent conceptual framework, tele-coupled GW-ABMs can enable an
    integrated analysis of how human decisions, grounded in localised contexts, can
    reverberate through the intricate web of interconnections that link distant groundwater
    systems. Secondly, GWMs are complex tools that demand high levels of data for
    proper characterisation and obtaining reliable predictions for scenario analysis.
    Alternatives to these complex and data-demanding physically-based groundwater
    models are possible by using Analytic Element Groundwater Models (AEGWMs) (Strack
    and Haitjema, 1981a, Strack and Haitjema, 1981b). In our review, we did not detect
    any use of the AEGWMs, despite current advancements in open-source libraries that
    would facilitate the coupling with ABMs (see Bakker and Kelson, 2009). AEGWMs
    come with advantages and disadvantages (Bakker and Strack, 2003, Bakker, 2006,
    Bakker, 2013a, Bakker, 2013b, Fitts et al., 2015, McLane, 2012). For example,
    AEGWMs are known for their computational efficiency and flexibility, precise representation
    of complex hydrogeological features without the need for a computational grid,
    and can handle problems with an infinite or semi-infinite domain. On the downside,
    AEGWMs struggle with non-linear problems (e.g., unsaturated and density-dependent
    flow) and may not be suitable for problems where aquifer heterogeneity is relevant.
    Considering these disadvantages, coupling an ABM with an AEGWM can therefore offer
    several opportunities including: a less computationally demanding coupled model,
    making it more feasible for large-scale or long-term simulations; the absence
    of a restrictive mesh or grid, which can be advantageous when working with ABMs
    that often require to represent complex spatial interactions between agents. However,
    it is important to note that the coupling of ABMs and AEGWMs can also present
    challenges, such as the need for extensive data, the complexity of model integration,
    and potential issues with model output corroboration and uncertainty. Thirdly,
    the rapidly evolving landscape of groundwater modelling opens multiple avenues
    for the future development of coupled GW-ABMs. From the untapped potential of
    versatile software, such as COMSOL Multiphysics (Li et al., 2009), to novel machine
    learning techniques and methods applied to simulate groundwater dynamics (Hussein
    et al., 2020, Tao et al., 2022). Notably, an Application Programming Interface
    (API) has been recently introduced for MODFLOW (Hughes et al., 2022), the prevalent
    software used by developers of GW-ABMs, which allows for direct interaction with
    this program without the need to alter its source code. For many existing MODFLOW
    coupling applications, the data provided to MODFLOW needs to be updated multiple
    times within a single time step which in our experience severely impacts memory
    usage and model run times. This makes the MODFLOW API a powerful tool for socio-hydrologists
    and other professionals who need to model groundwater flow and integrate these
    models with ABMs. Interfacing an ABM with a GWM using the MODFLOW API presents
    both advantages and challenges. On the advantage side, the API allows for a seamless
    integration of the two models, enabling the ABM to interact with the GWM in real-time
    and adjust variables without modifying the source code. This can lead to more
    accurate and dynamic simulations of complex systems, where human actions and groundwater
    responses interact. However, there are also challenges associated with this approach.
    The integration of two complex models can be computationally intensive and may
    require significant technical skill and computational resources. Furthermore,
    the process of interfacing the models can be complex, requiring a deep understanding
    of both the ABM and GWM, as well as the MODFLOW API itself. Additionally, the
    need to update information multiple times within a single time step, as required
    by many MODFLOW coupling applications, can add another layer of complexity and
    computational overhead to the modelling process. Despite these challenges, the
    potential benefits of a tightly coupled ABM and GWM, facilitated by the MODFLOW
    API, can offer significant research opportunities. 5.4. (C4) representation of
    groundwater governance and policy findings Groundwater sustainability challenges
    can be traced back to the decisions and behaviours of autonomous agents (An et
    al., 2021). Through computational experimentation of possible alternative futures,
    simulation models provide a pathway to explore the outcomes of different policies
    and thus inform resource management efforts (Gilbert et al., 2018, Squazzoni et
    al., 2020). However, traditional simulation tools are often not prepared to represent
    the diverse set of groundwater regulations and the hierarchy of groups and institutions
    that support and/or enforce them. To understand the progress of coupled GW-ABMs
    towards facing this challenge, we concurrently reviewed and documented which policies
    have been evaluated to date, and whether the compliance behaviour of individuals
    and the role of enforcement have been represented. Remarkably, our review revealed
    a prevalent policy-oriented focus of coupled GW-ABMs (83% of the corpus), and
    a landscape filled with examples of policy evaluations (see Fig. 13), which show
    what happens when we move outside the realm of simplistic models and assumptions
    to capture complex phenomena. Inspired by these efforts, we identify various gaps
    and areas for future research. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) comprise a wide
    and growing range of methods aimed to support active management of groundwater
    resources at the local and basin level (Bouwer, 2002). MAR systems have had a
    remarkable growth in applications in the past 60 years given its potential to
    replenish over-allocated and restore brackish aquifers, and even enable energy
    recovery (Dillon et al., 2019). As a demand-side management strategy, MAR systems
    rely on the actions of individuals for their success. With legislation now allowing
    individuals to bank treated storm-water or wastewater, and to also market the
    resulting credits (Lall et al., 2020), it becomes an interesting area of future
    research to critically assess the circumstances which favour the adoption of these
    practices, and the overall effect of the human component on their success in restoring
    or maintaining groundwater sustainability and quality (e.g., see the study of
    Bolton and Berglund (2023) assessed in this review). The pressing issue of anthropogenic
    groundwater contamination demands an understanding of both the intricate physical
    processes involved (flow and transport of contaminants), and the social drivers
    that underpin this degradation, including the values, norms, and decisions of
    water users. In this context, we anticipate a growing trend in the application
    of coupled GW-ABMs to simulate the role of farmers (e.g., decisions about the
    application of fertilisers, pesticides, hormones, antibiotics, and steroids consumed
    by livestock), households (e.g., usage of treated and untreated wastewater, septic
    systems, and other land treatment of solid and liquid wastes), and commercial/industrial
    (e.g., discharge or injection of a wide range of chemicals into groundwater) water
    users (Lall et al., 2020). These applications also hold promise for coastal aquifers,
    where the intricate saltwater intrusion processes add another layer of complexity
    to the transport of contaminants from land-based sources, placing them at more
    risk (Elshall et al., 2022). The enforcement of groundwater rules and regulations
    is seen as a cornerstone component of effective groundwater governance systems
    (Closas and Villholth, 2020, Rodella et al., 2023), with compliance serving as
    an essential pillar in sustaining any policy effort (Felbab-Brown, 2017, Rouillard
    et al., 2022). While our review revealed the explicit simulation of water users
    compliance behaviours and dynamic responses to enforcement (e.g., see Castilla-Rho
    et al., 2017), there remains a noticeable gap in understanding the role and the
    effects of the hierarchy of institutions and enforcement strategies in achieving
    compliance, which resonates with findings of previous research (e.g., see Kaiser
    et al., 2020, Lippe et al., 2019) and emphasises the need for focused exploration
    in this area. Notably, this gap is also reflected in the wider regulatory scholarship
    on compliance and enforcement, where numerous proposals have been put forth to
    address a key challenge faced by regulatory agencies: how to intervene in the
    affairs of regulated enterprises to foster compliance, such as graduated, responsive,
    smart, meta, and risk-based regulation (Black, 2010a, Black, 2010b, Coglianese,
    2017, Gunningham, 2010). Furthermore, there has also been a significant progress
    in understanding the motivations of regulated entities to comply (Parker and Nielsen,
    2011, Parker and Nielsen, 2017, Parker, 2021), and in particular with groundwater
    allocations (Holley et al., 2020). This situation presents a timely opportunity
    for coupled GW-ABMs to synthesise interdisciplinary knowledge, establish a robust
    behavioural framework for simulating water users, and computationally experiment
    and test the efficacy of competing regulatory strategies. Indeed, the widespread
    failure to comply with enacted groundwater legislation in many countries, along
    with inadequate enforcement power (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations, 2016), makes the insights from these analyses particularly valuable.
    A GW-ABM, for example, can help elucidate who (water user type), where (geographical
    location), when (such as during dry or wet periods), and why (motives) complies
    or not with a given groundwater policy, and reveal the aggregated effect on the
    sustainability of the underlying groundwater system. The complexity of grounding
    the behaviours and attributes of virtual agents in conceptual theories, however,
    underscores the need for active collaboration with stakeholders throughout the
    modelling process. Building on this, our review revealed that many studies have
    actively involved stakeholders during model development (16 studies), aligning
    with the growing momentum and agreement on stakeholder integration in managing
    challenges related to surface water (Carr et al., 2012), groundwater (Elshall
    et al., 2022, Hynds et al., 2018, Simpson and De Loë, 2020), and natural resources
    (see Perrone et al., 2023 and references therein). Certainly, appropriate stakeholder
    participation has been recognised as the most critical piece (Elshall et al.,
    2020) and essential prerequisite (Barthel et al., 2017) for successful groundwater
    management. A view that is endorsed by numerous global organisations (e.g., Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2016, UNESCO and Sánchez,
    2022, UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme, 2023, Rodella et al., 2023, Wijnen
    et al., 2012), and reflected in modern groundwater regulations (e.g., the California
    Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, the EU Water Framework Directive, among
    many others). The benefits of including stakeholders broadly include saliency,
    credibility, and legitimacy (see Elshall et al., 2020 and references therein),
    a shared understanding among diverse participants (social learning and co-learning),
    and a greater adoption in practice (see Baldwin et al., 2012, Basco-Carrera et
    al., 2017 and references therein). These benefits extend also to integrated modelling
    efforts (Voinov et al., 2020), and resonate with calls within the Agent-Based
    Modelling community for extensive collaboration between public stakeholders and
    academic scholars to co-design models (Squazzoni et al., 2020). Thus, we urge
    practitioners to adequately plan and document who (which groups of stakeholders)
    needs to be involved in which steps of the model development and use process,
    to what extent (level of involvement) and how (see useful guidelines on Voinov
    et al., 2016, Voinov et al., 2018). Lastly, since our review did not evaluated
    the quality of the participatory processes or their outcomes, future research
    could explore these areas. For instance, by using the framework developed by Basco-Carrera
    et al. (2017), which provides a systematic way to choose a participatory approach
    based on a ladder of participation levels, different types of cooperation, and
    other relevant factors. 5.5. (C5) methodological challenges in model development
    In the Introduction section we highlighted several methodological issues that
    coupled GW-ABMs face, which determine their quality and credibility. Then, in
    the Methods section we proposed and adopted the ‘Evaludation’ framework as an
    integrative approach under which to group and consider these issues, and subsequently
    defined and reviewed four of its six elements. Now, we weave key results from
    this assessment to highlight gaps and present future research directions under
    each of these elements. i. Model Output Verification: Calibrating the GWMs is
    a necessary step (Poeter and Hill, 1997), especially in the face of limited data,
    which can amplify the uncertainty in model predictions (Zhou et al., 2014). Our
    review revealed that while distributed numerical GWMs are widely used, only 54%
    of them have undergone calibration. Furthermore, in many coupled GW-ABMs, the
    employed GWM originated from prior research. If the original GWM was designed
    for a different objective, however, a re-calibration could be essential before
    integrating it with an ABM. Yet, our review found only one study acknowledging
    this limitation (see García et al., 2019). This gap may be attributed to the substantial
    resources required for a re-calibration exercise. Thus, it is paramount that modellers
    critically assess and document the reasons why the re-use of an existing GWM is
    valid for coupling it with an ABM. The lack of individual-level behavioural data,
    compounded by the taxing and complex resulting GW-ABM coupled architectures, creates
    substantial difficulties for performing rigorous parameterisation (An et al.,
    2021), especially if both systems (physical and social) are targeted jointly (note
    only 12 studies performed these on both, as highlighted on Fig. 14). In line with
    previous reviews of ABMs (Thiele et al., 2014), we also found an overall low adoption
    of model output verification efforts. However, given coupled GW-ABMs are gaining
    traction in regulatory and legal contexts, the importance of these efforts cannot
    be overstated (Bair and Metheny, 2011). To address these challenges, we recommend
    that future modellers explore and harness the established Pattern Oriented Modelling
    framework. When used for model output verification, each pattern can act as a
    selective filter for parameter values, discarding those that do not generate the
    observed phenomena according to selected criteria (Grimm and Railsback, 2012).
    In the context of a GW-ABM, these patterns may relate to physical or social aspects.
    By focusing on and accurately reproducing multiple tangible and recognisable patterns,
    this approach can enhance the robustness and reliability of GW-ABMs, thereby facilitating
    their acceptance and adoption by decision-makers (Topping et al., 2012). ii. Model
    Output Corroboration: ABMs attempt to model complex social systems for which there
    is usually no independent data against which to compare selected model outputs
    to assert validation (Kiel et al., 2021). This difficulty has led to a heated
    debate and multiple re-definitions of what is required from a model to be deemed
    credible and fit-for-purpose, and how to achieve this milestone for different
    modelling purposes (e.g., see An et al., 2021, Heppenstall et al., 2021, Sargent,
    2013, Troost et al., 2023). To provide relevant insights while navigating this
    complex and contentious issue (Heckbert et al., 2010), we focused our review towards
    (1) understanding what ABM ‘validation’ means to modellers, and (2) capturing
    the current techniques used, including the matching of simulation to empirical
    data (included in the model output corroboration element of the ‘Evaludation’
    framework). Interestingly, our results showed that various interdependent approaches
    are being used altogether, targeting both conceptual and empirical aspects, which
    aligns with previous recommendations (e.g., see Bert et al., 2014, Daly et al.,
    2022). The methodological diversity uncovered by our review, featuring different
    approaches applied in various combinations and to varying degrees, suggests an
    absence of standard guidelines for selecting suitable methods pertinent to a specific
    context or modelling purpose. Hence, an encouraging research direction to help
    progress the validity, credibility, and uptake of GW-ABMs could lie in the development
    of such standards for model output corroboration. In this vein, a promising framework
    was recently introduced by Troost et al. (2023), aimed to assist modellers in
    making appropriate choices during simulation analysis and to substantiate them
    with sound reasoning. Their “Keep It Adequate” (KIA) framework consists of 12
    questions that (i) define the modelling context, (ii) argue the adequate selection
    of models and methods for model inference and uncertainty documentation, and (iii)
    properly derive and interpret simulation results and their uncertainty. Policy-oriented
    coupled GW-ABMs, in particular, might derive significant benefits from adopting
    frameworks like KIA, as it offers a structured approach that promotes transparency,
    fosters trust, and ensures models are tailored to the policy context. Careful
    evaluation and discretion should be exercised however when implementing this framework,
    particularly in budget-constrained scenarios, as its detailed structure might
    result in a time-consuming and resource-intensive modelling process. A critical
    issue that has been highlighted, for instance, in the traditional ODD protocol
    (Grimm et al., 2020). iii. Model Analysis: Most of the GW-ABMs assessed in this
    review aimed to simulate and assess the performance of a policy using SA results
    as a key input to aid in decision-making. However, we detected a lack of methodological
    transparency with respect to the SA. For instance, critical design decisions,
    such as the selection of the minimum sampling size and variance stability (Lee
    et al., 2015), that are known to determine the resulting sensitivity assessment
    (Haghnegahdar et al., 2017, Razavi et al., 2021), were not clearly explained.
    Furthermore, our review revealed widespread use of Local sampling methods.While
    these might provide a fast initial exploration, they are less effective in systems
    exhibiting non-linear behaviour and interactions, characteristics typical in ABMs.
    Such techniques generally underestimate uncertainty and incorrectly estimate sensitivities,
    issues that are compounded by the lack of robust numerical methods and unrealistic
    model formulations (Kavetski and Clark, 2011), ultimately compromising the reliability,
    robustness, and credibility of the model results (Saltelli et al., 2019). Given
    the crucial role SA plays in supporting policy and decision-making processes (Razavi
    et al., 2021), we recommend modellers to use the vast range of existing global
    SA techniques, such as variance-based (e.g., Sobol, 2001, Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity
    Test (FAST) Cukier et al., 1973, Random Balance Designs Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity
    Test Tarantola et al., 2006, etc.), derivative-based (e.g., Morris Morris, 1991,
    Distributed Evaluation of Local Sensitivity Analysis (DELSA) Rakovec et al., 2014,
    Derivative-based Global Sensitivity Measures Sobol’ and Kucherenko, 2009, etc.),
    density-based (e.g., Delta Plischke et al., 2013, PAWN Pianosi and Wagener, 2015,
    etc.), variogram-based (Razavi and Gupta, 2016a, Razavi and Gupta, 2016b, Razavi
    et al., 2019), among others. As to the lack of common methodological practices
    for conducting sensitivity analyses over coupled GW-ABMs, rather than pushing
    for a standardisation that might overshadow the need for flexibility of each modelling
    effort, we instead refer interested readers to some of the systematic frameworks
    that have been recently developed for ABMs, such as the six-step methodology proposed
    by Borgonovo et al. (2022) and the mixed-method approach proposed by Ligmann-Zielinska
    et al. (2020). In our review, we consciously chose not to engage in a detailed
    exploration of how uncertainty permeates the modelling process of a GW-ABM, and
    its influence on the process of communicating the model and its results to the
    broader community. This decision stemmed from the expansive and complex nature
    of such an analysis, which would extend beyond the intended scope of our current
    work. However, we recognise that addressing uncertainty is crucial in the development
    and application of GW-ABMs. Thus, future research should focus on a systematic
    exploration of these uncertainties, the challenges they present, and their implications.
    Notably, while groundwater modelling has a rich tradition of uncertainty analysis
    with tools like PEST (Doherty, 2018a, Doherty, 2018b) and DAKOTA (Dalbey et al.,
    2020), such practices are less common in ABMs, possibly due to limited empirical
    data on individual-level human behaviours (Heppenstall et al., 2021), as indicated
    by our findings (see the transversal gap in Table 5). This gap underscores the
    potential for significant advancements in integrating uncertainty quantification
    and analysis into GW-ABMs, paving the way for more robust and reliable models.
    iv. Model Documentation: The absence of universally accepted standards for model
    documentation can make coupled GW-ABMs difficult to maintain, improve, and reuse
    (Daly et al., 2022, Voinov et al., 2020). Adequate documentation of the model’s
    structure and analysis plays a pivotal role in promoting transparency, facilitating
    communication, and enabling proper evaluation and reuse, all recognised bottleneck
    problems within the Agent-Based Modelling community (An et al., 2020, An et al.,
    2021). In our review, we examined the methods that modellers have employed to
    document their models across the different stages of the modelling cycle, and
    focused on the current uptake of the ODD protocol. Our findings revealed a lack
    of common documentation standards, with researchers employing various tools (e.g.,
    HydroShare and OpenABM) to different extents. Interestingly, the adoption of the
    ODD protocol among GW-ABM practitioners was strikingly higher than in the broader
    Agent-Based Modelling field — 29% over the 9.9% reported by Daly et al. (2022)
    — which suggests a growing acceptance of this documentation approach. Building
    on the insights of this review and our own hands-on experience developing coupled
    GW-ABMs, we have identified various promising methodological directions that can
    instil a consistent and effective documentation culture that spans all the stages
    of the iterative modelling cycle. Firstly, we urge practitioners to produce a
    TRACE document (Daly et al., 2022, Schulze et al., 2017), which provides a comprehensive
    and standard format for documenting all the major elements of model development,
    testing, and use (Augusiak et al., 2014, Grimm et al., 2014, Schmolke et al.,
    2010). To communicate the Model description element of TRACE, we advise modellers
    to adopt the refined ODD D protocol, which includes a rigorous basis (theoretical
    and empirical) for the selection of the human decision-making model (Müller et
    al., 2013). The adoption of this unified approach would not only promote transparency
    but also streamline good modelling practices within the field. Given the complexity
    and the resource-intensive nature of the implementation of these protocols, we
    anticipate this might result in substantial barriers to newcomers. Considering
    however its benefits we go as far as to suggest that publishers establish this
    combined TRACE-ODD D as a prerequisite for publication of future coupled GW-ABMs.
    Secondly, in line with the FAIR Principles for Research Software initiative (Chue
    Hong et al., 2022, Janssen, 2017, Janssen et al., 2020, Wilkinson et al., 2016),
    we recommend to make the source code of the model available. This can be published
    in community-of-practice repositories (e.g., CoMSES OpenABM, HydroShare, etc.)
    or through free-distribution platforms (e.g., GitHub or BitBucket). 6. Conclusions
    Groundwater sustainability hinges on the decisions and behaviours of autonomous
    agents (An et al., 2021, Vörösmarty et al., 2013). The complexity in groundwater
    management arises from several factors: the uncertainty of human behaviour (C1);
    a heterogeneous social system comprising various water users and stakeholders
    (C2); intricate bidirectional feedback loops connecting social systems to groundwater
    dynamics (C3); and the multifaceted nature of groundwater regulations and the
    hierarchy of groups and institutions that enforces them (C4). Historically, computational
    and simulation models have aimed to guide policy development to steer groundwater
    systems towards sustainable trajectories. These methods, however, often fall short
    in addressing these challenges, leading to ‘unintended consequences’ (Merton,
    1936), interventions that ‘backfire’ (Hammond, 2015), and the subsequent impacts
    on the social, economic, and environmental systems that critically depend on groundwater
    resources. In this research, we present the first comprehensive and critical review
    of the state of knowledge of coupling Agent-Based Groundwater Models to study
    and manage linked human-groundwater systems. Our review unearthed key findings
    across the aforementioned challenges. We identified a crucial obstacle to achieving
    a theoretically robust depiction of human behaviour (C1), and suggested adopting
    the “Human Behaviour - Cognition in Context” (HuB-CC) framework (Constantino et
    al., 2021) for the design, testing, and implementation of virtual agents within
    groundwater systems. To address data scarcity issues for populating social system
    heterogeneity (C2), we proposed using Epstein (2023) backward method. This approach
    aims to find families of agents that are able to grow specified macro-level targets.
    We also highlighted promising avenues to capture critical feedback loops between
    groundwater and social systems (C3), such as the development of tele-coupled GW-ABMs,
    and GW-ABMs using Analytic Elements GWMs as well as the MODFLOW API. Our review
    also exposed a prevalent policy-oriented focus of GW-ABMs (C4), and a landscape
    filled with policy evaluations that illustrate the effects of stepping beyond
    the realm of simplistic models and frameworks. In order to thrust future GW-ABMs
    to the highest standards of model development, transparency, and rigour for replicability
    and reusability, we offer a set of methodological recommendations favouring the
    use of global sensitivity analysis and model documentation following a combination
    of the TRACE and ODD D protocols. We further provide promising avenues for future
    research for model output verification based on the established Pattern Oriented
    Modelling framework, and for GW-ABMs corroboration using the KIA framework for
    coupled model validation. In a world where groundwater resources are increasingly
    strained by competing demands, climate change, and human interventions, the development
    of coupled GW-ABMs emerge as a critical tool for unravelling the drivers of groundwater
    sustainability and crafting more effective responses to this urgent issue. By
    integrating human behaviour with hydrological dynamics, GW-ABMs offer a comprehensive
    framework for modelling complex socio-hydrological systems. Through our review,
    we identify challenges, gaps and delineate a compelling agenda for future research,
    in the hope of inspiring readers to explore and harness this methodology and contribute
    to the sustainable management of our groundwater resources. CRediT authorship

  description: Coastal wetlands provide a range of ecosystem services, yet they are
    currently under threat from global change impacts. Thus, their monitoring and
    assessment is vital for evaluating their status, extent and distribution. Remote
    sensing provides an excellent tool for evaluating coastal ecosystems, whether
    with small-scale studies using drones or national-/regional-/global-scale studies
    using satellite-derived data. This study used a fine-scale plant community classification
    of coastal meadows in Estonia derived from a multispectral camera on board unoccupied
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) to calculate the plant fractional cover (PFC) in Sentinel-2
    MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) sensor grids. A random forest (RF) algorithm was
    trained and tested with vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from the spectral
    bands extracted from the MSI sensor to predict the PFC. Additional RF models were
    trained and tested after adding a digital elevation model (DEM). After comparing
    the models, results show that using DEM with VIs can increase the prediction accuracy
    of PFC up to 2 times (R2 58%-70%). This suggests the use of ancillary data such
    as DEM to improve the prediction of empirical machine learning models, providing
    an appropriate approach to upscale local studies to wider areas for management
    and conservation purposes.

    coastal wetlands provide a wide range of ecosystem services including flood and
    wave attenuation (Möller et al., 2014), estuarine filtration (Celis-Hernandez
    et al., 2022; de Lacerda et al., 2022), biodiversity maintenance (Sutton-Grier
    and Sandifer, 2019), and climate mitigation through carbon sequestration and storage
    (Martinetto et al., 2023; Maxwell et al., 2023). However, these ecosystems are
    under threat from a range of stressors including climate change (Ward et al.,
    2016b; Mafi-Gholami et al., 2019; Ward, 2020), pollution (Celis-Hernandez et al.,
    2020; Li et al., 2021) and direct losses through conversion to other land uses
    (de Lacerda et al., 2021). Boreal Baltic coastal meadows support a diverse mosaic
    of plant communities (Burnside et al., 2007), each supporting a range of ecosystem
    services (Villoslada Peciña et al., 2019) and biodiversity, largely controlled
    by the microtopography (Ward et al., 2015), providing a range of habitats for
    groups including arthropods, amphibians and waders (Rhymer et al., 2010; Rannap
    et al., 2016; Torma et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to be able to map
    the extent and distribution of these plant communities (Ward et al., 2013; Villoslada
    et al., 2020). Remote sensing techniques are increasingly used to map the distribution
    of coastal meadow plant communities (Villoslada et al., 2020; Martínez Prentice
    et al., 2021) and to estimate biomass and sward structure using unoccupied aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) (Villoslada Peciña et al., 2021). The very high spatial resolutions
    supplied by UAV-borne sensors also allow fine-grained ecosystem properties to
    be unveiled, which otherwise remain concealed under the coarse spatial resolution
    of satellites, such as plant fractional cover, soil organic carbon or aboveground
    biomass (Heil et al., 2022). In addition, near-real-time monitoring routines and
    the avoidance of the effect of clouds are among the advantages of UAVs over satellite
    sensors (Colomina and Molina, 2014; Díaz-Delgado et al., 2019). Conversely, the
    disadvantages are not only their limited coverage and battery capacity but also
    the legislation restrictions and their dependency on the weather conditions, as
    well as the requirement to be in the field (Cracknell, 2017; Emilien et al., 2021).
    On the other hand, Earth observation satellites capture images with large swaths
    and a high temporal resolution, which allows the consistent study of large extents
    of ecosystems over multiple years. In the last decade, the idea of combining the
    high spatial resolution derived from UAVs with the large swath and regular revisit
    times of satellites has gained momentum. Some studies have successfully addressed
    the potential upscaling of UAV multispectral images to satellite image resolutions
    in order to address wetland biophysical variables at multiple scales (Laliberte
    et al., 2011; Díaz-Delgado et al., 2019) with UAV as support for ground-truth
    observations. The accurate geometrical and radiometrical overlapping allows UAV
    imagery values to be aggregated into satellite pixel grids (Padró et al., 2018).
    Remotely sensed data in combination with artificial intelligence are essential
    to supply comprehensive assessments of these shifts (Knight et al., 2006; Adam
    et al., 2010; Pettorelli et al., 2014), playing a key role in wetland mapping,
    ecosystem monitoring and trend detection, overcoming some of the difficulties
    of local wetland surveys with traditional in situ field methodologies over large
    area extents, remoteness and inaccessibility (Mahdianpari et al., 2020). As the
    growing impacts of land-use intensification and climate changes become more conspicuous
    and widespread (Findell et al., 2017), local-scale field survey methods may not
    adequately reveal plant community shifts in a spatially explicit manner to study
    spatio-temporal patterns in plant community distribution, environmental monitoring
    and biodiversity conservation. Modelling plant community coverage with remote
    sensing data is one of the main goals in ecological assessments and monitoring
    (Corbane et al., 2015). Combining remotely sensed data with machine learning (ML)
    algorithms shows robust performance due to their ability to deal with non-parametric
    distribution of ground-truth data as well as the multicollinearity of variables
    (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012; Thessen, 2016; Maurya et al., 2021). ML-based
    models are used to predict the presence of vegetation using indices as the input
    for different algorithms (Maurya et al., 2021), and random forest (RF) has been
    shown to be an accurate algorithm to predict plant fractional cover (PFC) over
    large areas (Zhang et al., 2019; De Simone et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2020). Moreover,
    ancillary data such as digital elevation models (DEM) interpolated from light
    detection and ranging (lidar) point clouds have been successfully used for mapping
    plant communities in coastal wetlands (Ward et al., 2013) together with multispectral
    data from remote sensing platforms. This combination provides an enhancement on
    the detection of new plant distribution patterns (Okolie and Smit, 2022). The
    present study compared two PFC models of five plant communities in Estonian coastal
    meadows from vegetation indices (VIs) calculated with Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral
    Instrument (MSI) sensor and ancillary data from a DEM. High-resolution UAV imagery
    was used as the reference for PFC within the spatial resolution of a Sentinel-2
    image. The main objectives were to (1) quantify the relationship between UAV imagery
    and MSI imagery values, (2) predict and test ML models to predict individual PFC
    per plant community with VIs derived from Sentinel-2 spectral values, and (3)
    build and test the performance of the models by adding DEM data to the VIs. To
    improve the article''s readability, we have included a list of abbreviations in
    Appendix B. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study areas Six coastal meadow study sites
    located in protected areas on the west coast of Estonia were selected for this
    study: Kudani (KUD), Tahu North (TAN) and Tahu South (TAS) belong to the Silma
    Nature Reserve; Rälby (RAL) and Rumpo (RMP) to the Vormsi Landscape Protection
    Area; and Matsalu (MAT) to the Matsalu National Park (Fig. 1). These landscapes
    are characterized by coastal meadows extended over a gradual transition from the
    sea to terrestrial ecosystems with a low variation of topography, typically 0
    to 2 m above mean sea level (Ward et al., 2016a). Sites were chosen based on their
    near-continuous management history, high conservation value for wading birds and
    presence of endangered plant species (Rannap et al., 2004; Berg et al., 2012).
    Figure 1Location of the study sites on the west coast of Estonia: Matsalu (MAT),
    Tahu South (TAS), Tahu North (TAN), Kudani (KUD), Rälby (RAL) and Rumpo (RMP).
    The black square shows the Sentinel-2 tile footprint, whereas the extent of all
    the study areas is in red. The plant communities under study are typical of Estonian
    coastal meadows and have been previously grouped following a phytosociological
    classification by Burnside et al. (2007): lower shore (LS), open pioneer (OP),
    upper shore (US), tall grassland (TG) and reed swamp (RS). This classification
    has been used in various studies in these coastal meadows, and the plant communities
    have proven to be differentiable from high-resolution images (ca. 10 cm per pixel)
    (Ward et al., 2013; Villoslada et al., 2020; Martínez Prentice et al., 2021).
    The distribution of plant communities shows site-specific patterns due to local
    variations in the inundation levels and flood frequencies (Rivis et al., 2016),
    sediment accretion, microtopography (Ward et al., 2016a) and grazing regimes (Berg
    et al., 2012). Figure A1 in Appendix A shows the plant community distribution
    in relation to elevation in a boxplot. Floods depend mostly on the meteorological
    conditions across the North Atlantic and Fennoscandia (Kont et al., 2003), and
    the maximum level is reached in April after the snow melts. This is followed by
    the growing season, which is characterized by the maximum plant activity occurring
    from May until September. During this period, plant communities rely on mean temperatures
    above 10 °C (Paal, 1998). Table 1 provides a distribution description of each
    plant community in this study. Table 1Summary of the description of plant communities

    shore (US), tall grassland (TG) and reed swamp (RS). Download Print Version |
    Download XLSX 2.2 UAV classification data A classification of the plant communities
    from high-resolution images (Martínez Prentice et al., 2021) was used as training/validation.
    A multispectral Parrot Sequoia (PS) camera was carried on board an eBee fixed-wing
    drone controlled remotely with the software SenseFly eMotion (Parrot S.A. Paris)
    over the six study areas at an altitude of 120 m to obtain a ground sample distance
    of 10 cm. The UAV flights were conducted during the dates corresponding to the
    growing season, carefully chosen to minimize the impact of inundation effects
    (Table 2). Images were radiometrically corrected with Airinov calibration panels
    and a sunshine sensor to produce multi-band orthoimages merged in Pix4D v.4.3.31.
    VIs were calculated based on all the spectral bands (green, red, red edge and
    near-infrared spectral bands) and used as input for two different workflows: a
    pixel-based classification, where the pixels were classified with a random forest
    and K-nearest neighbours'' algorithms, and segmentation for an object-based classification
    with the same algorithms. The highest accuracy was achieved by a random forest
    pixel classification (accuracy and κ greater than 90 % and 0.85, respectively),
    calculated from a confusion matrix constructed using 140 vegetation survey quadrats
    as training samples (Fig. A2), where all the species with coverage above 5 % were
    recorded within the quadrats. A Sokkia GSR2700 ISX differential Global Positioning
    System (dGPS) was used to record the location and elevation of each plant community.
    Plants in OP community were recorded as a result of the low cover of all species
    and predominance of bare ground. Not all plant communities were present in each
    site (Table A1 in Appendix A). Further details of this methodology and results
    can be obtained in Martínez Prentice et al. (2021). 2.3 Satellite imagery Recent
    studies have shown that images taken by light-weight cameras in the visible and
    near-infrared spectrum on board UAVs have a good correlation with satellite images,
    especially with MSI images of Sentinel-2 (Zabala, 2017; Zhu et al., 2021). Thus,
    one Sentinel-2 Level 2A image covering the six study areas (Fig. 1) with the closest
    date to the drone flights was used (Table 2), with an estimated cloud cover of
    19 %. The tile number was T34VFL and its date 24 June 2019. The level 2A was chosen
    because the orthorectified bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance values are comparable
    with PS reflectance (Fawcett et al., 2020). This image product is radiometrically
    corrected by the Payload Data Ground Segment with Sen2Cor algorithm (Main-Knorn
    et al., 2017) and available online via the Copernicus Scientific Data Hub tool
    (Copernicus Hub, 2024). Table 2Drone flight dates for Matsalu (MAT), Tahu South
    (TAS), Tahu North (TAN), Kudani (KUD), Rälby (RAL) and Rumpo (RMP). Download Print
    Version | Download XLSX Band 6 of MSI is in the red-edge region (Table 3) and
    contains valuable information of vegetation, avoiding background reflectance that
    affects wetlands especially (Turpie, 2013). Its spatial resolution is 20 m per
    pixel. To use its reflectance values with the highest spatial resolution corresponding
    to the VNIR bands at 10 m, an enhancement process based on a super-resolution
    method was applied, instead of using a panchromatic band to carry out a pan-sharpening
    since this band does not exist in MSI. The super-resolution algorithm (Brodu,
    2017) is available in the SNAP software (ESA, 2014) and combines the geometric
    and radiometric information of target bands to increase the spatial resolution.

    elevation models DEMs constitute a powerful co-predictor in species distribution
    models, due to the prominent role of elevation in the distribution patterns of
    coastal plant communities (Ward et al., 2013). This holds especially true for
    coastal meadows, characterized by pronounced salinity and moisture gradients due
    to small variations of elevation, called microtopography (Ward et al., 2016a).
    Thus, a high-spatial resolution DEM was included in the models to test whether
    prediction accuracies improved. A lidar-derived DEM was downloaded from Eesti
    Maa-amet (Maa-amet geoportaal, 2018) with a spatial resolution of 1 m. The DEM
    was interpolated from a lidar point cloud of density of 2.1 points per square
    metre using a streaming triangulation (Isenburg et al., 2006). The vertical error
    was calculated with RMSE between in situ elevation points of the DEM (Fig. 2).

    Positioning System (dGPS), Sokkia GSR2700 ISX in each sampled plant community
    and the digital elevation model (DEM). RMSE units are centimetres (cm). Plant
    communities are lower shore (LS), open pioneer (OP), upper shore (US), tall grass
    (TG) and reed swamp (RS). Download 2.5 Image processing and upscaling A key process
    required to perform upscaling of remote sensing images is the aggregation of pixel
    values from a high-resolution image to the geographically coincident pixels of
    a coarser-resolution image. Several studies have performed the aggregation process
    to a common geographical data frame in the form of a quasi-continuous grid, where
    all the spectral data are stored (Padró et al., 2018; Riihimäki et al., 2019;
    Mao et al., 2022; Bergamo et al., 2023). In the present study, the grid was constrained
    to the limits of each study area, avoiding those overlapping with the edges, excluding
    transitional areas that do not correspond to the extent of plant communities of
    interest and submerged areas. In total, 9766 MSI pixels cover the study areas
    (Fig. A3). A band-to-band comparison between the PS bands used for the final classification
    in Martínez Prentice et al. (2021) and MSI reflectance values was undertaken to
    assess the potential differences in both sensors caused by different temporal,
    spectral or spatial resolutions (Padró et al., 2018; Fernández-Guisuraga et al.,
    2018; Jiang et al., 2022; Isgró et al., 2022). To carry out this process, PS and
    MSI reflectance values were transferred into a polygon grid generated with the
    exact cell size as the MSI image pixels covering the study areas with an associated
    unique identifier (ID) for each row of the data frame (Fig. 3). Level 2A MSI reflectance
    values were transferred to each cell of the polygon grid, and the PS values were
    aggregated calculating the average mean (Fig. 3). This approach generalizes the
    reflectance within a unit of grid, reducing noise from high-resolution images
    of PS and resulting in more predictable behaviour (Blan and Butler, 1999). This
    aggregation criterion was also used to integrate the DEM values into the polygon
    grid (Fig. 3). The comparability and consistency of the spectral data from PS
    and MSI bands was analysed by fitting the values in a linear model, calculating
    the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The
    p value shows the significance of the relation between PS and MSI. The PFC was
    the response variable under assessment for each plant community. It was calculated
    by intersecting the UAV-derived classification maps (Martínez Prentice et al.,
    2021) within each polygon grid (MSI pixel) and applying equation 1. All the grids
    sum a total of 1 (100 % PFC). For all the operations, all the pixels completely
    covered by each grid were extracted. Figure 3General workflow. The source data
    are marked as “Input” and the output data frame is DI. The final data frame contains
    the explanatory variables (xn) and response variable (yi) of plant fractional
    cover (PFC), where i = lower shore (LS), open pioneer (OP), upper shore (US),
    tall grass (TG) and reed swamp (RS). Download PFC was calculated within each MSI
    pixel in the main data frame after an overlay process of the classification and
    MSI pixel extents. Equation (1) was applied to each plant community of study.
    All processes were carried out using the open-source Python packages NumPy (Harris
    et al., 2020), GeoPandas (Jordahl et al., 2020) and Rasterio (Gillies, 2013).
    2.6 Vegetation indices VIs are quantitative and dimensionless mathematical combinations
    of spectral bands, related to vegetation structural properties (Lima-Cueto et
    al., 2019). VIs have been used to monitor vegetation cover by the enhancement
    of spectral contrast between photosynthetically active vegetation and other components
    (Andreatta et al., 2022). In this study, these band combinations may unveil vegetation
    patterns related to different levels of flooding and phenological activity, even
    though the flight dates correspond to the growing season and water presence was
    at its lowest in the study areas (Table 2). Because of variations in the amount
    of bare ground within each plant community (Table 1), VIs are also used for their
    sensitiveness to this type of ground cover. In total, 14 VIs were calculated (Table
    4) from all the MSI bands of this study. The red edge MSI band was included in
    the calculations of VIs because its reflectances show the highest photosynthetical
    activity and, thus, better differentiation between plant communities (Schuster
    et al., 2012; Turpie, 2013). The indices in Table 4 were calculated by combining
    the features in the data frame (Fig. 3) using the Pandas Python package (McKinney,
    2010). Table 4List of 14 vegetation indices used as explanatory variables in this
    study. G: green band; R: red band; Rre: red edge band; NIR: near-infrared band.
    Download Print Version | Download XLSX 2.7 Machine learning models A ML algorithm
    was chosen to build each PFC model because this approach has been successfully
    used in various ecological applications with remote sensing data (Olden et al.,
    2008; Thessen, 2016). More specifically, the RF algorithm is widely accepted because
    of its high performance in modelling species occurrence and distribution with
    remote sensing data without making assumptions of data distribution (Evans et
    al., 2011; Shiferaw et al., 2019; Valavi et al., 2021). This algorithm was chosen
    to build 10 regression models. To build the training and test samples, a stratified
    sampling from the initial data frame (DI, Fig. 3) was carried out. There were
    two tails in the data distribution of PFC, showing a clear imbalance towards the
    lack of distribution or absence of plant communities and a complete distribution
    of plant communities, typically happening in ecological data (Tang et al., 2023).
    To account for it, the values of PFC were grouped in four bins created for this
    purpose ([0–25), [25–50), [50–75) and [75–100]). Then, an under-sampling strategy
    was done by randomly reducing the number of values in each bin to match the number
    of values in the minority bin (Table 5). This procedure balanced the distribution
    of PFC values across bins, avoiding potential overfitting in the models that could
    result from learning more skewed bins while still capturing the entire dataset''s
    variability. Table 5Balanced training dataset per plant community with the number
    of training rows considered in each bin and the proportion of all the bins in
    relation to the number of all Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) pixels
    (9766). Plant communities are lower shore (LS), open pioneer (OP), upper shore
    (US), tall grass (TG) and reed swamp (RS). Download Print Version | Download XLSX
    Two models were built for each plant community (LS, OP, US, TG and RS) from the
    sampled data frame (DF0, Fig. 4): one trained with the list of 14 VIs as explanatory
    variables (data frame 1, DF1, Fig. 4) and the other one adding the DEM to the
    explanatory variables (data frame 2, DF2, Fig. 4). Figure 4Diagram of the two
    training datasets used for the random forest (RF) models per plant community.
    DF0 is the sampled dataset after the under-sample strategy. DF1 has the same structure
    as DF0 except the DEM variable (xn−1), and DF2 has all the explanatory variables
    (xn). yi is the response variable (plant fractional cover, PFC), where i = lower
    shore (LS), open pioneer (OP), upper shore (US), tall grass (TG) and reed swamp
    (RS). DF1 and DF2 have the same samples (rows), matching the unique identifier
    (ID) column derived from DF0. Download A fraction of 80 % was used to train the
    RF regression models with DF1 and DF2 (Fig. 4). A grid search cross-validation
    strategy was implemented to search for the best hyperparameters and tune a RF
    model (Fig. 5). This method iterates through a grid of predefined hyperparameters
    and tests the results with a 10-fold cross validation (Fig. 5). The hyperparameters
    used to carry out the grid search approach were the number of estimators (N) and
    maximum features (MFs) used to find the best split to grow each tree in the forest.
    The standard parameters for RF (Probst et al., 2019) were not used in this study
    because preliminary results did not show acceptable R2 and RMSE scores on the
    training dataset. The remaining 20 % of the samples were used to test the trained
    model with the best hyperparameters. Using this approach, training and testing
    dependencies are removed, ensuring the robustness of the final model. In order
    to compare the RF models of plant communities trained with each dataset (DF1 and
    DF2), R2, RMSE and mean bias error (MBE) metrics were reported to quantify deviations
    between actual and predicted PFC. To account for the contribution of VIs and DEM
    in each model, the variable importance was also extracted. Variable importance
    is calculated during the training phase of the model, indicating the relative
    contribution of each single variable to each of the tree''s total impurity reduction
    at each split of a node, meaning that it calculates the importance independently
    (Breiman, 2001). The importance ranges from 0 to 1, and it is calculated as the
    average of importance over all trees, indicating their relative contribution to
    the model accuracy. The models with the best scores were used to predict the relative
    PFC of each plant community over the whole polygon grid (Fig. 5). Since the predicted
    values represent relative PFC within a MSI pixel, they were rescaled to a range
    of 0 to 100 and then validated with the test fraction again to assess the ability
    of RF regression models to predict absolute PFC. The RF models were programmed
    using the package scikit-learn in Python (Pedregosa et al., 2018). Figure 5Machine
    learning algorithm training and testing process. A 10-fold cross validation on
    the training fraction (80 % of the input dataset) was used to search for the best
    hyperparameters for the random forest (RF) model, and the 20 % for test fraction
    was used to test the trained model. The lowest root mean square error (RMSE) in
    the different RF models was used to predict the plant community distribution values
    on the polygon grid. Download 3 Results 3.1 Inter-sensor comparison Figure 6 shows

    MSI sensors do not overlap completely (Table 3), the PS values aggregated by average
    into the MSI pixel show a significant positive correlation as well as low RMSE
    (Fig. 6). Figure 6R2 and RMSE obtained from the linear fitting between bands.

    The grid search cross-validation procedure enabled the selection of the best hyperparameters
    to build RF regression models with the lowest errors, leading to the identification
    of a minimum of 325 N. For models built on DF1, N was 500 except in RS (325) and
    OP (375) and 11 MF considered for the best split. Figure 7 shows the overall results
    of each RF regressor model with the best hyperparameters after the grid search
    in 10-fold cross validation. The models using only the VIs calculated from MSI
    bands (DF1) show a R2 score under 57 % and RMSE above 22 % (units of PFC), resulting
    in a moderate to low prediction capability. Having 48 % of the total samples to
    train, the RF model of the US community performed the worst with DF1, followed
    by TG and LS communities, which also had a greater percentage of samples to train
    the models (29 % and 34 %, respectively, Fig. 7). The models built on DF2 required
    more N, from 400 to 500 and the same MF. These models showed a higher performance,
    where R2 scores increased on average 20 units and RMSE decreased 5 % on average
    (Fig. 7). The best improvement of RF models is in US because the model trained
    and tested with DF2 increased its R2 by 2.15 times (Fig. 7). The highest R2 was
    achieved by the RF model of TG, reaching 70 % after training and testing with
    DF2. Its RMSE decreased the most between models DF1 and DF2, from 27 % to 19 %
    PFC. RF models trained and tested with DF1 and DF2 for LS, OP and RS show the
    lowest differences of R2 and RMSE despite having 34 %, 7 % and 4 % of the samples
    for training and testing. Figure 7R2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) retrieved
    by each random forest (RF) regressor on plant communities. Darker colours correspond
    to the model scores from data frame 2 (DF2), and lighter shades are model scores
    from data frame 1 (DF1). Plant communities are lower shore (LS), open pioneer
    (OP), upper shore (US), tall grass (TG) and reed swamp (RS). Download The prediction
    errors in the RF models show a scattered distribution between the predicted and
    real PFC (Figs. 8 and 9). In general, models tend to overestimate PFC below 50 %
    of the real value and underestimate above it, according to the differences between
    the best fit line of the point distribution and the identity line (perfect prediction).
    This is more evident on the extreme values, around 0 and 100 PFC (Figs. 8 and
    9). These results improved in models on DF2, which showed the best-fit line closer
    to the identity line than those on DF1. The MBE metric indicated that the models
    of LS, US and TG under- and overestimate the same way, either trained with DF1
    or DF2 (Figs. 8 and 9). On the contrary, the models of OP and RS underestimated
    the predicted values mostly and did not show any improvement. The average sum
    of relative PFC values predicted by RF models for each plant community within
    MSI pixels was 137 %. After the validation of rescaled predicted PFC values from
    the best RF models, the RMSE and underestimations increased. The results of these
    validations also show a steep decrease of R2 (Fig. 10). For these reasons, these
    models were not considered to map the PFC over the study areas. Variable importance
    measured by the RF models to split the nodes did not show a common variable used
    in the models built with DF1 (Fig. 11). Conversely, the models trained with DF2
    show the DEM as a common important explanatory variable used to split the nodes,
    except for the model to predict PFC of OP (Fig. 12). The models trained with DF2
    were used to map the distribution of relative PFC in the whole dataset (Fig. 13)
    due to their lower RMSE. Figure 8Prediction errors per plant community derived

    This study is one attempt to model the distribution of five coastal wetland plant
    communities belonging to the formal phytosociological categorization of Burnside
    et al. (2007), using open data from MSI sensor on board Sentinel-2 and the official
    DEM of Estonia. A fine plant community classification within the study areas derived
    from the spectral bands of a PS camera (Martínez Prentice et al., 2021) was the
    reference to calculate the distribution of each plant community. Firstly, the
    spatial aggregation by average mean of the PS images from 10 cm to 10 m gave coherent
    similarities with the values from MSI imagery at Level 2A after finding significant
    relationships between PS and MSI bands with a linear fit (Fig. 6), having an average
    of 33 % of unexplained variance in the relationships. The red and green bands
    in MSI data display weaker linear relationships when compared to the red edge
    and near-infrared bands. This discrepancy can be explained by the lower reflectance
    values in the visible spectrum within MSI, which might be influenced by the presence
    of a mixture of vegetation and water within the pixel. The PS data captured more
    reflectance of bare soil, contributing to higher reflectance values in red and
    green bands. Higher relationships are observed between red edge and near-infrared
    bands from both sensors (Fig. 6). This is because these bands capture strong reflectance
    signals from vegetation. Similar studies compared reflectance values of PS (Díaz-Delgado
    et al., 2019) or another sensor on board UAVs (Padró et al., 2018), with MSI images,
    finding good relationships. Secondly, the RF algorithm used in this study assessed
    the accuracy of non-parametric-based regression models to predict the distribution
    of plant communities, as commonly used in Earth observation studies (Ferreira
    et al., 2022). In the literature, random forest is acknowledged as a robust algorithm
    for plant distribution at large scales (Maxwell et al., 2018; Butler and Sanderson,
    2022), despite the challenges in its interpretability (Simon et al., 2023). RF
    averages the predictions of individual trees, a process that contributes to the
    model''s robustness and ability to generalize; however, it underpredicts samples
    in either of the extremes, contributing to the model''s uncertainties (Kuhn and
    Johnson, 2013). In an effort to enhance the interpretability of the RF models,
    balanced training datasets were employed to encompass the complete spectrum of
    PFC values. The undersampling approach resulted in improved model performances,
    robustness, and generalizations, as evidenced by the minimal discrepancies between
    test and training scores observed during the grid search cross validation. A more
    in-depth examination of inherent model structures, specifically from a hyperparameter
    tuning perspective considering a splitting criterion or averaging functions on
    terminal nodes of each tree in the forest, should be considered. Moreover, constructing
    an exhaustive training dataset from field survey plots equal to the area of S2
    pixels could reduce uncertainties, although it can be time-consuming due to logistic
    issues. The predictions of PFC improved after the fusion of a high-resolution
    DEM (Fig. 7). However, the mixture of reflectance signals included in one MSI
    pixel might have caused the deviations in the predictions (Figs. 8 and 9). Overestimations
    of PFC in the models might be due to the presence of patches where plant communities
    were mown or trampled, thus, retrieving VIs values near bare ground values. Underestimation,
    on the other hand, is due to the mixture of reflectance responses from different
    plant communities within the same spatial distribution of MSI pixels. Martínez
    Prentice et al. (2021) suggest that the presence of disagreement areas is due
    to a mixture of radiances in transitional areas or ecotones. The effect of mixed
    pixels is more significant in these types of transitional areas, as the sensor
    receives a wide range of reflectance signals within the extent of the pixel (Muukkonen
    and Heiskanen, 2007). The models of OP and RS with DF1 and DF2 underestimate PFC
    to a larger degree. The reflectance values retrieved from these plant communities
    are affected by a higher presence of water, reducing the values of VIs due to
    lower reflectance in the near-infrared and red edge spectrum. The decrease of
    RMSE in the models trained with DEM (Fig. 7) suggests that plant communities follow
    the elevation pattern at broader scales corresponding to variations in microtopography
    in the study areas represented by the DEM. The variable importance derived from
    RF models using DF1 and DF2 as shown in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively, shows that
    the models consider the DEM to predict PFC as very important. Similar predictive
    efficiency by a DEM is shown in those generated with the photogrammetric point
    cloud derived from UAVs at a resolution below 10 cm (Villoslada et al., 2020),
    as plant communities are strongly dependent on the variation of elevation represented
    with the DEM, in spite of being aggregated to 10 m. The only model that did not
    show the same importance of a DEM was the RF model of OP, where the green normalized
    difference vegetation index (GNDVI) is the most important index. OP is a type
    of plant community that is distributed over patches with a high proportion of
    moist and bare ground (Bergamo et al., 2022), where the visible part of the spectrum
    (red and green) retrieves greater reflectance values than the far visible part
    of the spectrum (red edge and near infrared). Ward et al. (2013) concluded that
    the presence of OP occurs at similar elevation ranges to TG by predicting with
    a microtopography variable. Building models with the DEM alone does not reach
    the metrics as with the VIs, as these are indicators of different vegetation conditions,
    phenology and structure of plant communities. Despite the consideration of total
    variable importance, VIs are not additive representations of the spectral information
    because they are variables considered in relative terms of importance by the models.
    Therefore, they do not add together and explain PFC more than DEM. The final plant
    community distribution maps match the common patterns recognized by expert knowledge
    in the study areas and the maps shown in Martínez Prentice et al. (2021) at a
    10 cm spatial resolution (Fig. 13). According to these criteria, the PFC maps
    in MAT are the most representative of PFC (Fig. 13). Some plant communities that
    were not identified in most of the study areas (Table A1) are present with high
    PFC values. This is the case of RS because its distribution along the coastline
    shows similar low values of DEM and VIs due to the higher inundation levels of
    brackish water (Table 1). It is largely missing in KUD mostly, as this study area
    is relatively far from the coastline (Fig. 1). The plant community of TG is overestimated
    in TAN and RMP areas where it was not identified, caused by similarities in VIs
    and DEM with other plant communities, which means similar biogeographical factors
    to those in other study areas where it is actually present. The distributions
    of LS, OP and US are mostly correct according to the aforementioned criteria.
    OP presents a similar overestimation as RS of its PFC in RAL area only, for the
    same reason concerning RS. While the fusion of DEM with VIs increases the accuracy
    of RF regression models in predicting relative PFC within MSI pixels, being a
    valuable quantification of individual plant community distribution from Sentinel-2
    images (Fig. 13), they are not suitable to predict the absolute PFC, as they yield
    higher estimation errors (comparison of Figs. 9 and 10). Due to the high deviations
    of predicted relative PFC (average of 137 %), once the values are rescaled, the
    plant communities with low distribution become even lower, thus, giving underestimated
    predictions. Similar prediction errors after rescaling were also noted in Yang
    et al. (2020) using a higher satellite spatial resolution. Our validation was
    done from a fine-scale plant community classification, being a reliable resource
    of an exhaustive vegetation inventory because it reflects the small-scale variations
    and mixed plant communities typical in these coastal wetlands. This study shows
    an acceptable empirical approximation to modelling the distribution of ecosystem
    service-providing units in large-scale images of coastal meadows of Estonia, this
    is, quantifying the prediction accuracy and error of PFC of small sized plant
    communities in heterogeneous ecosystems at a satellite spatial resolution. The
    main advantage of using publicly available data from the Sentinel-2 constellation
    is its short revisit time, provided by the two satellites, Sentinel-2 A and B.
    The methodology provides a rapid assessment of plant communities in a coastal
    ecosystem vulnerable to climate and land use changes using different sources of
    remotely sensed data. Additionally, it is shown that it is possible to reduce
    time and costs associated with multiple UAV flights in different areas to cover
    large extents by the validation of large-scale monitoring studies with open-source
    satellite data such as Sentinel-2 and high-resolution products derived from multispectral
    images taken from UAVs. Upscaling remotely sensed imagery from fine to coarse
    resolution is necessary although challenging. Satellite imagery provides critical
    information of changes needed for improved environmental management and conservation
    decision making at large scales. Considering this, linking UAVs to Earth observation
    satellites offers the opportunity for multiscale studies of environmentally sensitive
    ecosystems such as coastal wetlands. Further work can consider using ancillary
    data as a co-predictor with the aggregated spectral data, such as temperature,
    pluviometry or distance of plant communities from the coast, to improve the prediction
    accuracies, as shown with DEM data in the present work. The supervised learning
    RF algorithm is one of the most robust ML algorithms used for ecosystem and species
    distribution modelling (Pichler and Hartig, 2023); however, other algorithms should
    be explored, such as the soft classification, successfully implemented in Yang
    et al. (2020). Moreover, recent advances in super-resolution methodologies increase
    the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images by 4 times for all bands, at a maximum
    of 2.5 m using artificial intelligence algorithms (Tarasiewicz et al., 2023).
    Finer-scale analysis will be more suitable to study the heterogeneity of plant
    communities such as those in boreal Baltic coastal meadows. 5 Conclusions A multiscale
    synergy approach between UAV and Sentinel-2 MSI was undertaken in this study to
    model the PFC of five plant communities in coastal meadows. Good relationships
    existed between both sensors, which enabled PFC to be modelled using VIs, although
    the fusion of DEM improved the models from 1.2 to 2 times. From this research,
    future studies on coastal meadows using remote sensing from satellites should
    be focused on finding methods to achieve local calibration of the image based
    on values retrieved from UAV-mounted multispectral cameras and, thus, achieve
    stronger synergies between both sensors (Emilien et al, 2021). Due to the high
    repeat time and long duration of data collection, upscaling from UAV to satellite
    imagery provides an excellent resource for monitoring and assessment of the response
    of coastal ecosystems to loss and degradation as a result of climate change or
    other anthropogenic stressors. This will allow land users and managers to appropriately
    assess conservation priorities and implement and monitor responses. Appendix A: Additional

    model and enables the hosting of large programs from consumer, scientific, and
    commercial domains. However, cloud application hosting data centers have enormous
    energy consumption, which leads to high operating expenses and a carbon footprint.

    allocation of resourcesCloud computingEnergy consumption 1. Introduction The prevalence
    of Internet use and the ease with which the public may now access its associated
    facilities have led to a rise in the importance of the technology and items that
    enable Internet users to obtain all the amenities they require (Ismaeel et al.,
    2016, Zhao et al., 2024, Wu et al., 2024). The idea of cloud computing is one
    of the key technologies enabling the Internet, which has significantly advanced
    the idea of facilitating access to Internet-related resources (Hayat et al., 2018,
    Cheng et al., 2024, Liu et al., 2024). Cloud computing offers resources to internet
    users and small and large computer networks so that the network''s hardware and
    software architecture can be utilized to its fullest potential and users can more
    easily access processing resources (Sangaiah et al., 2023, Sun et al., 2020).
    As the cutting edge of technology in computer networks, the cloud is now the only
    technology accessible in vast computer networks that can give the idea of resource
    pools and resource usage based on demand (Xu et al., 2021a, Blbas and Kadir, 2019,
    Xiao and Konak, 2016). Distributed computing and computers are well-known (Rui
    et al., 2021). Actually, a significant advancement in optimization has been made
    possible by the cloud, which offers the ability to execute heavy software for
    a large number of users on the network without requiring a lot of hardware resources.
    Processing resource use has been eliminated (Cao et al., 2022, Kadir, 2021, Zhang
    et al., 2022, Zhao et al., 2023a). Rather from the traditional one-piece view
    of processing resources in the network, the cloud environment allows for a granular
    view of processing resources in the cloud (Wang et al., 2023b, Sakthidasan et
    al., 2021, Zhao et al., 2023b). This makes it possible for multiple users to access
    a shared infrastructure simultaneously, which is a major factor in the cloud''s
    current surge in popularity (Zhao et al., 2023c, Xue et al., 2023, Khosravi et
    al., 2024, Zheng et al., 2023a). Even though the cloud environment allows for
    far better resource consumption optimization than earlier technologies (such as
    grid computing), the large and open cloud ecosystem still necessitates extensive
    planning and the development of novel optimization techniques (Dai et al., 2023,
    Sun et al., 2015, Mao et al., 2022a). In recent times, a significant number of
    computer network researchers have concentrated on cloud task optimization in order
    to contribute to the advancement and enhancement of service delivery within this
    discipline (Jannat et al., 2023, Xu et al., 2021b, Zheng et al., 2023b). Energy
    conservation is one of the main issues facing cloud computing (Song et al., 2022,
    Mou et al., 2023). Regardless of the cooling systems and other accessories deployed
    to keep the cloud servers maintained, the cloud servers themselves account for
    the majority of the energy used in cloud computing (Mao et al., 2022b, Wang et
    al., 2023c). This means that in order to address the issue of lowering cloud energy
    consumption, it is necessary to look at the quantity of active resources in these
    servers as well as the number of open servers in the cloud. As a result, being
    able to maintain fewer processing power and fewer servers in an active state in
    order to fulfill client requests is increasingly closely associated with energy
    conservation in cloud computing. Initially, this may be viewed as an optimization
    problem where the goal is to maintain the smallest number of servers available
    by allocating the requests among the cloud servers in an appropriate manner. The
    primary issue, though, is that optimization needs to be done online at all times
    and the cloud is not an abstraction. As a result, the issue of energy management
    encompasses more than just the initial allocation of requests among cloud servers.
    This research''s primary contribution is the examination of a novel parameter
    that presents challenges for earlier cloud energy management methods. In actuality,
    these characteristics are the customers'' real-time resource availability and
    the cloud''s minimal rejection rate of requests. Because there isn''t enough time
    to execute online optimization, requests cannot be distributed conventionally
    or optimized online. Therefore, by using a new optimization architecture for resource
    management, we focus on the optimization process of energy consumption in this
    research and hope to put it into practice. To do this, two processes forecasting
    and optimization—will be used to create a resource management architecture that
    will reduce energy use in this study. In a nutshell, the researchers'' contributions
    to this study are as follows: • Optimizing the ant colony algorithm and ensuring
    predictability in Neuro-Fuzzy systems to reduce cloud computing''s energy usage.
    Because the net profit is so crucial in cloud resource allocation, it is critical
    to consider cost factors, which are crucial in our case and typically have a direct
    impact on the provider''s overall costs. There are clouds. Therefore, from a scientific
    perspective, we will be able to construct a platform for implementation in the
    practical and commercial environment to the degree that we can give a more optimal
    mechanism for exploiting cost reduction circumstances, even if it is only to the
    amount of simulation. • Preventing request rejections in order to retain clients.
    Aside from the energy consumption topic that was covered in detail above, one
    of the other components of competing in the market that focuses on the cloud economy
    is the customer retention debate. More revenue equates to greater profit. Now,
    here''s where it''s crucial to focus on two things: first, avoiding request rejections
    will help customers form a positive impression of the cloud, and second, you don''t
    want to miss out on the chance to turn a profit, which is crucial from both an
    economic and practical standpoint (such as energy consumption). Owns it. The rest
    of the article is organized as follows. Investigations, challenges and solutions
    of previous studies are stated in Section 2. In Section 3, the concepts of fuzzy
    neural networks and its application in the proposed approach are discussed. The
    proposed solution is fully presented in Section 4. In Section 5, evaluation and
    simulation are described, and finally in Section 5, conclusions and future works
    are discussed. 2. Related works In reality, the goal of this effort is to maximize
    resource management in cloud computing by minimizing energy usage. This would
    increase the cloud''s profitability in processing customer requests, allowing
    the cloud provider to be more Offering the top processing services was beneficial
    (Tu and Li, 2020). This can ultimately assist the cloud provider in offering better
    solutions to boost customer service delivery efficiency by taking into account
    other actions taken in addition to the dynamic management and allocation of cloud
    resources (Liu et al., 2023b). However, it is first necessary to review the background
    of the work done in the dynamic allocation of resources in order to be able to
    understand how cloud researchers, and especially researchers who work on the problem
    of resource management in cloud servers, analyze the dynamic allocation of resources
    and provide a solution for it (Li et al., 2018). Naturally, there are many variables
    to consider while attempting to minimize cloud energy usage, but one thing that
    is certain is that, even though equipment efficiency and organization play a role,
    Optimizing cloud energy consumption is crucial. The most essential factor in cloud
    energy consumption is the management of the cloud administrator in terms of virtual
    machine placement, which eventually reduces the number of real servers in cloud
    data centers. One option is the cloud (Khezri et al., 2024). Thus, minimizing
    energy consumption in the cloud is equal to minimizing the number of physical
    servers in the cloud. Accordingly, decreasing the number of active physical servers
    in cloud data centers can be regarded as a measure to reduce energy consumption
    in the cloud in this research. Cloud was aware. Thus, it will be able to lower
    energy usage by attempting to decrease the number of physical servers that are
    now in use. When using threshold-based procedures, threshold values like scaling
    up or down are taken into account for energy consumption if an efficiency requirement
    is taken into account (Xu et al., 2022). Evolutionary techniques for scheduling
    virtual machines depending on energy usage were studied by researchers in (Wang
    et al., 2023a). The goal of the suggested scheduling algorithm in this work includes
    modifying the dynamic voltage scale of processors, which are the functional components
    of cloud servers that consume the greatest amount of energy. Dynamic voltage scheduling,
    or DVS, is the term for this. The evolutionary algorithm is used in this work
    to control the processor''s dynamic voltage timing. Undoubtedly, the suggested
    methodology in this study necessitates a unique formulation to address the issue,
    particularly as it pertains to the intersection operator within the evolutionary
    algorithm. A novel scheduler based on energy usage is introduced in (Huang et
    al., 2024). It predicts how much energy the virtual machine will use and optimizes
    energy consumption accordingly. The main method used in this work to anticipate
    processor energy consumption is to concentrate on intra-processor activities,
    such as processor state changes. This reduces the amount of energy consumed in
    the virtual machine by keeping fewer cores active by anticipating their behavior
    pattern. Additionally, a new scheduling technique for virtual machines based on
    energy usage is provided by (Cao et al., 2020), which sets energy consumption
    limitations with predefined efficiency criteria. Researchers in the field of cloud
    computing have recently performed research that goes beyond the common practice
    of scheduling resource consumption on cloud servers. Instead, they investigate
    resource consumption patterns, which can be leveraged to identify more effective
    and basic strategies for reducing energy consumption displayed. A demand forecasting
    strategy is provided by (Sun et al., 2022), where the forecasting process is used
    to optimize resource usage, which in turn optimizes energy consumption. A number
    of strategies that can be greatly enhanced in the cloud environment by using predictability
    have been examined by (Lu and Osorio, 2022). While forecasting in the cloud to
    reduce energy consumption is not explicitly mentioned in the models presented
    in this work, it should be remembered that optimizing energy consumption is the
    first and most crucial step in the cloud management mechanism. Of course, a closer
    look reveals how these models affect resource consumption optimization, which
    in turn affects energy consumption optimization. In order to reduce operating
    costs associated with energy usage, load forecasting models in the cloud have
    been used to control resource allocation by (Trik et al., 2023). This work presents
    an algorithm to optimize resource allocation and rescaling based on workload prediction
    results. This mechanism can be used to optimize energy consumption and satisfy
    the quality constraints requested by the users for allocation. Cao et al. (2021),
    the reconfiguration of the resource allocation system is discussed using the resource
    demand prediction supervised assets for them. Table 1 presents a comparison of
    the benefits and drawbacks of the earlier approaches that were examined in this
    chapter. Table 1. Review and comparison of previous works in terms of advantages

    is the model used by many fuzzy neural techniques. Naturally, this is not required
    in order to use a learning algorithm on a fuzzy system. Nevertheless, because
    it displays input data, error signals that are utilized to change system parameters,
    and the data flow through the system, it might be useful. The ease with which
    several models can be compared and the obvious visibility of structural variations
    are further benefits. Neural fuzzy systems integrate fuzzy logic''s capacity to
    deal with ambiguity and imprecision with neural networks'' capacity to learn from
    data. These systems are very helpful for simulating intricate systems with ambiguous
    or lacking data. Layered structures of interconnected nodes, or neurons, make
    up neural networks (Cao et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024). Every neuron takes
    in information, uses an activation function to perform a mathematical transformation,
    and then outputs something. Neural networks are capable of learning from data
    and producing predictions through the manipulation of the weights and biases of
    connections among neurons. Furthermore, fuzzy logic makes it possible to express
    and reason with vague or inaccurate data. Fuzzy logic functions on degrees of
    truth, with values ranging from 0 to 1, as opposed to binary (true/false) logic.
    Fuzzy logic models relationships between inputs and outputs using linguistic variables,
    fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rules. The fuzzy rule-based scheduler''s organizational
    structure is displayed in Fig. 1. According to the overall schema of FRBSs (Hai
    et al., 2023), it is composed of four entities: the Fuzzification Interface, the
    Knowledge Base, the Inference Engine, and the Defuzzification Interface. As can
    be seen, the coding schemes are modified based on Juang''s work, and the fuzzy
    system is based on the Mamdani model (Yin et al., 2022). It can be identified
    by a set of guidelines or knowledge representations as well as by the definition
    of some terms related to the reasoning process. A rule Ri is defined by Mamdani
    (Saleh et al., 2023; Kadir and Rahi, 2023) and consists of antecedents and consequents.
    (1) where y is the output variable, and represent fuzzy sets related to feature
    m and output, respectively, each taking into consideration n potential sets, and
    is a system feature (mips,pow,cputil,ualloc,palloc). The subsequent portion represents
    the related broker response, while the conditional portion relates to the conditions
    under which the rule is activated. Every scenario that arises in a system needs
    to be covered by a set of rules in a comprehensive rule base. Three Gaussian membership
    functions (GMFs) are used in the proposed model to design each feature ω. (2)

    every rule and are the two values that describe Ri. The number of features NF
    is set to this value because in this work, we use five distinct inputs to characterize
    the state of the system. The normalized GMFs utilized for each feature are displayed
    in Fig. 2. Three membership functions—which stand for the low, medium, and high
    fuzzy sets define each input feature. Five fuzzy sets represent the fuzzy system''s
    output: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. Decision-making about the
    final product is enabled by the summation of the consequences of the activated
    rules. To find the general output choice for a given system state, the superposition
    of all rules'' output parts is computed. For every feature and every rule, the
    degree of membership is approximate. The final controller output decision is then
    obtained by applying the centroid approach during defuzzification (Jiang et al.,
    2022a, Jiang et al., 2022b, Fang et al., 2023). Our method uses two fuzzy rule
    bases, one for big scale datacenters and one for medium scale datacenters. Download

    Membership functions in Gaussian. This work employs two main algorithms: neural
    fuzzy systems for load prediction and ant colony optimization technique for virtual
    machine movement. Below, their strengths are examined. Fuzzy neural systems merge
    the flexibility of neural networks with the clarity of fuzzy logic, allowing for
    the modeling of intricate and nonlinear connections in data. These systems may
    efficiently combine several information sources, including past workload patterns,
    environmental conditions, and user behavior, to offer precise load projections.
    Fuzzy neural systems have the ability to learn and adjust to varying situations
    throughout time enabling them to offer current load forecasts in real time. Neural
    fuzzy systems facilitate proactive resource allocation and energy management by
    forecasting future task demands with precision. This aids in maximizing server
    usage and reducing energy consumption by efficiently allocating resources to match
    anticipated demand levels. 4. Proposed method In the cloud, several active physical
    computers are typically actively considered to support the requests of the future
    period in order to lessen the likelihood of a brief interruption of service before
    the requests come in. This policy is called pre-preparation policy. This results
    in excessive energy usage and resource waste, but there is more to this problem
    than meets the eye. Over-allocation strategies are typically used as a standard
    solution to this problem. However, this has a penalty just like the traditional
    pre-preparation regulations for the cloud, and because of the cloud''s limited
    resources, it lowers the service''s availability there. Naturally, the primary
    benefit and objective of this policy is to minimize harm to customers. Over-allocation
    refers to a strategy where service providers take on more clients than they ought
    to in order to offer adequate service. Thus, its capacity can support potential
    situational adjustments. On the other hand, this results in a notable rise in
    energy usage as well. Thus, the most crucial step in fact, the primary strategy
    for optimizing energy use in cloud servers is to turn off more servers. To achieve
    this, the most efficient method of scheduling, putting, and even relocating virtual
    machines from low-load physical servers should be used. This will allow the low-load
    servers and the quantity of suboptimal-load servers to be turned off in an effort
    to lower energy usage. Fig. 2 shows the neuro-fuzzy system for load prediction
    combined with the ant colony method for virtual machine movement. Fig. 4 illustrates
    the suggested design for maximizing cloud energy consumption by utilizing Neuro-Fuzzy
    systems'' predictive power. Download : Download high-res image (98KB) Download

    Fig. 4. Architecture of the proposed method. According to the suggested architecture,
    which is summarized in Fig. 4, the cloud manager assumes control of turning on
    or off the new physical servers to obtain the appropriate amount of resources
    to respond to requests after estimating the load for the upcoming round of resource
    allocation. While it may actively respond to client needs, it can also optimize
    energy use to align with cloud operations. A portion of the server space becomes
    empty at the conclusion of the customer''s allotted time for using the rented
    virtual machine; this must be checked at the conclusion of each session to maximize
    the amount of available space. It is also crucial to remember that the cloud may
    occasionally receive enormous demands, which might make it difficult for it to
    obtain the necessary resources in addition to yielding a sizable profit. This
    is because the total capacity of the active physical computers increases, as does
    the total amount of free space, when the new space is released as a result of
    the virtual machines'' completion of their task. The issue, though, is that none
    of these empty spots in various servers can offer enough capacity to support a
    massive machine request. This is referred to as granular capacity, meaning that
    even while there may be a lot of spare capacity overall, there won''t be a single
    area accessible to handle new requests because it will be distributed over many
    servers (Jiang et al., 2022a, Jiang et al., 2022b, Xiao et al., 2023). Usually,
    load balancing algorithms take care of this. These algorithms are typically used
    for controlling and correcting granular free capacity, as well as load distribution
    to prevent overloading and servers failing from overstressing. Since the nature
    of the job in this case differs greatly from that of load balancing algorithms
    and is limited to managing and correcting the granular space, resource usage is
    not optimized. Instead, virtual machines are moved and their movement is optimized
    by We apply the algorithm of ant colonies. By checking a threshold value, the
    cloud management can send an optimization order to the virtual machine relocation
    component, and the resource monitoring component can tell the cloud manager about
    the granularity of the empty capacity. On the other hand, the cloud might issue
    a command to empty the physical servers, lowering the total number of active servers,
    based on the anticipated volume of traffic. In this instance, it would be best
    to divide the virtual machines across several servers on the servers with the
    least amount of load. Consequently, the process of migrating virtual machines
    is called upon to minimize the quantity of active servers while simultaneously
    optimizing the granular free capacity. The flowchart in Fig. 5 illustrates the
    process implementation that corresponds to the suggested design that is displayed
    in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (181KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Program execution algorithm. Finding the ideal location among the
    physical host computers to accommodate virtual machines is crucial for distributing
    resources to virtual machines, taking into account that each of these machines
    corresponds to the implementation of a request''s needs. It receives attention.
    Physical machines have multiple independent sources (source 1, source 2, source
    3, etc.) in this operation. These resources may consist of a CPU, memory, bandwidth,
    and other things. To function, a virtual machine requires several of these resources,
    which are made available to him by making requests to the cloud. The resource
    allocation manager, which receives each request and develops a correspondence
    from the request to the actual machines carrying the resources, typically has
    a number of resources in different states when it comes to the method of installing
    virtual machines in the cloud. As a result, the i-th physical machine should be
    assigned the empty capacity of the i-th client''s request in the i-th virtual
    machine. The relationship (1) displays the request and capacity vector. (3) As
    such, one may argue that the problem of allocating virtual machines among real
    computers is a constraint satisfaction problem. in order for the number of virtual
    machines that are installed on physical computers to be limited by their capability.
    4.1. Predictability in the predictive method In this study, we use forecasting
    to predict the load in the future so that we can roughly calculate the number
    of servers needed to handle user requests. This work uses a dataset to predict
    the future demands on storage, memory, and processors in order to do this. A number
    of methods exist for making predictions. A top strategy for making accurate predictions
    is to use supervised learning methods to enable the learning system to independently
    predict a variable following training on a dataset. Systems based on supervised
    learning can only address classic supervised learning problems. While conventional
    supervised learning issues focus on historical parameter values to predict future
    values, the prediction issue is fundamentally a sequential supervised learning
    problem that deals with using recent data to forecast future values. When dealing
    with sequential supervised learning problems using typical supervised learning
    systems, the sliding window is used as an instrument or idea. As a matter of fact,
    the sliding window idea converts an ordinal supervision problem into a classical
    supervision problem. Using the sliding window technique, time series (like the
    loading rate up to this point) that need forecasting of important values are transformed
    into sequential portions of N units. The components might be produced by means
    of a single sample window device. We can think of the first N − 1 sample from
    these N units as input and the Nth unit from these N units as the equivalent output.
    Follow these steps, and the brand-new supervisory learning system will become
    a classic N − 1 input/one-output supervisory system. The size of the window is
    considered to be four units in this study (Ma and Hu, 2022). Because cloud servers''
    processors are the most important resource and because the cloud usually has trouble
    transferring resources to virtual machines we will only predict processor load.
    Here, the size of the sliding window is 4, and Table 2 shows the input and output
    of the Neuro-Fuzzy system when it uses this technique. Table 2. Inputs and outputs
    of the predictive Neuro-Fuzzy system. Parameter Title Input Output 4.2. Moving
    virtual machines The proposed approach of virtual machine transfer in this research
    accomplishes two major goals: (a) unloading unnecessary and inefficient virtual
    computers, or more accurately, scaling up and shutting down more running actual
    machines. (b) Fixing the problem with resource capacity granularity. According
    to the recommended design, when the cloud manager reduces the number of physical
    computers that are actively in use based on the anticipated volume of demand in
    the future, specific machines must be instructed to execute the command (all machines
    have resident load). Emitted In the literature, the servers with the lowest resident
    load are usually discharged. Therefore, in this investigation, we use this approach.
    However, every time, a small number of low-loading servers are selected, and their
    virtual machines are distributed among other servers as directed by the cloud
    resource manager, enabling the concurrent use of the available capacity. Consequently,
    when Tu and Li make demands for large virtual machines, the cloud can quickly
    accommodate them (2020). By doing this, the requirement to turn on the new server
    and the resulting rise in energy consumption will be avoided. To distribute virtual
    machines as effectively as feasible while also providing the greatest accessible
    space, an optimization approach should be used. But the problem we have here is
    one of constraint satisfaction, for which finding the best answer requires an
    accurate formulation that is not possible. Therefore, we require an algorithm
    that can solve the constraint fulfillment optimization problem without requiring
    a particular formulation of the problem. As a result, the study uses the ant colony
    algorithm, a well-known technique for tackling optimization problems, without
    requiring that the exact optimization problem be solved. The virtual computer
    can be moved in a way that uses the least amount of energy by using the ant colony
    algorithm. The packing difficulty and the virtual machine placement problem can
    exist in different scenarios (refer to Fig. 6). • In the packing problem, the
    first state presumes that all boxes are initially empty, while in the virtual
    machine placement problem, the beginning state really already has a configuration
    that needs to be optimized. This suggests that in the initial stage of the system,
    a large number of virtual machines are housed on physical equipment. • When migrating
    virtual machines, multiple movements (migration) may also be considered in order
    to maximize efficiency. Consequently, a large number of these bottlenecks may
    lead to increased network traffic and reduced efficiency. • There are some limits
    when moving virtual computers that must be considered. For instance, the bandwidth,
    memory size, and CPU features. This is an example of a packing issue of the multidimensional
    packing problem type (MDBPP). Download : Download high-res image (192KB) Download

    host machine is represented by the capacity vector Cv, which is correlated with
    each physical machine by Bv. Additionally, the multi-dimensional and time-varying
    capacity demand for each item is shown with ri. Additionally, there is a box assignment
    variable called yv. If the vth box is selected, yv is assigned a value of 1, otherwise
    it is set to 0. Additionally, the item assignment variable, , has a value of 1
    if item I is assigned to box v and 0 otherwise. The matrix representing the variable

    colony method is being used to minimize an objective function and optimize the
    cloud resource allocation process (Ding et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2022). This
    goal function shows how many boxes are allotted. It insures that just one source
    is assigned for each item, even as it makes sure that no more items than the boxes
    can hold. Stated differently, the objective of applying the ant colony algorithm
    to resource allocation is to reduce the total number of physically active servers.
    such that the problem takes limits into account as well. For instance, (Deepika
    and Dhanya. 2023): (4) By adjusting the variables for our application, the likelihood
    that an ant packs item i in box v that is, the probability that virtual machine
    i is placed in real host machine v in ant colony optimization is based on the
    following relationship (Deepika and Dhanya. 2023). (5) The quantity of pheromone
    required to position the i-th virtual machine in the v-th physical host is denoted
    by in relation (5). Additionally, provides heuristic data to enhance decision-making.
    is also a grouping of all virtual machines (items) that fit the capacity limits
    but haven''t been assigned to a real host (box) yet. To highlight the pheromone
    or exploratory data, utilize powers α and β. Virtual machines that meet requirement
    (6) are part of the set (Deepika and Dhanya. 2023): (6) The volume vector (bv)
    of the physical host machine (box) v in equation (7) is determined by equation
    (8): (7) According to whether virtual machines (items) make better use of physical
    machines (boxes), heuristic information picks those virtual machines (Relationship
    8). (8) simulates the evaporation of pheromones as well. The evaporation rate
    increases in tandem with an increase in , which is the evaporation parameter.
    (9) In this case, stands for the optimal pair that arises in each iteration, either
    virtual machine, physical machine, or item, box. (10) In this case, avoids the
    premature meeting that results in an improper solution and is the best solution
    that corresponds to the best binary matrix. Regarding the quantity of pheromone,
    the lower limit ( ) and upper limit ( ) are also taken into account. 5. Discussion
    and evaluation The cloud truly embodies many traits of both the demand and free
    markets, since it is the sole technology that links scattered resources and processing
    with these two markets. Accordingly, much like other markets, the cloud also offers
    its processing and rental products as they can be sold in the open market. Each
    virtual machine and the accompanying request is recognized as a product in a market
    known as the processing resource market. The recurring patterns of demand are
    one of the most significant features of free markets for products, and this fact
    is heavily stressed in the literature on free markets. Actually, these patterns
    give the supply and demand of products a dependable framework that supports and
    directs decision-making for company managers. As a result, the dataset used in
    this study is simulated using the demand trend repeated on several days. This
    indicates that under various load and demand scenarios, the trend and quantity
    of demand repeat recurring patterns when there is some noise present. The two-minute
    time intervals that the suggested algorithm runs automatically at the start of
    each period are the unit that is taken into consideration for the implementation
    of the suggested algorithm in order to build and simulate this dataset, based
    on the simulation requirements. To exist We will thus have 30 × 24, or 720 process
    executions, in a single day. The manner and distribution of demand entering the
    cloud is another aspect that needs to be taken into account in order to construct
    a dataset. In actuality, this displays how demand is distributed throughout the
    day. Even yet, the method of workload prediction is determined by the relationship
    between the workload''s time series'' successive values rather than by time. In
    this study, we first combine multiple normal distributions to build an arbitrary
    function that represents the distribution of requests at different times of the
    day. Fig. 8 is an example of this arbitrary function. Download : Download high-res
    image (73KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. An example of a form
    that can be used to create the data simulation request distribution function The
    function depicted in Fig. 8 illustrates how the total number of requests are distributed
    over time, with each time unit''s function value equal to the sum of all incoming
    requests for the time period displayed on the axis Horizontal displays the shape.
    Here, the crucial problem of noise presence should also be taken into account
    in order to prevent historical patterns of producing noise on subsequent days
    and to ensure that noise levels on various days are not impacted by noise levels
    on days prior. Due to the historical property, the noise will eventually be recreated
    on a noise function. Actually, this amplifies the combined influence of noise
    so that, eventually, after a few more general pattern periods, the function''s
    shape is established and does not repeat the intended recurrence. In this instance,
    the distribution function will no longer exhibit a recurring pattern since the
    noise has become an inherent part of the function. In this method, regardless
    of the quantity of noise in the preceding periods, noise at an acceptable level
    (10 %) is added to the distribution function to avoid bias from occurring every
    day. Naturally, in order for this noise to be included, its mean must be zero.
    But the mean of the noise is usually zero. Fig. 9 displays the total input demand
    for virtual machine allocation by clients throughout the course of a day for the

    The subsequent section will present two distinct elements of the criteria that
    may be considered when assessing the various stages of the suggested approach.
    First, one of the key instruments for putting the suggested strategy into practice
    is workload prediction, which takes the Neuro-Fuzzy system''s efficiency into
    account. The introduction of the suggested method''s evaluation criteria is then
    mentioned. 5.1. Mean square normalized error The normalized amount of the squared
    error, which is typically used to assess the projected continuous values, is actually
    known as the normalized value of the mean squared error. The error''s squared
    value allows one to account for a penalty in the event of a higher error, meaning
    that the error''s magnitude is reflected in the difference between the actual
    value and the simulated value after accounting for a power of two. As a result,
    accuracy is measured using efficiency, taking into account the size of the defect
    rather than its direction. Additionally, by normalizing the average squared error,
    the evaluation assumes a generic shape, and the algorithm''s effectiveness is
    typically assessed by looking at the suggested method''s correctness rather than
    the data it uses. The normalized mean squared error value is calculated as follows.
    (11) In this way, for the i-th member, Ti is the output''s true value and Yi is
    its simulated value. • Regression: A metric known as the linear regression of
    the simulated value and the real value of the approximating algorithm''s output
    serves as a complementary measure for accuracy, or nMSE/MSE. In actuality, a criterion
    other than precision is required to assess the continuous value approximation''s
    trustworthiness. Regression correlation coefficients are a metric used to calculate
    reliability. A number between −1 and −1) represents the degree of dependability,
    which is essentially a measure of the degree of linear relationship between an
    estimated parameter''s value and its real value. There is a stable positive or
    negative linear relationship between these two values if R = 1 or R = −1; otherwise,
    there is no linear relationship at all. Excellent reliability in the model is
    indicated by a desired value of R equal to one. Deepika and Dhanya. (2023) is
    the formula for calculating reliability criteria using linear regression of correlation
    coefficients. (12) In actuality, the effectiveness of supervised learning algorithms
    can be demonstrated by the combination of the nMSE accuracy criterion and R regression
    confidence, however each of them may have flaws on its own. Consequently, it is
    insufficient and insufficient to ensure the correct operation of the procedure
    if each of them is used separately to characterize the performance of the machine
    learning tool (in this case, the predictive Neuro-Fuzzy system). In this sense,
    the two criteria are utilized in tandem and as a supplement to demonstrate the
    effectiveness of the Neuro-Fuzzy system in estimating the workload. 5.2. Performance
    of dynamic resource allocation algorithm • Application rejection rate: The primary
    efficiency criterion of the suggested strategy is thought to be the quantity of
    denied requests. This means that the quantity of this efficiency measure is determined
    by dividing the total number of requests submitted to the cloud by the number
    of requests that were refused. The relationship shown below is used to determine
    this (Perea et al., 2021). (13) In order for to represent all of the requests
    received in total and to represent the quantity of requests that were denied.
    • The amount of wasted resources The ratio of the servers'' remaining vacant capacity
    to the entire capacity of the cloud servers is what determines how many resources
    are squandered (Deepika and Dhanya. 2023). (14) where is the current load on the
    i-th physical server, is the physical server''s total capacity, and N is the total
    number of servers that are available. In this sense, the suggested method''s entire
    goal is to minimize the quantity of resources squandered while also preventing
    request rejections as much as possible. This is significant, as was indicated
    in the earlier chapters, because the virtual machine has to be installed on the
    physical server without any prior optimization because there isn''t any online
    optimization to keep the request from being denied. Thus, online pre-allocation
    and prediction are combined with offline virtual machine migration to achieve
    optimization. 5.3. Performance of Neuro-Fuzzy system predicting work load Two
    findings are crucial for us to consider when assessing the embedded Neuro-Fuzzy
    system''s performance for workload prediction. The first result shows the algorithm''s
    best performance during this number of testing, as well as its average performance
    throughout 15 tests. In order to assess the sensitivity in the presence of varying
    noise levels, several experiments have been conducted in order to examine the
    Neuro-Fuzzy system''s efficiency for varying noise levels. In Table 4, this is
    displayed. Table 4. The Neuro-Fuzzy system''s performance in forecasting processor
    workload. Noise level Best performance Average efficiency R nMSE R nMSE No noise
    0.9804 0.0092 0.9761 0.0088 5 % 0.9712 0.0098 0.9650 0.0090 10 % 0.9536 0.0164
    0.9498 0.0132 15 % 0.9124 0.0188 0.9184 0.0161 To enhance the presentation of
    the outcomes found in Table 4, Fig. 11(a) and 11(b) respectively provide a visual
    depiction of the Neuro-Fuzzy system''s performance for accuracy (nMSE) and regression

    threshold for threshold desirability must be taken into consideration before delving
    into an analysis of Table 4 and Fig. 12 outcomes. For efficiency, it is normally
    possible to consider a reference limit, albeit this may vary depending on the
    application. Download : Download high-res image (80KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 12. CPU load. Therefore, we start by taking into account the threshold
    value of 0.02 for nMSE. Taking the normalization of the mean square error into
    consideration, this is obviously a very good and reasonable topic. Additionally,
    0.9 is thought to be the regression cutoff value. The algorithm has followed a
    linear and acceptable procedure throughout the whole tested range of pairs of
    values (actual value, simulated value), and 0.9 is efficient in this regard, therefore
    taking into account the value of 0.9 for R is appropriate. Consequently, if the
    Neuro-Fuzzy system''s prediction effectiveness is higher both when noise is present
    and when it is not, this will suggest that the method is optimal. Table 4′s results
    demonstrate how well the Neuro-Fuzzy system performs in terms of prediction in
    the presence of noise up until a 15 % noise addition to the data, at which point
    the threshold values for accuracy/error nose (nMSE) and reliability/regression
    (R) are maintained. Based on these readings, it can be concluded that the Neuro-Fuzzy
    system performs well and is a useful tool for predicting in the presence of 15
    % noise, helping to accomplish the objectives of this study. In this sense, we
    consider this tool to be finished and assess the outcome of the suggested approach
    under the assumption that the intended Neuro-Fuzzy system made the prediction
    accurately. 5.4. Performance of dynamic resource allocation algorithm Fig. 10

    algorithm performs well on the simulated dataset, it is now necessary to describe
    the methods used to evaluate the program''s performance by contrasting it with
    the recommended approach. Therefore, we should talk about and look over the parameters
    of the recommended method together with the ways that have been examined before
    deciding which way to compare. The real-time market approach is the first criterion,
    according to which a requested virtual machine must be rejected if it is not put
    in a physical target system right away. Consequently, any methods that do online
    optimization are not included in the approach comparison. Three categories of
    algorithms from the literature that can be compared in this study are based on
    these interpretations: techniques that are: a) very intelligent; b) controllable;
    and c) static. In the meanwhile, it seems that control-based and static approaches
    can be compared. This is because, even while highly intelligent techniques can
    predict the dynamics within the system, they need to be extensively trained before
    they can become efficient enough to prevent request denials. This task, of course,
    is modeled and executed in real time, therefore it does not have the requisite
    conditions to be compared to incredibly intelligent methods. The third strategy
    consists of static solutions that squander resources in an attempt to achieve
    efficiency goals. Naturally, it is important to keep in mind that the instant
    cloud market is frequently controlled by static tactics, especially considering
    the importance of the discussion about preventing the request from being denied.
    Since most of these strategies sacrifice resource usage to prevent the request
    from being refused, more than half of the resources are usually never used. In
    terms of resource leases and energy consumption, this naturally directly lays
    a significant financial pressure on cloud providers like RightScale and Amazon.
    Obviously, the complex nature of these approaches renders them unusable; for the
    sake of this research, “static approaches” denotes procedures that are unpredictable.
    These static solutions also maintain resource activity in order to avoid the first
    priority violation of this research, which is to prevent application rejection.
    According to an article published by the researchers Deepika and Dhanya, the conditions
    of the dataset and its reference are congruent with the settings of this investigation
    (2023). Therefore, considering the similarity of the dataset, it is possible to
    compare the proposed method with the methods provided in this article''s comparison
    section without violating the study rules. However, the suggested method in this
    article shows a superior efficiency due to its high level of intelligence and
    complexity. However, this does not preclude evaluating the suggested method''s
    efficacy in this research, as approaches at the same level will serve as the comparison
    criteria. The research''s suggested approach and the methods that are currently
    being used in the literature are contrasted in Table 5. Table 5. Comparison of
    the proposed method and other methods. Methods The average rate of resource wastage

    proposed technique''s implementation with the approaches that are currently in
    use in the literature, one can ascertain the efficacy of the recommended method
    with respect to the application rejection rate. Table 5 and Fig. 15, Fig. 16 present
    diagrams of these techniques. The recommended algorithm has effectively met the
    stated objectives and is clearly superior than comparable approaches in terms
    of the amount of resource waste (which is the main goal of this study). Now, we
    would like to see how well the algorithm performs in connection to the volume
    of queries. This is especially apparent when there are numerous requests. Table
    6 presents the algorithm''s performance in this way for three different demand
    ranges: modest (1500 requests), medium (6000 requests), and big (11,000 requests).

    is being proposed focuses on the energy consumption of cloud computing data centers.
    First, cloud center data is used in this section for classification purposes.
    Five classifiers in all are used in the categorization process. Support Vector
    Machines (SVM), linear, cubic, quadratic, fine, intermediate, and coarse Gaussian
    classifiers are just a few of the several types of classifiers that are available.
    Support vector machines (SVMs) come in different types, each with optimal parameters;
    they include fine Gaussian, medium Gaussian, coarse Gaussian, cubic, and quadratic
    SVMs. The optimal hyperplane that efficiently splits the search space into two
    separate groups is what these SVMs seek to find. The kind of the initial first-order
    classifier is assessed in relation to each classifier''s additional variations.
    The classifier employs a response set called “Outcome,” which includes the numerical
    values 0 and 1. The classifier uses these values to divide the data into two different
    groups. “0” is used to indicate high consumption data in the first group, and
    “1” is used to indicate low consumption data in the second category. The performance
    of five classifiers in terms of correctly classified and misclassified examples
    is shown in Fig. 17(a). The vertical axis shows the number of categorized samples,
    and the horizontal axis represents the different classifiers. As seen in Fig.
    17(b–e), the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and f measure are calculated
    to assess the efficacy of the classifiers. The highest values recorded for NB''s
    sensitivity and specificity are 0.741 and 0.415, respectively. At 0.970 and 0.986,
    respectively, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model performs better in terms
    of accuracy and F-Measure. A number of classifiers'' percentage accuracy is displayed
    in Fig. 17(f). With an accuracy measurement of 0.986 %, the K-Nearest Neighbors
    (KNN) classifier was the most accurate of them all. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    algorithm is the most accurate classifier available. Download : Download high-res

    metrics. The percentages of correctly identified positive and negative examples
    are denoted by the terms TP and TN, respectively. As can be seen in Table 7, the
    variables FP and FN stand for the proportions of negative cases that are mistakenly
    classified as positive and positive cases that are mistakenly labeled as negative.
    The Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT),
    Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers have respective true positive
    rates (TP rates) of 0.972, 0.987, 0.945, 0.984, and 0.827. Support Vector Machines
    (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and
    Naive Bayes (NB) have false positive rates (FP rates) of 0.033, 0.046, 0.17, 0.0542,
    and 0.344, in that order. Table 7. Instances that each classifier properly and

    order to match the performance of intelligent resource allocation techniques in
    cloud computing, we aimed to increase the efficiency of these algorithms in this
    study by presenting a method to enhance the cloud''s resource allocation mechanism
    when operating in the real-time market. On the other hand, because the cloud required
    payment for the amount of resources used, these techniques were more efficient
    overall. In order to reduce cloud energy usage, we employed the ideas of prediction
    and optimization. In order to pre-prepare the processing resources so that requests
    with real-time deadlines are observed due to a shortage of resources due to the
    lack of a host server ready to be placed, the forecasting process in this work
    used the ideas of sliding window and neuro-fuzzy system. Don''t turn down the
    request. An optimization technique known as the ant colony algorithm was used
    to enhance the suggested method''s operation and reduce energy usage. The strategy
    that turns off the extra active host servers to save energy when a small number
    of requests are to be transmitted to the cloud was actually used to optimize the
    system. To reduce energy consumption, this optimization issue actually takes into
    account a type of virtual machine distribution problem that may be used to distribute
    virtual machines on a low-load physical machine on other servers. The goal is
    to limit the number of open servers. Lastly, it was determined that the suggested
    approach outperforms the earlier approaches in terms of both the amount of resources
    wasted and the rate at which requests are rejected by comparing it with the methods
    that are currently in use in the relevant literature. It has demonstrated noteworthy
    relative effectiveness. In actuality, the application rejection—which was our
    primary and most crucial aim was effectively avoided, in contrast to other strategies
    that were unsuccessfully attempted based on information found in the literature.
    In addition, the experimental results demonstrate a significant decrease in energy
    consumption relative to the resource consumption, which is consistent with the
    suggested method''s proper performance when compared to the other techniques.
    Future study in this area might look into and test the following to extend and
    enhance the suggested method: • load balancing parameters for virtual machine
    migration • Combining techniques to improve optimization, such as ant-particle
    swarm or ant-genetics, in place of ant colonies in metaheuristic methodologies.
    • Improving forecasting and the synchronization of virtual machine movement periods
    through the use of node control based on reverse control. • Enhancing the suggested
    design by include a section on failure analysis to guard against system failure
    in the event that a sudden spike in requests occurs. Declaration of competing
    interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

    Real data plays a fundamental role in determining various features related to

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction With the growing interest
    and demand for intelligent agriculture, there is a need to convert traditional
    agricultural land to smart one [1]. Since most of the agricultural land is located
    in remote places, there is a need for new technologies to make them smart. For
    smart farming, low-cost, and resource-constraint sensors are placed across the
    agricultural field. To provide continuous connectivity for data communication,
    there must be a suitable and reliable technology for data communication over long
    distances and, at the same time, consume less energy. There are many protocols
    ranging from covering the personal area network (PAN) to wide-area network (WAN).
    The PAN wireless protocols include Bluetooth, wireless fidelity (WiFi), Zig-Bee,
    etc. WAN wireless protocols include Sigfox, long range (LoRa), long-term evolution
    (LTE), Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT), etc. In particular, LoRa, a relatively
    new communication technology, uses long waves to work over long distances [2],
    [3]. With the advent of various Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies,
    traditional agriculture fields can be converted to smart agricultural land [4].
    Presently, cloud-based infrastructures are being utilized to support various smart
    agriculture applications and data processing, wherein the data from smart sensors
    in the agricultural field is transmitted to the cloud over the Internet and is
    stored and processed in the cloud for decision making [1], [5], [6]. Though cloud-based
    infrastructures certainly offer enormous processing power and storage capacity,
    there are two key limitations that need to be addressed when used in the context
    of smart agriculture: 1) sensor data transmitted over the Internet requires continuous
    Internet connectivity, consumes high bandwidth, and incurs delays. In many developing
    countries there are huge agricultural lands that are cut off from Internet connectivity
    and 2) since IoT devices must transmit data continuously to the cloud for storage,
    processing, and decision making, the energy of battery-powered IoT devices is
    quickly drained. These limitations of cloud-based infrastructure for smart agriculture
    can be overcome with the help of fog computing [7]. However, building a cloud-assisted
    smart agriculture system presents several challenges, including high latency and
    bandwidth consumption and its difficult in rural areas where frequent Internet
    disconnections usually occur. Various shortcomings of IoT devices and infrastructure
    in the present-day literature are as follows. The power required in transmitting
    data is comparatively larger than the power required in sensing data by the sensor
    [8]. Many a time, a nearly static system or system with nearly constant dynamics
    (the difference between two consecutive data values is very small) like the temperature
    or humidity or soil moisture that changes very slightly generates a large amount
    of data and when transmitted by sensors to cloud over a large area consumes a
    large amount of power. Agricultural-related data tends to be homogeneous and change
    slowly over time [9]. Fig. 1 shows the data collected over a 2.5-h time frame
    from our real testbed (details about the real testbed are mentioned in Section
    V-C). It distinctly illustrates the gradual fluctuations in both temperature (in
    °C) and humidity (in %). These data patterns align with the hallmark of slow-moving
    dynamics commonly observed in agricultural environments. The sensing node has
    computation limitations due to the less processing power and energy restriction.
    LoRa technology facilitates long-range data communication. However, during airborne
    message transmission, data susceptibility to corruption or loss can occur due
    to channel characteristics, environmental factors, or collisions. To enhance resistance
    against noise, LoRa technology provides various spreading factors. While SF12
    represents a potent spreading factor, it necessitates extended airtime. Moreover,
    even in dense environments, these signals can be subject to corruption [10], [11].
    Fig. 1. Temperature (in °C) and humidity (in %) variation with iterations. Show
    All LPWAN stands for low-power WAN, which is a type of wireless communication
    technology designed for the IoT. LPWANs provide long-range, low-power connectivity
    for IoT devices, the LPWAN protocol includes Sigfox, NB-IoT, random phase multiple
    access (RPMA), and long-range WAN (LoRaWAN). The LPWAN is able to achieve large
    distances and it operates within the sub-GHz range through CSS modulation. LoRa
    technology is resistance to interference, owing to the linear variation of its
    chirp signal’s frequency over time. These chirp signals promptly utilize the accessible
    bandwidth, leading to a lower power consumption compared to alternative LPWAN
    technologies [12]. To address the issue of high power consumption, we use a LoRa-enabled,
    fog-based smart agriculture infrastructure and deploy an estimation algorithm
    that will reduce the quantity of data transferred from sensors to fog and further
    from fog to cloud. The architecture consists of three layers: 1) sensing layer;
    2) fog layer1; and 3) cloud layer [13]. Our aim is to reduce the number of data
    transmissions from the sensing layer to the fog layer within an accuracy threshold
    called tolerance denoted by ϵ . This will help in increasing the lifetime of deployed
    sensors in the field. To achieve the objective, we deploy a prediction algorithm
    [analytical prediction algorithm using estimation (APAE)] at all three layers.
    A sensor node transmits the sensed data to the fog node only if the error (difference
    between predicted and actual value) is beyond the predefined threshold or tolerance.
    Different events (such as water run-offs) in a large field cause each ED at different
    locations of the field to report different values at different times [14]. APAE
    is of a decentralized nature which can accommodate the natural heterogeneity of
    a large agricultural field. By allowing each end node (ED) to process data independently,
    the algorithm can capture the spatial variations and time-varying dynamics across
    the field. This capability is crucial for the accurate prediction of various environmental
    parameters. The contributions of this article are as follows. This article proposes
    an algorithm that predicts agricultural and IoT data without extensive computing
    power or lengthy historical data. This is particularly advantageous in energy-constrained
    IoT settings, enabling real-time predictions with minimal computational demands.
    Holistic Integration: Deploying APAE across all three layers of the IoT architecture—end
    device, fog layer, and cloud—streamlines data transmission. This integration reduces
    the number of transmitted data points, optimizing resource utilization, ensuring
    data consistency, and enhancing responsiveness. Empirical Validation: Our empirical
    validation, conducted through real-world testbeds and comparative analyses, demonstrates
    APAE’s superiority over existing methods. These concrete results substantiate
    APAE’s real-world applicability and efficiency. This article has been organized
    as follows. The literature review has been discussed in Section II. In Section
    III, the architecture for our work is described. The proposed APAE algorithm is
    described in detail in Section IV. Results, evaluation, and comparative study
    about APAE on open-source data sets and real testbeds are described in Section
    V. Finally, this article is concluded in Section VI. SECTION II. Literature Review
    As per the literature, data reduction techniques fall into three categories, data
    compression, data forecasting, and in-network processing [5], [20], [21]. The
    data compression techniques encode the data, thus reducing the size of the data
    [15]. In the forecasting technique, the data is predicted in the sensing node,
    the fog server, and at times in the cloud layer too. The predicted data is compared
    with the actual measured data and if found to have deviated from the predetermined
    range then, the data is sent; otherwise, the predicted value is used [9]. In case
    of in-network processing, the data is processed in the intermediate layer and
    the processed data is sent instead of the raw data [22]. Many state-of-the-art
    methods have been employed to reduce the data before transmitting it to the cloud.
    Koteich et al. have exploited the spatiotemporal correlation between neighboring
    nodes to reduce the number of captured frames in [22]. Ismael et al. [23] addressed
    the issues of network bandwidth, network energy consumption, and cloud storage
    in their study. They proposed an approach that operates within the network and
    consists of two layers. The initial layer, known as the data filtering layer,
    focuses on filtering data using two techniques: 1) data change detection and 2)
    identifying deviations between actual observations and their estimated values.
    Additionally, this layer identifies erroneous sensor readings by calculating the
    correlation among sensor readings. The second layer, the data fusion layer, employs
    the minimum-mean-square error technique to enhance data reliability following
    the filtering process. Yu et al. [24] employed a method that leverages fog computing
    to reduce data volume. The method is divided into two parts. The first part involves
    modeling the data based on a multivariate normal distribution, while the second
    part incorporates the utilization of the Kalman filter. This filter with identical
    parameters is implemented in both the fog and cloud platforms. If the projected
    value surpasses the specified range, the observations are then transmitted to
    the cloud. On the contrary, Fathy et al. [25] proposed an adaptive approach for
    data reduction that is based on the least-mean square (LMS). Their approach is
    based on a dual LMS filter, one deployed at the source and the other at the fog
    server. Both [24] and [25] rely on caching the data. However, the proposed algorithm
    does not cache data from the source. Salim and Mitton proposed a data reduction
    technique based on a data correlation technique by applying the Pearson correlation
    coefficient functions and equations in WSN implemented for agriculture to detect
    any abnormal situation in the meteorological data in [16]. They showed a reduction
    of more than 88% of the overall transmitted data considering the temperature and
    the humidity of two sensor nodes. Taneja et al. [18] introduced an approach centered
    around fog requirements for the examination of distributed IoT data. The proposed
    solution is formulated through mathematical modeling. The method they suggest
    employs a dissection strategy to disseminate the analysis task. This dissection
    technique is rooted in a query template, within which a learning approach is employed
    to accumulate instances in a summation form. The programming model based on map-reduce
    can be employed for any summation-form algorithm, enabling the distribution of
    computational tasks and analysis. The study employed the Linear Regression algorithm
    as a summation form to partition the analytical workload across multiple nodes.
    By utilizing this scheme, each fog node executes summation-based operations on
    the received IoT data, after which the aggregated results are conveyed to either
    the cloud platform or another fog node. The literature has presented various machine-learning
    approaches aimed at data reduction through data prediction. Many of these methods
    focus on capturing data correlation, primarily utilizing techniques, such as Pearson
    correlation and its variations, auto regression model, long short-term memory
    (LSTM) networks, and convolutional network techniques [26], [27], [28]. In order
    to predict and train the model, a big amount of data is needed, which makes it
    difficult to be done at the energy-limited sensor nodes. Among the aforementioned
    techniques, different authors have suggested diverse strategies. Some proposed
    conducting the processing at the sink, while others presented complex solutions
    that may pose challenges for low-power sensor nodes. Certain approaches focused
    primarily on prediction techniques without emphasizing methods to simultaneously
    enhance data reduction while maintaining accuracy. On the other hand, alternative
    methods explored the correlation between multiple parameters to achieve increased
    data reduction, often employing intricate systems and equations. In Table I, we
    presented a comparative study of different related works based on various aspects
    like 1) reduction approach; 2) novel concept; 3) domain; 4) advantages; and 5)
    disadvantages. In this article, we are interested in data processing starting
    at the end node and extending it to the cloud with fog in the intermediate. We
    consider different possible error factors, such as environmental factors, measurement
    errors, etc., in the algorithms and integrated trend variations in prediction.
    TABLE I Comparisons of Various Related Works SECTION III. Architecture We used
    a three-tier architecture, which includes the sensing layer, the fog layer, and
    the cloud layer as shown in Fig. 2. The developed algorithm is executed on all
    the layers. Sensing Layer: In IoT, the data about the parameters are collected
    from the sensors that are placed remotely. These groups of sensors are responsible
    for periodically sensing the data and transmitting it to the fog computing layer.
    This layer includes sensors, microcontrollers, actuating devices, etc. Fog Layer:
    The fog layer is an extended architecture of the cloud layer by using edge devices
    to compute, store, analyze, and communicate locally between the smart end devices
    and the data centers of cloud computing. It brings processing and intelligence
    close to the source of data. It is a bridge between the edge sensing layer and
    the cloud layer. In the present architecture, the fog layer also includes a network
    server and an application server. Cloud Layer: The cloud is a centralized system
    that is accessible from anywhere. All the complex computations are usually done
    at this layer. The fog layer connects with the cloud through the Internet. Fig.
    2. Three-layered adopted architecture. Show All SECTION IV. Analytical Prediction
    Algorithm Using Estimations This section discusses a novel algorithm that estimates
    and predicts a sensor’s data point based on the current state of the system. Table
    II shows the symbols used subsequently. TABLE II Symbol Table The state of the
    system is captured using various errors, gain, and process noise. To predict the
    next value accurately, it is important to feed in input to the algorithm. But
    the major problem in the three-layer architecture lies in the fact that the data
    measured in the sensing layer is not available to the model running synchronously
    in the fog layer, and cloud. So to cater to this need, we derive a parameter that
    is computed based on the uncertainties in the system and process. This uncertainty
    will help us compute the input parameter which will be fed to our algorithm to
    estimate the current state and extrapolate it to predict the next state.2 The
    high-level idea of the algorithm is that it does the following tasks broadly at
    time n : 1) estimates the data points for the n th iteration at time n using the
    predicted value for the n th iteration at time n−1 and 2) and it also predicts
    the data points for the (n+1) th iteration at time n . The proposed algorithm
    executes in iterations and each iteration consists of the following three steps.
    Process of Determining Errors in the System: Determining the various errors in
    the system, that is, (the errors in the environment, our model, and the sensors)
    known as the process error, the estimation error, and the measurement error, respectively,
    are determined. The Process of Deriving Input Value for the Algorithm: Determining
    the input given to the model to estimate the current data point and predict the
    next data point. As per the above discussion, the major challenge of the current
    IoT architecture is the unavailability of the actual measured value from the sensor
    to predict the next value. So to address this challenge, the input to the algorithm
    is determined using the process error using this input the algorithm will predict
    and estimate the data points. The Process of Estimating the Current Data Point
    and Predicting the Next Data Point: This involves the steps of estimation of the
    current data point using the input values and the prediction of the previous iteration.
    In this, the algorithm also predicts the data points for the next iteration. Now,
    we discuss each component in detail. A. Process of Determining Errors in the System
    We have considered the following possible errors in the sensing environment (which
    include errors in sensing devices, errors in algorithm estimation, and errors
    in the environment). Process (Environment) Error: The uncertainty in the dynamics
    of the sensing environment is termed as process error. In the literature, it is
    also called plant noise, driving noise, dynamics noise, and system noise. We denote
    process noise by p . The process noise produces estimation errors. In a system
    with almost constant dynamics [9] (the difference between any two consecutive
    data points is very small), the uncertainty or deviation is usually the difference
    between the next measured value and the present value. We define (1) to compute
    the process error for a system. It is determined by finding the weighted mean
    of the top frequently occurring uncertainty.3 For instance, if d 1 , d 2 , d 3
    ,…, d N denote the top N occurred uncertainties with frequency of f 1 , f 2 ,…,
    f N , respectively, then the process error is given by p= ∑ i=1 N f i ⋅ d i f
    i . (1) View Source The process error will be used to determine the input to the
    system. Measurement Error: It is defined as the difference between true and measured
    values (the accuracy with which a device can measure correctly). In the proposed
    algorithm, we assume that the measured value is the true value and we assume that
    the measured error is a very small value (we believe that our sensors work correctly).
    We denote measurement error using r . Estimation Error: The estimation error depends
    on how close our estimation is to the correct measured value. In our case, we
    assume that the initial estimation error is close to zero (we have considered
    the initial estimation error 0.0001 in our experiment), the reason being that
    the measured value by the sensor is taken as an estimated value so the error is
    almost zero (we assume that our sensor is working accurately). The estimated error
    is then updated at each iteration by the algorithm itself (so only the initial
    value needs to be provided). The process noise produces estimation errors, which
    need to be catered to with utmost priority. We denote estimation error by e. At
    time n , the estimated error is first updated for the current iteration (called
    n th iteration) using (2), where e ^ n,n is called the measured measurement error
    for iteration n at time n , G n is APAE gain for iteration n at time n , and e
    n,n−1 is the predicted measurement error for iteration n at time (n−1) e ^ n,n
    =(1− G n )× e n,n−1 . (2) View Source After updating the current state estimate,
    we extrapolate to predict the estimation error for the next iteration using e
    n+1,n = e ^ n,n +p (3) View Source where e ^ n,n is the estimated value of the
    current estimation error at the n th iteration at time n . e n+1,n is the predicted
    value for the n+1 th iteration at time n , and p is the process error which will
    be calculated at the start of the algorithm. B. Determining the Input Value for
    the Algorithm In the IoT architecture, the proposed algorithm is running in the
    sensing and the fog layers, but the proposed algorithm requires input or the measured
    value (by sensors) to estimate and update the current state and predict the next
    state based on the sensors’ measured data points. Here is the main challenge in
    producing the measured value since the actual measured data point is not available
    to the algorithm running at the fog level. So we address this issue by introducing
    the concept of a process error as discussed above. The input value for the n th
    iteration at time n is derived as follows using either (4) or (5): inp_va l n,n
    = x n,n−1 ±p (4) View Source OR inp_va l n,n = m s n,n (5) View Source where x
    n,n−1 is the predicted data point by the algorithm for the n th iteration at time
    (n−1) , and m s (n,n) is the n th measured data point by the sensor s for at time
    n . The prediction value produced by the proposed algorithm depends upon the input
    value. The input to the algorithm can either be the current measured value of
    the sensor or the input value generated by the algorithm as per (4). The initial
    input to the algorithm is the measured value by the sensor, thereafter the input
    is decided by the algorithm. The input value to the algorithm must therefore be
    decided very precisely, in order to ensure that the predicted output data points
    by the algorithm are very close to the actual measured data points, we define
    an accuracy threshold, i.e., tolerance (denoted by ϵ ). Tolerance, in the context
    of the proposed APAEs, is a user-defined parameter [29] that defines the acceptable
    range within which predicted values are considered accurate. This parameter is
    vital for optimizing data transmission in IoT environments. When a predicted value
    falls within the predefined tolerance, data transmission is avoided, conserving
    bandwidth and energy. Conversely, when a predicted value exceeds this tolerance
    range, it triggers data transmission to ensure data integrity. This dynamic approach
    allows users to tailor the algorithm’s performance to their specific application
    needs, balancing data accuracy with resource efficiency. For instance, when the
    user sets a tolerance value, such as ±0.25, the algorithm’s decision-making process
    ensures that predicted values within this tolerance range are accepted, and no
    data transmission occurs. However, when the predicted value falls outside this
    predefined tolerance, the end node initiates data transmission to the fog node
    and the same to the cloud layer. We now discuss how the algorithm determines the
    input value at time n . For that, we need to discuss the criteria for when a sensor
    node needs to transmit the actual measured data points to the fog node. It depends
    on two criteria: 1) increasing or 2) decreasing pattern of measured data points.
    We use two markers + and −. For any two consecutive data points ( m s (n−1,n−1)
    , m s (n,n) ) ,where ( m s (n−1,n−1) denotes the measured value by the sensor
    at time (n−1) , and m s (n,n) ) represents the measured data points by the sensor
    at time n , respectively. We assign marker + if ( m s (n,n) )≥( m s (n−1,n−1)
    ) , else we assign − marker for consecutive data points. A sensor node will transmit
    the measured data points in the following two cases. If the marker is changed.
    If the predicted output data point ( x n,n−1 ) at time n−1 for the n th iteration
    by the algorithm is beyond ( m s n,n ±ϵ) then the sensor node needs to transmit
    the actual measured data to the fog layer, where m s (n,n) is the actual measured
    value by the sensor at the sensing layer at time n and ϵ is accuracy threshold.
    Now, the input value is determined using the following steps. It depends on whether
    the measured value is following the increasing trend or decreasing trend, and
    to get that we need to compare the previously measured value with the present
    measured value. Since our system is of constant dynamics, this trend plays a very
    important role in determining whether the present process error p needs to be
    added or subtracted from the previously estimated value. If the marker is + then
    the next input will be inp_va l n,n = x ^ n,n−1 +p . If the marker is − then the
    next input will be inp_va l n,n = x ^ n,n−1 −p . In the case of predicted data
    point x n,n−1 =( x ^ n−1,n−1 ) is beyond ( m s n,n ±ϵ) , the next input is inp_va
    l n,n = m s n,n . C. Process of Updating the Current State and Predicting the
    Output for the Next Iteration After determining the input to the system, the next
    task is to update the current state and predict the data point for the next iteration
    (the next data points). The process is divided into two steps as follows: 1) updating
    the current state and 2) predicting the next state. State Update Equation: To
    estimate the current state of the system, we combine two variables. The prior
    state estimate or the current state predicted at the previous state ( x n,n−1
    = x ^ n−1,n−1 ). The Input Value (inp_val_n,n) : The input value to the algorithm
    at the n th iteration is determined as mentioned in Section IV-B. Then, we update
    the estimation error value as follows: e ^ n,n =(1− G n )× e n,n−1 . (6) View
    Source Next, we update the APAE Gain for the n th iteration at time n as follows:
    APAE Gain: G n = e n,n−1 e n,n−1 + r n . (7) View Source The algorithm will estimate
    the current data point (i.e., n th data point) using predicted data points at
    time n−1 for the n th iteration. It will be updated as follows: x ^ n,n = x n,n−1
    + G n ×(inp_va l n,n − x n,n−1 ). (8) View Source G n is a weight equation. It
    is the ratio of the estimation uncertainty to the sum of estimation and measurement
    uncertainty. If measurement uncertainty is high, the APAE gain is low. So due
    to this APAE gain in (8), it is clear that if the APAE gain is high then x n,n
    depends more on the input value (inp_va l n,n ) and if the value of G n is low
    then it depends more on the prior state. So G n puts a weight on the two-parameter,
    i.e., the inp_va l n,n or x n,n . Since we are solely relying upon the measurement
    for estimating the input value, so we must choose values such that the value of
    APAE gain is high. So that the next value of estimation is more toward the input
    value, which is close to the measured value from the sensor. State Predict Equation:
    State Extrapolation Equation: The state extrapolation determines the relation
    of the input parameter with the output parameter, since in the proposed algorithm,
    we assume that the system is of very slow dynamic, we predict that the (n+1) th
    estimate at the n th time is same as the n th estimated value computed at time
    n x n+1,n = x ^ n,n . (9) View Source Prediction of Estimation Error: In the proposed
    algorithm the succeeding estimation variance parameter is found by adding the
    process noise because, for a system with constant dynamic, the error in estimation
    is due to the process error e n+1,n = e ^ n,n +p. (10) View Source The aim of
    the proposed algorithm is to reduce the amount of data being sent from the sensing
    layer to the fog layer, which in turn reduces the energy consumed by sensor nodes.
    A pseudocode of the proposed algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Steps
    Involved for the n th Iteration Show All An example of the first two iterations
    is described in Sections IV-D and IV-E. D. Iteration 0 or Initial State Initializing
    the accuracy threshold ϵ value by the user. In our case, we assume ϵ=0.5 . Determining
    the process error for the system as per (1). It is denoted as p . Suppose that
    p=0.1 . Assigning the measurement error for the system r=0.001 . It is denoted
    by r and it remains constant throughout the process. Estimating the current state
    of the system, i.e., x ^ 0,0 (at time 0, we estimate the 0th iteration data points).
    At iteration 0, we set it equal to the sensor’s measured value m s , i.e., x ^
    0,0 =50.2 , (we assume that m s 0,0 =50.2 ). Initialize the estimation error at
    time 0 and for the 0th iteration e ^ 0,0 =0.0001 (initially, this value is close
    to zero because we assign the estimated data point the same as the measured data
    point). Predicting the next data point x 1,0 , i.e., the data point of the 1st
    iteration at time 0. Since the system is of slow-moving dynamics so set x 1,0
    = x ^ 0,0 =50.2 . Predicting the next estimation error e 1,0 using (10), i.e.,
    estimation error for the 1st iteration at time 0, e 1,0 = e ^ 0,0 +p=0.0001+0.1=0.1001
    . E. Iteration 1 Determining the input value to the system inp_valu e 1,1 . Suppose
    that the measured data point from the sensor is 50.45 in iteration 1. Now, we
    will compute the input value as per the discussion in Section IV-B, so inp_va
    l 1,1 =50.2+p=50.3 . This |50.45−50.3|<ϵ , so the input value will be 50.3 instead
    of 50.45. So, inp_valu e 1,1 =50.3 . Measurement error r constant throughout 0.001.
    Determining the APAE Gain G 1 =[ e 1,0 /( e 1,0 +0.001)]=[0.1001/(0.1001+0.001)]=0.99010
    . Now, the algorithm computes the current estimated state of the system at the
    1st iteration, i.e., x ^ 1,1 =50.2+0.99010×(50.3−50.2)=50.299 . Updating the estimation
    error e ^ 1,1 =(1−0.99010)×0.1001=0.000990 . Prediction of the next data point
    x 2,1 = x ^ 1,1 =50.299 . Prediction of the estimation error e 2,1 =0.000990+0.1=0.10099

    the present estimated value. *** Note that there is a difference between the estimated
    and predicted value. Estimated value refers to the computation of the sensor’s
    measured value whereas predicted value is guessing the next sensor value. Predicting
    the estimation error for the next state e n+1,n = e ^ n,n +p In order to understand
    the impact of other factors, it is necessary to provide testimony for the real-world
    evaluation of the algorithm. In this next section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated using data sets and a real-world testbed. SECTION V. Results
    and Evaluation In this section, we present a comprehensive analysis of the results
    obtained from the evaluation of our proposed APAE. We begin with describing the
    evaluation parameter, and then discuss about the data sets and the comparisons
    done and finally, we present the results associated with our real testbed. A.
    Performance Metrics This section highlights some important metrics that were used
    to evaluate the performance of the proposed APAE. Data Reduction: It is defined
    as the ratio of the data not sent to total data. The equation is provided as follows:  Data
    Reduction ( in %)=(1−  Data transmitted   Total data  )×100. (11) View Source
    Power Measuring: Power conservation is an important parameter in the context of
    IoT for increasing device lifespan, enhancing scalability, cost savings, etc.
    So, power consumption analysis is also done for the proposed algorithm APAE. The
    power is measured using the power current voltage formula as shown in Power(P)=Voltage(V)×Current(I).
    (12) View Source Here, power is measured in Watts, voltage is measured in Volts,
    and current is measured in Ampere. Since the sensor node is working at a fixed
    voltage of 5 V, using (12), we can determine the amount of power consumed. If
    one data sample requires a 1 Watts of power then N data samples will require (
    a 1 ×N) Watts of power. In the following discussion, we consider only the transmission
    power, i.e., the power required to transfer the packets from sensing to fog node,
    as the power consumption for transmitting is much greater than that for sensing
    [8]. Fig. 3(a) shows the schematic for the power measurement. The Keysight E3631A
    is used to measure the current drawn by the transmitting module. Arduino, sensors,
    and the LoRa that constitute the end node. Accuracy: To determine the accuracy
    of APAE, the mean absolute error (MAE) metric was chosen which is given by MAE=
    ∑ n=N n=1 (|PredictedValue -ActualValue|) N . (13) View Source Here, N denotes
    the total number of data points. MAE is well suited for accuracy assessment because
    it captures the magnitude of errors in predictions. This is particularly relevant
    for APAE, as it allows us to quantify how closely the algorithm’s predictions
    align with the actual sensor measurements. Higher MAE values indicate larger prediction
    errors, while lower value indicates less prediction error. Fig. 3. Performance

    Show All B. Simulation Results on Different Data Sets We have used two data sets
    to compare APAE with the state-of-the-art data reduction schemes present in the
    literature. We establish a baseline assumption that the reference research paper
    [9] transfers all data from the sensing layer to the fog layer, i.e., 100% data
    transfer from sensing to fog layer, and thereafter fog layer applies various machine
    learning algorithms in combination with data compression schemes like run length
    encoding (RLE) or Huffman coding for reducing the data from fog to cloud layer.
    The machine learning algorithms that were used are as follows: 1) K -nearest neighbor
    (KNN) algorithm; 2) Gaussian mixture model (GMM); 3) hierarchical clustering (Hierarchical);
    4) spectral clustering (Spectral); and 5) decision trees (Tree). By adopting this
    standardized benchmark, we align the comparison on equitable grounds, allowing
    us to elucidate the fundamental distinctions in data reduction strategies across
    diverse IoT architecture layers. Notably, the APAE-based architecture encompasses
    a twofold data reduction process: first, from the sensing layer to the fog layer,
    and second, from the fog layer to the cloud. This reduction approach is accentuated
    by our algorithm’s ability to exclusively transmit data that falls within the
    predefined tolerance (ϵ) thresholds. The two data sets based on the agriculture
    domain are discussed as follows. Soria Data Set [30]: The first data set originates
    from Cuerda del Pozo in Soria, Spain, during the Summer of 2013. It contains readings
    of humidity and temperature, collected every minute, resulting in 1440 data points
    per day. These measurements were captured using a Vaisala weather transmitter
    model WXT-520, as documented by Aguilar in 2014 and 2017. This data set provides
    us with a detailed and high-frequency view of the conditions. Cartagena Data Set
    [31]: Our second data set comes from Cartagena, Spain, during the Spring of 2020.
    It focuses on soil conditions. A total of 1561 samples, each taken every 5 min.
    Each sample includes measurements of soil temperature and moisture at different
    depths. This data set helps us understand how the soil behaves over time and depth.
    Its recent time frame and comprehensive nature make it an important asset for
    our study. These two data sets offer us different insights into the environment.
    The Soria data set’s frequent measurements of air humidity and temperature give
    us a closer look at rapid changes, while the Cartagena data set’s soil measurements
    over time and depth provide a more detailed understanding of soil characteristics.
    By combining these data sets, we gain a well-rounded view that is crucial for
    the agriculture domain. Data Reduction: Based on (11) and the above claim of standardizing
    the benchmark, a comparative study on various state-of-the-art data reduction
    schemes versus APAE has been presented. Fig. 3(b) demonstrates a comparison of
    various data reduction schemes, i.e., Machine Learning in addition to RLE compression
    techniques versus APAE at different tolerances on the Soria data set. Fig. 3(c)
    demonstrates a comparison of various data reduction schemes, i.e., Machine Learning
    in addition to Huffman Coding compression techniques versus APAE at different
    tolerances on the Soria data set. Fig. 3(d) demonstrates a comparison of various
    data reduction schemes, i.e., Machine Learning in addition to RLE compression
    techniques versus APAE at different tolerances on the Cartagena data set. Fig.
    3(e) demonstrates comparisons of various data reduction schemes, i.e., Machine
    Learning in addition to Huffman Coding compression techniques versus APAE at different
    tolerances on the Cartagena data set. Power Reduction: We conducted a thorough
    power consumption analysis within the Soria and Cartagena data sets, considering
    various tolerance (ϵ) levels (0.25,0.5,0.75, and 1.0). This assessment allowed
    us to gain valuable insights into the impact of APAE on power utilization in real-world
    IoT scenarios. By comparing power consumption with and without the application
    of APAE across diverse tolerance levels, we acquired a detailed understanding
    of the algorithm’s significance. From Table III it is clearly visible that the
    power reduction on applying APAE in the Soria’s data set at tolerance (ϵ=0.25)
    is 90.18% and at tolerance (ϵ=1.0) power reduction is 99.98%. This analysis served
    as a compelling demonstration of the importance of APAE in enhancing energy efficiency
    within deployments. Table III shows the detailed analysis, with each row denoting
    the data set’s name along with the parameter (temperature, soil moisture, humidity,
    and soil temperature) associated, and each column represents the different tolerance
    level (0.25,0.5,0.75, and 1.0). Accuracy: The accuracy metric of the APAE for
    the mentioned data set at different tolerance is given in Table IV. Each row of
    the table presents the data set’s name along with the parameter associated (temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature) and each column represents different
    tolerance value associated. The mean absolute relative error was chosen as a metric.
    It is clearly visible from Table IV that as the value of tolerance increases the
    MAE also increases. TABLE III Power Consumption in Watt for Soria and Cartagena
    Data Sets At Different Tolerance (ϵ) TABLE IV MAE for the Soria and Cartagena
    Data Sets at Different Tolerance C. Experimental Testbed To comprehensively assess
    the performance of APAE within a real-world context, we established an experimental
    testbed. Our setup featured two distinct end nodes, with each node equipped with
    three essential sensors: 1) humidity; 2) temperature; and 3) soil moisture. For
    temperature and humidity measurements, DHT11 sensor was deployed. Additionally,
    to gauge soil moisture levels effectively, a capacitive soil moisture sensor was
    utilized. The frequency of sensing was at an interval of 5 min for a period of
    14 days. Approximately, 4030 data points each for temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture were measured for each end node. So a total of 12 090 data points from
    each end node was sensed. The end node consists of first the microcontroller,
    second the sensor (that is attached to the microcontroller), and third, the transmitting
    module that is attached to the microcontroller. The microcontroller used is an
    Arduino Mega 2560 board based on the ATmega2560. The transmitting module is a
    Dragino Arduino LoRa shield based on Semtech SX1276/SX1278 chip. Fig. 4 shows
    the sensor node that is deployed in the field. Fig. 4. Sensor node deployed in
    the field. Show All The fog server constitutes the Gateway, Gateway bridge, and
    network server. The Gateway consists of the Dragino PG-1302 (10-channel LoRa Integrated
    Circuit) along with the Raspberry Pi 4 (Model B, 8-GB RAM). Gateway Bridge is
    a service that converts LoRa packet forwarder protocols into a ChirpStack common
    data format. The network server used was the “Chirpstack Opensource LoRaWAN server.”
    The cloud service used was Microsoft Azure Cloud. The schematic for the field
    is shown in Fig. 3(f). Here, Device1 and Device2 represent the end nodes, placed
    diagonally. The length of the field is 20 feet and the width is 10 feet. The crop
    grown in the field is Lady Finger. The evaluation of APAE’s performance in the
    real testbeds was guided by considering the parameters as described in the above
    section, i.e., data reduction, power measurement, and accuracy of the data predicted.
    The results related to the real testbed are elaborated as follows. Data Reduction:
    The reduction in data was quantified in terms of percentage reduction, providing
    a clear measure of the algorithm’s efficiency in optimizing data transmission.
    Table V represents the data reduction (in percentage) for each end node at different
    tolerance values. In the present research work, we have taken standard values
    of tolerance as 0.25,0.5,0.75, and 1.0. Each row in the table shows the end node
    and the columns in the table presents the data reduction of each parameter (temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture) at different tolerance levels. It is clearly visible
    from Table V that as the value of tolerance increases the percentage of data reduction
    also increases, for instance, for end node 1, the data reduction in temperature
    at ϵ=0.25 is 75.0% and that for ϵ=1 is 92.62%. Power Consumption: We conducted
    a comprehensive analysis of power consumption for our real testbed. This exploration
    aimed to validate the practical feasibility of the proposed APAE in minimizing
    energy utilization within IoT deployments in smart agriculture. Table VI shows
    the comparison of power consumed while APAE is deployed and without APAE. Table
    VI highlights on how the application of APAE in real testbeds with different tolerance
    levels has helped achieve power reduction, for instance, at tolerance ϵ=0.25 ,
    End Node 1 achieves the power reduction of 59.95% while the same node for ϵ=1
    achieves the power reduction of 82.89%. Accuracy: This metric provides a quantitative
    measure of the algorithm’s performance by assessing the disparity between the
    predicted values generated by APAE and the actual sensor readings. Table VII presents
    the MAE for each sensor reading at the tolerance 0.25,0.5,0.75, and 1.0, respectively,
    where the two rows represent the sensor nodes, and the columns represent the different
    parameters (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) at different tolerance (ϵ)
    . It is clearly visible that for the lower value of tolerance (ϵ) the MAE is low
    and for the high value of tolerance, MAE has a higher value. TABLE V Data Reduction

    in the Real Testbed SECTION VI. Conclusion In this work, we proposed an algorithm
    that achieves significant improvements toward addressing major crucial challenges
    in the field of smart agriculture. First, our algorithm focuses on reducing the
    number of data points transmitted from the sensing layer to the fog and further
    to the cloud layers. APAEs have helped in gaining a significant reduction in the
    data transmission, as it has helped attain a data reduction of 93.69% in Soria’s
    data set for ϵ=1.0 and a data reduction of 93.425% for the real testbed. Second,
    it aims to minimize the energy consumption of sensor nodes. Through the proposed
    APAE, we have successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of optimizing data transmission
    and energy management in IoT systems. Through comprehensive analysis, we have
    showcased that APAE in Soria’s data set has effectively reduced the power consumption
    to 45.7085 W compared to 2486 W at ϵ=1.0 when the whole of the data was sent.
    Similarly, in the real testbed, the power was reduced to 113.34 W compared to
    677.55 W when the entire data was being sent. APAE consistently exhibited promising
    results in providing accurate results, as it can be noticed that for Soria’s data
    set, the MAE was as low as 0.097 for ϵ=0.25 and similarly MAE for the real testbed
    was as low as 0.088 for ϵ=0.25 . Thus, the detailed performance evaluation and
    results obtained have proven APAE to be of significant use case in the field of
    smart agriculture. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes

  description: Digital Twins play a crucial role in bridging the physical and virtual
    worlds. Given the dynamic and evolving characteristics of the physical world,
    a huge volume of data transmission and exchange is necessary to attain synchronized
    updates in the virtual world. In this article, we propose a semantic communication
    framework based on you only look once (YOLO) to construct a virtual apple orchard
    with the aim of mitigating the costs associated with data transmission. Specifically,
    we first employ the YOLOv7-X object detector to extract semantic information from
    captured images of edge devices, thereby reducing the volume of transmitted data
    and saving transmission costs. Afterwards, we quantify the importance of each
    semantic information by the confidence generated through the object detector.
    Based on this, we propose two resource allocation schemes, i.e., the confidence-based
    scheme and the acrlong AI-generated scheme, aimed at enhancing the transmission
    quality of important semantic information. The proposed diffusion model generates
    an optimal allocation scheme that outperforms both the average allocation scheme
    and the confidence-based allocation scheme. Moreover, to obtain semantic information
    more effectively, we enhance the detection capability of the YOLOv7-X object detector
    by introducing new efficient layer aggregation network-horNet (ELAN-H) and SimAM
    attention modules, while reducing the model parameters and computational complexity,
    making it easier to run on edge devices with limited performance. The numerical
    results indicate that our proposed semantic communication framework and resource
    allocation schemes significantly reduce transmission costs while enhancing the
    transmission quality of important information in communication services.

    Metrics Abstract: Digital Twins play a crucial role in bridging the physical and
    virtual worlds. Given the dynamic and evolving characteristics of the physical
    world, a huge volume of data transmission and exchange is necessary to attain
    synchronized updates in the virtual world. In this article, we propose a semantic
    communication framework based on you only look once (YOLO) to construct a virtual
    apple orchard with the aim of mitigating the costs associated with data transmission.
    Specifically, we first employ the YOLOv7-X object detector to extract semantic
    information from captured images of edge devices, thereby reducing the volume
    of transmitted data and saving transmission costs. Afterwards, we quantify the
    importance of each semantic information by the confidence generated through the
    object detector. Based on this, we propose two resource allocation schemes, i.e.,
    the confidence-based scheme and the acrlong AI-generated scheme, aimed at enhancing
    the transmission quality of important semantic information. The proposed diffusion
    model generates an optimal allocation scheme that outperforms both the average
    allocation scheme and the confidence-based allocation scheme. Moreover, to obtain
    semantic information more effectively, we enhance the detection capability of
    the YOLOv7-X object detector by introducing new efficient layer aggregation network-horNet
    (ELAN-H) and SimAM attention modules, while reducing the model parameters and
    computational complexity, making it easier to run on edge devices with limited
    performance. The numerical results indicate that our proposed semantic communication
    framework and resource allocation schemes significantly reduce transmission costs
    while enhancing the transmission quality of important information in communication
    services. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 11, Issue: 5,

    I. Introduction In recent years, the advances in technologies, such as augmented/extended/virtual
    reality (AR/XR/VR), blockchain, sixth-generation (6G) network, artificial intelligence
    (AI), and edge computing have led to an increasing demand for virtual reality
    and digital worlds. The metaverse, as a virtual reality concept, is considered
    an integration of multiple virtual worlds that can provide people with a more
    immersive and realistic digital space [1], [2], allowing them to engage in various
    activities, such as virtual conferences, remote collaboration, online learning,
    digital exhibitions, etc. The emergence of these virtual reality activities has
    not only alleviated social isolation and transportation restrictions, but also
    saved time and costs, gradually becoming essential tools for people’s lives and
    work. Moreover, the popularity of these activities in various social domains has
    also accelerated the development of digital economy and digital transformation
    [3], [4]. In agriculture, novel paradigms, such as digital farms, smart agriculture,
    and agricultural metaverse, which are combined with metaverse technology, are
    emerging and flourishing [4], [5]. In terms of agricultural production, users,
    such as farmers, can establish virtual farms in a virtual environment, simulate
    the complete growth process of crops and livestock, and obtain real-time growth
    data to achieve intelligent and refined agriculture. For instance, the XR Laboratory
    of Alibaba DAMO Academy presented a case study of an autonomous agricultural picking
    robot. The proposed approach entails the development of a high-precision 3-D model
    of the entire orchard via 3-D modeling techniques of both the orchard and fruit
    trees. Subsequently, a motion planning scheme can be established in the virtual
    environment, which can facilitate the robot’s autonomous picking process in the
    real world. This innovative approach can potentially minimize the costs associated
    with orchard management [6]. Furthermore, virtual agriculture can be combined
    with other fields, such as agricultural leisure and agricultural education. For
    example, the Faculty of Agriculture has developed an agricultural metaverse teaching
    system for an egg chicken farm at the National University of Laos. Through the
    VR technology, the faculty members provide agricultural education to learners,
    including knowledge related to technology, farm location, and other relevant aspects.
    The system has been reported to have yielded positive results [7]. Digital twins
    (DTs), namely, digital replications of physical objects, have emerged as a pivotal
    technology for creating virtual environments [8], [9]. In agriculture, the physical
    realm is characterized by its intricate and constantly changing nature, necessitating
    digital twins (DTs) synchronizing with the physical world to ensure their accuracy
    in virtual operations. This process requires that edge devices persistently gather
    the most recent data from the physical world, enabling real-time DTs updates.
    The acquisition and transmission of the data from the physical world often rely
    on various advanced edge devices and wireless communication technologies [10],
    [11]. Various fixed or mobile devices (e.g., sensors and cameras) are deployed
    to collect status data of physical objects, which, in real time, update, and interact
    with the virtual world through wireless communication. However, continuous data
    transmission poses stringent requirements on wireless communication systems, especially
    when dealing with extensive data, such as high-definition images, which can be
    both expensive and challenging when the physical world is vast. Fortunately, semantic
    communication has been introduced as a novel avenue for tackling the aforementioned
    challenge [12], [13]. In contrast to conventional communication technologies,
    semantic communication systems regard transmission effective if the meaning of
    the received information maintains the original meaning of the transmitted information
    [14]. For example, in the context of image transmission, a semantic-based communication
    system can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted by only transmitting
    the semantic information behind the image, while achieving the same effect [15].
    In this article, we present a case study focusing on the development of a virtual
    apple orchard using a real apple data set. In the virtual orchard, users, i.e.,
    fruit growers, can easily access various information, such as the quantity and
    location of fruit on each apple tree, as well as growth status and view real images
    of individual apples. The virtual orchard can help users manage their orchard
    more efficiently. In this case, the implementation of DTs requires edge devices,
    such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to capture the status information of fruit
    trees by taking photographs, and then transmitting the collected data to users
    via the wireless communication technology. To reduce costs and enhance communication
    quality during this process, we propose a semantic communication and resource
    allocation framework based on YOLO. Our main contributions are summarized as follows.
    Unlike traditional communication methods that necessitate transmitting all acquired
    images, we propose a YOLO-based semantic communication framework. Specifically,
    the proposed framework discards irrelevant interference information after image
    data acquisition, retaining only the critical semantic information for transmission.
    This significantly reduces the data volume needed for transmission and lowers
    resource costs while achieving the same outcome. We employ the YOLOv7-X object
    detector to extract semantic information from images and enhance its performance
    on a real-world apple data set. Considering the limitations of existing object
    detectors in detecting small objects, such as small apples, and the constraints
    of processing power and memory in edge devices, larger models necessitate increased
    computational resources and memory for operation, which may result in performance
    degradation or inoperability. Consequently, we improve the YOLOv7-X algorithm
    by introducing the ELAN-H and the SimAM attention modules. These modifications
    elevate the detector’s performance and reduce the parameters and computational
    requirements, facilitating deployment on edge devices with greater ease. In the
    pursuit of enhancing transmission quality during the wireless transmission of
    a huge volume of images, we propose a resource allocation scheme based on the
    significance of semantic information. The scheme allocates transmission power
    following the relative importance of the semantic information, with the aim of
    enhancing the overall communication quality of image transmission systems by minimizing
    important information loss and improving the reliability of transmitted information.
    This approach ensures that critical information is transmitted with high quality
    to users, even in challenging wireless communication environments. Furthermore,
    we utilize the AI-generated resource allocation scheme algorithm as an alternative
    allocation scheme, which facilitates more efficient processing power distribution.
    Specifically, by using the denoising technique, the AI-generated algorithm generates
    a design for the allocation scheme and subsequently adds exploration noise to
    execute it, thereby gaining experience in exploration. The numerical results clearly
    demonstrate that this method achieves the highest score in terms of semantic information
    transmission quality. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In
    Section II, we initially summarize the related work about DTs, semantic communication,
    and apple detection. Section III introduces the overall system design, semantic
    communication approach, and the metric used for evaluating the system’s communication
    quality. In Section IV, the YOLOv7-X object detector and its enhancement methods
    are described in detail, followed by an explanation of two distinct resource allocation
    methods for data transmission. Subsequently, we analyze the numerical results
    in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes this article. SECTION II. Related
    Work In this section, we briefly introduce three related techniques, i.e., DTs,
    semantic communication, and apple detection. A. Digital Twins The physical system
    and physical world in agriculture are complex and dynamic environments that include
    basic information and characteristics of physical objects. DTs require continuous
    updating from the physical to the virtual space as the state of physical objects
    changes over time [16], [17]. Li et al. [18] proposed a deep learning-based single-view
    leaf reconstruction method for a plant growth DT system, improving leaf reconstruction’s
    accuracy and speed. Angin et al. [19] introduced a DT framework for agriculture
    called AgriLoRa, which detects plant diseases and weeds using computer vision
    algorithms after uploading data from UAV images and field sensor data to cloud
    servers. Awais et al. [20] used the multispectral UAV and DTs model to achieve
    intelligent irrigation in the field. However, these works have focused only on
    the use of collected data and have not considered the impact of data transmission.
    DTs require a significant amount of computing power to render 3-D objects, which
    is achieved through collecting large amounts of data from perception networks
    and ultralow latency communication to maintain a seamless user experience [1].
    When physical objects are large enough, the massive data streams can burden communication
    systems and cause excessive latency, or even transmission failure. Therefore,
    in this article, we use a semantic-aware communication method to reduce the amount
    of data that needs to be transmitted. B. Semantic Communication In classical communication
    theory, the semantic content and meaning of the message are largely considered
    irrelevant to communication. However, in the age of rapidly increasing data volume,
    the limitations of classical communication theory have begun to be revealed [21].
    Semantic communication constitutes an innovative paradigm wherein message transmission
    is not confined solely to the message content, but rather entails direct extraction
    of pertinent semantic information, thereby eliminating redundant data and mitigating
    associated costs. Xie et al. [22] proposed a text transfer framework called DeepSC
    based on the Transformer [23], which can recover the meaning of sentences through
    semantic information, thus minimizing semantic errors during transmission. Zhou
    et al. [24] proposed a cognitive semantic communication framework that utilizes
    knowledge graphs, which has good data compression rates and communication reliability.
    In addition to text-based semantic communication, some literature also proposes
    semantic communication methods applied to images. Lokumarambage et al. [25] obtained
    semantic information through semantic segmentation at the transmitter and used
    GAN networks to reconstruct the image at the receiver, greatly saving bandwidth
    resources, but the reconstructed image is slightly different from reality. Zhang
    et al. [26] proposed a neural network-based image transfer semantic communication
    system, where the transmitter can extract and transmit the required semantic information
    in a dynamic environment through a receiver-leading training process without knowing
    the task. Kang et al. [27] proposed a task-oriented semantic communication framework,
    where users can match the semantic information of images by querying text, and
    also consider the resource allocation problem when there are multiple users. Although
    the above literature reduces communication overhead through semantic communication,
    they have not considered the varying importance of semantic information itself,
    which may result in the loss of significant semantic information in the competition
    for channel resources. Therefore, we assign different levels of importance to
    the semantic information extracted from images to ensure the transmission quality
    of critical semantic information by rationally allocating transmission power.
    C. Object Detection In the communication framework proposed in this article, the
    UAV needs to extract the semantic information of the acquired images, i.e., to
    achieve the separation of apples and backgrounds, and the core of achieving this
    is the object detection technique. Apple Detection: In recent years, deep learning-based
    object detection techniques have achieved remarkable success. In contrast to traditional
    algorithms that rely on appearance features, such as shape and color [28], [29],
    deep learning-based techniques demonstrate strong adaptability to different scenarios
    and achieve higher accuracy. Chen et al. [30] utilized the DenseNet network structure
    to optimize the YOLOv4 model, proposing a Des-YOLOv4 algorithm for detecting apples.
    However, the performance of the algorithm significantly deteriorates under low-light
    conditions. Yan et al. [31] proposed an improved YOLOv5 [32] algorithm for real-time
    apple recognition by incorporating squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules and modifying
    the fusion mode of feature maps. Despite the improved performance, the algorithm’s
    effectiveness in detecting small apples is suboptimal. Sun et al. [33] proposed
    a novel balanced feature pyramid network (BFP Net) that enhances the accuracy
    of small apple detection. Nevertheless, the BFP Net has a slower detection speed.
    The above work indicates that it is difficult to balance the detection speed and
    accuracy of the model, and detecting small apples in complex environments remains
    a challenge. With the continuous development of the YOLO series object detectors,
    the YOLOv7 model emerges as a highly advanced and efficient end-to-end object
    detector. It employs a state-of-the-art methodology for detecting objects in an
    image, with exceptional accuracy and real-time performance [34]. However, its
    performance on data set with a considerable number of small apples is slightly
    limited. Thus, we employed it as the baseline model for improving detection performance.
    Data Augmentation: In addition to modifying the model structure to improve detection
    capability, data augmentation is another straightforward and effective approach.
    Data augmentation allows generating additional equally effective data based on
    limited data without altering the essential information of the images. This significantly
    enhances the diversity of the training data, thereby enhancing the model with
    stronger generalization capabilities. Changing the color and shape of images is
    the fundamental and common approach in data augmentation. In this study, we use
    fundamental data augmentation methods, such as randomly altering the hue, saturation,
    and brightness of images, as well as performing random scaling and translation.
    In addition to these basic data augmentation methods, some studies have proposed
    more efficient approaches, such as Mosaic [35] and Mixup [36]. Mosaic involves
    randomly cropping and scaling four images, then combining them into a single image
    for training data. Mixup randomly selects two samples from the training data and
    constructs new training samples and labels through linear interpolation. In this
    work, we use a combination of Mosaic, Mixup, and fundamental methods. In summary,
    we propose a YOLO-based semantic communication and resource allocation framework
    to address the above problems in this article. First, we select the advanced YOLOv7-X
    object detector as the core of the entire system and optimize its performance
    on real data set. Following that, the UAV extracts semantic information from collected
    images using the optimized YOLOv7-X object detector. Then, the UAV allocates transmission
    power based on the importance of semantic information before transmitting, ultimately
    achieving high-quality transmission of critical information. SECTION III. System
    Model In this section, we present the proposed data transmission framework and
    the semantic-based communication approach, followed by an explanation of the metric
    methodology for assessing image semantic information transmission quality. A.
    Design of Semantic Communication and Resource Allocation Framework In data collection
    in DTs, a UAV takes images along a specified trajectory and transmit the data
    to users. However, in wireless communication environments with fading channels,
    the cost of transmitting all data to users at high quality is prohibitive. To
    address this issue, we propose a semantic communication framework based on YOLO,
    as shown in Fig. 1. We first simulate the images captured by the UAV using real
    apple data set. After the collection task is completed, the UAV uses the trained
    YOLOv7-X object detector to extract semantic information behind the image that
    people need and transmit them. At the same time, we quantify the importance of
    each semantic information based on the confidence generated by the object detector
    and allocate transmission power accordingly to ensure the transmission quality
    of important information. The problem of optimal power allocation schemes is introduced
    in Section IV. It is worth noting that the semantic extraction model is a flexible
    module. When faced with user interest in other single or multiple classes of objects
    in the captured image, this module can be replaced with other pretrained YOLO
    series models or alternative object detectors to assist users in extracting useful
    information. By employing other well-trained object detectors, our semantic communication
    framework can expand its applicability, enabling the extraction and transmission
    of useful information about different objects in images according to user demands.
    Fig. 1. Illustration of the YOLO-based semantic communication system model. Show
    All B. Semantic Communication Solution In conventional communication paradigms,
    edge devices transmit the entirety of the acquired image data to facilitate continuous
    data synchronization for DTs, resulting in voluminous data traffic. This imposes
    substantial burdens on both edge devices and the communication infrastructure.
    To illustrate, in smart agriculture, users deploy UAVs for image capture [37].
    However, oftentimes, only a portion of the captured content is relevant to users,
    e.g., ripening fruits. Utilizing such an inefficient communication approach for
    transmitting all images leads to the excessive consumption of communication resources
    and energy for UAVs, thereby exacerbating resource wastage. The development of
    semantic communication provides a solution to the aforementioned problems. Upon
    completing the designated data acquisition task, the UAV transmits only the pertinent
    semantic features extracted from the captured images, rather than the entire data
    set. The transmission of these semantic features requires minimal channel resources
    and facilitates efficient data storage for users. In the virtual orchard, users,
    e.g., fruit growers, are primarily more concerned about the status of the fruits.
    As a result, we discard irrelevant background and interference factors before
    transmitting the images, ensuring that users only receive the semantic information
    they are interested in, which helps reduce transmission cost. C. Semantic Communication
    Quality Analysis To evaluate the quality of semantic communication, we propose
    a metric for image semantic transmission (MIST) in this work, which involves combining
    the importance weights of each semantic information with their respective transmission
    quality to obtain the final evaluation result. Considering that a UAV needs to
    send an image to the user after capturing it, semantic information is first extracted
    by the object detector. Specifically, a total of U apple objects are detected,
    with i denoting the i th object and c i denoting its corresponding confidence.
    The relationship between the importance score W i and the confidence c i of the
    object i can be represented as W i = c i σ , where σ is a variable that adjusts
    the importances among different semantic information. The final semantic transmission
    quality score can be represented as follows: E(A, W i ,Q( p i ))=A ∑ i=1 U ( W
    i ×Q( p i )) (1) View Source where A represents the accuracy of semantic information
    extraction, i.e., the performance evaluation metric Average Precision at 0.5 Intersection
    over Union (AP@0.5) of the object detector, and Q( p i ) represents the structure
    similarity index measure (SSIM) [38] value of object i before and after transmission,
    which is a function that is positively correlated with the transmission power
    p i according to [27]. Therefore, considering the definition of the communication
    system in this article, our goal is to maximize the MIST while satisfying the
    transmission power constraint, which can be expressed as follows: max A, W i ,
    p i ∑ i=1 U E(A, W i ,Q( p i ))) (2) View Source ∑ i=1 U p i ≤P c i ∈[ c min ,1]
    (2a) (2b) View Source where the constraint in (2a) is the total transmitted power,
    and c min in (2b) is the confidence threshold, the objects with confidence below
    this value are not detected by the detector. In this study, we set the variable
    σ=1 and the confidence threshold c min =0.25 by default. The proposed MIST considers
    not only the transmission quality of each semantic information but also their
    respective significance, which can provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment
    of the performance of these methods. SECTION IV. YOLO-Based Semantic Communication
    System Design The YOLOv7-X object detector is a critical component of the overall
    communication system. It aids UAVs in extracting semantic information from images
    and subsequently quantifying the semantic information’s importance to facilitate
    optimal transmission power allocation. In this section, we present the motivation
    for choosing YOLO and provide a detailed exposition of YOLOv7-X, along with the
    improvements made. Subsequently, we discuss two distinct resource allocation schemes
    in data transmission. A. Overview of YOLOv7-X The motivation for selecting YOLO
    as the semantic extraction model in our study stems from several key factors.
    First, YOLO has demonstrated exceptional performance in real-time object detection
    tasks, making it a suitable choice for various applications. Its ability to achieve
    high accuracy while maintaining impressive inference speed aligns with our goal
    of efficiently detecting and extracting semantic information from apple images
    in real-world scenarios. Moreover, YOLO’s end-to-end architecture contributes
    to its simplicity and ease of implementation. This feature not only simplifies
    the overall model structure but also reduces computational complexity, making
    it suitable for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices like UAVs.
    Furthermore, in the application scenario of our article, the confidence generated
    by the YOLO model effectively measures the importance of the object’s semantic
    information. This aids in efficient semantic communication by prioritizing and
    transmitting important features, thus ensuring optimal power allocation for the
    information. YOLOv7 has seven different models of varying sizes, including YOLOv7-tiny,
    YOLOv7, YOLOv7-X, and YOLOv7-W6, among others, which are suitable for different
    application environments. Considering both model complexity and detection performance,
    we select YOLOv7-X as the base model for improvement. The YOLOv7-X model can be
    divided into three parts: 1) Input; 2) Backbone; and 3) Head. Specifically, the
    Input resizes the input image to the required training size. The Backbone component
    includes multiple CBS convolutions, max pooling convolution (MPConv), efficient
    layer aggregation network in YOLOv7-X (ELAN-X) modules, and an SPPCSPC module.
    The CBS convolution consists of a convolutional layer, a batch normalization layer
    (BN), and a sigmoid linear unit (SiLU) activation function. ELAN-X extends the
    efficient layer aggregation network (ELAN) module by increasing its depth and
    width, and enhances the learning capability of the network by guiding the computation
    blocks to learn more diverse features of different feature groups. The MPConv
    module adds a Maxpool layer on top of CBS and strengthens the feature extraction
    ability by merging features from the top and bottom branches. The SPPCSPC module
    is similar to the spatial pyramid pooling-fast (SPPF) used by YOLOv5 [32], which
    increases a network’s receptive field. The Head component employs the same path
    aggregation feature pyramid network (PAFPN) [39] architecture as YOLOv5 to efficiently
    fuse features from multiple levels. Finally, the fused and enhanced feature map
    is fed to three detection heads to generate predictions for confidence, object
    category, and anchor boxes. B. Model Enhancement Methods ELAN-H: The ELAN-X module
    in YOLOv7-X is an efficient network structure that enables the network to learn
    more features and have stronger robustness by controlling the shortest and longest
    gradient paths. The structure of ELAN-X is shown in Fig. 4. The shortest branch
    passes through only one CBS convolution to change the number of channels, while
    the longest branch extracts features through seven CBS convolutions. The feature
    maps extracted by each branch are concatenated through the Concatenation (Concat)
    operation as the final result of feature-enhanced fusion. ELAN-X is repeatedly
    used in the Neck to improve the model’s learning capability. However, too many
    branches and convolution operations also increase model complexity and parameter
    size, leading to increased processing time and consumption of computing resources.
    Therefore, we reduce the depth and width of this module without breaking its original
    architecture, changing the number of CBS in the longest branch to three and correspondingly
    decreasing the number of output feature maps to four. In addition, to compensate
    for the decrease in detection performance caused by simplifying this module, we
    replace one CBS convolution in the long branch with Hornet Block [40] to enhance
    the module’s ability to learn important features. Finally, this module, named
    ELAN-H, has a structure shown in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2. ELAN-H model structure with
    HorNet. (a) ELAN-H model structure, which stacks feature maps from different levels

    and head, and basic components: CBS, MPConv, UP, SPPCSPC, SimAM, and two ELAN
    NPSabbrpl with different structures, namely, ELAN-X and ELAN-H. Show All Here,
    the Hornet block is a design based on Recursive Gated Convolution ( g n Conv)
    . The output of the gated convolution y=gConv(x) can be represented as follows:
    [ p 0 HW×C , q HW×C 0 ]= ϕ in (x)∈ R HW×2C p 1 =f( q 0 )⊙ p 0 ∈ R HW×C ,y= ϕ out
    ( p 1 )∈ R HW×C (3) (4) View Source where x∈ R HW×C represents the input features
    which are linearly projected to obtain p 0 and q 0 . Then, q 0 is subjected to
    depth-wise convolution and multiplied with p 0 to obtain p 1 . Finally, p 1 is
    projected linearly again to yield the output y . High-order spatial interaction
    requires the implementation of gated convolutions with recursive designs. Initially,
    a higher-order linear projection is applied to x resulting in p 0 and q k (k=0,1,…,n−1)
    . Subsequently, recursive gated convolutions are executed to generate p k+1 .
    The output of y= g n Conv(x) can be mathematically expressed as follows: = p k+1
    = g k = C k = [ p 0 HW× C 0 , q HW× C 0 0 ,…, q HW× C n−1 n−1 ] ϕ in (x)∈ R HW×(
    C 0 + ∑ 0≤k≤n−1 C k ) f k ( q k )⊙ g k ( p k )/α,k=0,1,…,n−1 { Identity,k = 0,
    Linear( C k−1 , C k ),1≤k≤n−1 C 2 n−k−1 ,0≤k≤n−1 (5) (6) (7) (8) View Source where
    { g k } are utilized to match the dimension in various orders and { f k } are
    depth-wise convolution layers. As depicted in Fig. 2(b), the HorNet block employs
    a block-wise design inspired by Transformer [23] and replace the self-attention
    sublayer with g n Conv that have high-order spatial modeling capability. We replace
    all ELAN-X modules in the Neck with ELAN-H modules, which can better fuse and
    enhance the image features extracted by the Backbone, leading to improved detection
    performance while reducing model complexity. SimAM [41]: The attention module
    can assign different weights to different channels or regions in space, thereby
    helping the model to focus on extracting more important information. Existing
    attention mechanisms typically generate corresponding 1-D or 2-D weights in the
    channel or spatial dimension, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), such as BAM [42],
    which parallelly connects two kinds of attention, and CBAM [43], which serially
    connects them. However, they treat each neuron in every channel or spatial position
    equally during the generation process. This limitation restricts their ability
    to learn more discriminative cues, while in the human brain, these two types of
    attention often occur simultaneously [41]. As shown in Fig. 3(c), SimAM is a unified
    weight attention module that can derive 3-D attention weights for feature maps
    without requiring additional parameters. In visual neuroscience, the most informative
    neurons typically exhibit discharge patterns that differ from those of surrounding
    neurons, and active neurons tend to inhibit surrounding neurons [44]. Drawing
    inspiration from this, the SimAM module designs an energy function to measure
    the linear separability between neurons, thereby identifying important neurons.
    The energy function is defined as follows: e t ( w t , b t ,y, x i )= 1 M−1 ∑
    i=1 M−1 (−1−( w t x i + b t )) 2 + (1−( w t t+ b t )) 2 +λ w 2 t (9) View Source
    where t denotes the target neuron and x i denotes other neurons in a single channel
    of the input feature x∈ R HW×C , i is index over spatial dimension, and M is the
    number of neurons. w t and b t are weight and bias the transform. Subsequently,
    by computing the closed-form solutions of variables w t and b t , and substituting
    them into (9). The minimum energy can be obtained as follows: e ∗ t = 4( σ ^ 2
    +λ) (t− μ ^ ) 2 +2 μ ^ 2 +2λ . (10) View Source The expression in (10) indicates
    that a smaller energy value corresponds to a greater linear separability between
    neuron t and other neurons, which signifies higher importance. Following the definition
    of attention mechanisms, the SimAM module can be expressed as follows: x ~ =sigmoid(
    1 E )⊙x (11) View Source where E is a classification function for all energy functions
    e ∗ t in both channel and spatial dimensions. The sigmoid function ensures that
    the larger values in E are constrained, thereby not affecting the relative importance
    of each neuron. We integrate SimAM modules into the Neck section of the YOLOv7-X
    model, which helps the model to better focus on targets without introducing additional
    parameters. YOLOv7-HS: The improved architecture of the YOLOv7-X model is depicted
    in Fig. 4. We enhance the YOLOv7-X model using the above methods to make it more
    suitable for the Minneapple data set, and named it YOLOv7-HS. C. Resource Allocation
    in Semantic Communication After the UAV obtains the semantic information of images,
    a straightforward approach is to transmit it equally to users. However, due to
    the limited bandwidth resources in wireless transmission, semantic information
    is susceptible to signal attenuation during transmission, consequently affecting
    communication quality. Simultaneously, as nearly every original image is cropped
    into numerous apple images, and considering the highly complex orchard environment
    and the inherent limitations of the detection model, the importance of each cropped
    image (e.g., apple completeness and cropping accuracy) varies. The average allocation
    method (named Avg-SemCom) faces intense competition for scarce wireless channel
    resources among multiple images, resulting in the discarding of crucial images.
    Therefore, we propose a Confidence-based Semantic Communication (Conf-SemCom)
    method, which allocates transmission power by quantifying the importance of semantic
    information to ensure the transmission quality of important data. The correlation
    between an object detector’s confidence and the object it identifies is significant.
    Generally, the confidence of a detected object is positively correlated with the
    amount of semantic features it contains. As illustrated in Fig. 5, apples f ,
    g , and h exhibit relatively complete and rich characteristic information of apples,
    making them easily detectable with a high confidence. While apples a and c are
    heavily obscured by leaves, resulting in low confidence scores for all of them.
    The semantic information of these low-confidence objects, after being cropped,
    is far less important than the other objects, and they should not occupy too much
    power during wireless transmission. In summary, the Conf-SemCom method can ensure
    that more important information is successfully transmitted to users. Fig. 5.
    Results of apple detection comprise anchor boxes and corresponding confidence
    values for each object, apples a to f are sorted in ascending order of confidence
    scores. Furthermore, the cropped images are resized to the same height for ease
    of viewing. Show All Specifically, we prioritize sorting based on the confidence
    c i of each object i and allocate more transmission power with a higher priority
    weight w i . The definition of w i is as follows: w i = c i η (12) View Source
    we use the variable η to adjust the relative difference in power allocation between
    different semantic information. The proposed Conf-SemCom is summarized in Algorithm
    1 with the corresponding pseudo code. Algorithm 1 Resource Allocation in Conf-SemCom

    D. Diffusion-Based Resource Allocation Diffusion Model: The diffusion model has
    emerged as a new state-of-the-art deep generative model [45]. The fundamental
    concept of the diffusion model entails systematically perturbing the distribution
    of data during the forward diffusion process by introducing the Gaussian noise.
    Subsequently, the data distribution is recovered through the reverse diffusion
    process, which can be viewed as a denoising procedure. Specifically, within the
    forward diffusion process, by iteratively adding Gaussian noise T times to any
    initial sample x 0 , we can obtain x 1 , x 2 ,…, x T . As T approaches infinity,
    the original features of sample x 0 completely vanish and become pure Gaussian
    noise. This process can be represented as follows: q( x 1 ,…, x T ∣ x 0 )= q(
    x t ∣ x t−1 ):= ∏ t=1 T q( x t ∣ x t−1 ) N( x t ; 1− β t − − − − − √ x t−1 , β
    t I) (13) (14) View Source where β t is a parameter that controls the progress
    of noise. From (14), it can be inferred that given the sample x t−1 , the sample
    x t at time t follows a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 1− β t − − − − −
    √ x t−1 and a variance of β t I . The parameters under this condition only depend
    on the x t(!−!)1 at the previous time step. Therefore, the diffusion process is
    a Markov process. When β t is sufficiently small, the reverse diffusion process
    q( x t(!−!)1 ∣ x t , x 0 ) is the posterior probability distribution of the forward
    diffusion process q( x t ∣ x t−1 ) . In order to achieve incremental sampling
    from the Gaussian noise x T to obtain real samples, it is necessary for the generative
    model p θ ( x 0:T ) to learn sufficiently good parameters θ from the training
    samples. This process can be represented as follows: p θ ( x 0:T )= p θ ( x t−1
    ∣ x t )= p( x T ) ∏ t=1 T p θ ( x t−1 ∣ x t ) N( x t−1 ; μ θ ( x t ,t), Σ θ (
    x t ,t)) (15) (16) View Source where p( x T )=N( x T ;0,I) . Finally, the reverse
    diffusion process can be achieved by utilizing a well-trained p θ ( x t−1 ∣ x
    t ) to approximate q( x t(!−!)1 ∣ x t , x 0 ) . AI-Generated Power Allocation
    Scheme: Motivated by diffusion model-based AI-generated contract [46], we propose
    an AI-generated power allocation scheme. In deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
    the intelligent agent learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment
    to maximize cumulative rewards. As shown in Fig. 6, the AI-generated algorithm
    is capable of addressing the challenges posed by high-dimensional state spaces
    and complex action spaces. Compared to the aforementioned two methods, i.e., Avg-SemCom
    and Conf-SemCom, this method exhibits superior performance in generating resource
    allocation schemes. Specifically, we represent the environment using the vector
    e , which encompasses various factors, such as the wireless channel model, the
    transmission power P , and the number of objects U involved in the semantic communication.
    In this given environment, our objective is to maximize the expected cumulative
    reward across a series of time steps, aiming to determine the transmission power
    weights w i for each object. Fig. 6. Design principles of diffusion model. The
    diffusion model performs multistep denoising on noise and generates an optimal
    allocation scheme. Show All We first construct a generative model π θ (w∣e) that
    can map the environmental state e . The reverse process of the conditional diffusion
    model can be represented as follows: π θ (w∣e)= = p θ ( w 0:N ∣e) N( w N ;0,I)
    ∏ i=1 N p θ ( w j−1 ∣ w j ,e) (17) View Source where p θ ( w j−1 ∣ w j ,e) can
    be modeled as a Gaussian distribution N( w j−1 ; μ θ ( w j ,e,j), Σ θ ( w j ,e,j))
    . According to denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) [47], the covariance
    matrix Σ θ ( w j ,e,j) of this Gaussian distribution is β j I , and the mean μ
    θ ( w j ,e,j) can be represented as (1/ α j − − √ )( w j −( β j )/ 1− α ¯ j −
    − − − − √ ) ε θ ( w j ,e,j)) . Initially, we sample w N ∼N(0,I) , and then from
    the reverse diffusion chain parameterized by θ as follows: w j−1 | w j = 1 α j
    − − √ ( w j − β j 1− α ¯ j − − − − − √ ε θ ( w j ,e,j))+ β j − − √ ε. (18) View
    Source From (18), as can be seen that the result is only related to w j and the
    added noise ε . Therefore, the training of the denoising process π θ can be achieved
    by training ε θ . Subsequently, we use the quality network Q v to train the ε
    θ , which represents the expected cumulative reward that an agent takes an allocation
    scheme in the current state and executes accordingly. The objective function that
    needs to be optimized becomes π= argmin π θ L(θ)=− E w 0 ∼ π θ [ Q v (e, w 0 )].
    (19) View Source Utilizing the double Q -learning method [48], the network Q v
    is learned by minimizing the Bellman operator. Consequently, we construct two
    networks, specifically Q v 1 and Q v 2 , along with corresponding target networks
    Q v ′ 1 , Q v ′ 2 , and π θ ′ . The optimization of v 1 and v 2 is achieved by
    minimizing the objective E w 0 t+1 ∼ π θ ′ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ (r(e, w t )+γ min i=1,2
    Q v ′ i (e, w 0 t+1 )) − Q v i (e, w t ) ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ . (20) View Source
    In DRL, we set the training parameters: batch size N b , discount factor γ , diffusion
    step N , soft target update parameter τ , and exploration noise ϵ . The loss function
    can be represented as follows: L= 1 N b ∑ j ( r j +γ Q ′ v ′ ( e j , w ′ o t )−
    Q v ( e j , w j )) 2 . (21) View Source Then, we can obtain the optimal allocation
    scheme based on the wireless communication environment. The detail of the AI-generated
    scheme is shown in Algorithm 2. Additionally, the trained diffusive model requires
    only five denoising process steps during inference to achieve optimized power
    allocation schemes. Its low computational complexity avoids excessive resource
    consumption. Algorithm 2 Diffusion Model-Based AI-Generated Scheme Training: 1:

    primarily presents the experimental settings, materials, and results in this study.
    Initially, we evaluate the effectiveness of the improvements made to the object
    detector YOLOv7-X and compare its performance with other state-of-the-art models.
    Subsequently, we assess the performance of the proposed YOLO-based semantic communication
    system, verify the cost savings of semantic communication, and examine the impact
    of two proposed power allocation schemes on the transmission quality for critical
    information. A. Environment Setup The experimental platform is built on a generic
    Ubuntu 20.04 system with 2 Intel Xeon Silver 4110 CPUs and GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.
    The parameters of the object detection model training process used are shown in
    Table I. The MinneApple data set [49] is the apple image data set used in this
    experiment. It is a publicly available data set utilized for apple detection and
    segmentation, containing images of multiple apple varieties at different stages
    of growth, with a large number of densely packed small apples. The MinneApple
    data set contains a total of 670 labeled images and 331 unlabeled images. Fig.
    7 shows example images from the MinneApple data set. TABLE I Object Detection
    Models Training Parameters Fig. 7. Partial overview of MinneApple data set. Show
    All We use the Fisher-Snedecor F channel model [27] in wireless semantic communication
    to analyze the performance of our model. The small-scale fading between the UAV
    and users is represented by the Fisher–Snedecor F fading distribution, while small-scale
    variations follow the Nakagami- m distribution and shadowing follows the inverse
    Nakagami- m distribution [27]. We set the fading parameter m f = 6, the shadowing
    parameter m s = 6 and the transmit power P= 3000 W by default. In addition, the
    parameters of the resource allocation scheme generated by the AI-generated algorithm
    during the training process are shown in Table II. TABLE II Diffusion Model-Based
    AI-Generated Algorithm Training Parameters B. Results and Analysis Results of
    Ablation Experiment: To evaluate the effectiveness of the ELAN-H and SimAM attention
    modules, we utilize the amount of parameters and computational complexity, i.e.,
    floating point operations (FLOPs), as well as AP@0.5 and AP@0.5:0.95 as indicators
    to measure the performance of the models, where AP@0.5 and AP@0.5:0.95 are commonly
    used evaluation standards in object detection, with higher values indicating better
    model performance. From the results in Table III, the utilization of the ELAN-H
    module leads to 1.3% and 1.7% increases in AP@0.5 and AP@0.5:0.95, respectively,
    while reducing the amount of parameters by 24% and FLOPs by 19%. The incorporation
    of the SimAM attention module enhances the value of AP@0.5 by 0.8%, with no changes
    to the amount of parameters and FLOPs. TABLE III Results of Ablation Experiment
    Comparison With Other State-of-the-Art Object Detectors: We conduct a performance
    comparison of our enhanced YOLOv7-X model with other advanced object detection
    models. In addition to the comparison items presented in Table III, we also compare
    the detection speed. As shown in Table IV, our proposed model achieves the best
    performance in terms of AP@0.5 compared to other models. Although the performance
    difference between our proposed model and other advanced YOLO series models is
    not significant, our model greatly reduces the amount of parameters and FLOPs
    while achieving the fastest detection speed. However, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet,
    and FCOS models, although having smaller parameter size, perform poorly on the
    MinneApple data set, which contains many small objects, and their detection performance
    fails to meet the requirements of our proposed scenarios. TABLE IV Comparison
    of State-of-the-Art Object Detectors The Effects of Reducing Communication Overhead:
    We use 331 unannotated test images from the MinneApple data set as the images
    to be sent by the UAV. Fig. 8 illustrates a comparison between the data size of
    images transmitted through conventional communication methods and the data size
    resulting from semantic communication after the implementation of semantic feature
    extraction. The aggregate size of the original images amounts to 595.2 MB. However,
    following semantic feature extraction, the volume of data required for transmission
    by edge devices is considerably reduced to 55.4 MB, encompassing 54.8 MB of image
    format data and 0.6 MB of text format data. This reduction corresponds to a 91%
    decrease in communication costs, thereby substantially minimizing power consumption
    during transmission. Fig. 8. Comparison of transferred bytes for each image in
    the two communication methods. Show All The Effect of η on Conf-SemCom: Given
    that the textual data required for transmission by the UAV is considerably smaller
    than image data, we focus solely on the impact of wireless transmission environments
    on the semantic information transfer of image formats. Taking Fig. 5 as an example,
    the UAV first detects that the image contains 30 objects and then allocates power
    for transmission according to the confidence of each object. We first show the
    effectiveness of the proposed Conf-SemCom method. Additionally, to investigate
    the impact of variable η on the transmission performance, we increase η from 0.25
    to 1.5 and the transmission distance from 10 to 30 m. Each experiment is repeated
    100 times, and the average results are shown. The curves of transmission quality
    values (i.e., MIST scores) are shown in Fig. 9. It can be observed that due to
    allocating more resources to important information, Conf-SmeCom outperforms the
    Avg-SemCom method in most cases, with its effectiveness becoming more evident
    as the transmission distance increases. Furthermore, the optimal value of variable
    η varies across different transmission distances. At transmission distances of
    10, 20, and 30 m, the highest MIST scores are achieved when η equals 0.5, 0.75,
    and 1, respectively. This indicates that appropriately increasing the value of
    variable η as the transmission distance increases, while keeping the total power
    P unchanged, allows for a better enhancement of overall communication quality
    by increasing the transmission power p i for more significant objects i . Fig.
    9. Curves of transmission quality scores with different weight adjustment variables
    η and transmission distance D . (a) Transmission Distance D=10 m. (b) Transmission
    Distance D=20 m. (c) Transmission Distance D=30 m. Show All The Effects of Power
    Allocation: We investigate the impact of two power allocation methods, i.e., Avg-SemCom
    and Conf-SemCom, on the transmission quality of images with different levels of
    confidence, over different transmission distances (i.e., 10, 20, and 30 m). As
    shown in Fig. 10, the horizontal axis represents the 30 detected images, sorted
    in ascending order of confidence levels, and the vertical axis represents the
    bit error rate (BER) values derived from the channel model according to the allocated
    power. It is evident that, as the distance increases, the image transmission quality
    declines for both communication methods. However, Conf-SemCom opts to allocate
    more power to semantically important information, resulting in reduced error rates
    for crucial semantic information even under poor channel conditions. Fig. 10.
    BER of images at different transmission distances under two transmission methods.
    Show All To facilitate a comprehensive comparison between the two power allocation
    methods, Fig. 11 illustrates the transmission performance of select images at
    various communication distances. We use SSIM to evaluate the transmission quality
    of each object. From Fig. 11, the transmitted image quality for both methods degrades
    significantly as the transmission distance increases. Moreover, due to the uniformed
    distribution of transmission power, the SSIM values transmitted by Avg-SemCom
    for each image exhibit a relatively uniform and irregular pattern, resulting in
    certain critical images possessing inferior transmission quality compared to original
    images. For instance, apples a and c are heavily occluded and contain very little
    usable information. The significance of semantic features for these images is
    less than that for other images. However, their transmission quality surpasses
    that of other images, which is unreasonable. In contrast, Conf-SemCom allocates
    increased power to salient images, enabling the high-quality transmission of these
    images even in poor channel conditions. Fig. 11. Transmission effects and corresponding
    SSIM values of partial images at different transmission distances. The odd-numbered
    rows are Conf-SemCom and the even-numbered rows are Avg-SemCom. Show All The Effects
    of AI-Generated Scheme: We compare the diffusion model-based AI-generated scheme
    with two other transmission power allocation methods for transmitting semantic
    information at the transmission distance D= 20 m and the transmission power P=
    4 kW. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the diffusion model-based AI-generated algorithm
    exhibits rapid training speed during the optimization of power allocation schemes,
    surpassing the confidence-based allocation scheme at approximately 500 iterations.
    The superiority of the AI-generated approach primarily stems from the exploration
    conducted through the diffusion method, which enhances the flexibility of strategies
    and prevents the model from getting trapped in suboptimal solutions. Furthermore,
    it is evident that the Avg-SemCom method significantly underperforms in terms
    of the MIST score compared to the other two schemes, indicating the necessity
    of considering the importance of semantic information during the communication
    process. Fig. 12. Comparison of the training process of the diffusion model-based
    AI-generated algorithm and the results of two other methods (i.e., Avg-SemCom
    and Conf-SemCom), with transmission distance D= 20 m and transmission power P=
    4 kW. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In this article, we have proposed a YOLO-based
    semantic communication framework for developing a virtual apple orchard case,
    focusing on optimizing semantic information transmission and resource allocation
    for images collected by edge devices. Initially, we have enhanced the performance
    of the object detector YOLOv7-X on a real apple data set and have employed the
    optimized object detector to extract semantic information from images captured
    by edge devices, aiming to reduce transmission costs. Furthermore, to ensure the
    high-quality transmission of essential semantic information, we have allocated
    resource based on the significance of their semantic content. Specifically, we
    have allocated the transmission power of semantic information based on the confidence
    generated by the object detection algorithm and the scheme generated by the diffusion
    model-based AI-generated algorithm, respectively. Numerical results have demonstrated
    that the proposed framework and strategy have considerably reduced communication
    costs and have markedly improved the transmission quality of important information
    during communication. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This

  description: Fifth-generation (5G) technology provides new possibilities for a variety
    of applications, but it also comes with challenges influenced by distinct aspects,
    such as the size of organizations that use such technology. Therefore, it is important
    to understand which architecture of 5G-radio access networks (RANs) is best for
    a given purpose; this requires an evaluation platform for assessment. This paper
    tackles this problem by presenting a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)
    solution based on a new integrated fuzzy set. The proposed integrated approach,
    which is based on a Type-2 neutrosophic fuzzy environment, is developed to address
    the application challenges of 5G-RANs architecture evaluation, as also to face
    the MCDM theoretical challenge represented by ambiguities and inconsistencies
    among decision makers within the decision making context of the presented case
    study. Many MCDM techniques for weighting and selection were presented from the
    literature, yet many of them still suffer from inconsistencies and uncertainty.
    Therefore, the chosen methods in this research are unique in a way that previous
    issues are addressed, making them suitable for integration with Type-2 neutrosophic
    fuzzy environment, and therefore creating a more robust decision platform for
    the presented challenge in this research, as a theoretical contribution. First,
    a new “Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy-Weighted Zero-Inconsistency” (T2NN-FWZIC) technique
    is formulated for weighting the evaluation criteria of RAN architectures. Second,
    another new method, namely, “Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy Decision by Opinion Score
    Method” (T2NN-FDOSM), was formulated to select the optimal RAN architecture using
    the obtained weights. The weighting results by T2NN-FWZIC for the (n = 25) evaluation
    criteria revealed that (C21 latency and C22 reliability) as the most important
    criteria, with 0.06 value for each as opposed to (C15 Data Processing) as the
    lowest weighted criteria with 0.0186 value. As for T2NN-FDOSM, a total of four
    5G-RAN architectures were evaluated, including “virtualized cloud RAN” coming
    as the optimal one, followed by “fog RAN,” “cloud RAN,” and finally “heterogeneous
    cloud RAN.” The results were confirmed by carrying out a sensitivity analysis.
    The outcome of this study can be used to assist future 5G-RAN developments according
    to business needs and to establish an assessment platform for 5G technology in
    different domains and applications.

    Get rights and content Abstract Fifth-generation (5G) technology provides new
    possibilities for a variety of applications, but it also comes with challenges
    influenced by distinct aspects, such as the size of organizations that use such
    technology. Therefore, it is important to understand which architecture of 5G-radio
    access networks (RANs) is best for a given purpose; this requires an evaluation
    platform for assessment. This paper tackles this problem by presenting a novel
    multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) solution based on a new integrated fuzzy
    set. The proposed integrated approach, which is based on a Type-2 neutrosophic
    fuzzy environment, is developed to address the application challenges of 5G-RANs
    architecture evaluation, as also to face the MCDM theoretical challenge represented
    by ambiguities and inconsistencies among decision makers within the decision making
    context of the presented case study. Many MCDM techniques for weighting and selection
    were presented from the literature, yet many of them still suffer from inconsistencies
    and uncertainty. Therefore, the chosen methods in this research are unique in
    a way that previous issues are addressed, making them suitable for integration
    with Type-2 neutrosophic fuzzy environment, and therefore creating a more robust
    decision platform for the presented challenge in this research, as a theoretical
    contribution. First, a new “Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy-Weighted Zero-Inconsistency”
    (T2NN-FWZIC) technique is formulated for weighting the evaluation criteria of
    RAN architectures. Second, another new method, namely, “Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy
    Decision by Opinion Score Method” (T2NN-FDOSM), was formulated to select the optimal
    RAN architecture using the obtained weights. The weighting results by T2NN-FWZIC
    for the (n = 25) evaluation criteria revealed that (C21 latency and C22 reliability)
    as the most important criteria, with 0.06 value for each as opposed to (C15 Data
    Processing) as the lowest weighted criteria with 0.0186 value. As for T2NN-FDOSM,
    a total of four 5G-RAN architectures were evaluated, including “virtualized cloud
    RAN” coming as the optimal one, followed by “fog RAN,” “cloud RAN,” and finally
    “heterogeneous cloud RAN.” The results were confirmed by carrying out a sensitivity
    analysis. The outcome of this study can be used to assist future 5G-RAN developments
    according to business needs and to establish an assessment platform for 5G technology
    in different domains and applications. Previous article in issue Next article

    (5G) wireless networking technology is a novel system with the potential to enhance
    user experience and open up exciting new avenues in numerous fields as diverse
    as transportation (Le & Moh, 2021), device-to-device communication (Ansari et
    al., 2017), agriculture (Tang et al., 2021), and industrial production (Cheng
    et al., 2018). Numerous new use cases and applications, including virtual/augmented
    reality, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and tactile Internet
    use cases, are expected with the advent of 5G (Pham et al., 2020). These new use
    cases significantly increase the number of users, volume of traffic, throughput,
    and latency (Pana et al., 2022). Each 5G technology has a unique effect on a mobile
    operator''s capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX),
    which could decrease the performance and implementation of the 5G network if not
    accurately managed (Wu et al., 2021). Some technologies save expenses by a projected
    30%, such as network function virtualization, but others, such as the high-frequency
    spectrum''s unpredictable propagation properties, will increase expenses. Compared
    to earlier mobile network generations (2G, 3G, and LTE), 5G will enable capabilities,
    including data computing for diverse applications, control, and content delivery.
    Despite its significance and potential, 5G technology is prone to challenges encountered
    in other technological advances. For 5G, the challenges include end-to-end latency,
    number of connections, computing cost, and constraints, including end-device battery
    life, computational power, and memory limitations (Pana et al., 2022). Various
    technology approaches for 5G have been proposed in the areas of radio access to
    manage network resources to respond to radio access network (RAN) bottleneck issues
    or poor performance (Khumalo et al., 2021). Network performance depends not only
    on resource management strategies but also on the RAN architecture itself (Khumalo
    et al., 2021). For instance, multi-perspective/criteria are neglected when implementing
    network optimization strategies, as most proposed approaches only consider one
    side (user or network) with no multi-concept/criteria diversity, resulting in
    the degradation of network performance (Ma et al., 2021). The essence is that
    mobile network capacity must be increased to meet the traffic demand, which can
    ensure the suitability/adaptability of RAN architecture to the user traffic load
    in certain geographical locations or times of the day, which vary in terms of
    network traffic, capacity, and latency (multi perspective consideration/criteria).
    Current technologies clearly lack the ability to support such crucial requirements.
    Therefore, industries and researchers need to bring some adaptive and/or multi-perspective
    solutions to 5G networks, both in technologies and architectures core network
    (CN) or RAN (Ma et al., 2021). In the literature, different types of RANs architectures
    have been proposed to overcome the problem of network capacity. These architectures
    are as follows: cloud-RAN (C-RAN), heterogeneous Cloud RAN (H-CRAN), virtualized
    cloud RAN (V-CRAN), and Fog RAN (F-RAN) (Habibi et al., 2022). The C-RAN architecture
    minimizes OPEX, a mobile network operator (MNO), and CAPEX, uses less energy,
    boosts network scalability, simplifies network management and maintenance, increases
    spectrum efficiency and network throughput, and allows for load balancing (Maximidis
    et al., 2023). Recently, a new RAN architecture known as H-CRAN was designed to
    decouple both the control and user network planes to improve the functionality
    and performance of the C-RAN architecture, in which control plane operations are
    performed only at macrobase stations (BSs). In the next H-CRAN, the benefits of
    both heterogeneous networks and C-RANs have been fully exploited, resulting in
    improved spectrum and energy efficiency and increased data throughput (Maximidis
    et al., 2023). The H-CRAN can enhance the 5G network by an Enhanced-Cloud and
    Real-Time Virtualized Baseband Unit (BBU) Pool, Extremely Reliable Transport Network,
    High Number of Macro BSs, and small BSs and Remote Radio Head (RRH) (Goutham &
    Mishra, 2023). However, there are some differences between C-RAN and H-CRAN which
    need to be addressed like having all RRHs in the H-CRAN managed by the BBU pool,
    even in sleep mode, to save power when the traffic load is low (Lorincz et al.,
    2023). Additionally, MNOs can fully leverage the benefits of the next V-CRAN architecture,
    including lower power consumption, lower CAPEX/OPEX, service isolation via virtual
    networks, scalability throughout network upgrades, and responsiveness to non-uniform
    traffic. V-CRAN has several benefits for 5G systems; however, its implementation
    has drawbacks. Most of these problems are caused by C-RAN network function virtualization
    and software-defined networking, both of which affect V-CRAN implementation (Ejaz
    et al., 2020). However, CISCO coined the name “Fog Computing” to describe F-RAN,
    where “fog is a cloud close to the ground” and cloud computing extends to the
    periphery of the network. Computation, communication, control, and decision-making
    processes are selectively moved to the edge of the network in fog computing to
    act on data in milliseconds, assess time-sensitive data close to the IoT device,
    and send gathered information to the cloud data center for long-term storage or
    historical analysis (Dwivedi et al., 2023, Xiang et al., 2020). Fog computing
    places numerous tasks that are typically performed by central servers closer to
    the core of the network to its periphery. The BBU pool, the RRH, and the UEs themselves
    can all execute the collaborative radio signal processing (CRSP) in a fog computing
    environment (such as wearable smart UEs) (Jo et al., 2023). An F-RAN has several
    benefits for 5G mobile networks, but there are also many unanswered questions
    and obstacles. These include standard development, optimal resource allocation,
    backhaul load balancing, theoretical performance analysis, and spectrum/energy
    efficiency (Habibi et al., 2019, Mukherjee et al., 2018). Based on the discussed
    foundations, advantages, and challenges of each RAN, there is an essential need
    to investigate the current state of the evaluation mechanisms and their various
    criteria to be used in the RANs selection process for 5G mobile communication
    systems alongside the proposed evaluation approach in this research, as presented
    in Section 2. In evaluating and selecting RAN architectures for 5G mobile communication
    systems, it is essential to keep in mind that this can provide the basis for serving
    users'' needs, minimizing the number of handoffs, lowering anomaly ratios, and
    increasing the usage of network resources (Zhong et al., 2020). Thus, this study
    contributes to the body of knowledge in this area by developing a novel multi-criteria
    decision making MCDM-based selection approach for RAN architectures of 5G mobile
    communication systems, as follows: 1) To formulate a new evaluation decision matrix
    for 5G mobile communication systems considering the crisscrossing of all available
    RAN criteria and alternative lists of RAN architectures. 2) To evaluate the significance
    levels of RAN evaluation criteria based on a novel MCDM weighting method called
    T2NN-FWZIC (“Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy-Weighted Zero-InConsistency”). 3) Select
    the most optimum RAN architectures based on individual, internal, and external
    group MCDM contexts using a novel MCDM ranking method called T2NN-FDOSM (“Type-2
    Neutrosophic Fuzzy Decision by Opinion Score Method”). 4) To evaluate the robustness
    of the proposed T2NNs-based MCDM approach using several scenario-based sensitivity
    analyses. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses
    related works on the current state of RAN architecture evaluation mechanisms and
    the MCDM-integrated approach. Section 3 outlines basic definitions and preliminaries.
    Section 4 describes the research methodology applied in this research, and Section
    5 discusses a novel case study. Section 6 details the experimental and validation
    results, and section 7 concludes the study. 2. Related works In this section,
    a brief and focused literature review is presented, covering topics such as RAN
    architecture evaluation mechanisms represented in previous academic works, followed
    by literature on the proposed MCDM approach and its theoretical background. 2.1.
    RAN architectures evaluation mechanisms 5G is anticipated to offer various services,
    including the distribution of high-definition videos, automated vehicle driving,
    IoT, and autonomous robots. A RAN offers comprehensive services to numerous technologies
    and devices (de Oliveira et al., 2023). In the 5G era, the RAN must meet elasticity,
    capacity, and scalability specifications to provide various services. However,
    the globalization of service expectations for latency, bandwidth, reliability,
    mobility, and other factors presents challenges for operators to effectively address
    these objectives (Marzouk et al., 2020). 5G necessitates a radical redesign of
    the mobile network architecture, notably, its RAN architecture. This necessitates
    innovative solutions for the needs of mobile consumers and vertical businesses
    in the coming decade. To meet these escalating needs, network operators continue
    to invest in network capability enhancement and usage optimization (Oughton et
    al., 2021). It would be advantageous for end users, developers, network operators,
    cellular vendors, and researchers to have a generic architectural solution to
    allocate requirements from multiple domains (Säily et al., 2020). A universal
    access network is most likely to use RAN capabilities more effectively and offer
    enhanced performance (Khaturia et al., 2021). Investigations on a 5G-RAN design
    that can fulfil these specifications effectively are ongoing (Dangi et al., 2022).
    Different architectures and technologies must be compared fairly in terms of all
    necessary conditions of a 5G fronthaul network, such as delay budgets, bandwidth
    requirements, the complexity of RRH, implementation costs, and the capability
    to accommodate advanced wireless functions, to determine the fronthaul technology
    best suited to meet the unprecedented demands of future 5G wireless networks cost-effectively
    (Alimi et al., 2021). There is still uncertainty about the ideal 5G network platform
    that will enable all areas of innovation to function together and concurrently
    satisfy the demanding Key Performance Indicator (KPIs) (Barakabitze et al., 2020).
    It is crucial to study and compare the performance of 5G core and RAN technologies
    to determine if the needs of 5G-reliant use cases can be met (Mohamed et al.,
    2021). Recommending and deploying intelligent energy management solutions, particularly
    in the RAN, could be an effective way to lower total network operations expenses
    (Chochliouros et al., 2021). Thus, an important question has been risen, which
    is “What is the Current State of RANs Evaluation Mechanisms and Existing Research
    Gap?” A detailed procedure for high-level evaluations, including complexity, imprint,
    latency, scalability, resource efficiency, and dimensionality analysis, providing
    insightful and practical instructions on the feasibility of RAN architectures,
    was proposed by (Säily et al., 2020). It is generally understood that 5G mobile
    networks must be evaluated using concepts/criteria, such as capacity, data rate,
    lower E2E latency, massive device connectivity, reduced capital and operations
    costs, and consistent QoE provisioning. Authors in (Niu et al., 2014) discussed
    the main RAN architecture options considered for 5G network evolution in terms
    of energy efficiency, CAPEX and OPEX, capacity, and traffic offloading. In (Tinini
    et al., 2020), the authors described a hybrid architecture that focuses on the
    dynamic activation and deactivation of both network and processing resources to
    balance the cloud and fog. The authors then developed a performance evaluation
    model to analyze the performance of the various metrics of the proposed architecture.
    For example, different C-RAN technologies have been evaluated using the capacity,
    power consumption, delay, and reliability performance metrics. The authors of
    (Mitsolidou et al., 2019) proposed and analyzed an optical fronthaul 5G C-RAN
    architecture to satisfy the latency, energy demands, and bandwidth of densely
    populated hotspots. The work of (Ramantas et al., 2018) proposes the development
    of a comprehensive 5G platform utilising the C-RAN architecture. The platform
    is designed to incorporate a completely virtualized RAN, an optical/wireless Fronthaul,
    and a cloud-based backend. Multiple fronthaul topologies for 5G networks were
    compared objectively by the authors of (Ranaweera et al., 2017). The applicability
    of three fronthaul technologies (PLS, ARoF, and CPRI) for C-RAN architecture was
    investigated and evaluated in terms of 5G latency and capacity requirements, complexity
    of RRH, and deployment costs of these architectures to endorse advances in wireless
    characteristics such as cooperative communication. The authors used subjective
    evaluation criteria, such as latency, capacity, complexity of RRH, cooperative
    communication, and cost for the evaluation process. Authors in (Chabbouh et al.,
    2017) used subjective evaluation values for C-RAN evaluation based on five criteria:
    throughput, site OPEX, transport costs, and pooling/cloud automation benefits.
    The most relevant study is what the authors proposed in (Habibi et al., 2019),
    in which they used 25 subjective evaluation criteria to evaluate four 5G-RAN architectures.
    The proposed criteria are as follows: storage, caching, control, communication
    functions, management, Cooperative Radio Resource Management(CRRM), decoupling
    of control/user planes, backhaul interface, heterogeneity, edge networking complexity,
    fronthaul complexity, BBU pool complexity, RRH complexity, UEs complexity, data
    processing, burden on fronthaul, burden on BBU pool, burden CN, inter-tier interference,
    transmission delay, latency, reliability, energy consumption, CAPEX, and OPEX.
    (Habibi et al., 2019) evaluated different RAN architectures and ignored the selection
    of optimum architectures for 5G mobile communication systems, which is considered
    a research gap in the existing literature review. To bridge this, another essential
    question has been posed: “What are the Technical Issues for RAN Architectures
    Selection?” In the literature, the majority of proposed evaluation methods/techniques
    concentrate on specific attributes, specific layers, and specific traffic types
    of the network protocol stack without considering the differences in user preference
    and multiple traffic types, which frequently lead to unbalanced network loads,
    ping-pong handoffs (invalid handoffs), ranking anomaly phenomena, and in severe
    cases, service interruption (Zhong et al., 2020). The literature shows that not
    all articles consider all the existing RAN evaluation criteria (Habibi et al.,
    2019). This can reduce the credibility of choosing the right architecture, as
    criteria diversity and a wide range of aspects are not considered during the 5G-RAN
    selection process. Additionally, the importance of each criterion varies significantly,
    and these criteria are not equally important during the selection process. The
    selection of the most significant criterion depends on the evaluator''s preferences,
    which are subjective and vary among evaluators. In addition, 5G-RAN supports the
    network-slicing concept, which allows specific groups or communities to have their
    own QoS and KPI performance based on sociodemographic and geographical factors
    (Abiko et al., 2020). Both the network- and customer-related aspects should be
    considered when selecting the most suitable RAN. In decision making, it is essential
    to consider both network- and customer-centric principles. Choosing the appropriate
    number and type of criteria for this decision-making challenge is crucial. The
    criteria type will aid in considering the network criteria, which are critical
    for selecting the RAN (Gaur et al., 2021). However, several factors affect the
    system performance. Having too few criteria will not lead to wise decisions, whereas
    having too many criteria may cause the system performance to deteriorate (Gaur
    et al., 2021). For instance, a dense (heterogeneous) community in a city location
    requires an architecture that provides reliable (redundant) services, which is
    different from a suburban (less heterogeneous) community that requires less reliability
    in QoS. Accordingly, evaluators can define different weighting values for each
    criterion (Säily et al., 2020). Third, it can be seen from the work proposed in
    (Habibi et al., 2019) that some 5G-RANs criteria are affected directly when some
    other criteria increase or decrease, causing a trade-off or conflict issue. For
    example, H-CRAN has a relatively high level of heterogeneity compared to C-RAN.
    To meet the requirements of a 5G mobile network, V-CRAN and F-RAN require a high
    level of heterogeneity owing to the increased number of UEs and capacity demands
    (Al-Tarawneh, 2023). It is important to note that a larger level of heterogeneity
    results in multiple interferences, hence limiting performance increases and commercial
    deployments of RANs architectures (Ejaz et al., 2020). In addition, the inter-tier
    interference requirement is inversely related to the heterogeneity level requirement.
    Hence, the level of heterogeneity was greater in H-CRAN than in F/V C-RAN and
    C-RAN, which were medium and low, respectively (Habibi et al., 2019). The presence
    of all these technical challenges necessitates the consideration of a multi-criteria
    decision-making (MCDM) complicated problem in the evaluation and selection process.
    Thus, selecting a 5G architecture is a complex task due to the numerous factors
    and trade-offs involved. This decision-making process can be approached using
    MCDM problem, where various criteria are considered simultaneously to evaluate
    and rank alternative solutions. A mathematical representation of a simplified
    5G architecture selection problem could be as follows: Let''s consider three potential
    5G architectures: Architecture A, Architecture B, and Architecture C. We want
    to select the best architecture based on three criteria: Performance (P), Cost
    (C), and Future-Proofing (F). We can represent the performance, cost, and future-proofing
    scores for each architecture as seen in Table 1. Table 1. Problem Example. Architecture
    / Criteria Performance (P) Cost (C) Future-Proofing (F) Architecture A Architecture
    B Architecture C We also assign weights to each criterion to represent its relative
    importance in the decision-making process: • Weight of Performance: • Weight of
    Cost: • Weight of Future-Proofing: The overall score (S) for each architecture
    can be calculated using a weighted sum: • • • The architecture with the highest
    overall score is selected as the optimal choice. The challenge lies in determining
    appropriate weights for each criterion, which may require stakeholder input, expert
    opinions, and data analysis. Additionally, accurately quantifying and measuring
    the criteria (such as performance and future-proofing) can be complex and may
    involve predictive modeling and simulations. It should be considered that the
    actual problem is likely to be more intricate, with more criteria, sub-criteria,
    and interactions between them. Previous research in this subject has overlooked
    this aspect. Furthermore, it has been noted in the existing literature on 5G network
    architecture that there is a lack of evaluation, particularly in terms of considering
    multiple criteria. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive decision
    support system platform that can address this issue which is discussed in the
    following section. 2.2. MCDM-integrated approach MCDM is an operational research
    concept that enables decision-makers to select the most appropriate among predetermined
    alternatives by evaluating them in terms of many criteria in complicated scenarios
    (Al-Humairi et al., 2022, Jeon et al., 2023, Jaisankar et al., 2023, Nezhad et
    al., 2023). MCDM has many advantages in various research areas, rendering it a
    valuable research tool. In situations that are normally difficult to choose, MCDM
    methodologies assist researchers and developers (Al-Humairi et al., 2022, Dagistanli,
    2023). In many other scientific fields and sections, such as the energy sector
    (Kaya et al., 2019), mobile communication (Gaur et al., 2021), engineering (Jiang
    et al., 2022), and many others (Alsalem et al., 2021, David, 2023), MCDM methods
    have been successfully applied to tackle real-world problems. Owing to these advantages,
    it is important to understand that MCDM methods vary in their development goals
    and why they are created. Some MCDM approaches are only used for weighting and
    assigning importance values for the criteria involved in the decisions. Other
    MCDM methods are only attributed to selecting the choices for decision makers
    (DMs), and others can perform both tasks simultaneously. Many robust MCDM methods
    have been introduced over the years, and they differ in their settings for addressing
    MCDM challenges (Alsalem et al., 2022). Some of the well-known MCDM weighting
    methods include “Fuzzy-Weighted with Zero-Inconsistency (FWZIC)” (Mohammed, Zaidan,
    et al., 2021), “Full Consistency Method” (Pamučar et al., 2018), and others. When
    it comes to MCDM ranking and selection methods, they include “Technique for Order
    of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” (Mohammed, Albahri, et
    al., 2021), “Visekriterijumska Optimizacija i Kompromisno Resenje” (Malik et al.,
    2022), “Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC)” (Pamučar
    & Ćirović, 2015), and others. The MCDM approaches, which can do both, include
    “Fuzzy Decision by Opinion Score Method (FDOSM)” (Salih et al., 2020), “Analytic
    Hierarchy Process (AHP)” (Khatari et al., 2021), “Best Worst Method (BWM)” (Alsalem
    et al., 2019) and others. Owing to their significance, MCDM approaches have been
    widely utilized in decision-making challenges; however, some problems are more
    significant than others. In this regard, MCDM methods are generally classified
    into conventional and fuzzy-set based methods. Conventional MCDM methods are considered
    inadequate for handling the uncertainties associated with complex decision-making
    (Pradhan et al., 2022). Towards that end, the notion of fuzzy sets has been introduced.
    To address the ambiguity issues raised by MCDM research, Zadeh (1965) proposed
    the concept of a fuzzy set, which uses the membership degree to indicate the level
    of belongingness of element to a (fuzzy set). The latter was designed to improve
    the accuracy of the information and dependability of the outcomes of decision-making.
    Owing to the notion of fuzzy sets, numerous researchers have begun to discover
    the usefulness of fuzzy sets in a range of areas, including decision-making in
    medical diagnosis (Liu et al., 2021), and engineering (Lin et al., 2022). Fuzzy
    sets are continuously being used in MCDM issues; however, as problems become more
    complex, fuzzy sets have to be generalized. However, classic fuzzy sets which
    is also known as “standard or ordinary fuzzy sets” (Zadeh, 1965), “Bipolar Soft
    Sets” (Mahmood, 2020), “Picture Fuzzy Sets” (Ganie et al., 2020), “Spherical Fuzzy
    Sets (SFSs)” (Kutlu Gündoğdu & Kahraman, 2019), “Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs)”
    (Alcantud et al., 2020), and “Interval-valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IVIFSs)”
    (Liu & Jiang, 2020), “Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFSs)” (Yager, 2013), “Hesitant
    Fuzzy Sets (HFSs)” (Torra, 2010), “Fermatean Fuzzy Sets” (Akram & Niaz, 2022),
    and “Neutrosophic Fuzzy Sets (NFSs)” (Broumi et al., 2019) are the main and commonly
    discussed types of fuzzy sets (Zeng et al., 2020). The hesitation degree, which
    is included in the IFS idea and is thought to be the most traditional of the extensions,
    is determined to be less than the sum of the membership and non-membership degrees
    (Alamoodi, Albahri, et al., 2022). Typically, DMs indicate their preference for
    an alternative to a criterion using fuzzy numbers, which indicate the degree to
    which the alternative satisfies the criterion. To manage ambiguity in a decision-making
    process, the use of MCDM approaches with fuzzy sets has been suggested (Kaya et
    al., 2019). Notably, the concept of NFSs can be utilized to manage fuzzy information
    in experimental scenarios. This is because the limits on typical fuzzy sets can
    be easily violated in real-world analyses. In contrast to IFSs and PFSs, which
    employ two concepts to define membership to fuzzy sets in actual issues, an NFS
    uses truth, indeterminacy, and falsehood to simultaneously explain uncertain membership
    to the NFS. Moreover, these concepts are unrelated to one another. This demonstrates
    that NFS can deal with a broader range of applications than the previous fuzzy
    techniques for data processing in actual situations (Zeng et al., 2020). NFSs
    are used instead of traditional fuzzy sets, because they are more capable of handling
    complex uncertainties. This is because several ambiguities in the evaluation process
    are highly complex. As supported by previous research, NFSs successfully address
    various uncertainties and complex situations. They have also been shown to effectively
    handle unclear, unpredictable, and indeterminate information (Görçün, 2022). An
    NFS has more possibility strength than other forming mathematical apparatuses,
    such as fuzzy sets, interval IVIFSs, or IFSs (Abdel-Basset et al., 2019). NFSs
    present an approach with the unique capability of handling the indeterminacy of
    the problem and can overcome highly complicated uncertainties (Simic et al., 2022).
    MCDM methods with NFSs have been used to better handle uncertainty for various
    applications such as IoT enterprises (Nabeeh et al., 2019), renewable energy (Supciller
    & Toprak, 2020), and agriculture (Garai & Garg, 2022), etc. Part of our new innovation
    addition to NFSs in this research is the “Type 2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy Sets (T2NFSs),”
    also named Type 2 Neutrosophic Numbers (T2NNs), which can be an effective tool
    to better address expert assessments with ambiguities and inconsistencies with
    decision-makers’ appreciation over the alternative (Deveci, Erdogan, et al., 2021).
    To handle multiple uncertainties in the decision-making process, this study proposes
    utilizing the new T2NFSs-based MCDM approach for the 5G-RAN architecture selection
    problem, which inherently contains uncertainty. T2NFSs-based MCDM literature shows
    that this method has been adopted and used by many authors, such as (Görçün, 2022)
    who applied T2NFSs with TOPSIS and WASPAS techniques to select appropriate second-hand
    chemical tankers among 15 alternatives. Authors in (Görçün et al., 2023) proposed
    the T2NFSs-based WASPAS’B approach strengthened with the help of “Type-2 Neutrosophic
    Numbers (T2NNs)” based on the Bonferroni function to select the best Ro-Ro vessel
    in the second-hand market. (Simic et al., 2022) proposed a new T2NFSs-based MABAC
    method for ranking public transportation pricing systems. Authors in (Abdel-Basset
    et al., 2019) proposed an approach using the TOPSIS technique for developing supplier
    selection with group decision-making under T2NNs. Authors in (Deveci, Erdogan,
    et al., 2021) proposed a T2NFSs-based MABAC approach for offshore wind farm site
    selection. Authors in (Deveci, Simic, et al., 2021) presented the innovative usage
    of the hierarchical BWM to select optimal evaluation criteria weights and the
    CODAS method extension under the T2NFSs environment to rank an ALiB remanufacturing
    facility. Authors in (Gokasar et al., 2022) proposed a T2NFSs-WASPAS and TOPSIS
    framework to examine the impact of bridge maintenance on the environment. Authors
    in (Deveci et al., 2022) proposed a DIBR method and a modified T2NNs based CoCoSo
    model for urban freight transportation management. In accordance with the advantages
    of T2NFSs, and because of its suitability in decision-making content, it is therefore
    selected in this work to solve the problem of selecting the best 5G-RAN architectures
    in an MCDM complex environment. T2NNs are utilized in this research alongside
    other robust MCDM methods in a homogenous integrated environment, and each of
    the methods is discussed in detail in the next sections of this paper. 3. Preliminaries

    the proposed integrated fuzzy approach and the main and sub process steps of the
    T2NN-FWZIC method for criteria weighting in Section 4.1, followed by the T2NN-FDOSM
    method for the selection results of the 5G-RANs architectures in Section 4.2.
    The details of both the methods are described in the following subsections. 4.1.
    Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy-Weighted Zero-Inconsistency A competitive subjective
    MCDM weighting method, FWZIC, was developed in (Mohammed, Zaidan, et al., 2021)
    to reflect the accumulated knowledge and subjective opinions of decision-makers.
    FWZIC is highly preferred in solving inconsistency problems resulting from the
    high subjectivity in determining the significance and importance of several evaluation
    criteria on the criteria pairwise comparison basis (Basil et al., 2023, Talal
    et al., 2023). It is necessary to understand that the inconsistency rate increases
    as the number of criteria increases, which affects the final outcomes (Paramanik
    et al., 2022). Although several FWZIC extensions have been developed by considering
    the advantages of different fuzzy environments (e.g., PFSs (Al-Samarraay et al.,
    2022), “Interval Type 2 Trapezoidal Fuzzy Sets (IT2TFS)” (Krishnan et al., 2021),
    and SFSs (Albahri et al., 2022), extending it by taking into account the comprehensive
    advantages of T2NNs is yet to come. Thus, in this study, the superiority of FWZIC
    is extended in solving the uncertainty and vagueness of fuzzy problems and accurately
    representing decision-makers’ real cognitive information by formulating a novel
    version of FWZIC based on the T2NNs environment. The steps are as follows. Step
    1: In the first step, the criteria for evaluating and selecting 5G-RAN architectures
    for 5G mobile communication systems are defined and discussed in greater detail.
    This includes the identification of the main criteria and their sub, their measurement
    nature (how each is calculated using subjective or objective values), measurement
    scale (numerical representation for criteria values whether a cost or a benefit).
    After that, all criteria are sorted and organized into different categories according
    to the type of behavior and assessment required. Step 2: The second phase entails
    explaining the structured expert judgement (SEJ). Specialist panels were screened
    and chosen from related subject fields to assess and determine the degree of significance
    of the criteria specified in Step 1. The focus of this investigation is on a community
    of individuals working on 5G mobile communication. After conducting research and
    compiling a list of potential subject matter experts, the next step was to nominate
    candidates and select finalist experts. In this case, a panel of SEJ was created.
    Finally, an evaluation form was created to collect the consensus of all the SEJ
    panelists for each criterion of 5G-RAN architectures for 5G mobile communication
    systems, which is then followed by the conversion of the linguistic scale to its
    equivalent numerical scale, as shown in Table 3. Table 3. Linguistic Variables
    and their Corresponding Numerical Values. Linguistic Variable Abbreviated Term
    Numerical-based Score Very High VH 1 High H 2 Medium M 3 Medium Low ML 4 Low L
    5 Step 3: The third step outlines how the expert decision matrix constructed (EDM)
    process is formulated and defined. According to the information presented in Table
    4, the essential components of EDM are the selection criteria and list of alternatives.
    Table 4. Construction Process of EDM. Expert C1 C2 Cn Expert_1 Expert_1 importance
    for C1 Expert_1 importance for C2 Expert_1 importance for Cn Expert_2 Expert_2
    importance for C1 Expert_2 importance for C2 Expert_2 importance for Cn Expert_m
    Expert_m importance for C1 Expert_m importance for C2 Expert_m importance for
    Cn Table 4 shows that the criteria for selection (5G-RAN criteria) and SEJ panel
    intersect. Every selection criterion (Cn) intersects with every selective expert
    (Expert_m), and each expert is given a score corresponding to the appropriate
    significance level for each criterion. EDM serves as the foundation for the subsequent
    analytical processes included in the proposed T2NN-FWZIC and will be demonstrated
    in the following steps. Step 4: In the fourth step, a T2NN-based fuzzy membership
    function and the accompanying fuzzification processes are applied to the EDM data.
    This causes the data to be changed, increasing the precision of the data and making
    it easier to use the data for later analysis. T2NNs have been developed to handle
    multiple uncertainties in decision making and accurately describe real cognitive
    information. A T2NN is a compound number in which each component of the three
    components of the set, namely truth ( ), indeterminacy ( ), and falsity ( ) memberships,
    is split into its truth, indeterminacy, and falsity subparts, as shown in Table
    5. Table 5. Numerical Values and corresponding T2NNs. Numerical-based Score T2NNs
    1 {(0.90,0.85,0.95) (0.10,0.15,0.10) (0.05,0.05,0.10)} 2 {(0.80,0.75,0.70) (0.20,0.15,0.30)
    (0.15,0.10,0.20)} 3 {(0.65,0.55,0.55) (0.40,0.45,0.55) (0.35,0.40,0.35)} 4 {(0.40,0.30,0.25)
    (0.45,0.55,0.40) (0.45,0.60,0.55)} 5 {(0.20,0.30,0.20) (0.60,0.70,0.80) (0.45,0.75,0.75)}
    As shown in Table 5, all linguistic variables and numerical-based scores defined
    in (Abdel-Basset et al., 2019) should be transformed into T2NNs. This assumes
    that T2NNs should serve as the variable for each criterion assessed by each expert.
    In other words, 5G mobile communication experts were tasked with determining the
    priority degree of the assessment criterion, also known as 5G mobile communication
    criteria, within the variables evaluated using the linguistic variables. Step
    5: For an MCDM problem with experts and criteria, the weights of selection criteria
    are calculated as illustrated in the following sub-processes. Step 5 Sub Process
    1:The first sub-process computes the T2NN ratio of the data using Eq. (15), as
    listed in Table 6. (15) Table 6. T2NNs-based EDM . Experts Expert_1 Expert_2 Expert_m
    where is the expert’s evaluation of the criterion represented by a T2NN, and is
    the summation of the evaluation scores obtained by Eq. (13) of the expert for
    the criteria. Eq. (15) was performed using Eq. (8). Step 5 Sub Process 2: The
    second sub-process determines the weights of the selection criteria in its T2NNs
    form. The experts’ evaluations of each criterion were aggregated using Eq. (12)
    to determine the weights . (16) Step 5 Sub Process 3: This sub-process finds the
    final selection criterion weights . The scores of weights were computed using
    Eq. (13) to obtain crisp weights . The crisp weights are then normalized to obtain
    the final weights that satisfy the condition 4.2. Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy Decision
    by Opinion Score Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy Decision by Opinion Score Method Regarding
    the MCDM-based alternative ranking approach, a recent superior method called the
    FDOSM has been developed (Salih et al., 2020). This method has been formulated
    to solve various problems, such as the inconsistent ratio derived from pairwise
    comparisons, which prompted a substantial amount of time utilization and created
    another problem called abnormal comparisons. Nevertheless, normalization refers
    to integrating various assessment scales and transforming their values into unitless
    ones, which is another issue that can be resolved with the help of the FDOSM.
    In addition, the FDOSM discusses the distance measurement challenge between ideal
    and alternative solutions. This problem typically involves estimating the costs
    and benefits of each characteristic based on the Euclidean distance between the
    separate characteristics and the ideal solution. In addition to the concerns that
    have been described, the challenges caused by subjective data representations
    that result in unclear and imprecise information have also been discussed by FDOSM
    using a variety of fuzzy environments such as IT2TFS (Salih et al., 2021), “Interval-Valued
    Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets” (Al-Samarraay et al., 2021) and NFSs (Alamoodi, Mohammed,
    et al., 2022). However, formulating such a superior method has not been achieved
    by taking advantage of T2NNs, which are presented based on single and group decision-making
    processes in the present study. The T2NN-FDOSM stages and their steps are formulated
    as follows: First Stage: This stage presents the data entry process to formulate
    the main component of the MCDM approach, which is a selection decision matrix
    (SDM) for the ranking and selection processes presented below in Table 8 where
    four RANs architectures (alternatives) against the (n = 25) evaluation criteria
    are considered, the process can be summarized as shown below (17) This formulation
    is achieved by intersecting the list of alternatives ( ) (i.e., 5G-RAN architectures)
    and decision criteria ( ). Second Stage: In the second stage, the transformational
    process is adopted via FDOSM after the production of SDM that resulted from the
    previous stage. This is accomplished by choosing an ideal solution with three
    potential properties (critical value, minimum, and maximum). A philosophy based
    on the critical value is the value that is employed in a variety of situations,
    particularly those in which the ideal solution is neither the minimum nor maximum
    possible. Using the same philosophical underpinnings, this method can potentially
    provide an optimal solution for values that cannot be measured. However, when
    combined with the cost criterion, the minimal value represents the optimal solution,
    with the minimum value indicating the best choice and conversely the maximum the
    best. The following is a presentation and description of the steps that must be
    taken at this stage. Step 1: Choose the optimal solution based on the decision-maker
    specialists. Considering this, a perfect answer can be described as follows: (18)
    where: mx is the most optimal for the maximum selection criteria, mn is the most
    optimal for the minimum selection criteria, and is the most optimal for the critical
    selection criteria (neither mx nor mn), which can be chosen by a decision maker
    specialist. Step 2: The optimal solution and other values per criterion used in
    the selection approach were compared. The comparison of the linguistic variables
    is accomplished by employing five different scales (i.e. “no difference,” “slight
    difference,” “difference,” “big difference,” and “huge difference”). After selecting
    the optimal solution, the next step is to contrast the value of the optimal solution
    with the alternatives based on the exact selection criterion, as shown in Eq.
    (19). (19) where: refers to the process of the comparison between the optimal
    solution ( ij) and other alternatives’ values per exact selection criterion (rij),
    and LOM represents the linguistic opinion matrix for the selection approach, as
    shown in Eq. (20). (20) Third Stage: In the third stage, three steps were included
    as follows. Step 1: First, the fuzzification formulation was processed by transforming
    the LOM represented by (Abdel-Basset et al., 2019) into a fuzzy LOM by deploying
    a T2NNs basis. This was accomplished to process the LOM. During this process,
    the linguistic variables were substituted for T2NNs, which were established according
    to the basis membership functions to which they belong, as shown in Table 7. Table
    7. Linguistic Variables and their Corresponding T2NNs for Evaluating the Alternatives.

    2 2 3 2 2 4 3 3 3 A1 = C-RAN, A2 = H-CRAN, A3 = V-CRAN, A4 = F-RAN. It is essential
    to understand that two decision-making processes were used in this study: single
    and group decision making. Three specialist decision makers were involved in evaluating
    the alternatives. Step 2: Once the fuzzy LOM has been completed, the aggregation
    procedure is applied to calculate a fuzzy performance score for each alternative
    involved in the selection approach by using the aggregation operator presented
    in Eq. (11). It is important to note that the effectiveness of the selection criteria
    weights is included in this step. This was accomplished by calculating the T2NN
    of each alternative’s criterion value based on a particular weight, which was
    then extensively incorporated into the alternative ranking of the selection approach.
    Step 3: To calculate the crisp performance score for each potential alternative,
    the defuzzification procedure was determined using Eq. (13). Step 4: The sequence
    of all alternatives can be prioritized after the previously mentioned equation
    determination within the selection approach. Each alternative receives crisp and
    final performance values, and the values are ranked from best to worst. The alternative
    that has earned the highest rating score will be given priority in the selection
    approach. 5. MCDM case study of 5G-RAN architectures In this section, the MCDM
    complex problem of evaluating and selecting 5G-RAN architectures is discussed.
    First, as discussed earlier, four alternatives of RAN architectures used in 5G
    mobile communication systems were evaluated and selected based on their similarities,
    working and implementation structures, and advantages and disadvantages. These
    four alternatives were C-RAN (A1), H-CRAN (A2), V-CRAN (A3), and F-RAN (A4). It
    should be noted that 25 criteria were used to evaluate those 5G-RANs architectures
    (Habibi et al., 2019). A description of the criteria used in the summary is presented
    as follows: 1) Storage (C1): This criterion describes the network''s ability to
    store and process data in a centralized or distributed manner. 2) Caching (C2):
    This criterion shows the ability of 5G networks to process information that is
    often accessed, stored in a temporary location, and then locally process subsequent
    requests for the same content. 3) Control (C3): This criterion describes the ability
    of the network to control the RAN component centrally or in a distributed manner.
    4) Communication (C4): This criterion explains the capability of a network to
    perform centralized or distributed communication methods. 5) Management (C5):
    This criterion represents the network''s capability to perform its management
    ability in a centralized or decentralized manner. 6) Cooperative Radio Resource
    Management (CRRM) (C6): is a criterion for communication among network functions
    or assets in a centralized or decentralized manner. 7) Decouple of Control, and
    User Planes (C7): Both the user and control planes are coupled in C-RAN, whereas
    they are decoupled in H-CRAN, V-CRAN, and F-RAN. 8) Backhaul Interface (C8): This
    criterion explains the network''s ability to use the backhaul interfacing method
    to connect the core network to the HPNs. 9) Heterogeneity (C9): This concept represents
    the network''s ability to cover a high level of energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency,
    and capacity. 10) Edge Networking Complexity (C10): Adding new elements to the
    RAN architecture or increasing the number of user devices (UD) introduces additional
    complexity and overhead, which affect network performance. 11) Fronthaul Complexity
    (C11): This criterion explains the level of practicality that the RAN architecture
    produces when connecting the RRH to the BBU pool equipment. 12) BBU Pool Complexity
    (C12): This criterion defines network practicality in terms of the burden level
    acquired when implementing a certain type of 5G-RAN architecture. 13) RRH Complexity
    (C13): This criterion represents the complexity level when deploying a certain
    type of 5G-RAN architecture. 14) User Equipments (UEs) Complexity (C14): This
    criterion defines the practicality of increasing the number of users in the network
    when implementing a certain type of 5G-RAN architecture. 15) Data Processing (C15):
    This criterion explains the location of the data-processing unit in the 5G network.
    16) The burden on Fronthaul (C16): This criterion represents the size of functionality
    that the fronthaul communication link is supposed to handle. 17) Burden on BBU
    Pool (C17): This criterion defines the size of the load functionality that BBUs
    should handle in a certain type of 5G-RAN architecture. 18) Burden CN (C18): This
    criterion explains the functionality load that the core network should handle
    when implementing a certain type of 5G-RAN architecture. 19) Inter-Tier Interference
    (C19): This criterion defines the interference between RRHs and HPNs, which is
    directly related to the heterogeneity criterion. 20) Transmission Delay (C20):
    This criterion represents the time required to send data among the 5G layers.
    This is directly related to the centralized architecture of the 5G-RAN, and a
    low transmission delay increases reliability. 21) Latency (C21): This criterion
    specifies the time required to exchange data among 5-RAN network components. 22)
    Reliability (C22): This criterion defines the network characteristics in terms
    of providing services with low distribution to end-user QoS (e.g., low latency,
    low transmission delay, and distributed architecture). 23) Energy Consumption
    (C23): This criterion specifies the power consumption level if a certain 5G-RAN
    architecture is implemented. 24) CAPEX (C24): Capital expenditure costs are usually
    high, and operators are keen to decrease them by reusing the existing infrastructure.
    25) OPEX (C25): The last criterion presents the cost of operations/procedures
    that some 5G-RAN architectures require to function to produce optimal network
    performance. Furthermore, the evaluation decision matrix was established based
    on the intersection of the 25 evaluation criteria and the list of decision alternatives
    (i.e., C-RAN (A1), H-CRAN (A2), V-CRAN (A3), and F-RAN (A4), as indicated in Table
    8. This is considered amongst the main innovations of this study where no previous
    work has considered intersecting all the 25 criteria against their counterparts
    from 5G RAN architectures. This Evaluation and selection of RAN architectures
    used in 5G mobile communication systems is a crucial step that provides the foundation
    for meeting the expectations of users, minimising the number of handoffs, reducing
    anomaly ratios, and maximising the utilisation of network resources. As shown
    in Table 8, there are (n = 4) alternatives (5G-RANs) according to their implementation
    design/type being measured over various evaluation criteria (n = 25). Hence, all
    25 evaluation criteria were measured subjectively. The first type of subjective
    evaluation value is a five-point Likert scale, like criteria: C9-C14 and C16-C25.
    All original values were based on linguistic terms (very high = 1, high = 2, medium
    = 3, low = 4, very low = 5). However, criteria like C1-C6 were measured using
    subjective evaluation values such as (centralized) or (distributed and centralized).
    These values were converted to numerical values as (centralized = 0) and (centralized
    and distributed = 1). Criterion (C7) was evaluated using categorical values like
    (Yes or No), where Yes = 1 and No = 0. Moreover, criterion (C8) was evaluated
    using two subjective values: (CN) and (CN and BBU pool). The CN value was set
    to 0 and (CN and BBU pool) was set to 1. Another criterion (C15) was evaluated
    using (cloud data center) and (near to device) values, where 0 was assigned to
    the (cloud data center) value and 1 was assigned to the (near to device) value.
    The parameters considered in this work relates to how each RAN architecture have
    achieved the desired criteria using the subjective value as presented in Table
    6. This evaluation will enforce that each RAN architecture to undergo the same
    assessment settings when compared with others, and this part of the innovations
    makes the evaluation comparison applicable in general environments. Other than
    that, if all technical parameters within each RAN architecture was to be assessed,
    this creates an unfair comparison given that some RANs are different from others
    in terms of their implementation and working environment. 6. Experimental results
    This section presents the research results for criteria weighting using T2NN-FWZIC,
    followed by selecting the 5G-RANs architectures using T2NN-FDOSM. 6.1. Weighting
    Determination Using Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy-Weighted Zero-Inconsistency This
    section discusses the weighting results of T2NN-FWZIC for the evaluation criteria
    used in selecting 5G-RANs architectures. Various steps are included in generating
    the results of this section, as discussed in Section 6. These steps began by incorporating
    the evaluation criteria discussed in Section 5. The importance of these criteria
    was assessed on the basis of the opinions of three wireless network technology
    experts. In line with the experts’ responses, they were transformed from linguistic
    terms to numerical scales using Table 3. These processes were followed by EDM,

    of 25 criteria for three decision-makers (DM1, DM2, and DM3) using linguistic
    variables (LV) and numerical scale (NS) for each criterion. The evaluation was
    conducted using a hybrid approach that combined fuzzy weights with interval Type-2
    fuzzy sets to address uncertainties and inconsistencies in evaluations of the
    DMs. The linguistic variables used in the table included low (LV), medium–low
    (ML), medium (M), high (H), and very high (VH). The numerical scale ranged from
    two to five, with higher values indicating better evaluation scores. Each DM provided
    its evaluation for each criterion, resulting in a matrix of 25 criteria by three
    DMs. The evaluation scores showed varying degrees of agreement among the DMs for
    the different criteria. For example, criterion C9 (heterogeneity) received a high
    evaluation score from DM1 and VH scores from DM2 and DM3, indicating a high level
    of agreement among DMs. However, criterion C18 (burden on CN) received mixed evaluation
    scores from the DMs, indicating a lower level of agreement. Overall, the table
    provides a useful summary of 5G-RAN criteria evaluation by multiple decision-makers
    using a hybrid fuzzy approach. This highlights the importance of considering uncertainties
    and inconsistencies in DMs'' evaluations of DMs when making complex decisions,
    such as when selecting the most optimal 5G-RAN architecture. After constructing
    the EDM represented in Table 9, the following step includes using T2NNs, whereby
    the crisp values are transformed into their fuzzy numbers represented in Table
    5. The EDM fuzzification process was completed upon completion of the previous
    process. The following step includes each expert’s mean preference computed using
    Eq. (12) and Eq. (13) to generate a fuzzy weight. Subsequently, the defuzzification
    process was established, resulting in crisp weights normalized to the final weight,

    0.0998 0.0503 As shown in Table 10, all evaluation criteria used in selecting
    the 5G-RAN architectures were weighted using T2NN-FWZIC. Different processes were
    applied to reach the final weight for all criteria (as explained earlier), n =
    25). Different observations can be made, including the best and worst criteria.
    We can conclude three main groups of weights. The first group of weights is the
    group of high-weighted criteria with This group includes six criteria, namely
    (C21_ Latency, C22_ Reliability, C10_ Edge Networking Complexity, C20_Transmission
    Delay, C9_ Heterogeneity, and C25_S OPEX,) arranged in descending order. The second
    group of weights is the group of middle-weighted criteria with This group included
    the majority of criteria, 14 criteria. The criteria of the second group in descending
    order are (C7_ Decouple of Control and User Planes, C23_Energy Consumption, C12_
    BBU Pool Complexity, C24_ CAPEX, C2_ Caching, C13_ RRH Complexity, C6_ CRRM, C17_
    Burden on BBU Pool, C16_ Burden on Fronthaul, C1_Storage, C11_ Fronthaul Complexity,
    C14_UEs Complexity, C18_ Burden CN, C3_ Control, C4_ Communication). Finally,
    the third group comprises low-weighted criteria and encompasses only four criteria
    with weights . These criteria are (C15_ Management, C8_ Backhaul Interface, C19_
    Inter-Tier Interference, and C15_ Data Processing). C21_ Latency is the leading
    criterion with the highest weight, and C15_ Data Processing is the least weighted
    criterion. All the weights for these criteria are used alongside T2NN-FDOSM in
    the following section. 6.2. 5G-RANs Architectures Selection using Type-2 Neutrosophic
    Fuzzy Decision by Opinion Score This section presents the selection results of
    the 5G-RANs architectures using T2NN-FDOSM. Upon completing the weighting stage
    previously presented, the same three experts presented their importance levels
    for the evaluation criteria and once again presented their opinions on the performance
    of each of the 5G-RANs architectures. This process resulted in the three opinion
    matrices presented in Table 11. Table 11. Opinion Matrices for All Experts. Alternatives

    using a 5-Point Likert scale. All data in the opinion matrices represent each
    expert’s ideal solution in line with the values of each 5G-RANs architectures.
    The process is completed by allowing the expert to assign his/her ideal solution
    (5G-RANs architectures) in line with each evaluation criterion and then comparing
    the results of the remaining 5G-RANs architectures for that attribute with the
    ideal. This process was carried out separately for each expert according to the
    25 criteria. The linguistic terms used in the process are then transformed into
    three fuzzy opinion matrices (Appendix Table A1, Table A2, and Table A3) to obtain
    the final selection results for the 5G-RANs architectures. The results for individual
    decision-making contexts are presented in Table 12. Table 12. RANs Architecture

    2 A 3 > A 4 > A 2 > A 1 As shown in Table 12, the importance of the three decision-makers
    is represented based on their ranking results. The table demonstrates the “Fuzzy
    Performance Score,” “Crisp Performance Score,” and the final rank. According to
    the Crisp Performance Score, the higher the score, the better the alternative
    (5G-RANs architecture). For Expert 1, it is clearly seen that alternative A3 was
    determined as the best selection with the highest score of (0.8941), followed
    by A4, A1, and A2 with scores (0.8687, 0.7292, and 0.6797), respectively. For
    the second expert, the alternative ranking was similar to that of the first expert,
    with slightly different scores. The last expert ranking was different, where two
    alternatives (A2 and A1) ranked third and fourth, as opposed to being fourth and
    third for previous experts with score values of (0.6874 and 0.7145). A high level
    of agreement was observed across the experts’ judgements and opinions in terms
    of their ideal solution selection, but a slight rank variation was observed. In
    such a scenario and in MCDM research, when an absolute agreement is not reached,
    this calls for the utilization of ranking results achieved by the group decision-making
    (GDM) context, where the three experts’ opinions are combined to present a unified
    ranking. This is accomplished in the following table by using two settings: internal
    and external aggregation, as shown in Table 13. Table 13. RANs Architecture Selection
    Based on Group Context. Alternative Internal Aggregation External Aggregation

    0.8642 2 As shown in Table 13, the GDM ranking results are represented using the
    internal and external aggregation means. Before these results were obtained, the
    fuzzy performance scores from the three experts were aggregated into a fuzzy matrix
    (Appendix Table A4) to achieve the final selection results using the internal
    aggregation rank, whereby the external aggregation GDM results were presented
    by averaging the crisp scores of all experts and ranking them based on the average
    values. The final ranking results were identical in terms of the ranking result,
    with slight variance in terms of the crisp score value, which did not affect the
    final rank; thus, this ranking can be considered the final ranking. Finally, robustness
    checks must be applied, and the results in the ranking and criteria weights must
    undergo an evaluation process, as discussed in the following section. 6.3. Sensitivity
    analysis and validation In MCDM research, sensitivity analysis is one of the most
    well-established methods for evaluating and checking the robustness of novel MCDM
    methods. This approach uses the criteria weights and manipulates them under certain
    conditions and scenarios to measure their effect on the final ranking results.
    There have been many ways in which sensitivity analysis has been conducted, but
    all they share is that more than one scenario is included. In this research, a
    total of (n = 25) criteria are included and grouping them before applying the
    weight changes was deemed suitable. The criteria and groups are presented in Table
    14. Table 14. Criteria Grouping. Group Criteria Weight Centralization C1_Storage

    criteria with an overall close nature. Upon the completion of these criteria groups,

    for each criteria group), which are to be used in the new ranking, as seen in

    of all the criteria in a certain group and then taking the newly added weight
    and subtracting it equally from the remaining criteria in all the groups. This
    process was performed once for each criterion group, resulting in eight new weight
    sets. These new weights are used for ranking, as shown in Table 16. Table 16.

    Alternative identifier. Table 16 shows a new set of ranking results over eight
    scenarios; out of the eight scenarios, five had identical rankings with the original,
    and the remaining three presented slight differences. These minor differences
    were observed in the 3rd and 4th ranks. As for the 1st and 2nd ranks, they were
    consistent across all scenarios, whether using internal or external aggregation
    settings. This shows their dominance, even with the introduction of a new set
    of weights in different scenarios. At the same time, weight changes cannot be
    ignored because if they did not change the best two, they changed the last two
    (ranks 3 and 4) in the three scenarios. Fig. 1 illustrates the sensitivity analysis

    and External Aggregation. As shown in Fig. 1, it is clear that RANs A3 and A4
    maintained their selection results over all scenarios in terms of internal and
    external aggregation settings being the first best and second best, respectively,
    which proves their dominance and robustness even when new weights are introduced.
    However, for RANs A1 and A2, they maintained similar selection results in the
    majority of scenarios, where A1 maintained 7/8 over all the scenarios for internal
    aggregation and 6/8 for the external aggregation results. For A2, 7/8 selection,
    it was maintained in 7/8 for internal aggregation and 5/8 for external aggregation.
    This proves that weight changes can change the selection results, even if not
    for the best alternatives, they change some even if the least preferred alternatives,
    which in turn shows the importance of weight in the selection process. 7. Conclusion
    From a technological standpoint, 5G technologies are used in various applications
    in our daily lives. These applications have altered our perspectives on normal
    wireless communications used for chatting and basic Internet services, transforming
    them into essential tools that integrate into many domains, including medicine,
    transportation, manufacturing and many others. Despite their relevance, 5G technologies
    are not simple to adopt, especially when considering factors such as the type
    of application, number of users, designated services, volume of traffic, throughput,
    and latency, as well as whether it is intended for small, medium, or large organizations.
    Owing to these factors, evaluating the architecture of 5G-RANs has become necessary.
    However, evaluating these architectures is a difficult task because of the large
    number of evaluation criteria that must be considered as well as their performance,
    which is prone to trade-offs and conflicts. This study aimed to address these
    issues using an integral MCDM approach that was determined to be the most appropriate
    after a review of the academic literature and identifying two MCDM approaches
    known as FWZIC and FDOSM, which are best suited for weighting the evaluation criteria
    and evaluating the available 5G-RANs. Both methods have been provided based on
    a novel T2NFSs environment to address the theoretical difficulty of delivering
    better evaluations in the presence of ambiguities and inconsistencies among DMs.
    The primary contributions of this study are the innovative formulation of the
    decision matrix for 5G mobile communication systems, the robust assessment approach
    for weighing the RAN evaluation criteria using T2NS-FWZIC, and the selection of
    the most optimal RAN architectures using T2NS-FDOSM. The robustness of the proposed
    approach was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis. Nonetheless, this study had
    a shortcoming: the relative contribution or weight of each expert was ignored
    when asked to provide their knowledge or opinions, which could affect the final
    criteria weights and alternative selection of the involved case study or any potential
    future case. One of our future works is to solve this problem by proposing a new
    mechanism to assign a specific weight to each expert to be used in the criteria
    weights, followed by alternative evaluation. Finally, combining other new fuzzy
    sets and other precise fuzzy operators with the proposed MCDM methods may be a
    possible future contribution. CRediT authorship contribution statement Iman Mohamad

    2023 1 Introduction Person re-identification (ReID) is the process of identifying
    individuals with the same identity across different camera perspectives. Domain
    Generalizable Person Re-Identification (DG-ReID) represents a more practical approach
    to ReID by focusing on identifying samples in previously unseen domains since
    recognition systems often encounter the need to search for individuals in novel
    scenes in real-world scenarios. However, traditional person re-identification
    methods exhibit a significant decline in performance when applied to unseen domains.
    To address this challenge, numerous ReID models have been developed, employing
    joint training on multiple source domains and subsequent direct application to
    unseen domains (He et al. 2021; Liao and Shao 2020, 2022, 2021; Xuan and Zhang
    2021; Luo et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021; Pan et al. 2018). Despite a lot of progress,
    substantial disparities exist between different domains, encompassing variations
    in illumination, resolution, image tone, and pedestrian clothing, etc. As each
    domain possesses its domain-unique characteristics, the learning process of the
    model on other domains may render the domain-unique characteristics of one domain
    irrelevant or introduce significant interference during joint training, thereby
    giving rise to domain conflict (Wei et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2022; Xiao et al.
    2016a). To mitigate domain conflicts, early methods (Zhao et al. 2021; Zheng et
    al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2021; Lin et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2021) have explored
    feature disentanglement or meta-learning to model generalized features across
    multiple domains. Nevertheless, these methods usually overlook the diversity of
    domain-specific features within each domain and their contributions to the overall
    model learning process. Consequently, the domain generalization capability of
    these models is significantly limited (Zhou et al. 2021). More recent approaches
    have focused on designing multiple expert networks tailored to each domain to
    capture its distinctive features (Xu et al. 2021; Yu et al. 2021; Dai et al. 2021).
    For example, Xu et al. (2021) adopt the Mixture of Experts (MoE) to exploit multiple
    domain-specific networks. Similarly, Yu et al. (2021) also adopt multiple domain-specific
    networks to extract features of each domain. However, such methods have to maintain
    separate feature spaces for each domain, which leads to a challenging problem
    in transferring these separate features to other feature spaces or new domains.
    Moreover, this approach incurs substantial computational overhead since the number
    of domain-specific feature spaces must match the number of domains. To address
    the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Source Adaptive
    Meta-Learning Framework (MAM), that creates a shared space for both domain-generalized
    features and domain-unique features. Specifically, the proposed MAM introduces
    a novel Multi-Source Adaptive Feature Refinement (MAFR) block, which comprises
    three essential components: the Fine-Grained Feature Extraction (FGFE) branch,
    the Refinement Feature Supplementary (RFS) branch, and the Feature Fusion (FF)
    module. The FGFE branch aims to reduce cross-domain interference by leveraging
    a set of parallel feature embedding spaces, each of which captures finer-grained
    domain-generalized features as well as domain-unique features. Then, a meta-weight
    generator, that is trained using a novel clustering loss function is introduced
    to produce meta-weights for adaptively aggregating and capturing desirable information.
    The RFS branch complements the fine-grained feature extraction branch by extracting
    additional domain-generalized features that bridge the gap between different domains.
    To mitigate the interference of specific features from other domains, we incorporate
    the style normalization layer proposed in Huang and Belongie (2017). This layer
    effectively filters contrastive information present in domain-unique features,
    enabling the framework to focus more on learning domain-generalized features within
    domains. Consequently, the interference caused by specific features from other
    domains is alleviated, addressing the domain conflict problem. The FF module then
    is adopted to integrate features from the fine-grained feature extraction branch
    and from the refinement feature supplementary branch into the final output feature.
    By combining these components, the MAM framework adaptively acquires domain-generalized
    and domain-unique features for each domain, thereby improving the accuracy of
    ReID systems. Moreover, we incorporate a meta-learning strategy during the training–testing
    process to enhance the model’s generalization ability. In each iteration, the
    source domain is dynamically partitioned into a meta-training set and a meta-test
    set. The meta-training set is treated as the source data, while the meta-test
    set represents \"unseen\" data. The key to meta-learning is to construct suitable
    learning objectives. For this goal, we propose the following loss functions: (1)
    the clustering loss that is specifically designed for the MAFR block to encourage
    the meta-weight generator to be diverse for different domains while to be concentrated
    on the same domain; (2) the unknown domain identification loss that promotes the
    model to learn more discriminative features. (3) The non-parametric identification
    loss that avoids the unstable optimization in meta-learning. Finally, during the
    meta-test phase, we introduce a meta-feature sampling method that combines meta-training
    features with meta-test features. This approach allows us to simulate feature
    changes across different domains. By incorporating meta-training features into
    the meta-test features, we can further diversify meta-test features by using domain-unique
    variations, resulting in better model generalization capability. In brief, the
    contribution of this paper is as followed: We propose a novel framework, the Multi-Source
    Adaptive Meta-Learning Framework (MAM) that is built on a novel Multi-derived
    Adaptive Feature Refinement (MAFR) block, to address the limitations of existing
    methods by adaptively acquiring unique and generalized features for each domain.
    The MAFR block comprises three key components: the fine-grained feature extraction
    (FGFE) branch, the refinement feature supplement (RFS) branch, and the feature
    fusion (FF) module. The RFS branch works in conjunction with the FGFE branch to
    extract both domain-generalized and domain-unique features across different domains.
    The FF module combines the learned features from these branches to produce the
    final output. By integrating these three branches, the MAFR block effectively
    captures both domain-generalized and domain-unique features within each domain.
    We incorporate a meta-learning strategy during the training–testing process to
    enhance the model’s generalization ability. Three novel loss functions are proposed
    including the clustering loss, the unknown domain identification loss, and the
    non-parametric identification loss. A meta-feature sampling method is designed
    during the meta-test phase to further improve the domain generalization capability
    of the model. 2 Related work 2.1 Domain generalization Domain generalization (DG)

    et al. 2020; Ghifary et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2020) is a machine learning technique
    aimed at learning a robust model that can generalize well on unseen target domains,
    despite having different data distributions from the source domains. There are
    two main categories of methods used to solve the domain generalization problem:
    Representation Learning and Sample Feature Augmentation in domain. The former
    reduces the variance between domains by disentangling features or aligning probability
    distributions. For instance, Li et al. (2018d) proposes a model that learns feature
    transformations to minimize the variance of the distribution of all classes over
    multiple source domains. The latter approach improves generalization by generating
    more cross-domain sample classes to avoid overfitting. For example, Shankar et
    al. (2018) uses adversarial gradients in a domain classifier obtained after training
    to generate cross-domain samples. Although traditional domain generalization methods
    have achieved impressive performance on closed-set tasks where the label spaces
    of the training and testing domains are the same, there is a considerable gap
    between different domains in practical ReID retrieval tasks. As a result, applying
    these methods directly to ReID is challenging to achieve good performance. 2.2
    Methods and applications of re-identification detection Re-identification is often
    regarded as an image retrieval task that utilizes computer vision techniques to
    recognize and retrieve identical objects across various cameras and scenes, making
    it highly applicable in numerous scenarios. For instance, Zhang et al. (2023)
    improve the AdaBoost classifier by incorporating local binary edge features and
    using a selective grayscale approach based on the H component of HSV space to
    distinguish vehicle targets from the background. Gao et al. (2022) propose a multitask
    recognition–verification concatenation network for vehicles that combines color
    feature vectors with intrinsic structure, class, and other vehicle attributes.
    They also investigate a dynamic circular non-uniform partitioned color super-pixel
    sampling strategy for the vehicle face based on the two-dimensional structure
    model of the vehicle. To improve face recognition performance when query images
    are taken from high altitudes or long distances with limited human facial information,
    Rostami et al. (2022) propose a novel UAV face detection and recognition model.
    Llano and Morales-González (2023) focus on biometric recognition under controlled
    conditions and utilize a YOLO network for directly detecting the iris-pupil region,
    assessing its quality, and semantic segmentation of the iris by a fully convolutional
    network. Additionally, Gao et al. (2023) propose an automatic verification method
    for vehicle crimp violations using convolutional neural networks and geometric
    projections. Rao et al. (2021) develop a distracted driving recognition method
    based on a deep convolutional neural network to analyze driving image data captured
    by in-vehicle cameras, using PCA technique to whiten the driving images and reduce
    pixel matrix redundancy and correlation. To address tracking accuracy degradation
    due to fast movement and severe occlusion, Qu et al. (2019) propose an improved
    kernel correlation tracking algorithm based on Kalman filtering and motion model.
    Kanagaraj et al. (2021) utilize a convolutional neural network of spatial transformer
    networks and real-time lane detection to enhance self-driving car efficiency.
    To optimize image text recognition accuracy, Wu et al. (2021) use the canny algorithm
    for edge detection of text and the k-means algorithm for clustered pixel recognition.
    This combination optimizes the maximum stable polar region and the image text
    stroke width to achieve better recognition rate, recall, precision, F-score, and
    accuracy. Moslehi and Haeri (2020) propose a hybrid filter packing method for
    feature subset selection, combining evolutionary-based genetic algorithm (GA)
    and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to reduce the computational complexity and
    search time spent in achieving an optimal solution to the feature selection problem
    for high-dimensional datasets. 2.3 Domain generalizable person re-identification
    Recently, many specific DG methods have emerged for the ReID task, which can be
    divided into two categories: (1) Domain generalization feature modeling. These
    methods capture shared features of multiple source domains and minimize individual
    domain bias, leading to a more robust generalization ability. Strategies such
    as domain adversarial learning (Lin et al. 2020), feature disentanglement learning
    (Zhang et al. 2021), meta-learning (Zhao et al. 2021), joint training, or normalization-based
    methods (Choi et al. 2020) are often used. (2) Unique domain feature modeling.
    (Lin et al. 2020) proposes a scenario learning scheme such that the learned features
    will exhibit sufficient domain-invariant properties without over-fitting the source
    domain data or ID tags. (Dai et al. 2021) proposes a new approach called Relevance-Aware
    Mixture of Experts (RaMoE) that uses an effective voting-based mixture mechanism
    to dynamically exploit different features of the source domain to improve the
    model. Yu et al. (2021) proposes a novel multidomain expert collaborative learning
    (MECL) framework, and uses domain-unique meta-learning strategies to prevent experts
    from overfitting the corresponding domains. Bai et al. (2021) designed a \"learn
    and then generalize evaluation\" meta-training procedure and a meta-discriminative
    loss to enhance the generalization and discriminative ability of the model. To
    address the problem existing moe-based DG re-identification methods have oversized
    models and mostly ignore the utilization of domain invariant features. Xu et al.
    (2021) proposes a DG pedestrian reidentification method based on Mimic Embedding
    via adapTive Aggregation (META). To avoid oversizing the model, the experts in
    META do not use branching networks for each source domain, but share all parameters
    except the batch normalization layer. Compared to previous methods, our approach
    can model both unique and generalizable features in a shared feature space. Moreover,
    the cross-meta-weight generator in our method is more effective in capturing cross-domain
    correlations than previous MOE-based methods, which reduces redundant modeling
    of domains. 2.4 Meta-learning Meta-learning (Thrun and Pratt 1998), the concept
    of learning to learn, has been applied to various depth-based applications including
    few-shot learning (Finn et al. 2017; Snell et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2019; Vinyals
    et al. 2016), model optimization (Li and Malik 2017; Andrychowicz et al. 2016;
    Ostad-Ali-Askari et al. 2017b, a), and domain generalization (Balaji et al. 2018;
    Guo et al. 2020; Li et al. 2018a, 2019b, a). Specifically, MAML (Finn et al. 2017)
    and Reptile (Nichol et al. 2018) are proposed to learn a good initialization for
    adapting the model to new tasks quickly. Li et al. (2018) extend MAML to closed-set
    domain generalization and meta-learning is now widely used in both closed-set
    (Balaji et al. 2018; Li et al. 2019b, a) and open-set (Guo et al. 2020) domain
    generalization tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning strategy
    for multi-source domain generalization in ReID, which is incorporated into the
    train-test process. 3 Methodology In this section, we present a novel framework
    called Multi-Source Adaptive Meta-Learning (MAM) to mitigate domain conflicts
    in DG-ReID. Our approach aims to model domain-generalized features and domain-unique
    features from multiple source domains in a shared feature space. We begin by providing
    an overview of the MAM framework. Subsequently, we introduce the core component,
    the Multi-Source Adaptive Feature Refinement (MAFR) block. Then, we present the
    learning paradigm of the adopted meta-learning principle and elaborate on the
    loss functions of our MAM framework. Afterward, we introduce meta-feature sampling
    used in our meta-test stage. Finally, we present the learning objectives of the
    meta-training and meta-test. Fig. 1 The overview of the feature extraction process
    and the detailed structure of MAFR block Full size image 3.1 Overview of MAM framework
    Figure 1 provides an overview of the proposed MAM framework, including the detailed
    structure of the MAFR block. To extract different levels of semantics separately
    (e.g., at low layers, extract hue and contrast; at high layers, extract carrying
    objects, viewpoints, and clothing styles, etc.), the MAM framework incorporates
    MAFR blocks into various layers of the model. To reduce computational costs, MAFR
    blocks replace the last convolutional block of each stage throughout the model.
    The MAFR block comprises three key components: the fine-grained feature extraction
    (FGFE) branch, the refinement feature supplement (RFS) branch, and the feature
    fusion (FF) module. The FGFE branch focuses on extracting fine-grained features
    that are applicable to multiple domains, allowing for the capture of domain-generalized
    characteristics. Then, a meta-weight generator, that is trained using a novel
    clustering loss function is introduced to produce meta-weights for adaptively
    aggregating and capturing desirable information. Simultaneously, the RFS branch
    complements the FGFE branch by extracting features specific to each domain, capturing
    the domain-unique information. This joint extraction process ensures a comprehensive
    representation of features across different domains. Finally, the FF module performs
    feature fusion by combining the learned features from the FGFE and RFS branches.
    This fusion process aggregates the domain-generalized and domain-unique features
    to generate the final output, which embodies a rich representation capturing both
    shared and distinctive characteristics within each domain. We propose a novel
    clustering loss function \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {cluster}}\\) specifically
    designed for the MAFR block, to ensure that the generated meta-weights effectively
    adapt to different domains, we employ an intra-domain clustering regularization
    to increase their inter-domain variance among different domains while reducing
    the intra-domain variance for a given domain. 3.2 Multi-source adaptive feature
    refinement (MAFR) block As shown in Fig. 1, the MAFR block consists of three components:
    the fine-grained feature extraction branch, the refinement feature supplementary
    branch, and the feature fusion module. Let \\(I \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^{H \\times
    W \\times C}\\) represent the feature map of the input MAFR, where H denotes height,
    W denotes width, and C denotes the number of channels, respectively. The processing
    procedure of the MAFR block is as follows: (1) The fine-grained feature extraction
    branch extracts fine-grained features \\(\\left\\{ I_i^F\\right\\} _{i=1}^N\\)
    through multiple parallel embedding spaces. These fine-grained features can capture
    domain-generalized features or domain-unique features. Here, N represents the
    number of embedding spaces. Then, by aggregating fine-grained features under the
    guidance of the meta-weight \\(Meta_w \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^N\\) generated by the
    meta-weight generator, the discriminative domain-adaptive features \\(I^F \\in
    {\\mathbb {R}}^{H \\times W \\times C}\\) is extracted. (2) The refinement feature
    supplementary branch extracts more robust and difficult-to-capture domain-generalized
    feature \\(I^G \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^{H \\times W \\times C}\\) from the input feature.
    (3) The feature fusion module integrates discriminative domain-adaptive feature
    \\(I^F\\) from the fine-grained feature extraction branch and domain-generalized
    feature \\(I^G\\) from the refinement feature supplementary branch to obtain the
    final output feature \\({\\tilde{I}} \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^{H \\times W \\times
    C}\\). 3.2.1 Fine-grained feature extraction branch The fine-grained feature extraction
    branch serves as the core of the MAFR block, encompassing multiple parallel feature
    embedding spaces. These spaces facilitate the creation of a shared feature space
    that accommodates both domain-generalized and domain-unique features across all
    domains. To guide the composition of discriminative domain-adaptive features,
    the fine-grained feature extraction branch incorporates a meta-weight generator,
    which provides instructions for each domain. (1) Feature Embedding Space. Due
    to the significant variations in hue, pedestrian objects, resolution, and other
    factors among different domains, relying on a single feature embedding space to
    capture an adequate set of features from the source domain becomes challenging.
    Therefore, we propose a design that incorporates a series of parallel feature
    embedding spaces. These spaces function as individual neural networks, enabling
    the simultaneous capture of both domain-generalized features and domain-unique
    features specific to each domain. By utilizing multiple parallel embedding spaces,
    our approach aims to better accommodate the diverse characteristics present within
    the source domain. We construct a total of N parallel feature embedding spaces,
    which are composed of bottleneck blocks in ResNet-IBN. Each embedding space is
    initialized differently to promote diversity. To mitigate computational overhead,
    we apply average pooling after each feature space. The fine-grained features \\(\\left\\{
    I_i^F\\right\\} _{i=1}^N\\) from the i-th feature embedding space can be represented
    as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} I_i^F={\\text {Embedding}}_i(I), \\text{ s.t. }
    i \\in [1 \\cdots N] \\text{, } \\end{aligned}$$ (1) where \\({\\text {Embedding}}_i\\)
    represents the i-th feature embedding space. All fine-grained features extracted
    from different feature embedding spaces are projected onto the same common feature
    space. The parallel feature embedding spaces are capable of capturing fine-grained
    domain-generalized features as well as domain-unique features, which serve as
    the foundation for subsequent feature aggregation. Notably, our approach, in contrast
    to prior methods (Xu et al. 2021; Bai et al. 2021; Dai et al. 2021), which focus
    on modeling features for each individual domain, enables the simultaneous learning
    of domain-generalized features and domain-unique features through the utilization
    of multiple parallel embedding spaces. This approach significantly reduces the
    risk of cross-domain interference and eliminates wasteful computational resource
    allocation in redundant feature space modeling. 2) Meta-weight Generator. As illustrated
    in Fig. 1, to adaptively capture domain-unique features, we introduce a meta-weight
    generator. This generator utilizes a weight generator to produce meta-weights,
    which are then used to adaptively aggregate the fine-grained features from the
    feature embedding spaces. The fine-grained features are fed into the meta-weight
    generator to obtain the meta-weight, which can be mathematically formalized as
    follows: $$\\begin{aligned} W_p=\\phi \\left( F_2 \\phi \\left( F_1 {\\text {pool}}(I)\\right)
    \\right) , \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where I represents the input features. The meta-weight
    generator consists of the global average pooling layer followed by two FC layers
    parameterized as \\(F_1 \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^{\\frac{C}{r} \\times C}\\) and \\(F_2
    \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^{N C \\times \\frac{C}{r}}\\), respectively. Specifically,
    the original feature is input to the global average pooling layer followed by
    two FC layers \\(F_1 \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^{\\frac{C}{r} \\times C}\\) and \\(F_2
    \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^{N C \\times \\frac{C}{r}}\\), respectively, with the reduction
    ratio \\(\\gamma \\) set to 8 and \\(\\phi (\\cdot )\\) representing the ReLU
    activation function. Finally, the meta-weights \\(Meta_w\\) are obtained by \\(Meta_w=\\delta
    \\left( W_p {\\text {pool}}(I)\\right) \\), where \\(Meta_w \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^N\\)
    and \\(\\delta (\\cdot )\\) denotes the Softmax function. By combining cross-domain
    features, we obtain the final adaptive domain features \\(I^F=\\sum _{i=1}^N Meta_{w_i}
    I_i^F\\), which is a weighted sum of the fine-grained features \\(\\left\\{ I_i^F\\right\\}
    _{i=1}^N\\). 3.2.2 Refinement feature supplementary branch In addition to the
    fine-grained feature extraction branch, we have incorporated a refinement feature
    supplementary branch to effectively extract domain-generalized features that are
    challenging to capture, so as to enhance the robustness of the model. The refinement
    feature supplementary branch shares the same architecture as the traditional bottleneck
    block in ResNet. However, we have replaced the batch normalization (BN) layer
    with the instance normalization (IN) layer, as introduced in Huang and Belongie
    (2017). The utilization of IN, which is a specialized style normalization technique,
    enables the filtering of domain-unique features and helps reduce sample discrepancies.
    Consequently, the refinement feature supplementary branch plays a crucial role
    in stabilizing and supplementing the adaptive features extracted from the fine-grained
    feature extraction branch. 3.2.3 Feature fusion module Following the extraction
    of the adaptive features \\(I^F\\) and the refined domain-generalized features
    \\(I^G\\), we introduce a feature fusion module to achieve complementarity. As
    depicted in Fig. 1, we begin by normalizing the two input features. Subsequently,
    we combine them using an optimized weight vector \\(\\lambda \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^C\\).
    Furthermore, we incorporate a channel attention mechanism (Hu et al. 2018) to
    enhance the feature fusion process. Formally, the aforementioned process can be
    expressed as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned}&{\\tilde{I}}=\\lambda
    * {\\text {Norm}}_G\\left( I^G\\right) +(1-\\lambda ) * {\\text {Norm}}_F\\left(
    I^F\\right) , \\\\&{\\tilde{I}}={\\tilde{I}} * {\\text {Sigmoid}}\\left( F_2^r
    \\phi \\left( F_1^r {\\text {pool}}({\\tilde{I}})\\right) \\right) , \\end{aligned}
    \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where \\(*\\) represents element-wise multiplication, \\(F_1^r\\)
    and \\(F_2^r\\) are FC layers with dimensions \\({\\mathbb {R}}^{\\frac{C}{r}
    \\times C}\\) and \\({\\mathbb {R}}^{C \\times \\frac{C}{r}}\\), respectively.
    3.3 Meta-learning objectives 3.3.1 Learning paradigm of meta-learning We incorporate
    a meta-learning strategy during the training–testing process to enhance the model’s
    generalization ability. Specifically, in the training–testing process, we leverage
    the concept of “learning to learn” to learn more powerful generalization features.
    We consider a set of source domains denoted as \\({\\mathcal {D}} = {{\\mathcal
    {D}}_1, \\ldots , {\\mathcal {D}}_T}\\), where S represents the number of source
    domains. During each training iteration, the S source domains are randomly partitioned
    into \\(S-1\\) domains for meta-training and the remaining 1 domain for meta-test.
    In the meta-training stage, we calculate the meta-training loss \\({\\mathcal
    {L}}_{\\text {train}}\\) using the meta-training samples to optimize the model.
    Subsequently, in the meta-test phase, the optimized model is employed to compute
    the meta-test loss \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {test}}\\) on the meta-test samples.
    Finally, the network is optimized by combining the losses from both the meta-training
    and meta-test stages. This is achieved through the following expression: $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\underset{\\zeta }{\\arg \\min }\\ \\quad {\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {train}}(\\zeta
    )+{\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {test}}\\left( \\zeta ^{\\prime }\\right) , \\end{aligned}$$
    (4) where \\(\\zeta \\) represents the parameter of the model, \\(\\zeta ^{\\prime
    }\\) represents the model parameter after \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text{ train }
    }\\) optimization, i.e., a step forward than \\(\\zeta ^{\\prime }\\). Now, the
    key is to construct suitable loss functions for \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {train}}\\)
    and \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {test}}\\), which are detailed in the following
    parts. In the next, we provide the loss function used in this paper first. Then,
    we introduce the meta-feature sampling strategy. Finally, we present the learning
    objectives of \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {train}}\\) and \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text
    {test}}\\), respectively. Fig. 2 The entire process of processing the unknown
    domain identification loss Full size image 3.3.2 Loss functions In this subsection,
    we provide the loss functions used in our paper. Clustering Loss: We propose a
    novel clustering loss function \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {cluster}}\\) specifically
    designed for the MAFR block. In order to ensure that the generated meta-weights
    effectively adapt to different domains, we employ an intra-domain clustering regularization
    to increase their inter-domain variance among different domains while reducing
    the intra-domain variance for a given domain. Let \\(Meta_w \\in {\\mathbb {R}}^{M
    \\times N}\\) denote the meta-weights of all modules, where M represents the number
    of MAFR blocks and N represents the number of feature embedding spaces in MAFR.
    The expressions for the intra-domain loss \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {intra}}\\)
    and inter-domain loss \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {inter}}\\) are as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\begin{aligned} {\\mathcal {L}}_{intra}&=\\frac{1}{K \\times L} \\sum _{i=1}^K
    \\sum _{j=1}^L\\left[ \\left\\| Meta_{w_{i, j}}-\\overline{Meta_{w_{i,:}}}\\right\\|
    _2-m_1\\right] _{}^2, \\\\ {\\mathcal {L}}_{inter}&=\\frac{1}{K(K-1)} \\sum _{i=1}^K
    \\sum _{j \\ne i}^K\\left[ m_2-\\left\\| \\overline{Meta_{w_{i,:}}}-\\overline{Meta_{w_{j,:}}}\\right\\|
    _2\\right] _{}^2, \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (5) where K denotes the number
    of domains, \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are margin parameters, L represents the number
    of instances associated with a domain, \\(Meta_{w_{i, j}}\\) represents the j-th
    instance of domain i, and \\(\\overline{Meta_{w_{i,:}}}\\) represents the cluster
    center of domain i. The clustering loss \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{\\text {cluster}}\\)
    can be expressed directly as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} {\\mathcal {L}}_{cluster}={\\mathcal
    {L}}_{inter}+{\\mathcal {L}}_{intra}. \\end{aligned}$$ (6) In this way, the meta-weights
    are trained to be diverse for different domains while to be concentrated on the
    same domain. As a result, the inter-domain variance increase while the intra-domain
    variance reduces. Unknown Domain Identification Loss: We introduced unknown domain
    identification loss, which is designed to improve the identity estimation of unknown
    domains for learning the discriminative features, for enhancing the discriminability
    of learned features. The entire process of the unknown domain identification loss
    is shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the unknown domain identification loss
    requires a known domain D and an unlabeled domain \\(D^\\prime \\). Specifically,
    D is composed of labeled features \\(D^f\\) and real labels \\(D^l\\). Similarly,
    \\(D^\\prime \\) is composed of unlabeled features \\(D^{\\prime f}\\) and pseudo-labels
    \\(D^{\\prime l}\\). The pseudo-labels are estimated by D and updated along with
    D’s changes. In particular, \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{udi}\\) guides D to retain useful
    information and guides \\(D^\\prime \\) to retain reliable information. \\({\\mathcal
    {L}}_{udi}\\) feeds reliable pseudo-samples back as labeled samples to expand
    the sample set with domain styles that are inconsistent or misaligned, achieving
    progressive learning. We use the Least Recently Used Access (LRUA) (Santoro et
    al. 2016) algorithm to refine labeled samples \\(s_1\\), i.e., labeled samples
    and refine reliable pseudo-samples \\(s_2\\), i.e., unknown domain samples. The
    following is the mathematical description of the \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{udi}\\):
    (1) For inserting into the memory slots of the labeled domain: LRUA specifies
    inserting information into the slot that is last used, to update the memory with
    more relevant information, or to insert into the least used slot while preserving
    recently encoded information. For the i-th labeled sample, its feature \\(k_i\\)
    and label \\(y_i\\) are inserted into \\(D_i^f\\) and \\(D_i^l\\), respectively.
    The insertion is performed using an average weight denoted as \\(W_i^a\\) and
    a least recently used weight denoted as \\(W_i^l\\). Furthermore, an evaluation
    weight denoted as \\(W_i^e\\) is utilized to evaluate the importance of each feature
    \\(D_i^f\\) to the feature \\(k_i\\), and an insertion weight denoted as \\(W_i^I\\)
    is employed to insert the feature \\(k_i\\) into the memory slot \\(D_i^f\\).
    The effectiveness of the task slots is determined by write operations, read operations,
    and the previous state. In this context, the average weight \\(W_i^a\\) is defined
    as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} W_i^a=\\kappa _1 W_{i-1}^a+W_i^e+W_i^I, \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) Where \\(\\kappa _1\\) is the attenuation factor, we consider the least important
    slot in \\(k_i\\) as the least used slot, and therefore, \\(W_i^l\\) is defined
    as: $$\\begin{aligned} W_i^l(n)= {\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}1 &{} \\text{ if
    } W_i^a(n)=\\min \\left( W_i^a\\right) , \\\\ 0 &{} \\text{ otherwise. } \\end{array}\\right.
    } \\end{aligned}$$ (8) We evaluate the importance of each slot by calculating
    the distance between each unit in \\(k_i\\) and \\(D_i^f\\), and then find the
    index position I in \\(D_i^l\\) to insert \\(y_i\\). \\(W_i^e\\) and the write
    index I are defined as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} W_i^e(n) =\\frac{\\exp
    \\left( \\cos \\left( k_i, D_i^f(n)\\right) \\right) }{\\sum _{i=1}^{s_1} \\exp
    \\left( \\cos \\left( k_i, D_i^f(n)\\right) \\right) }, \\end{aligned}$$ (9) $$\\begin{aligned}{}
    & {} I ={\\text {find}}\\left( \\max \\left( W_i^e\\right) , D_i^l\\right) , \\end{aligned}$$
    (10) where the function \\(\\cos (\\cdot )\\) represents the cosine distance,
    \\(\\max (\\cdot )\\) returns the maximum value of a vector, and find(a, b) returns
    the index when b satisfies the condition a. In addition to considering the importance
    of each slot in \\(D_i^f\\), \\(W_i^I\\) also takes into account the insertion
    operation (write operation). \\(W_i^I\\) is defined as: $$\\begin{aligned} W_i^I=\\sigma
    (\\alpha ) W_{i-1}^e+(1-\\sigma (\\alpha )) W_{i-1}^{l }, \\end{aligned}$$ (11)
    where the function\\(\\sigma (\\alpha )=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\alpha }}\\) is used
    to interpolate between weights. \\(\\sigma \\) is a learnable scalar. Newly inserted
    content tends to be written into either the most recently used slot \\((\\sigma
    (\\alpha ) \\rightarrow 1)\\) or the least frequently used slot \\((\\sigma (\\alpha
    ) \\rightarrow 0)\\). Before writing D, the least frequently used slot is cleared.
    The cleaning operation is as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} D_i^f(n)&=D_{i-1}^f(n)
    \\cdot \\left( 1-W_{i-1}^{l }(n)\\right) ,&\\forall n, \\\\ D_i^l(i)&=D_{i-1}^l(i)
    \\cdot \\left( 1-W_{i-1}^{l }(i)\\right) ,&\\forall n.\\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$
    (12) Finally, \\(k_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) are inserted into \\(D_i^f\\) and \\(D^l_i\\),
    respectively: $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned}&D_i^f(n)=D_{i-1}^f(n)+W_i^I(n)
    k_i, \\quad \\forall _n \\\\&D_i^l(n)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lll} y_i, &{} \\forall
    _n, &{} n=I, \\\\ D_{i-1}^l(n), &{} \\forall _n, &{} n \\ne I. \\end{array}\\right.
    \\\\&\\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (13) (2) For inserting into the memory slots
    of the unknown domain (unlabeled domain): Before writing \\(k^\\prime _i\\) into
    \\(D^{\\prime f}_i\\), we first retrieve its pseudo-label \\(y^\\prime _i\\) from
    the label domain \\(D^l_t\\) using the retrieval weight \\(W^r_i\\). We find the
    index \\(I_r\\) in \\(D^l_i\\) that is most similar to \\(k_i\\) and assign the
    label in \\(D^l_t\\) with index \\(I_r\\) to \\(y^\\prime _i\\). The above process
    can be represented as: $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} W_i^r(i)&=\\frac{\\exp
    \\left( \\cos \\left( k_i^{\\prime }, D_i^f(n)\\right) \\right) }{\\sum _{i=1}^{s_2}
    \\exp \\left( \\cos \\left( k_i^{\\prime }, D_i^f(n)\\right) \\right) } \\\\ I^r=&{\\text
    {find}}\\left( \\max \\left( W_i^r\\right) , D_t^l\\right) , \\\\ y_i^{\\prime
    }&=D_i^l\\left( I^r\\right) . \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (14) We write the
    weights \\(W^{\\prime e}_a\\), \\(W^{\\prime e}_l\\), \\(W^{\\prime e}_i\\), \\(W^{\\prime
    e}_I\\), and the insert position index \\(I^\\prime \\) into \\(D^{\\prime f}_i\\)
    and \\(D^{\\prime l}_i\\), respectively, using the same insertion method as in
    the labeled domain. After the training phase, the memory D retains the labeled
    sample information that is valuable for estimating pseudo-labels, while the memory
    \\(D^\\prime \\) retains reliable pseudo-sample information. When new unlabeled
    samples, specifically unknown domain samples, are introduced during training,
    their pseudo-labels can be estimated based on the current state of the memory
    M. Subsequently, the memory \\(D^\\prime \\) can be updated accordingly, which
    actually gives the idea of progressive mutual learning. To ensure that the inter-class
    distance between features in \\(D_f\\) is sufficiently large to make the pseudo-label
    estimates meaningful when assigning a pseudo-label \\(y^\\prime _i\\) to the feature
    \\(k^\\prime _i\\), we divide the samples stored in D into two sets: positive
    and negative samples. This division is based on their similarity with the feature
    \\(k^\\prime _i\\). Specifically, we construct a positive set denoted as \\({\\mathcal
    {P}}\\) and a negative set denoted as \\({\\mathcal {N}}\\). In this context,
    samples labeled as \\(y^\\prime _i\\) in the memory M are treated as positive
    samples, while the remaining samples are considered as negative samples: $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\begin{aligned} {\\mathcal {P}}&=\\left\\{ n \\mid D_i^l(n)=y_i^{\\prime }, \\forall
    _n\\right\\} , \\\\ {\\mathcal {N}}&=\\left\\{ n \\mid D_i^l(n) \\ne y_i^{\\prime
    },\\forall _n\\right\\} . \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (15) In addition, some
    previously written pseudo-labels may be incorrect and detrimental to learning.
    They have the same pseudo-label as \\(k^\\prime _i\\), but their features are
    not similar enough to \\(k^\\prime _i\\). That is, they have a different pseudo-label
    than \\(k_i\\), while their features are very similar to \\(k_i\\). Therefore,
    we construct false positive set \\({\\mathcal {F}}_P\\) and false negative set
    \\({\\mathcal {F}}_N\\): $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned}&{\\mathcal {F}}_P=\\left\\{
    i \\mid D^{\\prime l}(n)=y^{\\prime }, W_i^{\\prime e}(n) \\notin \\max \\left(
    W_i^{\\prime e}, N\\right) \\right\\} , \\\\&{\\mathcal {F}}_N=\\left\\{ i \\mid
    D^{\\prime l}{ }_i(n) \\ne y^{\\prime }, W_i^{\\prime e}(n) \\in \\max \\left(
    W_i^{\\prime e}, N\\right) \\right\\} . \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (16) Before
    writing to \\(D^\\prime \\), the slots of the false positive and false negative
    samples are cleared, i.e., \\(D_i^{\\prime f}(n)=0, D_i^{\\prime l}(n)=0, \\forall
    n \\in {\\mathcal {F}}_P, {\\mathcal {F}}_N\\), for all i in \\({\\mathcal {F}}_P\\)
    and \\({\\mathcal {F}}_N\\), where N is the number of pseudo-samples labeled \\(y^\\prime
    \\) in \\(D^\\prime \\). The unknown domain identification loss is defined as:
    $$\\begin{aligned} {\\mathcal {L}}_{u di}=-\\log \\frac{{\\bar{P}}}{{\\bar{P}}+{\\bar{N}}}-
    \\log \\frac{{\\bar{F}}_P}{{\\bar{F}}_P+{\\bar{F}}_N}, \\end{aligned}$$ (17) where
    $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned}&{\\bar{P}}=\\frac{1}{|{\\mathcal {P}}|} \\sum
    _{n \\in {\\mathcal {P}}} W_i^r(n),&{\\bar{N}}=\\frac{1}{|{\\mathcal {N}}|} \\sum
    _{n \\in {\\mathcal {N}}} W_t^r(i), \\\\&{\\bar{F}}_P=\\frac{1}{\\left| {\\mathcal
    {F}}_P\\right| } \\sum _{n \\in {\\mathcal {F}}_P} W^{\\prime e}(n),&{\\bar{F}}_N=\\frac{1}{\\left|
    {\\mathcal {F}}_N\\right| } \\sum _{n \\in {\\mathcal {F}}_N} W^{\\prime e}(n),
    \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (18) The first term of \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{udi}\\)
    enhances the discriminability of the features in D, which is beneficial for the
    estimation of pseudo-labels for the samples from the unknown domain, while the
    second term of \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{u di}\\) further reduces the error rate of
    the estimation, making the pseudo-samples retained in \\(D^\\prime \\) more reliable.
    Since the pseudo-labels are estimated based on the similarity of the features
    of the unknown domain samples and the features in \\(D^\\prime \\), the discriminability
    of the features in \\(D^\\prime \\) also increases accordingly. This can be clearly
    observed from Fig. 2. Identification Loss: we propose a non-parametric identification
    loss for meta-test. As shown in Fig. 3, we add a feature bank for each domain,
    which is used to store the centroid of each identity. The identification loss
    is computed by measuring the similarity between the embedded features and the
    centroids. This identification loss offers two advantages within the meta-learning
    framework. Firstly, the feature bank serves as a non-parametric classifier, avoiding
    unstable optimization caused by a large number of parameters. Secondly, as the
    feature bank is smoothly updated through momentum rather than the optimizer, asynchronous
    updates between the feature encoder and feature bank have minimal impact on model
    training. Consequently, the feature bank remains insensitive to iteration-induced
    changes in feature encoders. Assuming that the source domain \\({\\mathcal {D}}_i,
    i \\in {1, 2, \\cdots , S}\\) consists of \\(n_i\\) identities, the corresponding
    feature bank \\({\\mathcal {B}}_i\\) contains \\(n_i\\) slots, with each slot
    storing the feature centroid of the corresponding identity. During initialization,
    we extract features for all samples in \\({\\mathcal {D}}_i\\) using the MAFR
    block. Subsequently, we calculate the average of the features for each identity
    and store them in the feature bank as the centroids. In each iteration, we update
    the feature bank with the features captured in the current mini-batch. This process
    can be formalized as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} {\\mathcal {B}}_{[k]} \\leftarrow
    \\eta \\cdot {\\mathcal {B}}_{[k]}+(1-\\eta ) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\left| {\\mathcal
    {S}}_k\\right| } \\sum _{x_i \\in {\\mathcal {S}}_k} f\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}\\right)
    , \\end{aligned}$$ (19) where \\({\\mathcal {S}}_k\\) is the number of samples
    for k-th identity, and \\(\\left| {\\mathcal {B}}_k\\right| \\) is the number
    of samples for k-th identity in the current mini-batch. \\(\\eta \\in [0,1]\\)
    is used to control the updating rate. \\(f\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}\\right) \\) represents
    the feature embedding of the forward propagation of the MAFR block, and we compute
    the similarity between \\(f\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}\\right) \\) and each centroid
    in the feature bank. Our proposed identification loss aims to classify each identity
    in \\(f\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}\\right) \\), which is calculated as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    {\\mathcal {L}}_{id}=-\\log \\frac{\\exp \\left( {\\mathcal {B}}_{[i]}^T f\\left(
    {{\\tilde{I}}}\\right) / \\tau \\right) }{\\sum _{k=1}^{n_i} \\exp \\left( {\\mathcal
    {B}}_{[k]}^T f\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}\\right) / \\tau \\right) }, \\end{aligned}$$
    (20) where \\(\\tau \\) is used to adjust the temperature factor of the distribution.
    Fig. 3 The complete process of meta-training and meta-test for the MAM framework
    Full size image Triplet Loss: In addition, we also add the triplet loss (Hermans
    et al. 2017), formalized as: $$\\begin{aligned} {\\mathcal {L}}_{t r i}=\\left[
    d_n-d_p+\\epsilon \\right] _{+}, \\end{aligned}$$ (21) where \\(d_n\\) denotes
    the Euclidean distance between anchor features and hard negative features, and
    \\(d_p\\) denotes the Euclidean distance between anchor features and hard positive
    features. \\(\\epsilon \\) is the triplet loss margin, and \\([\\cdot ]_{+}\\)
    is \\(\\max (\\cdot , 0)\\). 3.4 Meta-feature sampling In the context of meta-learning,
    the meta-test loss plays a crucial role in learning a generalizable model as it
    simulates an \"unseen\" domain. The optimization process towards robust domain
    generalization is further enhanced when the samples in the meta-test phase are
    drawn from a diverse distribution. To generate more diverse meta-test features,
    we introduce a meta-feature sampling method. This approach incorporates domain-unique
    information from the meta-training phase into the meta-test features, resulting
    in feature variations that simulate a broader range of domains. During the meta-training
    phase, for the i-th meta-training domain, we save the mean \\(\\mu _i\\) and variance
    \\(\\sigma _i\\) of the mini-batch before normalizing the features using conventional
    batch normalization (BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015). In the subsequent meta-test
    stage, we utilize the saved mean and variance to form a Gaussian distribution
    for each of the \\(S-1\\) source domain features. It is important to note that
    the saved mean and variance are obtained from multiple identity samples, and thus,
    the generated distribution primarily reflects high-level domain information rather
    than specific identity information. Consequently, we sample features from these
    generative distributions and integrate them with the original meta-test features.
    Specifically, for the distribution of i-th domain, we sample the feature \\(u^i
    \\sim {\\mathcal {N}}(\\mu _i, \\sigma _i)\\) for augmenting meta-test features,
    where \\({\\mathcal {N}}\\) denotes a Gaussian distribution. For each domain,
    we obtain C sampled features in total. These sampled features \\(u^i\\) are then
    combined with the original meta-test features \\(F^i\\), denoted as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    {\\hat{F}}^i=\\rho F+(1-\\rho ) U^i, \\end{aligned}$$ (22) where \\(F^i=\\left[
    f_0^i, f_1^i, \\dots , f_C^i\\right] \\) is the original meta-test sample features,
    \\(U^i=\\left[ u_0^i, u_1^i, \\dots , u_C^i\\right] \\) denote the C features
    sampled from the Gaussian distribution of i-th domain. \\(\\rho \\) is the mixing
    coefficient, sampled from a Beta distribution, ie., \\(\\rho \\sim {\\text {Beta}}(1,1)\\).
    As a result, we obtain the mixed feature \\({\\hat{F}}^i=\\left[ {\\hat{f}}_0^i,
    {\\hat{f}}_1^i, \\dots , {\\hat{f}}_C^i\\right] \\) for meta-test, which servers
    as the input to calculate the loss in meta-test stage. 3.5 Learning objectives
    for meta-training and meta-test For i-th meta-training domain, the meta-training
    loss consists of Eqs. 21, 20, 6, and 17, which is expressed as: $$\\begin{aligned}{}
    & {} {\\mathcal {L}}_{train}^i={\\mathcal {L}}_{t r i}\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}_i;
    \\zeta \\right) \\nonumber \\\\{} & {} \\quad +{\\mathcal {L}}_{id}\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}_i,
    {\\mathcal {B}}_i; \\zeta \\right) +{\\mathcal {L}}_{cluster}\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}_i
    \\right) +{\\mathcal {L}}_{udi}\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}_i \\right) , \\end{aligned}$$
    (23) where \\({{\\tilde{I}}}_i\\) denotes the images from i-th meta-training domain.
    The average total loss of meta-training on \\(S-1\\) meta-training domains is
    expressed as: $$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} {\\mathcal {L}}_{train}=\\frac{1}{S-1}
    \\nonumber \\\\{} & {} \\quad \\sum _{i=0}^{S-1} {\\mathcal {L}}_{train}^i. \\end{aligned}$$
    (24) In the meta-testing stage, we use the new model parameter \\(\\zeta ^{\\prime
    }\\) optimized by \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{train}\\), combined with the proposed meta-feature
    sampling method, to obtain the mixed features from \\(S-1\\) domains, which are
    used to calculate the loss for meta-test. The meta-test loss consists of Eqs.
    21, 20 and 6: $$\\begin{aligned} {\\mathcal {L}}_{test}= & {} {\\mathcal {L}}_{tri}\\left(
    {{\\tilde{I}}}_t; \\zeta ^{\\prime }\\right) +\\frac{1}{S-1} \\sum _{k=0}^{S-1}
    {\\mathcal {L}}_{id}\\left( f_t^k, {\\mathcal {B}}_t; \\zeta ^{\\prime }\\right)
    \\nonumber \\\\{} & {} +{\\mathcal {L}}_{cluster}\\left( {{\\tilde{I}}}_t \\right)
    , \\end{aligned}$$ (25) where \\({{\\tilde{I}}}_t\\) represents the meta-testing
    samples, and \\({\\hat{f}}_t^k\\) represents the mixed feature of the t-th samples
    of k-th domain generated by the meta-feature sampling method. The overall process
    of meta_training and meta_testing for MAM Framework is shown in Fig. 3. 3.6 Model
    optimization The model is optimized according to the objectives in Eq. 4. The
    optimization process of the whole model is in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Training
    Process of MAM Framework Full size image 4 Experiments 4.1 Datasets and evaluation
    settings 4.1.1 Datasets We conduct experiments on several large-scale public ReID
    benchmarks, including Market1501 (M) (Zheng et al. 2015), CUHK02 (C2) (Li and
    Wang 2013), MSMT17 (MS) (Wei et al. 2018), CUHK03 (C3) (Li et al. 2014), CUHK-SYSU
    (CS) (Xiao et al. 2016b), and four small ReID datasets: GRID (Loy et al. 2010),
    VIPeR (Gray and Tao 2008), iLIDs (Zheng et al. 2009), and PRID (Hirzer et al.
    2011). In particular, we adopt the \"labeled\" data in CUHK03 following the setup
    of (Dai et al. 2021; Zhong et al. 2017). The details of the datasets are shown
    in Table 1. Table 1 Details of all the datasets Full size table Table 2 Evaluation
    protocols Full size table 4.2 Evaluation protocols For evaluating the performance
    of our model, we use the mean Average Precision (mAP), the cumulative matching
    characteristic (CMC) at Rank-k (R-k) as the evaluation metrics. In compliance
    with CVPR 2022 ethical guidelines, we exclude DukeMTMC (Zheng et al. 2017) and
    adopt the new evaluation protocols proposed in (Xu et al. 2021; Zheng et al. 2021;
    Dai et al. 2021) to assess the generalization ability of the model. The details
    of the evaluation protocols are presented in Table 2. Protocol-1: In protocol-1,
    the model is trained using all the data in M, C2, C3, and CS as source domains,
    where the training set and testing set of each dataset are included in the model
    training. The data in the remaining four small datasets are used as the target
    source, which is the unseen domain used as the test set. As these small datasets
    do not have a formal split of the probe and gallery sets, we randomly split the
    probe/gallery sets 10 times and record the average evaluation performance as the
    final results. Protocol-2 and Protocol-3: To better reflect the generalization
    ability of the model in real-world scenarios, two new protocols (i.e., leave-one-out
    setting) were proposed by (Dai et al. 2021; Zhao et al. 2021) for four large-scale
    Re-ID datasets. In Protocol-2 and Protocol-3, four large-scale ReID datasets (M,
    CS, C3 and MS) are divided into two parts: three datasets are selected as seen
    domains for training, and the remaining datasets are used as unseen domains for
    testing. However, in Protocol-3, the testing set from the source domains is also
    used for model training, while Protocol-2 only uses the training set of the source
    domains for model training. It is worth noting that since the ReID dataset CS
    only contains 1 camera, it is not used as the testing set in these protocols.
    It should be noted that due to the poor image quality of small-scale ReID datasets,
    the performance on these datasets may not accurately reflect the generalization
    ability of the model in real-world scenarios. 4.3 Implementation details We implement
    the MAM framework using the ResNet50 (He et al. 2016) pretrained on ImageNet.
    The input images are resized to 256\\(\\times \\)128, and the training batch size
    is set to 64, including a total of 16 identities and 4 images per identity. We
    apply random flipping and random cropping for data augmentation. The momentum
    coefficient \\(\\eta \\) in Eq. 19 is set to 0.2, and the temperature factor \\(\\tau
    \\) in Eq. 20 is set to 0.05. The margin \\(\\epsilon \\) in triplet loss in Eq.
    21 is 0.3. The hyper-parameter \\(\\lambda \\) in Eq. 3 is set to 0.9. To optimize
    the model, we use the Adam optimizer with a weight decay of 0.0005. The learning
    rates of the inner loop parameter \\(\\zeta \\) and the outer loop parameter \\(\\beta
    \\) are initialized to \\(3.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\) and linearly increased to \\(3.5
    \\times 10^{-4}\\) in the first 10 epochs. Then, \\(\\zeta \\) and \\(\\beta \\)
    are decayed by 0.1 at the 25th epoch and 50th epoch, respectively. The entire
    training phase requires 60 epochs. The final layer of the backbone network outputs
    a 2048-dimensional vector, among which 2045 dimensions are used as keys and stored
    in the feature storage \\(D^f\\) or \\(D^{\\prime f}\\). The proposed network
    is implemented using the PyTorch framework on a server with 4 GeForce RTX 3090
    GPUs and 96 GB of RAM. Table 3 Comparison with state-of-the-art methods under

    Full size table 4.4 Comparison with the state-of-the-arts 4.4.1 Comparison under
    protocol-1 Under Protocol-1, we compared MAM with other state-of-the-art methods
    in terms of mAP, Rank-1, Rank-5, and Rank-10 values, as shown in Tables 3 and
    4. We also presented some results by including DukeMTMC-reID (Zheng et al. 2017)
    in the source domains and removing it from the training set. Despite using fewer
    source domains, MAM still achieved the best performance. Specifically, MAM outperformed
    other methods by at least 1.3% and 0.9% on average mAP and Rank-1, respectively,
    and achieved the best performance on PRID, GRID, VIPeR, and iLIDs. In our comparison,
    we additionally selected 11 representative models, all of which were trained on
    data partitions from the target dataset. Despite the inaccessibility of data from
    the target domain for DIR-ReID, MAM achieved competitive or better performance
    on all four benchmarks, indicating that our Multi-source Adaptive Feature Refinement
    (MAFR) module and progressive meta-learning training process can alleviate the
    need for target domain data. Furthermore, as shown in Table 4, compared to other
    DG-ReID methods, DIR-ReID achieved the best performance in Rank-5 and Rank-10
    values on all four benchmarks. Specifically, in terms of average Rank-5 and Rank-10,
    MAM outperformed other methods by at least 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively. Interestingly,
    methods such as \\(\\text {SNR}\\) (Jin et al. 2020) and \\(\\text {M}^3\\) (Zhao
    et al. 2021) perform very well in iLIDS but had lower performance on other datasets,
    indicating unstable generalization ability of these models. On the other hand,
    our MAM maintained high-performance values on all benchmarks, further demonstrating
    its superior generalization ability. 4.4.2 Comparison under protocol-2 and protocol-3
    We conduct a comparison of MAM with other state-of-the-art methods under Protocol-2
    and Protocol-3, as presented in Tables 5 and 6. Protocol-2 uses only the training
    set in the source domain for training, while Protocol-3 employs all images in
    the source domains, including both the training set and the testing set, during
    training. The experimental results indicate that MAM outperforms other methods
    significantly on all datasets and under both protocols. Specifically, the average
    performance of MAM in terms of mAP and Rank-1 under Protocol-2 and Protocol-3
    is respectively 1.0%, 0.9%, 1.5%, and 1.4% higher than other methods. The experimental
    results demonstrate the superiority of MAM in domain generalization. All models
    in Protocol-2 and Protocol-3 are trained only on the source data without any model
    adaptation in the target domain. As the camera views in the same dataset may have
    similar imaging characteristics (such as background environment, resolution, etc.),
    the variation of specific domain factors in a single dataset may be smaller than
    that of multiple data sources, making cross-domain Re-ID tasks extremely challenging.
    Nevertheless, Table 6 shows that our DIR-ReID framework achieves comparable performance
    on both protocols. This indicates that MAM can improve the generalization ability
    of the algorithm even in cases of small domain changes. Unlike MetaBIN (Choi et
    al. 2020) and \\(M^3L\\) (Zhao et al. 2021), MAM does not require any model adjustments
    on the target domain data, significantly reducing the cost of large-scale data
    collection in ReID model deployment. 4.4.3 Comparison of model complexity and
    time cost Apart from accuracy, we also compared the complexity and time cost of
    the models, including SNR (Jin et al. 2020), RaMoE (Dai et al. 2021), DMG-Net
    (Bai et al. 2021), and \\(\\text {M}^3\\text {L}\\) (Zhao et al. 2021). In the
    Market1501 (Zheng et al. 2015) dataset, we calculated the GFLOPs (billions of
    floating-point operations per second) and average training time (s/epoch) for
    each model, as shown in Table 7. It can be seen that although our MAM model has
    the highest accuracy, it has lower complexity and faster training time. Therefore,
    MAM has broader practical value and is easier to deploy. Table 7 Comparison of

    4.5.1 Effectiveness of the fine-grained feature extraction branch and refinement
    feature supplementary branch All ablation studies were conducted according to
    Protocol-3. The MAFR block in MAM is composed of two branches: the refinement
    feature supplementary branch, which extracts more robust domain generalization
    features, and the fine-grained feature extraction branch, which extracts domain
    adaptive features. As presented in Table 8, we investigate the impact of these
    two branches on the performance of the MAM framework. \"Baseline\" refers to the
    normal model without the MAFR block, which follows the same training settings
    as our training phase. It is noteworthy that even by solely utilizing the fine-grained
    feature extraction branch, a substantial performance improvement can be achieved,
    indicating the effectiveness of adaptive feature modeling. When combined with
    the refinement feature branch, the generalization performance can be further enhanced.
    All ablation studies in this paper were conducted under Protocol-3. 4.5.2 Effectiveness
    of the meta-weight generator We also compare the methods of directly using weight
    parameters aggregation, using softmax to directly assign weight parameters, and
    our meta-weight generator to obtain meta-parameter aggregation. The meta-weight
    generator adaptively generates domain-aware meta-weights for each sample by the
    meta-parameter generator to predict the parameter weights of the weight generator.
    Table 9 verifies the effectiveness of the meta-weight generator. We replace the
    meta-weight generator in MAM with other methods for comparative experiments. It
    can be found that the meta-weight generator of MAM is more adaptable to samples,
    and it can better reduce inter-domain conflicts. 4.5.3 Effectiveness of the feature
    fusion module Table 10 demonstrates the effectiveness of the Feature Fusion Module
    in our approach. Without the fusion module, our direct sum method for combining
    the two branch features has limited impact. However, by comparing the addition
    of the normalization layer and weighted summation layer, we find that our feature
    fusion module can better integrate these features and achieve superior generalization
    performance. Our experimental results show that the addition of the fusion module
    improves average performance by 0.9% in mean average precision (mAP) and 1.3%
    in rank-1 accuracy. Fig. 4 Average performance of different numbers parallel embedding
    spaces in MAFR blocks under Protocol-3 Full size image Table 12 Ablation study

    Exploring the impact of MAFR block embedding position on performance Because the
    MAFR block is an embedded module, it can be inserted into the backbone network
    in multiple stages. We conduct the ablation study to explore the impact of different
    embedding stages on the backbone network. The results are shown in Table 11, embedding
    to a higher semantic level can achieve better performance. Furthermore, the combination
    of multiple MAFR blocks at different semantic levels can better model cross-domain
    features for better generalization performance. 4.5.5 Ablation study for the number
    of embedding spaces in MAFR blocks Figure 4 demonstrates the impact of different
    numbers of parallel embedding spaces N in the MAFR block on the model performance.
    It can be observed that the model achieves the highest mAP and Rank-1 values when
    \\(N=4\\). When N is smaller or larger than 4, the model performance decreases.
    This experimental result is consistent with the understanding that \"the more
    embedding spaces there are, the more diverse and fine-grained features can be
    modeled, but it also increases the complexity of the model processing.\" Therefore,
    to achieve better generalization performance, we choose to use four embedding
    spaces in each MAFR block. Fig. 5 In CUHK03 dataset under Protocol-3, the t-SNE

    and meta-feature sampling Ablation studies are conducted in Table 12 to demonstrate
    the effectiveness of the meta-learning strategy. It is evident that the model
    trained with the proposed meta-learning strategy leads to a significant improvement
    in model performance. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the meta-feature sampling
    method is also verified, indicating that integrating meta-learning strategies
    during model training and testing facilitates the learning of domain-invariant
    features. 4.5.7 Ablation study of loss function components Table 13 experimentally
    evaluates the impact of loss function components on model performance. When \\({\\mathcal
    {L}}{cluster}\\) is employed as the primary supervising method for model training,
    the unknown domain identification loss \\({\\mathcal {L}}{udi}\\) significantly
    enhances the generalization performance, while incorporating the identification
    loss \\({\\mathcal {L}}_{id}\\) marginally improves the performance. 4.6 Visualization
    4.6.1 T-SNE Visualization To better understand the effectiveness of our proposed
    method, we visualize the final features extracted from different unseen domains
    under Protocol-3 in Figs. 5 and 6. We plot the feature distributions of each identity
    in the query and gallery sets using t-SNE (Van der Maaten and Hinton 2008) in
    a two-dimensional space and visualize them, where each point represents a single
    identity in either the query or gallery set. As shown in Figs. 5(b) and 6(b),
    under the MAM framework, we obtain more compact feature representations for unseen
    target domains, with features belonging to the same class gradually clustering
    together. This further confirms that MAM has stronger discriminative power and
    better generalization ability. 4.6.2 MAFR attention visualization To qualitatively
    assess the superiority of the MAFR module in the DG-ReID task, we randomly selected
    some test images from two target datasets and generated heatmaps, as shown in
    Fig. 7. These selected images cover almost all misalignment cases of pedestrians.
    By observing the heatmaps obtained by the MAFR module and the MataBIN method,
    it can be visually observed that the MAFR module can pay more attention to the
    pedestrian body and less to occlusion or background. This improvement is attributed
    to the fine-grained feature extraction (FGFE) branch, the refinement feature supplement
    (RFS) branch, and the feature fusion (FF) module in the MAFR module. This also
    demonstrates that our proposed MAM is more suitable for the DG-ReID task than
    MataBIN (Choi et al. 2020). 5 Future work In our future work, we have the goal
    of enhancing the performance of our model by incorporating additional regularization
    techniques. One approach that we propose is to generate realistic images from
    latent representation features. By using a reconstruction loss as a guide, the
    augmented feature vectors will aid in improving the disentanglement of specific
    identity factors and specific domain factors within the model. Moreover, these
    generated images can be utilized to augment the training set, thereby providing
    additional data for training. Furthermore, we will explore other methods to obtain
    better representation features. For instance, we plan to investigate the incorporation
    of techniques such as mutual information minimization (Belghazi et al. 2018) or
    f-divergence maximization (Nowozin et al. 2016) into the model training process.
    These methods have shown promise in learning more informative and discriminative
    representations, and we anticipate that their integration will contribute to further
    enhancing the performance of our model. By leveraging these additional regularization
    techniques and exploring novel approaches for feature representation, we aim to
    advance the capabilities and effectiveness of our model for person re-identification
    tasks. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a Multi-Source Adaptive Meta-Learning
    (MAM) framework for domain-generalizable person re-identification (DG-ReID). First,
    the MAM adopts the Multi-Source Adaptive Feature Refinement (MAFR) block, which
    adaptively captures domain-generalized features and domain-unique features. Specifically,
    MAFR consists of three key components: the fine-grained feature extraction (FGFE)
    branch, the refined feature supplementation (RFS) branch, and the feature fusion
    (FF) module. Through these blocks, MAFR is able to explore the interrelationships
    between different domains and extract features that are both generalized and unique.
    MAM leverages the principles of meta-learning during training to acquire more
    powerful generalization features. To achieve better learning, we proposed three
    novel loss functions including the clustering loss, the unknown domain identification
    loss, and the non-parametric identification loss. For better generalization capability,
    we further design a novel meta-feature sampling method to diversify features used
    in the meta-testing stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed framework and achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

    The cyber-agricultural system (CAS) integrates cybersystems with the physical
    world of agriculture via sensing, modeling, and actuation, and leverages the three
    pillars of functional cyber-physical systems (CPSs): computation, control, and
    communication: Advances in computation (i.e., ubiquitous, multimodal sensing,
    modeling/reasoning enabled by complex computation capabilities, and off-the-shelf
    deep learning models) have opened up numerous opportunities in CAS. Progress in
    control/actuation is characterized by advanced agricultural machinery and the
    rise of agricultural robotics (e.g., dexterous manipulation and harvesting, interactive
    sensing, precision spraying, mechanical operations, and weed culling). Advanced
    communication is enabling sensors, actuators, and platforms to coordinate and
    collaborate using internet of things (IoT) principles/tools. Abstract The cyber-agricultural
    system (CAS) represents an overarching framework of agriculture that leverages
    recent advances in ubiquitous sensing, artificial intelligence, smart actuators,
    and scalable cyberinfrastructure (CI) in both breeding and production agriculture.
    We discuss the recent progress and perspective of the three fundamental components
    of CAS – sensing, modeling, and actuation – and the emerging concept of agricultural
    digital twins (DTs). We also discuss how scalable CI is becoming a key enabler
    of smart agriculture. In this review we shed light on the significance of CAS
    in revolutionizing crop breeding and production by enhancing efficiency, productivity,
    sustainability, and resilience to changing climate. Finally, we identify underexplored

    systems Cyber-physical systems (CPSs; see Glossary) are natural or human-engineered
    systems that deeply integrate computation (cyber) and physical processes. In a
    CPS, the physical space is the source of information, and the cyberspace uses
    the generated information to make decisions which are then implemented back into
    the physical space [1]. In addition to memory, computation, and communication
    constraints, the information processing and control algorithms in the cyberspace
    also consider the aspects of physical constraints such as time, energy, and safety.
    A typical CPS comprises three modules, namely sensing, modeling, and actuation,
    that form a closed-loop system that leverages the three functional pillars – communication,
    computation, and control (Figure 1A, Key figure). Download : Download high-res

    of cyber-agricultural systems (CASs). (A) Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are engineered
    systems with deep integration between the physical and the cyberspace. The three
    technical modules of CPS – sensing, modeling, and actuation – leverage the three
    functional pillars – communication, computation, and control. (B) The future vision
    of CAS – an individualized plant management paradigm that senses and models up
    to basal individual plants and organs and applies treatments at the plant level
    rather than the field level by replacing heavy machinery with multiple small,
    lightweight units. (C) The CAS vision to transform conventional agriculture into
    a highly sustainable system by reducing the disadvantages of widespread chemical
    usage and significant capital input required by conventional large-scale farming,
    for example leading to chemical runoff and soil compaction. Advanced automation
    improves the abilities of farmers to manage their operations by reducing work
    stress, improving accuracy and precision, reducing physical strain, and minimizing
    safety concerns. In a CPS, the sensing devices ''sense'' or collect specific information
    from the physical system or environment that is being monitored and controlled.
    The sensed data are either processed in situ or transmitted through communication
    channels to the servers for storage, further processing, and analysis. Data analysis
    often involves cloud computing, which not only offers cost-effectiveness and flexibility
    but also demonstrates resource elasticity to allow dynamic allocation and scaling
    of computing resources based on demand. The sensing module is followed by the
    modeling module which utilizes decision-making algorithms such as machine learning
    (ML) models to extract actionable information from the data and construct computational
    models. These models enable reasoning and control of the underlying system, thus
    allowing predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and optimization. Finally, the
    control and actuation module regulates the CPS to achieve the desired performance
    safely and efficiently. Although a CPS can be a monolithic system such as an autonomous
    vehicle, it can also be a distributed system (e.g., an electric power grid) through
    which many subsystems are connected via a communication network [2,3]. In this
    age of Industry 4.0 [4], examples of real-world CPS applications can be found
    in every sector – from smart cities, smart power grids, autonomous vehicles, and
    intelligent transportation systems to advanced manufacturing and industrial control
    systems, and robotic systems. Exactly as in all these sectors, the CPS paradigm
    is poised to fundamentally change agriculture, making it significantly more efficient,
    profitable, sustainable, and safe. The objective of this review is to present
    the significance of CPS in plant agriculture. The vision of agricultural CPS or
    cyber-agricultural systems (CASs), as illustrated in Figure 1B, is already showing
    immense possibilities by leveraging the power of advanced sensing, artificial
    intelligence (AI), ML, computational modeling, robotics, wireless communication,
    and scalable cyberinfrastructure (CI). For example, in the case of US agriculture,
    CAS has the ability to alter the current paradigm of large farms (∼70% of US farmland
    is in holdings of >500 acres) that are characterized by large machinery and a
    large swath of chemical applications that have increased input costs [5,6]. Conventional
    big agricultural practices have helped to improve agricultural outputs but have
    also produced unintended negative consequences that affect farm economic health
    and environmental sustainability [7,8], especially when combating plant pathogens,
    weeds, and insects that reduce US crop yields. For example, US agriculture loses
    US$60.66 per acre due to soybean diseases [9], and global estimates suggest 21.4%
    yield loss [10]. Large farms counteract these stressors by large-scale and frequent
    application of chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [11].
    However, this increased chemical application directly affects run-off, which impacts
    on water quality across all watershed scales, including the oceans [12]. Large-scale
    chemical applications also deteriorate the quality of soil and impact on the food
    chain; overuse of chemicals results in chemical resistance with cascading negative
    consequences [13]. The vision of CAS can alleviate many of these challenges by
    achieving ultra-precision agriculture with integration of improved sustainability,
    profitability, and technology, as shown in Figure 1C. It is worth noting that
    the principles of CAS have been previously applied to crop improvement [14] and
    protection, encompassing sensing (e.g., phenotyping), modeling (e.g., breeding
    methodologies), and actuation (e.g., selection decisions and farm management).
    However, with advances in sensing, communication, data management, AI, and robotics
    technologies, this process has become more efficient and intelligent in recent
    times. Specifically, to address crop breeding problems, efficient sensing, monitoring,
    analysis, and characterization of plant traits, known as phenomics or plant phenotyping,
    is crucial. Several research questions pertaining to breeding and phenomics are
    illustrated in [15]. Although the notion of precision agriculture has been demonstrated
    and adopted in recent years to some extent, the framework of CAS can push the
    boundary further. It can enable an individualized plant management paradigm (enabled
    by individualized sensing, individualized modeling, and individualized actuation,
    as illustrated in Figure 1B) that applies treatments (i.e., actuation) at the
    plant level rather than the field level by replacing heavy machinery with multiple
    small, lightweight platforms [4]. We refer to this individualized CAS paradigm
    as ultra-precision agriculture because it offers greater flexibility of scale
    (i.e., scale-agnostic, equally effective for small and large fields), higher functionality
    (more effective management and outcomes), increased resilience (e.g., ability
    to adapt to changing climate), greater profitability (e.g., reduced costs of operations),
    enhanced autonomy, and reduced soil compaction by utilizing small and lightweight
    platforms. For example, the authors of [16] describe a CAS framework with a monitoring,
    managing, and adapting (MMA) approach. They also discuss how connectivity is ensured
    among the edge computing devices to perform cloud computing and dissemination
    of real-time or near real-time information in production agriculture. In summary,
    the concept of CAS lies at the intersection of precision agriculture, digital
    agriculture, and smart agriculture that can address various efficiency, sustainability,
    and resiliency issues faced by current agricultural practices. In the following
    sections we discuss the three fundamental components (sensing, modeling, and actuation)
    of CAS (Figure 2 for a conceptual illustration of these three components), followed
    by a brief discussion of agricultural digital twins (DTs), a recently emerging
    concept in the context of CAS. Finally, we provide a discussion on CI, a key enabler
    of the CAS paradigm. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    information processing This section delves into the realm of the sensing element
    within a CAS, and offers a comprehensive overview of different types of CAS sensors,
    their measurement capabilities, and advanced and recent information processing
    techniques employed for analyzing the sensed data. High-throughput phenotyping
    Among various CAS sensing applications, high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) or phenomics
    has recently emerged as one of the most useful frameworks [17]. HTP leverages
    both state-of-the-art technologies and analytics to provide a significantly faster
    and non-invasive alternative to conventional phenotyping methods. Moreover, HTP
    helps to explore the nexus between several forms of ''omics'' that together provide
    a holistic information of plants to better characterize plant health and performance.
    Hence, it is extremely useful for making many important crop breeding decisions
    [18,19]. HTP of plants use various remote sensing techniques to allow large-scale
    non-destructive measurement of plant traits [20]. In addition, for both crop breeding
    and production, by employing a diverse array of sensors, both proximal and remote,
    we can facilitate envirotyping and effectively measure and characterize physical
    and environmental variables. This enables us to model plant–environment relations
    and unlock the hidden genetic variations within the latent characteristics [21].
    In addition to remote sensing tools, plant phenotyping can be carried out using
    various proximal sensing platforms in which the sensors are not very far from
    the objects of interest and are installed on platforms such as handheld, fixed
    installations, robots, tractors, and drones [22,23]. These sensors are predominantly
    imaging devices (e.g., simple RGB or grayscale cameras, and thermal, multispectral,
    or hyperspectral cameras) [24]. By contrast, a variety of handheld sensors and
    in planta sensors are used to estimate phenotypes such as plant chlorophyll fluorescence,
    canopy temperature, leaf area, nitrogen content, and plant height. Instead of
    directly enabling HTP, these sensors essentially help to provide the ground-truth
    for validating the model-derived phenotypic estimates [23,25]. However, efforts
    are ongoing that help to provide a proxy measurement of these traits using digital
    technologies. In addition to sensors, CAS also leverages measurements in semi-
    or high-throughput manner. For example, plant morphological traits are phenotyped
    using automated screening systems [26., 27., 28., 29.]. CAS ideally comprises
    a collection of sensors or sensing units to enable organ- to plant- to canopy-level
    sensing and measurement. Although such applications provide rapid measurements
    with affordable solutions, they provide limited physiological information, involve
    complex data reconstruction and extraction methods, and are also limited to specific
    illumination requirements besides the effects of spatial heterogeneity (due to
    changing gradients of environmental factors). The HTP advances have also benefited
    root trait studies through phenotyping platforms as well as sensing and imaging
    technologies [30]. These complex datastreams (spatial and temporal) require ML-
    and computer vision (CV)-based advanced information processing methods that constitute
    a crucial part of the sensing components in CAS. Role of computer vision and machine
    learning With the rapid rise in deep learning (DL) applications [31], many trait-specific
    pipelines or architectures have been developed [32., 33., 34., 35., 36., 37.].
    There are numerous examples of the use of image-based phenotyping aided by computer
    vision and/or ML to study root traits [38., 39., 40., 41., 42., 43., 44., 45.,
    46., 47.], which aid mostly semi-automated analysis of root morphogeometric parameters,
    although end-to-end phenotyping pipelines have been developed [48,49]. Nodule
    features were studied and counted using a soybean nodule acquisition pipeline
    (SNAP) system that combines two convolutional neural network (CNN) models for
    nodule segmentation [50]. Similarly, published studies that leverage ML for phenotyping
    plant traits are rapidly accumulating. These include plant segmentation and image
    analysis to automate the temporal mapping of plant parameters [51], an image segmentation-oriented
    HTP system for temporal analysis of projected leaf area using distributed learning
    to train the CNN model [52], a leaf-tracking algorithm for motion estimation from
    time-lapse images to compared drought-tolerant and wild-type plants [53], compression
    of very deep CNN for easy in-field deployment that allows pixel-wise segmentation
    of plants into multiple classes [54], a 3D sensing-based stereo-imaging system
    to measure plant stem diameter [55], plant organ-level point cloud segmentation
    [56], and deep multiview image fusion for yield estimation and prediction [57],
    and prescriptive breeding [58,59]. Multimodal data assimilation In many CAS instances,
    sensing involves multiple modalities in which a variety of traits are measured
    and then leveraged to estimate the derived features. The incorporation of multiple
    modalities often adds complexity to the reasoning process, and requires updating
    the single-modality models with multimodal measurements to estimate the CAS state
    variables. Furthermore, these measurements could be performed at different scales
    of environmental conditions and plant physiology that very likely require dealing
    with degraded sensing environments. However, the fusion process needs to be task-driven
    because different cross-modal features could be more informative for different
    decision objectives [60,61]. Hence, robust ML approaches will be necessary for
    feature extraction and fusion of multiscale, multimodal data to update the models.
    The schematic of such a framework is compared to a single modality in Figure 2A.
    One of the earliest applications of sensor fusion in this area can be traced to
    [62] in which plant diseases were detected using a fusion of hyperspectral images
    by Kohonen maps. Several other works [63., 64., 65., 66.] primarily consider sensor
    fusion using IR thermography, chlorophyll fluorescence, hyperspectral imagery,
    light detection and ranging (LiDAR), among others, for several types of plant
    disease detection and vegetation monitoring. One of the earliest scalable multimodal
    open-source frameworks, namely the integrated analysis platform (IAP), handles
    different image sources and organizes phenotypic data by maintaining the metadata
    from the input in the result data [67]. On a smaller field scale, the field scanalyzeri
    gantry system is an advanced three-axis sensor-to-plant phenotyping system designed
    with a rail-based x axis, customizable widths for the y axis, and precise vertical
    movement capability in the z axis, enabling sub-centimeter precision during scheduled
    measurements. A multimodal sensor suite and data analysis pipeline for field phenotyping
    has also been implemented using unpiloted aircraft systems (UAS) [68., 69., 70.,
    71.]. GPhenoVision [72] is another notable multimodal system, comprising a high-clearance
    tractor and sensing and electrical systems, that substantially employs image-segmentation
    and point cloud reconstruction algorithms for deriving multiple phenotypic estimates.
    The modalities of its sensing system include a distributed structure that integrates
    environmental sensors, real-time GPS, and multi-imaging sensors such as RGB-D,
    thermal, and hyperspectral cameras. Similarly, NU-Spidercam [73] was also proposed
    as a large-scale and automated sensing/robotics system that integrates various
    sensor modules for field phenotyping. This system enabled the extraction of time-series
    canopy temperature and spectral induced fluorescence (SIF) traits. Thus, fundamentally,
    CAS is a leap towards realizing large-scale, ultra-precision agriculture and smart
    agriculture that intricately rely on sensing and advanced information processing.
    Modeling and reasoning Upon gathering heterogeneous information from multiple
    CAS sensing units, computational modeling and reasoning frameworks are necessary
    to make optimized farm management or crop breeding decisions. This section highlights
    some of the key aspects of CAS modeling and reasoning strategies. Computational
    modeling of crop systems Crop modeling is a mature field of research that has
    produced several biophysical process-based models for various types of decision
    making. An incomplete list of well-used models includes APSIM [74], DSSAT [75],
    and MLCan [76]. However, in the context of CAS, computational modeling frameworks
    ideally need to include both data-driven and process-based models for reliable
    biophysical characterization of the plants, trait prediction (for instance, yield,
    phenology, stress response), and decision support – in both short(er)-term (production
    application) and longer-term (prescriptive breeding) applications. Although process-based
    models are useful, they suffer from crucial deficiencies necessitating this complementary
    (data + process) strategy for CAS applications. Key deficiencies include (i) incomplete
    knowledge of all the mechanisms impacting the quality of the modeled states, (ii)
    incorporation of latent variables that are often difficult to directly measure
    or are only empirically estimated, making transferability and personalization
    of process models very challenging, (iii) numerical and representational ''brittleness''
    due to mismatch between the length- and time-scales of parameters input to the
    submodels, their calibration with averaged properties, and their subjectivity.
    These deficiencies reduce the utility of any ensuing management decision and limit
    any decision necessarily to a coarse scale. On the other hand, data-driven approaches
    have begun to show promise in various crop modeling applications. For example,
    early works in this field relied on utilizing a single data modality for crop
    yield prediction [77., 78., 79., 80.], disease identification [81], and irrigation
    optimization [82,83]. Even natural language processing and network theory have
    been proposed to compute phenotypic descriptions for novel candidate gene prediction
    [84]. However, with the advent of internet of things (IoT) devices in data collection
    from multiple modalities, decision making has distanced itself from previous single-mode
    ML approaches. For example, the authors of [85] have shown that publicly available
    weather and soil data can be relatively effective in county-level corn yield prediction
    for the US Midwestern region. Similarly, DL models have been developed to integrate
    genotype and environmental variables for crop yield prediction [86., 87., 88.].
    Whereas traditional DL models tend to be ''black box'' (i.e., models without clear
    understanding of the inner workings) in nature, explainable DL models have been
    shown to uncover useful insights about important predictors in yield prediction
    problems [89]. However, purely data-driven models often fail miserably to provide
    meaningful outcomes even slightly outside their training data support. Carefully
    incorporating biophysical knowledge may alleviate such issues while also potentially
    reducing the need for extremely large amounts of data for training. Therefore,
    several ML-based studies have begun to work towards assimilating data from high-throughput
    imaging/sensing platforms to rapidly, precisely, and accurately model plant traits
    at different growth stages, and integrate these data with (incomplete) knowledge
    models to create flexible, hybrid AI representations. For example, a knowledge-guided
    ML model for rice growth simulation has been proposed recently [90]. Similarly,
    coupling of ML and crop modeling was shown to improve crop yield prediction in
    the US Corn Belt [91]. Thus, the availability of hybrid data–biophysics models
    has the potential to transform plot-, field-, and region-level models from ad
    hoc calibration to a more principled CPS approach [92,93]. However, this remains
    a nascent area of research and there is no consensus yet in the community regarding
    the most effective ways to integrate knowledge and ML for modeling crop growth
    and production. Reasoning frameworks for crop management With a computational
    model in place that can simulate crop growth and production under various environmental
    conditions, as well as management inputs, reasoning and decision-making tools
    can leverage that model to generate optimized crop management prescriptions, as
    shown in Figure 2B. There have been several attempts to build such decision-making
    frameworks in the context of CAS. Among various techniques, reinforcement learning
    (RL)-based frameworks for planning and supervisory decision making have emerged
    as a popular choice [94], primarily driven by the popularity of advanced deep
    RL tools in various application sectors. Examples include control crop irrigation
    [95., 96., 97.] and crop yield prediction [98]. The objective of an RL agent is
    to learn a policy for dictating a sequence of optimal actions that maximize the
    cumulative rewards over a particular time horizon [99]. The application of RL
    (specifically deep RL) in CAS is an active research area, especially for engineering
    a proper representation of the environment states, actions, and rewards. Ideally,
    an RL agent should directly interact with the real physical system to arrive at
    an optimal policy, but it typically has a very large sample complexity – it needs
    many iterations of interactions with the underlying system to obtain an optimal
    policy. On top of that, during such a training process, utterly suboptimal actions
    can be taken by the RL agent that may be completely unacceptable for an actual
    crop farm. Therefore, a standard practice is to build reliable simulated environments
    (that can leverage the computational models, as described before) to train RL
    policies, followed by fine-tuning the policies to effectively transfer them from
    simulation to real (Sim2Real) environments. In the RL literature, these simulation
    platforms are referred to as gym environments, and these have also started emerging
    for CAS. For example, CropGym was proposed as a RL environment for crop management
    [95]. Actuation and in-field Intelligence In the CAS setting for crop production,
    actuation refers to the use of mechanical and electrical systems to control and
    automate various processes in farming to optimize agricultural goals [100]. In
    plant breeding and crop improvement, actuation refers to decision making following
    sensing and modeling to decide the outcome of tested varieties – whether it will
    be culled or retained for further testing or release to farmers. Advanced robotic
    actuation in CAS Agricultural robots can be divided into a few categories based
    on their characteristics. According to their working environment, agricultural
    robots are divided into indoor and outdoor robots [101]. Indoor robots are mainly
    utilized in greenhouses and indoor settings, such as for indoor harvesting, flower
    cutting, fruit and vegetable grasping, and greenhouse automation control systems
    [102., 103., 104.]. Outdoor robots such as spraying robots, weeding robots, nursery
    robots, tractors, and fruit-harvesting robots [69,105., 106., 107., 108., 109.],
    on the other hand, are used in large-scale farmland, pasture, and other outdoor
    environments. These include both aerial robots, such as unpiloted aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), and ground robots, such as unpiloted ground vehicles (UGVs), based on
    their operational domain. In addition, they also can be classified into robots
    for seeding, planting, harvesting, weeding, and pesticide application [102,110.,
    111., 112.]. Regarding agricultural management approaches, actuators can be categorized
    into soil management robots, field mapping robots, irrigation management robots,
    harvesting management robots, and weather tracking and forecasting platforms [100,113.,
    114., 115.]. Moreover, from the mechanical point of view, agricultural robots
    have an actuation system as the key component which, depending on their specific
    use, can be one or a combination of electric, piezoelectric, hydraulic, and pneumatic
    systems [116., 117., 118., 119., 120.]. The CAS vision is to have teams of semi-
    or fully autonomous mobile robots that can provide avant-garde actuation options
    to farmers that improve the production efficiency and quality of agricultural
    products [121., 122., 123.]. Such teams can scale from a small group of robots
    or UAVs to a large swarm depending on the scale of operation, the size and capability
    of the platforms, and cost. Technical and digital advances in crop production,
    sensing, and phenotyping include an interest in automating in-field actions using
    robots and drones (e.g., the ''see and spray'' technology) [124]. To execute diverse
    in-field actions, the robot/UAV teams can be composed of homogeneous (i.e., similar
    capability, performing similar tasks) and heterogeneous (i.e., different capability,
    performing different tasks) platforms. To enable autonomous fleets of robots in
    agriculture with minimal human intervention, it is imperative to build scalable
    electrified agricultural systems and use energy optimally. The authors of [125]
    perform a cost analysis considering battery charge and health behavior for autonomous
    electric field tractors. The works presented in [126., 127., 128.] also offer
    valuable insights into power management, life maximization, and battery balancing
    strategies related to agricultural applications. However, further research in
    this area will be necessary to realize the potential of electrification in promoting
    sustainable agriculture, including power optimization in scalable and connected
    electric-powered agriculture. For instance, although teams of mobile robots equipped
    with plant manipulation systems could help to alleviate the acute labor shortage
    in agriculture [129], it is also crucial to consider optimizing the power management
    of this robot network for sustained, autonomous operation. In-field intelligence
    ML has greatly enhanced the capabilities of agriculture robots of all categories,
    particularly those designed for sensing and actuation. These intelligent robots
    range from small robots in greenhouses to UAVs and tractors in the outside field,
    which are equipped with ML algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data collected
    by sensors/cameras to identify agricultural data patterns and make decisions.
    For instance, UAVs equipped with high-resolution cameras and sensors can be used
    to monitor crop health and growth patterns, and identify any potential issues
    such as pests, diseases, or irrigation problems [22,130., 131., 132.]. Recently,
    the use of ML algorithms with multiple connected drones in agriculture has enhanced
    field mapping, thus providing a more comprehensive view of the farmland, which
    leads to improving the land management practices [133,134]. Similarly, automatic
    navigation of tractors using machine vision algorithms (e.g., object detection,
    segmentation) enhances accuracy by mapping the crop lines and navigation routes
    in real time to improve efficiency in agriculture operations [135., 136., 137.].
    A key challenge in enabling envisaged CPS for large-scale row-crops is long-duration
    reliable autonomy in harsh and changing field environments at low cost. One way
    to achieve this is to use intelligent software that makes the most out of cheaper
    sensors. For example, low-cost LiDARs with inertial sensors and encoders could
    enable robust row-following [138,139], and vision sensors can be used to replace
    LiDAR sensors which are comparatively more expensive [140]. However, it is relatively
    challenging to reduce the cost and effort required for programming robot tasks
    while still reaching high accuracy in the perception process to avoid wrong actions
    in the field. In addition, an active area of work includes automatic detection
    of traversable regions through improved robot mission programming [141., 142.,
    143., 144., 145.]. Such intelligent coordination of agricultural robot teams enables
    mechanical tasks such as weed removal using planning algorithms [146., 147., 148.],
    speeding of route schedules on the aisles for complex tasks such as harvesting
    in vineyards and pruning trees in orchards [105], and dexterity for tasks such
    as harvesting and grasping. These tasks require actuation components such as drive
    systems, controllers, robotic arms, end-effectors, and environmental perception
    components such as radar and cameras with DL-based detection algorithms [149.,
    150., 151., 152., 153.]. Figure 2C showcases that agricultural robots need to
    be dexterous (to achieve human level performance) but must be able to scale up
    to millions of acres of farming. This means that plant manipulation needs to be
    robust, reliable, and fast. This is, of course, highly challenging owing to clutter,
    occlusion, and the soft nature of fruits and other plant organs. Adding to this
    is the challenge that the robots must be cost-effective, precluding the use of
    expensive industrial rigid arms and expensive sensors. There is considerable promise
    in soft-robots [154], but the underlying control and sensing challenges require
    further work. Digital twins Building on the three technical modules of a CAS,
    as described above, the concept of agricultural DT has recently started to emerge.
    The notion of a DT brings together the sensing, modeling, control, and actuation
    aspects of the CPS under a single conceptual umbrella. DTs have found extensive
    utility in engineered systems [155,156] as well as in logistics and supply chains
    [157]. Plant sciences and agriculture are ripe for the development and deployment
    of DTs across the spectrum of applications from basic research [158] to breeding
    [159] to precision agriculture [160,161] to policy [162]. The basic idea of a
    DT in agriculture is a data and software framework that serves as a digital replica
    of the agricultural physical system [163]. That is, the DT mirrors the behavior
    of the physical object over its lifetime. This includes mimicking the physiological
    state, growth, and development of a plant (in case of a plant DT), or of a field
    (in case of a field DT), as illustrated in Figure 3A. Building the DT starts with
    identifying the states that are most important, the measurements that are being
    made, and the management decisions (formally, control inputs). We note that the
    definition of DTs (i.e., their digital states) will be highly context-specific,
    and depend on the key properties of interest and the associated rewards. Download

    (D) Conceptual illustration of a CAS with a team of robots working together to
    maximize productivity and profitability by using fundamentally more sustainable
    actuation options, including see-and-spray, mechanical weeding, and cover-crop
    planting. Reliable data travel and networking solutions are a key enabler of such
    a vision. As discussed earlier, crop models play a crucial role in understanding
    plant physiology, growth, development, and management. However, it is useful to
    distinguish between such agricultural simulators (or crop models) and a DT [158].
    A primary difference is that a DT must – by definition – be able to update its
    digital state continuously (or periodically) using measurements made on its physical
    counterpart. This includes both physical state measurements (phenotyping, physiological
    measurements, etc.) as well as environmental measurements (soil, weather, and
    management) that impact on its state. In addition, the DT (in its various formulations)
    provides a principled approach to account for known dynamics (as encoded in a
    crop model) with unknown dynamics (as encoded in physical measurements). This
    is especially important in biological DT because no complete first-principle models
    exist (unlike engineered systems where models can completely describe behavior
    with no tunable parameters). Finally, a desirable property of a DT is its ability
    to be transferable to different scenarios. This is particularly useful to evaluate
    various what-if scenarios to identify the best control action. Another exciting
    technological option for CAS and DT is augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
    (VR) which were earlier proposed for precision farming [164]. AR and VR can play
    an important role in sensing, reasoning, and future actuation applications via
    remote robotic manipulation. Utilization of AR and VR allows researchers and (in
    future) farmers to conduct various experiments and operations (e.g., remote scouting,
    as illustrated in Figure 3B) with significantly less effort. For example, through
    VR simulations, researchers can gain insights into how robots navigate, interact
    with crops, and execute specific tasks, thus facilitating the identification of
    potential improvements and optimizations in their behavior. Furthermore, virtual
    experiment runs using VR allow researchers to collect valuable data on robot performance,
    thereby enabling them to refine algorithms, adjust parameters, and enhance the
    overall efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural robots before deploying them
    in real-world scenarios. DT concepts have recently been used in a variety of contexts
    in agriculture. They have been used across species, with applications to row crops,
    orchards, viticulture, gardens, and horticulture. DTs can also be defined, constructed,
    and deployed at different length scales, and recent studies have been performed
    at the organ, plant, field, and farm/greenhouse scales [165., 166., 167.]. Finally,
    DTs can be deployed for a variety of end-goals ranging from monitoring and real-time
    diagnosis to maximizing yield and/or profitability [161,168., 169., 170.], breeding
    decision support, and autonomous field operations. The next goal for research
    in DT would be to successfully create an ''intelligent digital twin'' (IDT) [168],
    which means a DT that can self-learn and decide what is best for the farm. ML
    methods can be used for adding intelligence to DT, as discussed in [168]. A few
    more studies have explored IDT, mostly utilizing generative models as the basis
    of DTs [171,172]. These intelligent twins can self-learn with different levels
    of data integration. Therefore, the integration of ML and large-scale sensing
    with autonomous systems provides significant opportunities to build DT for CASs.
    Cyberinfrastructure Although sensing, modeling, and actuation are the technical
    pillars of a CPS, scalable and robust CI is a key enabler of such a framework.
    In this section we discuss some of the major components of CAS CI. Data management
    Data management in a CI framework substantially differs from traditional data
    representations that are not suitable for large-scale, real-time analysis, visualization,
    and information dissemination for complex dynamic phenomena. By contrast, CAS
    platforms need to offer access to suitable software and hardware that can handle
    various data types and scale computations. This entails having access to a shared
    data storage system that can efficiently and securely transfer large datasets,
    connections to the proper computational hardware such as high-memory computers
    and virtual machines for analysis, the ability to label and retrieve data using
    descriptive metadata, and identity management systems for secure data sharing
    with reliable entities [173]. Hence, with rapid development of sensor networks,
    IoT systems, hardware-accelerated graphic cards, and computer vision, CI data
    are distributed in cyberspace [174]. These sensor observation data are multivariate,
    space/time-sensitive, and are found in different types, formats, dimensions, sources,
    and structures [175]. In distributed CAS, different observation sites or nodes
    sense/observe different sets of variables, mostly collected at different frequencies,
    resulting in streaming of heterogeneous data. Such data require complex data structures
    for storing, representation, and management techniques involving cloud computing
    infrastructure. In CAS, the IoT is a vital component because it involves the deployment
    of IoT devices such as Raspberry Pi cameras, irrigation sensors, and geographic
    information systems (GISs) in farms to gather data from the fields. These data
    are then transmitted to the server (computer unit) for further processing and
    analysis. With a distributed framework, these sensing units hierarchically operate
    at the edge, fog computing, and cloud layers. The data feed is ideally scheduled
    such that historical field data serve as input iteratively for informed and improved
    decision making. In addition, there is the option of smart warehousing, which
    makes use of these data to improve post-harvest storage and enable big data-enabled
    warehousing. This assists farmers in making decisions about how much produce to
    store and sell [176]. Some instances of data management systems and CI-enabled
    consortiums are iRODS [177], IBPii, NEVPiii, and SERNECiv [173,178,179] that assist
    with data analysis and sharing. Computing Li et al. [174] highlight the difficulties
    involved in managing multivariate data collected across modalities from a distributed
    sensor network, which is commonly observed in CAS. The study suggests that, to
    address those challenges and improve online interactive visual analysis, conventional
    data integration methods must be revamped to support more efficient, scalable,
    and collaborative visual analysis. Hence, multimodal data fusion that has already
    proved to be very efficient in improving accuracy and robustness by combining
    learning over multiple modalities is integral to computing in a CI [180,181].
    For computational efficiency, it is imperative to learn from a compressed representative
    set of the overall sensor data that can also be converted to human-interpretable
    actionable insights. These computations are generally scheduled and performed
    in a central computing unit or in distributed units that are connected to the
    cloud [182,183]. These computations make decisions based on area-specific knowledge
    as well as business intelligence. As a result, CAS can also function as a decision
    support system (DSS) for users (e.g., farmers). The decisions made can be sent
    to the end-users through WiFi-enabled smartphones or computers that act as an
    interface to enable the user to control all the activities taking place in the
    field from their computer or smartphone; it therefore enables a service platform
    for the end-user [176]. Edge, fog, and cloud computing Despite the advantages
    of IoT, it is challenging to transmit a large amount of sensory data from agricultural
    fields to the back-end servers, whether they are in the cloud or in data centers.
    Such communication requires significant energy, causes delays in communication,
    and generates substantial network traffic. For example, reliable communication
    between coordinated robots in an intelligent system is crucial; however, low-range
    (LoRa) high-bandwidth wireless connectivity (in the 2.5–5 GHz range) and larger
    power-demand make it challenging. Figure 3D depicts an example CPS where multiple
    robots work together through reliable communication to enable fundamentally more
    sustainable actuation for agriculture. There are multiple technology options for
    communication, such as 5G and MIoTy [184]. However, in many rural areas, broadband
    technologies such as 5G may not be available. LoRA communication and other low-bandwidth
    options could help, but significant edge computing is required so that only essential
    messages need to be exchanged [185]. Another challenge here is in creating reliable
    predictive models and keeping their prediction on track using feedback-like mechanisms
    [186]. Edge computing refers to the process of locally storing and processing
    data near end devices or users [187,188]. This reduces the energy consumption
    and communication delay required to transmit the collected data. Recent advances
    in compression/decompression methods using ML models have further helped to decrease
    the data size at edge/local devices [189., 190., 191., 192.]. However, edge devices
    (e.g., sensors) have limited resources and cannot efficiently execute DL. To address
    this, a recent approach has been proposed that utilizes efficient online computation
    offloading through deep RL for extensive mobile edge computing [193]. To address
    the computing limitation of edge devices, an edge–fog architecture is introduced
    to process IoT data in an efficient way while avoiding the communication delay
    that occurs in cloud computing [194]. As argued in [195], the three layers (edge,
    fog, and cloud) architecture in smart agriculture, as shown in Figure 3C, would
    reduce energy consumption, network traffic, and communication delay. Moreover,
    a state-of-the-art survey on fog computing for IoT was proposed in [196]. Fog
    devices (e.g., laptops or low- end computing machines) are usually equipped with
    more resources than edge devices, and are mostly located at closer communication
    distance than the cloud. DL with light configuration (few layers and neurons)
    may be executed efficiently in the fog. Specifically, energy-aware fog-based frameworks
    were recently studied for mobile crowdsensing, where farmers use smartphones to
    supply high-quality information [197,198]. However, edge computing is not a replacement
    for the cloud, and thus the cloud services are still preferable for performing
    heavy computational tasks in IoT-based farming; for instance, big data analysis
    and execution of resource-intensive DL models (e.g., ResNet [199]) for real-time
    crop monitoring. Data travel and networking The objective of any CPS is to connect
    embedded systems with the help of worldwide networks and to enable communication
    as well as back-coupling between the digital and the physical worlds [200]. Ideally,
    a CPS comprises several interconnected layers that facilitate secure data travel
    (between the end users and the cloud) from the physical layer to the IoT layer.
    The data captured in the IoT layer is moved to the cyber layer, which is enabled
    with a DT that allows the experts to study system behavior virtually and observe
    the analytical outcomes by iteratively predicting, modeling, analyzing, and actuating
    on the cyber platform [201]. The cyber layer connects the edge tier to the data
    analytics platform tier, followed by the enterprise layer that accounts for business
    intelligence and decision making. Finally, the cloud tier stores and handles the
    big data and connects to the application tier forming the service platform for
    the farmers/stakeholders [176]. However, this data travel requires a cybersecurity
    strategy to guarantee that sensitive information is only accessed by authenticated
    entities [202,203]. In addition, meeting the time requirements for such data transfer
    between and within the layers is extremely crucial [200]. Hence, the identification
    and tracking technologies, and the networking and communication technologies,
    play a key role in making the whole integration functional. The most common identification
    and tracking technologies include radio-frequency identification devices (RFIDs)
    and intelligent sensors [204]. For interconnecting the sensors and actuators,
    the prevalent wireless network protocols used in CPS typically include Bluetooth,
    WirelessHART, ZigBee, and WiFi [203]. With a goal to provide internet access to
    rural areas, existing solutions utilize either short-range technologies (e.g.,
    WiFi, and Bluetooth) or long-range solutions (e.g., 3G/4G/5G, WiMax, LTE/LTE-A)
    or a combination thereof. The long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) has recently
    been suggested as a solution to meet the needs of providing connectivity in agricultural
    environments owing to its scalable network architecture and straightforward access
    method, thus enabling long-range communication with low energy consumption [205].
    Although LoRaWAN provides promising applications in the agricultural domain, it’s
    very limited data rates prohibit the adoption of many broadband solutions in a
    rural context. As an example, transferring large hyperspectral images collected
    by a drone would be infeasible with a low data rate technology such as LoRaWAN
    [206,207]. Concluding remarks and future perspectives Bringing CPS concepts to
    agriculture, both for crop breeding and production, has enormous potential to
    enhance productivity, profitability, and resiliency while lowering the environmental
    footprint. This review article presents the current state of CAS development as
    well as the trends of innovation that will determine the near and distant future
    of CAS. CAS tools are at various levels of technology readiness and market adoption.
    Given the enormous uncertainties stemming from many confounding factors such as
    disruptive innovations (e.g., generative AI), manufacturing and supply chain issues,
    market economy, labor market situation, and environmental regulations, it is difficult
    to forecast precise future trends and timelines. However, we provide a broad discussion
    here based on our views and understanding (also see Outstanding questions). We
    summarize the main takeaways from the paper in Box 1 and suggest some best practices
    for future research in Box 2. Box 1 Key take-away points for practitioners CAS
    tools are at various levels of technology readiness. For example, many high- throughput
    phenotyping tools are available and deployable today; AI-driven farm management
    decision support tools will also be starting to roll out soon. However, fully
    autonomous robots running a farm may not become a reality immediately. Designing
    a specific CAS framework, such as an appropriate choice of platform – drones,
    ground robots, traditional machinery, or static sensors – depends on the objective
    (e.g., stress identification and mitigation, or yield estimation), scale of application,
    cost, and resource availability. A scalable cyberinfrastructure solution that
    is the backbone of a CAS should range from edge to fog to cloud computing. Advanced
    wireless communication technology is another key enabler of a CAS, and improving
    rural connectivity will act as a catalyst for accelerated development and deployment
    of CAS technologies in farms. Remark: despite excellent progress in the area of
    CAS research over the past few years, significant effort will still be required
    for a transition of many of these tools into practice. Although some CAS tools
    will be more readily adopted by the farming and research community, other aspects
    will need a more drastic overhaul of the system, and hence may take longer for
    market penetration. Different parts of the world may also see different trajectories
    for adoption, depending on various factors such as economic status, labor market
    situation, and environmental regulations. Therefore, it is imperative for CAS
    researchers to continuously consider any adoption issues alongside the challenges
    and advances of science, engineering, and technology. Box 2 Best practices for
    using CAS tools Multimodal, multiscale (spatial and spectral) data collection
    is crucial for greater effectiveness of CAS tools. Hybrid modeling approaches
    that can seamlessly combine process models and data-driven models are more robust
    for in-field applications. A scale-agnostic approach to actuation using collaborative
    teams of (autonomous) heterogeneous platforms will be a more sustainable solution
    for future agriculture with a low entry barrier. Leveraging advanced data warehousing
    and machine learning operations (MLOps) to manage data and generate insights is
    an important design choice that streamlines the development, deployment, and maintenance
    of CAS tools. In the context of CAS sensing tools, many high-throughput phenotyping
    tools are available and deployable today. Although the commercially available
    tools primarily enable extraction of relatively simpler traits (e.g., plant height,
    canopy volume, detection and counting of fruits, and estimation of yield), capabilities
    to extract more complex traits (e.g., identification, classification, and quantification
    of biotic and abiotic stresses, pests) will also be starting to roll out soon.
    Research and development in this area can specifically benefit from data sharing
    and open innovations. Although the CAS community has made many datasets publicly
    available as benchmarks, data sharing needs to be further incentivized to trigger
    widespread open innovation. Widely collected citizen science data can also be
    extremely useful in this regard [208]. Data annotation (especially by experts)
    is still a major bottleneck to train ML models in this regard. However, the rise
    of foundation models in ML is helping to address this issue at least partially
    [209]. AI-driven farm management decision support tools are next in line to be
    deployed commercially. Within the next 5–10 years, breeders and producers should
    have many technology options to turn their data into decisions using CAS modeling
    and reasoning tools for making optimal choices in choosing seeds, deciding planting
    dates, farm management (e.g., irrigation, applying fertilizers and pesticides)
    and scheduling harvest. In many cases, these products may be available as ''software
    as service'', thus lowering the barrier to adoption by the farming community.
    However, the cost of sensing infrastructure and data privacy are common bottlenecks
    in this regard. Although ''economy of scale'' can alleviate the cost issue in
    future, the research community and the AgTech industry need to engage with the
    farming community extensively to raise awareness about CAS capabilities for technology
    adoption. In terms of actuation, design modification and retrofitting of large
    equipment (e.g., autonomous tractors) for increased levels of automation have
    already been commercialized. However, the vision of fleets of autonomous robots
    and drones running a farm with little human supervision may not become a reality
    immediately. Although there have been several successful proof-of-concept demonstrations
    of autonomous field robots performing several tasks such as planting, chemical
    spraying, and harvesting, fine manipulation and individual plant-level actuation
    remain challenging. In addition, the technology needs to be hardened further to
    handle the harsh agricultural environment. Apart from the technical issues, various
    social (e.g., uncertainty about the future of work and employment), legal (e.g.,
    regulation, liability, certification), and economic (e.g., manufacturing cost)
    issues also remain in this regard. However, these problems can be very different
    in different parts of the world depending on the scale of farming, the type of
    crops, climate, communication infrastructure, economy, and cost of labor. Finally,
    deployment of CPS tools at scale relies heavily on communication and computation
    infrastructure. However, high-quality broadband connectivity may still not be
    available in many rural areas, and this poses a significant challenge in deploying
    advanced CAS solutions in rural agriculture. Hence, the CAS research community
    has been focusing on developing edge computing solutions to reduce the need for
    extensive communication. With recent advances in both hardware and software for
    edge computing, hybrid edge–cloud solutions are becoming increasingly feasible
    and cost-effective for deploying CAS solutions. Outstanding questions How can
    we ensure a high degree of reliability of a CAS ''in the wild'' that would guarantee
    performance under environmental uncertainties, system faults, and natural edge
    cases? How can we build and maintain reliable 4D (3D + time) in-field (as opposed
    to controlled environment) DT models from plant to plot to field scale? How can
    we achieve the ''economy of scale'' for advanced CAS sensing and actuation solutions
    (i.e., to enable widespread adoption and reduce costs as well as barriers to entry)?
    How can we build fully autonomous (i.e., level 5 autonomy which does not require
    human attention) platforms for CAS operations? Acknowledgments This work was supported

    review on IoT-aware business process modeling views, requirements and notations
    Article 28 October 2022 1 Introduction In the last decade, the possibility to
    manufacture micro-controllers and CPUs of small physical dimensions at reduced
    cost has made it feasible to embed these devices alongside various everyday physical
    objects at a massive scale – e.g. home appliances and industrial equipment, just
    (to name a few). Combining this increased computing capacity with sensors, actuators,
    and communication modules allows such objects to interface with the physical world
    and operate autonomously, thus becoming smart objects. In this context, Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) broadly refers to the network of connected smart objects able to collect
    and exchange data over the Internet, thus providing advanced functionalities such
    as real-time monitoring, data sharing, and remote control (Kopetz and Steiner
    2022). Typical early adopters of smart objects and IoT can be found in industrial
    manufacturing, logistics and healthcare domains. For these areas, the tools and
    practices of Business Process Management (BPM) play a relevant role (Leotta et
    al. 2019). BPM is a research area concerned with the identification, modeling,
    analysis, redesign, implementation, monitoring and mining of business processes
    (BPs) (Dumas et al. 2018). A BP is a collection of related, structured activities,
    events and decisions that accomplish a specific organizational goal. According
    to the BPM approach, BPs are formalized through explicit BP models expressed with
    a suitable graphical notation, such as the standard BPMN. 1 A specific type of
    information system, called Process Management System (PMS), is employed to support
    the execution and monitoring of BPs and analyze historical traces of BP execution
    (Weske 2019). IoT’s presence in BPM activities continuously increasing since IoT
    data allows for finer-grained automated monitoring, analysis, and control during
    BP execution. Consequently, organizations’ BPs must be aligned to take advantage
    of IoT capabilities. This has resulted in the rise of relevant studies focused
    on IoT-aware BPM (Cheng et al. 2018, 2019; Grefen et al. 2019). The Industry 4.0
    revolution was one of the significant accelerators for integrating IoT and BPM.
    In addition to the increased usage of smart objects, Industry 4.0 prescribes a
    factor of high degree of individual customizability for manufactured products,
    an aspect that IoT-aware BPM can effectively capture (Grefen et al. 2018). In
    this direction, Janiesch et al. in their manifesto about “The Internet of Things
    Meets Business Process Management” (IoT-Meets-BPM Manifesto for short in the following)
    identified many open challenges to address in order to achieve a more comprehensive
    and targeted integration of the main concepts of the two areas (Janiesch et al.
    2020). This study aims to gain profound insights into the nature and maturity
    of existing approaches to IoT-aware BPM. In particular, we present results from
    a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conducted to systematically evaluate the
    literature on IoT-aware BPM concerning the phases of the BP life cycle covered
    by the different approaches, the specific topics addressed, the application domains
    involved, and the possibility to tackle the research challenges identified by
    Janiesch et al. (2020). Our SLR, which follows the scientific and reproducible
    approach proposed by Keele (2007), consists of 3 phases: (1) the planning phase
    identifies the needs of the SLR, defines the research questions and develops a
    protocol for the review; (2) the conducting phase selects the studies, extracts
    and synthesizes relevant data; (3) the reporting phase analyzes the collected
    data and presents the results based on the prior research analysis. With the support
    of the SLR, we identify 93 primary studies that are thoroughly analyzed. Based
    on this evaluation, we examine (i) which phases of the BPM life cycle were investigated
    by each study, (ii) which specific topics relating to IoT integration in BPM were
    primarily discussed by each study, and (iii) which are the main application domains
    addressed so far. Based on this analysis, we compare the studies according to
    which of the research challenges identified in the IoT-Meets-BPM Manifesto (Janiesch
    et al. 2020) are addressed. It emerges that the field of IoT-aware BPM is still
    in the development stage. Therefore, we consider our analysis beneficial for researchers
    and practitioners addressing such a novel and interesting field. The paper is
    structured as follows. Section 2 shows the methodology we applied, including the
    research questions and the search protocol we adopted. In contrast, Sect. 3 describes
    the application of the protocol, and Sect. 4 gives an overview of the results
    achieved. Finally, to conclude our paper, Sect. 5 comprises a discussion of our
    results, including a presentation of the validity of the SLR, and Sect. 6 provides
    some concluding remarks. 2 Planning the Systematic Literature Review In this section,
    we describe the planning phase of the SLR. Planning includes the following activities:
    1. Related work analysis to motivate the need of the SLR; 2. Formulation of research
    questions to narrow the search; 3. Definition of the search strings; 4. Selection
    of data sources; 5. Definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria. 2.1 Related
    Work The increased research community’s interest in the interplay between IoT
    and BPM has led to the publication of relevant literature reviews and surveys
    on the topic. In Del Giudice (2016), a literature review is conducted to analyze
    the impact and the role of IoT in fostering innovation within organizations, and
    which implications this phenomenon may have on BPM and the competitiveness of
    firms. In Chang et al. (2016), the authors analyze existing PMSs for IoT and identify
    the limitations and their drawbacks based on a mobile cloud computing perspective.
    In Stoiber and Schönig (2021), a survey on event-driven BPM is conducted focusing
    on its capabilities to enable the scale-up of IoT applications. Research on incorporating
    IoT into BPM has shown that the majority of SLRs focus on the IoT-aware BP modeling
    phase. In Torres et al. (2020), a SLR is performed to collect and describe ways
    to model IoT-aware BPs. Compagnucci et al. (2023, 2020) for example, investigated
    modeling views related to different types of IoT-aware BPs and the IoT requirements
    supported by the various modeling notations. Abouzid et al. (2022) conducted a
    SLR on BPMN extensions for IoT domains and their integration in supply chain BPs.
    Compared to the other papers, this SLR not only addressed the modeling of IoT-aware
    processes, but also the other phases of BPM lifecycle. Finally, the work Fattouch
    et al. (2020) presents a survey of different approaches that integrate IoT technologies
    within BPs. The authors provide a brief overview of each approach and compare
    them based on specific criteria by identifying some open challenges. This survey
    shares our objective and an intersection of 8 out of 93 primary studies, but it
    was conducted in a non-systematic way, thus not permitting the results’ replicability.
    Therefore another contribution of our approach is that it includes this replicability.
    Whereas the above studies focus on analyzing specific aspects of the integration
    of IoT and BPM, in this SLR we provide a holistic view of such an integration
    by exploring its impact on the different BP life cycle phases and BPM-related
    application domains. As opposed to our approach, none of the works employ a generative
    statistical model to discover the most discussed topics in the collection of studies
    and automatically classify individual studies based on their relevance to these
    topics essential for achieving the integration of IoT and BPM. Moreover, we discuss
    which challenges of the ones identified by the IoT-Meets-BPM Manifesto (Janiesch
    et al. 2020) have been (to date) adequately addressed or are still far from being
    tackled. 2.2 The Research Questions Our main goal is to assess the current state
    of research on the IoT integration in the BPM ecosystem, consisting of methods,
    approaches and tools to manage the life cycle of a BP. To achieve this, we formulated
    the following research questions from collaborative brainstorming sessions among
    the authors: RQ1: Which phases of the BP life cycle was mainly impacted by the
    integration of IoT? RQ2: Which topics relating to IoT integration in BPM are discussed
    in the literature? RQ3: Which application domains are used to study IoT and BPM
    integration? RQ4: What are the research challenges addressed so far to support
    the management of IoT-aware BP? 2.3 Data Sources We applied the search string
    on three search engines: Google Scholar (GS) and two more specialized in information
    systems and computer science, namely the IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ACM Digital
    Library. This approach has enabled us to overcome limitations associated with
    relying solely on a single search engine, specifically: (i) accessing a broader
    spectrum of pertinent sources beyond GS, (ii) mitigating the risk of missing relevant
    studies, (iii) reducing the inclusion of low-quality sources, and (iv) overcoming
    potential biases towards popular and recent publications. As a further data source,
    we also reviewed the literature cited by the studies, performing a backward reference
    search. Additionally, we carried out a conference and journal search to retrieve
    other studies without any time constraints. The relevant studies for this SLR
    include publications from the most relevant conferences, seminar proceedings,
    and journals within the BPM and IoT fields and those focusing on practical solutions
    and applications. These sources have been selected through a well-defined and
    consistent process and align with the review’s topic and objective. The journals
    and conferences were initially selected based on the authors’ research experience.
    Subsequently, we expanded the search and defined criteria for adding new sources.
    Specifically, these were chosen because (i) they are subject to a peer-review
    process and (ii) they are registered in the libraries used to conduct this SLR.
    As a result, we included nine conferences, a dedicated workshop and eight journals,
    namely: Conference on: Business Information Systems (BIS), Business Process Management
    (BPM), Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE), Enterprise Distributed
    Object Computing (EDOC), Conceptual Modeling (ER), Process Mining (ICPM), Computational
    Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC), Service Science (ICSS), Workshop
    on Business Processes Meet Internet-of-Things (BP-Meet-IoT), Business Process
    Modeling, Development and Support (BPMDS). ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems
    and Technology (ACM TIST), Business and Information Systems Engineering (BISE),
    Business Process Management Journal (BPMJ), Computers in Industry, Information
    Systems, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), Software
    and Systems Modeling (SoSyM), Journal on Data Semantics (JoDS). 2.4 The Search
    String The search terms for our SLR were constructed using the authors’ knowledge
    of the subject matter. We started with the two most relevant acronyms, BPM and
    IoT. Starting from these, a first survey of the databases was carried out to capture
    more information on the topic, thus identifying the advantages and disadvantages
    of the possible choices. However, the acronym BPM produced many studies that did
    not relate to BPM but referred to the concept of beats per minute. For this reason,
    we expanded it to include the terms process and workflow. On the other hand, we
    included the term Internet of Things in its longer version to avoid the appearance
    of improper studies. From this initial set, we extended the search by adding synonyms
    to increase the possible configurations and create a final string that avoided
    excluding relevant studies. For example, we included cyber physical, industry
    4.0 and smart because IoT technologies were primarly observed in specific domains
    (Leotta et al. 2019). The search terms were linked using boolean AND, while alternative
    spellings and synonyms were combined using boolean OR. 2 The resulting search
    string is given below: (process OR workflow OR processes OR workflows OR BPM)
    AND (IoT OR internet of things OR cyber physical OR industry 4.0 OR smart) 2.5
    Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The SLR also includes identifying specific criteria
    that allow us to guarantee that only relevant studies are selected. Consequently,
    we defined the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. We did not use all
    filters simultaneously, but each criterion was applied within a specific process
    step. 2.5.1 Inclusion Criteria We define one criterion for study inclusion. Criterion
    I.1 includes the studies proposing a case study, an approach, a technique or a
    conceptual framework that deals with the concrete use of IoT to tackle issues
    from the BPM community. Consequently, studies using BPM techniques for IoT community
    problems or merely mentioning IoT and BPM without being the primary focus of the
    research do not meet the inclusion criteria. 2.5.2 Exclusion Criteria Five criteria
    for study exclusion were also been defined. Criterion E.1 excludes the studies
    not written in English. Criterion E.2 excludes the studies that are not available.
    This mainly concerns studies that are not electronically accessible, require payment
    for access, or are only partially available (e.g., abstracts only). Criterion
    E.3 excludes the studies that are not peer-reviewed. Criterion E.4 excludes the
    studies that do not satisfy any inclusion criteria. Criterion E.5 excludes studies
    with fragmented results, where findings are reported across multiple publications.
    In such cases, only the most comprehensive publication is considered for inclusion.
    A study was considered for inclusion in the SLR if it met at least one inclusion
    criterion and did not meet any exclusion criteria. 3 Conducting the Systematic
    Literature Review This section describes the search protocol developed to identify
    and select studies. 3.1 Study Selection To carry out the selection, we follow
    a three-phase search process as suggested by Keele (2007): 1. Phase 1 – Digital
    library search: During this phase, 5,315 studies were identified after entering
    the search string on GS, 3 IEEE and ACM. Then duplicate studies were removed,
    obtaining as a result a total of 4,869 potential studies. We then applied the
    inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting in 309 potentially relevant studies. These
    studies were assessed based on their titles, abstracts, conclusions, and keywords
    to determine their relevance to the SLR. 2. Phase 2 – Conference and journal search:
    In the second phase, we selected the leading conferences and journals of the domain
    of interest and carried out a new search to add 233 studies. Then, duplicate studies
    were removed, obtaining, as a result, a total of 195 potential studies. We then
    applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria that allowed us to add 38 potential relevant
    studies to the studies included in the previous phase. 3. Phase 3 – Backward snowballing
    search: In the third phase, we performed a backward snowballing search to analyze
    references and citations of the studies from the previous two phases and from
    both searches to identify other relevant studies. Thus, we obtained further 8
    studies. In summary, at the end of the three search phases, 355 studies were obtained,
    which were further processed into 93 final studies after applying the inclusion/exclusion
    criteria. The search was formally completed in June 2023, and we decided to start
    from 1999 when the term IoT was coined. Data extraction involved collecting such
    data in an Excel spreadsheet. The Excel file can be found at http://tinyurl.com/m7j4x9mm.

    Review In this section, we discuss the SLR results based on the research questions
    listed in Sect. 2. We cover: (i) the BPM life cycle phases affected by the IoT,
    (ii) the main topic of the study on BPM and IoT, (iii) the application domain
    on the usage of BPM and IoT solutions, and (iv) the addressed research challenge(s).
    4.1 Which Phases of the BP Life Cycle Were Mainly Impacted by the Integration
    of IoT? The research question RQ1 seeks to group the studies dealing with the
    BPM life cycle phases. We found that all the selected studies (93) refer to, or
    in some cases explicitly mention, one or more phases of the BPM’s life cycle to
    contextualize their work (cf. Table 3). In detail, phases are considered by the
    identified studies with regard to the following aspects (cf. Figure 2): Identification
    (3.8%), Modeling (35.4%), Analysis (7%), Redesign (5.7%), Implementation (31.6%)
    and Monitoring and Mining (16.5%). Fig. 2 Distribution of selected studies according
    to the aspect of integration of IoT into the BP life cycle phases Full size image
    Identification Hu et al. (2014) propose a dynamic integration mechanism of BPs

    executions based on sensor-actuator-activity patterns. Diamantini et al. (2023)
    discuss the role of semantic models when integrating IIoT data streams into an
    Industry 4.0 context. They propose a process-aware knowledge graph that enriches

    Gómez-Valiente et al. (2023) present the DOMINIoT architecture to address scheduling,
    resource allocation, and state management challenges. Redesign The redesign phase
    is often applied across other BPM life cycle stages. In Ruiz-Fernández et al.
    (2017), a redesign of a given clinical process is presented, while in Ismaili-Alaoui
    et al. (2018), interdisciplinary healthcare processes are redesigned to ensure
    direct and real-time interaction between the patient and the medical staff. Song
    et al. (2022) mainly address this phase by proposing an IoT-enabled Context-aware
    BPM (IoT-CaBPM) framework, which facilitates the evolution of BPs in combination
    with IoT advances. Implementation Chen et al. (2012) propose to extend WS-BPEL

    interactions and self-adaptation. Varga et al. (2018) propose a supporting system
    for service chaining and workflow execution using a Petri Net-based method, similar
    to a recent article that provide further insights into this area (Kozma et al.
    2019). Wieland et al. (2008) define and implement two smart workflows and provide
    an architecture for transforming sensor data into business-level information.
    Zhu et al. (2014) design and implement a dynamic adaptation framework using an
    adaptive algorithm, allowing the system to infer the process when the environment
    changes. Di Martino et al. (2022) provide a methodology for the smart management

    interdisciplinary development of IoT-enhanced BPs using BPMN, ontology-based technologies,
    and a microservices architecture. Monitoring and Mining Seiger et al. (2020) propose

    PM technique. Sora et al. (2017) transform raw movement measurements into actions
    and adapt sensor logs to apply BPM techniques. Bertrand et al. (2021) propose
    a model bridging the gap between IoT and PM using IoT ontologies and BP context
    models. Elali et al. (2022) enhance process models derived from PM with contextual
    information from sensor data. Elkodssi et al. (2022) present a PM approach for

    event logs enriched with IoT concepts using a BPMN Ontology. More phases A BPMN
    2.0 IoT-enabled extension for modeling, executing and monitoring IoT-aware BPs
    is proposed by Gallik et al. (2022), while Kirikkayis et al. (2023a) also present
    a framework for IoT-driven business rules. Kirikkayis et al. (2023c) present a

    BPs, enhancing real-time decision-making and monitoring. Table 3 Studies distribution
    by BPM life cycle (RQ1) Full size table 4.2 Which Topics Relating to IoT Integration
    in BPM are Discussed in the Literature? To answer the question RQ2, we analyzed
    the identified studies based on the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) technique
    (Blei et al. 2003), which is one of the most effective ones for latent topics
    distribution within a corpus (Chauhan and Shah 2021). LDA is a generative probabilistic
    model of a corpus where the documents are represented as a random mixture of latent
    topics each characterized by a mix of words. The application of the LDA to identify
    the topics in the 93 studies is detailed in a specific appendix (available online
    via http://link.springer.com). The resulting four topics are listed in Table 4,
    where the bolded words represent the most relevant terms in terms of estimated
    frequency within the selected topic. Once we trained the model and derived the
    four topics, we observed the keywords associated with each topic using a web-based
    interactive visualization (see the appendix) to understand what they refer to
    from the semantic point of view. Then, we tried to contextualize them within a
    semantic context. Table 5 shows the 93 studies and their topics. Note that the
    topics associated with each study are not exclusive, as a study can be related
    to one or more topics. We then discuss the four topics concerning specific studies.
    Table 4 The four topics mostly discussed in the 93 selected studies and terms
    related tp them Full size table Table 5 Associations between papers and their
    topics (the study topic number is in bold) Full size table Topic 1 – Event mining
    from sensors Knowledge extraction from sensor data has gained significant attention
    in the BPM community. Process mining techniques can greatly enhance BPM management
    when applied to analyze and transform raw data into usable information. The information
    provided by the sensors can be expressed through a functional business view, as
    demonstrated in Gao et al. (2011), representing the classification, storage, and
    distribution procedure of floral products within a flower company. This model
    in BPMN is connected to a functional model to import an ontology of the sensors
    and related instance data and then integrate the information modeled using the
    Semantic Sensor Network ontology with BPs. Similarly, various frameworks address
    the correlation between workflow states, sensor data, and events generated by
    IoT devices that initiate instances of BPs (Seiger et al. 2020; Wombacher 2011;
    Ismaili-Alaoui et al. 2018; Ruiz-Fernández et al. 2017; Ruppen and Meyer 2013;
    Chadli et al. 2022; Diamantini et al. 2023; Pastor et al. 2022). Koschmider et
    al. (2020) detect high-level events from raw event data and discover BPs from
    derived instances. Zhu et al. (2014) present a multi-agent framework that chooses
    the best step to move in the BP when an event caused by agents occurs. In addition,
    Sora et al. (2017) present an approach to discover process models from activities
    in the field of smart spaces where sensors must turn the sensor log into an event
    log consisting of human actions. Another interesting challenge when applying PM
    techniques in the context of sensor data is mapping sensor measurements to human
    activities and grouping activities into process instances (van Eck et al. 2016;
    de Leoni and Pellattiero 2021). The problem of mapping sensor data to event logs
    based on process knowledge is solved by Senderovich et al. (2016), which maps
    location-based events to activities by recognizing interactions between various
    agents and transforming historical sensor data registers into standardized event
    logs. Another contribution to translating sensor data into higher-level ones comes
    from Janssen et al. (2020). They discretize sensor data into activities using
    unsupervised learning through clustering, while Seiger et al. (2023) analyze sensor
    data to detect higher-level process activities. Topic 2 – Physical resource management
    This topic tackles the specification and management of the resources associated
    with the BPs supporting Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Graja et al. (2019) propose
    a verification framework to support the various CPS concepts and properties, which
    enables the designer to handle CPS process features. To integrate and utilize
    smart devices as BP resources to support the modeling, a service-oriented BPM
    system architecture was developed by Wehlitz et al. (2017). The resource management
    during runtime of a system to model a CPS-aware resource associated with a BP
    activity is proposed by Bocciarelli et al. (2017), while the DOMINIoT architecture
    is designed by Gómez-Valiente et al. (2023). In scenarios where physical resources
    are exchanged, knowing how a resource owned by a party is managed on anothers
    party’s premises is impossible. Thus possible misalignments can be detected too
    late. In Montali and Plebani (2017), the authors investigated an approach for
    compliance checking that mixes commitments and smart devices. Suri et al. (2017)
    developed a framework that describes IoT resources (e.g. extending the BP models
    with energy cost parameters to enable the energy-aware management of IoT resources
    in BPs). Topic 3 – Context-aware execution A context-aware execution environment
    involves processes continuously observed and adapted according to the model specified
    when required by context changes. Contextual information enhances process execution,
    incorporating situation-aware insights for improved effectiveness. Such information
    is often gathered from sensors within intelligent environments, enabling pervasive
    execution known as intelligent workflows (Wieland et al. 2008). Frameworks that
    enhance process awareness and self-adaptation are proposed (Seiger et al. 2019;
    Pryss et al. 2015; Friedow et al. 2018; Malburg et al. 2020; Engels et al. 2018).
    To support context variables and sensors as well as communication paradigms for
    IoT, Domingos et al. (2014) extend the WS-BPEL workflow language, dynamically
    selecting IoT services based on availability, functionality, and context (Seiger
    et al. 2018; Elali et al. 2022). Other studies focused on the adaptability of
    BPs during the execution phase. A dynamic integration mechanism for coping with
    changes in BPs is proposed by Hu et al. (2014); Domingos et al. (2010); Tôn and
    Lê (2019). An application to the predictive process monitoring field using IoT
    events as a process context and developing a predictive model to predict the next
    activity is provided by Elhami et al. (2020). A new trend in running the IoT-aware
    BP is running on fog computing. 8 In this context, Cheng et al. (2018) dealt with
    IoT-aware BPs at the execution level, where they introduced a new intermediate
    layer consisting of a set of distributed fog nodes to perform certain parts of
    the process. Topic 4 – IoT-aware process modeling To create IoT-aware BPs and
    exploit the full potential of IoT and BPM, this must be integrated into process
    models. Modeling strategies for IoT-aware BPs fall into two categories (Brouns
    et al. 2018): those utilizing known modeling languages and those proposing new
    domain-specific languages. The former includes integrating BPMN with ontologies
    (Valderas et al. 2022; Di Martino et al. 2022; Valderas et al. 2023; Bertrand
    et al. 2021; Elkodssi et al. 2022) and extending BPMN with IoT devices (Chiu and
    Wang 2015; Kirikkayis et al. 2022b; Hornsteiner and Schönig 2023), as well as
    using Petri Nets (Varga et al. 2018), or DMN 9 (Hasić et al. 2020; Kirikkayis
    et al. 2023b). In the latter, Chen et al. (2012) provide a new process definition
    language for IoT-enabled BPs, encapsulating physical devices as SOA services.
    IoT device interaction is critical. To this end, the application of mixed reality
    as a new interaction paradigm to facilitate the modeling and configuration of
    processes among IoT devices was elaborated on Seiger et al. (2021). From an access
    IoT data perspective, Cherrier and Deshpande (2017) present a gateway for transferring
    IoT events to BPs, managing device heterogeneity. Meyer et al. (2013) map IoT
    concepts to process models, and Martins and Domingos (2017) use BPMN to model
    IoT device behaviours. Other studies focus on collaborative structures to improve
    physical and digital collaboration between multiple actors to achieve a common
    goal (Maamar et al. 2020; Shamsuzzoha et al. 2014; Li et al. 2021; Wang et al.
    2022). For example, Grefen et al. (2019) discuss synchronizing physical objects
    for successful IoT-aware digital processes. 4.3 Which Application Domains are
    Used to Study IoT and BPM Integration? Question number three was answered based
    on data from research conducted by HSPI 10 Accessed 6 January 2022. Thus, from
    the HSPI process mining application database, we collected and analyzed the studies
    to map the applications provided through different industries and markets and
    understand the adoption of BPM and IoT. The application domains which the found
    studies refer to are (cf. Figure 3): Healthcare (17.6%); Industrial sector (41.2%);
    Public (7.1%); Consumer Services (5.9%); Consumer Goods (3.5%) and Services (24.7%).
    Only eight studies (11%) do not refer to any application domain. Fig. 3 Distribution
    of selected studies by application domains Full size image Healthcare Most healthcare
    applications are related to remote patient monitoring systems, within hospitals
    or at home, and constantly enriched with IoT devices (Antonius and Dachyar 2020;
    Cheng et al. 2018; Jain and Tata 2017; Pryss et al. 2015; Seiger et al. 2018;
    Vitali and Pernici 2016; Ruiz-Fernández et al. 2017; Ruppen and Meyer 2013; Tôn
    and Lê 2019; Kirikkayis et al. 2022b; Gómez-Valiente et al. 2023). Maamar et al.
    (2018) use the example of a hospital that is on high alert being close to a severe
    car accident, where departments equipped with environmental sensors or smart wrists,
    enable the real-time transmission of patients’ vital signs to appropriate recipients,
    demonstrating how IoT can facilitate operations and improve efficiency. Senderovich
    et al. (2016) present an example of a process of treatment in a day hospital for
    cancer patients through Real-Time Locating System (RTLS) receivers that monitor
    all corporate entities involved in the process (e.g., patients, doctors, nurses)
    as well as some of the medical devices that record the data emitted and use it
    for real-time monitoring of process entities and equipment. Another frequent scenario
    is elderly care. Integrating the real-time event streams from bed pressure sensors
    into the BP field can reflect the health status of the elderly in real-time and
    thus monitor them through immediate warnings (Li et al. 2021). Industrial sector
    In the domain of transportation, IoT might be used to realize monitoring of goods,
    such as dangerous or perishable goods (Domingos et al. 2010, 2014, 2015; Valderas
    et al. 2022; Suri et al. 2017; Valderas et al. 2023; Gallik et al. 2022; Seiger
    et al. 2023; Diamantini et al. 2023). These systems react to events that occur
    during transport using sensors and location technologies to improve the monitoring
    of transport conditions, such as temperature and pressure (Mass et al. 2016).
    Sensors and smart devices have great potential to provide further automation in
    various domains including logistics (Meroni et al. 2018; Gao et al. 2011; Grefen
    et al. 2019; Zanfack et al. 2015; Wombacher 2011; Schief et al. 2011; Song et
    al. 2022). Take, for example, the maritime transport scenario of heavy fog where
    disasters can be prevented in sea-land transport (Wang et al. 2022). Montali and
    Plebani (2017) use an example of a seafood company that organizes fish delivery
    and aims to verify if all actors operate correctly because of the complexity of
    the delivery process (deviations to the plan may occur). Several studies focus
    on smart factories as representatives of IoT environments (Grambow et al. 2021;
    Bocciarelli et al. 2017; Malburg et al. 2020; Wieland et al. 2008; Seiger et al.
    2020; Kirikkayis et al. 2023c, a, b, 2022a). In the manufacturing industry, BPM
    and IoT support could improve both management by closely linking digital production
    and machine data (Schönig et al. 2018, 2020; Shamsuzzoha et al. 2014; Keates 2019)
    and cybersecurity by integrating security requirements into modeling using a ”security
    by design” paradigm (Hornsteiner and Schönig 2023). Public Cheng et al. (2019)
    develop an actual sensor-aware BP application and validate it by using the designed
    system to protect a large area of forest in North China. Graja et al. (2019) evaluate
    their study through an example of disaster recovery systems. Maamar et al. (2020)
    present a city that runs many systems like transportation for traffic control
    and environment for air pollution monitoring; Marrella and Mecella (2017) rely
    on a case study previously conducted by the same authors in (Humayoun et al. 2009b,
    a; Marrella et al. 2011) to evaluate their study in an emergency management domain,
    in which teams of first responders act in disaster locations with the primary
    purpose of assisting potential victims and stabilizing the situation. Chadli et
    al. (2022) propose a classroom case study involving the deployment of hardware
    device and management software to measure the environmental parameters and control
    ventilation, lighting, and air conditioning. Pastor et al. (2022) employ a smart
    camera with active sensors for vehicle identification in road traffic. Consumer
    Services Kahl et al. (2015) test their study for common BPs in the retail domain
    within the innovative retail lab of a large European supermarket chain; Meyer
    et al. (2011) evaluate their study using a use case from the domain of retail
    and show how sensors monitor perishable goods in a store; Meyer et al. (2013)
    test their study using a dynamic pricing process in the retail domain and show
    how the IoT device temperature sensor monitors the perishable good orchid in a
    store; Suri et al. (2018) evaluate their study using a process family from the
    Retail/Supply Chain Management domain; Ugljanin et al. (2018) test their study
    using a Smart City Tourism Organization (SCTO) scenario to automate its BPs related
    to visitor mobility by communicating with them using social networks and collecting
    their feedback. Consumer Goods Friedow et al. (2018) use a simple coffee machine
    billing system to automate the process of counting the coffee amount for each
    user; Kunz et al. (2011) use the lifecycle of a fish fillet within the different
    domains of manufacturer, logistics service provider, wholesaler distribution hub,
    wholesaler store, and the customer; van Eck et al. (2016) use a case study performed
    at Philips where a smart baby bottle has been developed. Services Scenarios that
    use smart device detection and implementation capabilities in smart home environments
    have been extensively addressed (Janssen et al. 2020; Loke et al. 2007; Wehlitz
    et al. 2017; Xing et al. 2012; Seiger et al. 2019; Hu et al. 2014; Chiu and Wang
    2015; Elali et al. 2022). Examples of instances where service applications play
    a crucial role include the intruder detection system in a security scenario (Kikuchi
    et al. 2018); office supply processes (Cherrier and Deshpande 2017), temperature
    control processes (Seiger et al. 2021), warehouse management system monitoring
    processes (Hou et al. 2016), automatic irrigation control processes (Martins and
    Domingos 2017; Martins et al. 2020; Di Martino et al. 2022), processes for adaptive
    ventilation in a student dormitory (Mottola et al. 2019) or on student thesis
    defence (Zhu et al. 2014), processes for repair and maintenance of computers and
    peripherals (Muhsin et al. 2016); while Park et al. (2018) implement smart toilets
    for companion animals by simply attaching sensors and introducing BPM technology.

    What are the Research Challenges Addressed So Far to Support the Management of
    IoT-Aware BP? In this section, we present the results related to research question
    RQ4. Enriching BPs with IoT technologies brings several advantages and many challenges
    (Janiesch et al. 2020); therefore, we provide the distribution of the studies
    according to the IoT-Meets-BPM Manifesto (cf. Figure 4 and Table 7). Not all studies
    face one of these challenges, actually, only 38% of them do. Fig. 4 Distribution
    of the studies by research challenges addressed in the IoT-Meets-BPM Manifesto
    Full size image C1 – Placing sensors in a process-aware way The research challenge
    C1 is considered by 25% (i.e., 12) of the studies. The link between the position
    of the sensors and that of the corresponding actuator is discussed in Mottola
    et al. (2019). Using a physical simulation model, Malburg et al. (2020) conducted
    research in BPM and Industry 4.0, aiming to program a smart factory for BPs by
    selecting hardware components to detect process-relevant events. To place IoT
    sensors in a process-aware way and link them to the running process, a BPMS must
    be aware of the current values of IoT objects, and based on an established mapping
    from IoT variables to process models IoT data is sent to a BPMS (Schönig et al.
    2020). Process model discovery from sensors or wearable devices depends on their
    location and amount (Koschmider et al. 2020; Senderovich et al. 2016; van Eck
    et al. 2016). Other interesting studies on how to integrate sensors with other
    services and into existing BPs have been conducted (Ruppen and Meyer 2013; Gallik
    et al. 2022; Song et al. 2022; Di Martino et al. 2022). Regarding sensors, the
    presented ontological model covers domain configuration, including IoT resources’
    placement and gathered observations over time (Diamantini et al. 2023; Valderas
    et al. 2023). C3 – Connection of analytical processes with IoT The research challenge
    C3 is considered by 8.3% (i.e. 4) of the studies. Elhami et al. (2020) use contextual
    events in the decision point to control the process execution and incorporate
    contextual changes with process rules and exaction logic at the runtime. With
    the proposed extension Kirikkayis et al. (2023b) can specify event-driven behaviour
    at various points in a BP but also demarcate IoT-based data sources from other
    process inputs for monitoring and error handling. BP execution necessitates updated
    information availability. Li et al. (2021) proposed a framework separating event
    processing and BP execution, reducing BPM engine load. C4 – Integrating the IoT
    with process correctness checks The research challenge C4 is considered by 4.2%
    (i.e. 2) of the studies. By connecting individual tasks and workflow executions
    to the respective effects in the physical and virtual world with the help of additional
    sensor data, you can verify the correct execution and behaviour of the IoT entities
    involved (Seiger et al. 2018; Malburg et al. 2020). C5 – Dealing with unstructured
    environments The research challenge C5 is considered by 6.3% (i.e. 3) of the studies.
    In the IoT world, which is much more ad hoc and situative, Domingos et al. (2010)
    introduce mechanisms to perform ad-hoc changes in IoT-aware BPs by identifying
    change primitives that support the change operations needed to modify parts of
    the BP. C6 – Managing the link between micro-processes The research challenge
    C6 is considered by 6.3% (i.e. 3) of the studies. An example is to achieve an
    efficient and flexible production line by investigating the micro-processes at
    the individual machines and stations and their interconnections to achieve a more
    flexible composition of smaller processes (Malburg et al. 2020). By extending
    BPMN 2.0, Gao et al. (2011) links process models with business functions, connecting
    them to external open data, including sensor and instance ontology data; another
    extension suggest using low-level IoT data for decision-making, not including
    high-level data aggregation (Kirikkayis et al. 2023c). C7 – Breaking down end-to-end
    processes The research challenge C7 is considered by 4.2% (i.e. 2) of the studies.
    Malburg et al. (2020) suggest relaxing and detailing the static and coarse-grained
    “hardwired” processes to achieve a more flexible composition of smaller processes.
    Kahl et al. (2015) propose a system that provides an agent-assisted realization
    and adaptation of BPs with semantic service selection and facilitates an event-driven
    selection and controlled execution of relevant BPs in intelligent environments.
    C9 – Specifying the autonomy level of things The research challenge C9 is considered
    by 2.1% (i.e. 1) of the studies. Ensuring appropriate autonomy for resource constrained
    IoT device is investigated by Malburg et al. (2020). C12 – Dealing with new situations
    The research challenge C12 is considered by 2.1% (i.e. 1) of the studies. Malburg
    et al. (2020) use past successful process executions to automatically learn possible
    adaptations of process instances to deal with new or similar situations. C13 –
    Bridging the gap between event-based and process-based systems The research challenge
    C13 is considered by 25% (i.e. 12) of the studies. The complex IoT system is event-driven
    due to the large number of sensors and process-based (Malburg et al. 2020). While
    in the past, process models have been detected by documents or interviews with
    domain experts, today the challenge of automatically discovering the process model
    from the network of sensors or wearable devices also depends on their location
    and amount (Koschmider et al. 2020; Senderovich et al. 2016; van Eck et al. 2016).
    Therefore, considering the physical context and revealing the correlation between
    IoT data and process events is crucial (Bertrand et al. 2021). C14 – Improving
    online conformance checking The research challenge C14 is considered by 6.3% (i.e.
    3) of the studies. Seiger et al. (2020) mainly focus on generating event logs
    from streams of IoT sensor data with smart factories as an application domain.
    C15 – Improving resource utilization optimization The research challenge C15 is
    considered by 10.4% (i.e. 5) of the studies. Suri et al. (2017) present a framework
    that formalizes IoT properties and rules to optimize resource management in BPs,
    defining resource constraints to be mapped to a task during the design phase.
    Table 7 Definitions of the research challenges of the IoT-Meets-BPM Manifesto
    Full size table 5 Discussion Table 8 Trends for research studies to support IoT-aware
    BPs life cycle phases Full size table In this section, we discuss the relationships
    between the topics extracted from the studies, the application domains, the life
    cycle phases of the BPM and the research challenges introduced by Janiesch et
    al. (2020). Finally, the main issues which seem to need further investigation
    are discussed. \\(\\blacksquare \\): BPM life cycle phases Our results suggest
    that many studies include more than one phase, and most (43%, 40 studies) combine
    the modeling and implementation phases. The impact of IoT technology on the modeling
    phase has been widely studied, giving rise to the so-called IoT-aware BP modeling
    that has attracted the attention of researchers. Introducing IoT entities into
    the modeling phase has encountered difficulties with the entities’ heterogeneity.
    Analysis of the studies showed that the approaches used to model IoT entities
    involve: the expression of entities through the use of standard elements of process
    modeling languages, although increasingly rarely, or more commonly, the extension
    of languages through the introduction of specific IoT elements. However, the existing
    BPM solutions have not yet precisely defined the behaviour of IoT entities, and
    this absence proves a significant obstacle to running BPs of traditional BPM systems
    on IoT devices automatically. The analysis showed that an integrated workflow
    engine approach can rapidly change the model and its execution, avoiding the situation
    where the process model changes. The system must re-convert the model into an
    executable source code and distribute the code to IoT devices. A second common
    approach involves the implementation of a middleware that makes BP independent
    of the device’s technology. However, the proposal of an approach that covers most
    of the phases of an IoT-aware BP is the most critical challenge to date. Based
    on the findings, we have defined a set of trends (or directions for research studies)
    for the life cycle phases of IoT-aware BPs (cf. Table 8). Topic Modeling One of
    the biggest challenges we have encountered in topic analysis, which is to extract
    knowledge from sensor data, is to bridge the gap between sensor data clouds and
    event logs. To be more precise, the goal is to identify events from raw event
    data, discover their activities and correlate them with the process instance.
    Another interesting topic that emerged from the analysis concerns the modeling
    approaches of IoT-aware BPs. For example, based on the review conducted in this
    article, we have seen several approaches to modeling IoT devices. Most authors
    modeling IoT-aware BPs propose methods that rely on a BPMN extension to integrate
    IoT devices within the process model. Another interesting approach uses a linked
    data mechanism to create links between the BP model and external open data, including
    the ontology of sensors and instance data, to achieve better integration between
    the physical world and BPs. Many authors see IoT as the external data source for
    BPM, most commonly in terms of process context. Physical resource management was
    the last topic of interest in the BPM and IoT field. We have seen that it is essential
    to specify the resources used to perform tasks because IoT resources are active.
    However, the challenge remains to formalize the relationship between IoT resources
    to ensure efficient management. Application domains and case studies Our results
    show that there are application domains that benefit more than others from the
    integration of IoT concepts into BPM application scenarios. Among these, the industrial
    categories (41.2%, 35 studies) and services (24.7%, 21 studies) are the most used
    as application scenarios in BPM and IoT. Within the industrial category, we have
    further classified studies into several sectors, and we have seen that many studies
    have introduced BPM for IoT-based logistics. It emerged that filtering and processing
    events are important but are only the first steps to obtaining transparent BPs.
    It is necessary to consider the quality of the information because the data in
    the logistics area are often incomplete and inconsistent. Data quality is a topic
    that needs to be addressed if you want to build approaches that integrate IoT
    into the BPM community. Existing solutions presuppose persistent and relatively
    static data sets contrary to the physical world’s needs. Notice that among these
    only a few studies utilize real scenarios, such as a temperature controlling process
    (Chiu and Wang 2015), a small scale physical smart factory model (Kirikkayis et
    al. 2022a), a smart hospital (Jain and Tata 2017) or a clinical process of the
    hypertension (Ruiz-Fernández et al. 2017). Furthermore, two studies propose that
    their future work will be dedicated to devising a comprehensive evaluation of
    the real-case approach (Maamar et al. 2018; Diamantini et al. 2023). Research
    challenges Another essential aspect that we have observed in some of the studies
    analysed (38%, 35 studies) is the discussion of the challenges presented in the
    BPM-IoT Manifesto (Janiesch et al. 2020). Complex IoT environments consist of
    many sensors, actuators, and control units. In addition to IoT components, a further
    software stack is also needed to elevate programming and research to the level
    of abstraction of BPs and thus exploit the potential of BPM’s integration with
    IoT. This type of system can often be driven either by events, due to a large
    number of sensors, or by the process (C13 - Sect. 4.4). One of the research activities
    associated with this challenge concerns the functionality analysis of the available
    sensors and actuators and their grouping and abstraction at the BPM-oriented level.
    Identifying process events from IoT data, perfecting them, and generating associated
    events is often insufficient. What may remain are ambiguities and uncertainties,
    typical of the nature of IoT environments, as part of the event log and this must
    be considered in the following analysis steps (e.g. in the compliance check).
    The analysis of the research challenges also showed that it is necessary to place
    IoT sensors in a process-aware way and that these must be connected to running
    processes (C1 - Sect. 4.4). To date, this challenge mainly involves BPMS which
    must be aware of the current values of IoT objects. In addition, it is also necessary
    to investigate how to acquire current values from different data variables and
    obtain a mapping between IoT variables and process models so that IoT data can
    be sent to a BPMS. This process is fundamental as, on the one hand, based on the
    current values of some variables, tasks are activated or canceled and decisions
    are made; on the other hand, this allows IoT data variables to be more configurable
    and traceable. 5.1 Threats to Validity The SLR’s validity should be rigorously
    assessed to ensure the level of scientific value in its conduct and findings.
    In this section, we discuss the factors (threats to validity) that dispute the
    results of an SLR or decrease the meaningfulness of the results. Our review adopted
    the guidelines specified by Zhou et al. (2016) in assessing the validity of Software
    Engineering. The authors classify validity categories and associate identified
    threats with them. One of the main threats to the validity of this SLR is incompleteness.
    In our case, what risk this threat poses depends heavily on the limitations of
    available search engines. A multidisciplinary search engine such as GS and two
    more specific ones, ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries, should significantly decrease
    such constraints. Another critical issue is bias in the selection of studies which
    could lead to inaccuracies in the data. To solve this, we employed various strategies.
    The reviewer thoroughly read the documents during the selection process to minimize
    misinterpretations from relying solely on titles and abstracts. Additionally,
    explicit reasons for exclusion decisions were documented during the screening
    phase. This approach aided in mitigating the threat of overlooking relevant studies.
    To maximize study coverage, we employed snowballing as a complementary search
    to reduce the possibility of missing relevant studies. Another action taken, which
    could be traced back to a wrong search method (Zhou et al. 2016), was the combination
    of automated and manual search methods. 6 Concluding Remarks This article has
    provided an in-depth overview of the interplay between BPM and IoT. Unlike the
    existing surveys that deal with specific aspects of the interaction, we aimed
    to provide a holistic view in this study. The systematic analysis of reviewed
    studies provides answers to several research questions, enabling us to (i) identify
    the hottest topics studied within the literature (Mining from event sensors, Physical
    resource management, Context-aware execution, IoT-aware process modeling), (ii)
    classify the integration of IoT within the BP life cycle phases (Identification,
    Modeling, Analysis, Re-design, Implementation, and Monitoring and mining), (iii)
    identify which are the application domains where integration between IoT and BPM
    have the most significant expansion (Consumer goods, Consumer services, Healthcare,
    Industrials, Services and Public), and (vi) highlight the research challenges
    provided by the IoT-Meets-BPM Manifesto faced so far to support the management
    of IoT-aware BPs. Notes The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is the ISO
    standard (ISO/IEC 19510:2013) for modeling BPs. Note that while GS lacks explicit
    Boolean operator functionality, we simulated it in our search process using the
    Publish or Perish software (https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish).
    We used Publish or Perish software to overcome Google Scholar’s 1000-results limit.
    We segmented our search into multiple time intervals and iteratively refined the
    query until each search yielded fewer than 1000 results. Accessed 10 Nov 2023.

    Innovation, Systems and Technologies ((SIST,volume 376)) Abstract The Internet
    has extensively disseminated into civilization, and numerous facilities in several
    industries are built on top of the Internet. A classical network works by distributing
    bits in classical nature. In any network, a connection is established between

    is a huge network which associates computer systems globally. Through the internet
    connection, sharing and transferring data from anywhere on Earth can happen just
    in the blink of an eye. Network service providers give internet access to end
    users. This internet connection may be wired or wireless. Today, we communicate
    information by means of internet media using the classical interpretation as binary
    bits. A bit is an elementary component of the classical computer’s data or information
    processing system by which we communicate through the internet. There is a chance
    of noise interpreted over the information, and thereby, information is degraded
    or destroyed, even collapsed. The bit represents a logical state with truly binary
    values [1]. Confidential information is transmitted across an insecure communication
    channel within a network. As a result, there are potential hacking risks when
    sending information. In order to hide information, cybersecurity is crucial. Although
    the present encryption techniques are quantum secure, they are not safe for conventional
    systems. To solve this issue, the quantum internet aims to increase global security.
    The revelation of a quantum internet is to come up with new internet technology
    by aiding quantum communication between any two nodes. A network of quantum computers
    that compute, encode, and decode information is known as quantum internet. The
    quantum internet will not replace the traditional internet; it will offer additional
    features, such as quantum bit, quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, quantum
    communication, quantum encryption, and many more. The application of quantum computing
    is numerous, and commercial as well as non-commercial establishments are using
    them. This review paper is categorized as follows. Section 48.2 presents the relevant
    quantum computing theoretical concepts and definitions. The architecture of the
    quantum internet is presented in Sect. 48.3. Section 48.4 presents the quantum
    internet protocol. Section 48.5 presents a comparative study between classical
    internet with quantum internet. The literature review is presented in Sect. 48.6.
    Section 48.7 concludes the paper with future directions of research. 48.2 Quantum
    Computing Preliminaries A brief summary of quantum theoretic concepts is presented
    in this section. Quantum computing is an associative arena including mechanics,
    physics, and computer science features that resolve complex issues quicker than
    conventional computers. Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that lessons
    the manners of atoms at a macroscopic level. Quantum processors execute calculations
    in a brand-new manner using these features. 48.2.1 Concept of Quantum Bit The
    bit, represented as ‘0’ or ‘1’, is the most fundamental unit of the classical
    computing system to communicate with different devices through the internet. In
    quantum networking systems, these drawbacks are overcome with quantum mechanical
    properties [2]. Qubit is the most fundamental component of a quantum system where
    quantum data is transmitted using QKD principles. Qubits can be entangled and
    superimposed, which means two qubits share a strong connection in a distributed
    manner and stay in both states, i.e., |0⟩ and |1⟩. A qubit is denoted as |φ⟩ = β|0⟩ + γ|1⟩,
    where β and γ are probability amplitudes corresponding to finding |0⟩ and |1⟩,
    provided that β2 + γ2 = 1. Qubits have unlimited states using the superposition
    theorem (Fig. 48.1). Fig. 48.1 Bit and qubit Full size image 48.2.2 Quantum Measurement
    The quantum state of a system serves as its description in quantum mechanics.
    If the value of quantum characteristics is not measured, it has no existence [3].
    A quantum state is a vector within a complex vector space. Individual physical
    machine in quantum mechanics has a corresponding Hilbert space; each component
    denotes a feasible state for that system. 48.2.3 Quantum Logic Gates Quantum logic
    gates work like digital logical gates on classical computers. Logical quantum
    gates make quantum circuits. It has no loops because qubits can’t go back in time.
    Lines can’t spread out because of the no-cloning theorem [4]. Quantum wires are
    interconnected with quantum gates. The number and types of gates are the actual
    structure of a quantum circuit. The most important quantum gates are as follows:
    Single-Qubit Gates—The NOT logic gate is simple because it is reversible [4, 5].
    It is represented as. $$ \\begin{aligned} {\\text{NOT}}: & |\\left. 0 \\right\\rangle
    = |\\left. 1 \\right\\rangle \\\\ |\\left. 1 \\right\\rangle = |\\left. 0 \\right\\rangle
    . \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Multiple-Qubit Gates—In classical systems, any digital
    logic circuit can be built up from NAND gates, but in quantum circuits, NAND is
    not useful because of its irreversible feature. However, universal quantum logic
    gates are present in quantum systems. Controlled-NOT or C-NOT consists of two
    qubits as input. One qubit is called a target, and the other one is controlled.
    If and only if the control qubit is |1⟩, the C-NOT flips the target qubit [6].
    48.2.4 Quantum Superposition The most significant concept in quantum mechanics
    is quantum superposition [7]. In traditional computing, a computer can only be
    in one state at a time. Still, in quantum computing, superposition is the theorem
    to be in more than one state at the same time before measurement. The concept
    of quantum superposition might take a lot of work to visualize. For particles
    in the instance of quantum computing, it becomes duplicated but identical or effectively
    existing in two places at the same time. This overlapping of quantum bits gives
    quantum computers intrinsic parallelism, allowing them to perform lots of operations
    concurrently. 48.2.5 No-Cloning Theorem No-cloning is another important concept
    in quantum computing. According to no-cloning, it is impossible to replicate any
    quantum state into another state. Based on a fundamental distinction between quantum
    and classical systems, quantum key distribution is secured. Nonorthogonal states
    cannot be disturbed. $$ \\left( - \\right) \\otimes \\left( - \\right):V \\times
    V \\to V $$ Certain classical error-correcting methods cannot be applied to quantum
    states because of the no-cloning theorem. The no communication, which argues that
    quantum entanglement cannot be utilized to transfer classical information, implies
    the no-cloning theorem [8]. 48.2.6 Quantum Entanglement Erwin Schrödinger invented
    the entanglement of qubit states in 1935 [9]. Quantum entanglement is a quantum-level
    phenomenon where the states must be described relative to each other, even if
    the particles can be isolated. Quantum entanglement has always played a significant
    role in quantum communication systems. In general terms, quantum entanglement
    means that the difference between one element in an entangled pair depends on
    the difference between the other elements, no matter how far apart. When measuring
    the quantum state, the energy wave disappears and is measured as its ‘0’ or ‘1’
    state, and in the real or deterministic state, the qubit behaves like a standard
    bit. Entanglement is the ability of qubits to share their state with other qubits.
    48.3 Architecture of Quantum Internet The architecture of the quantum internet,
    elementary concepts of edge node, quantum repeater, quantum switch, and quantum
    channel are presented in this section. Also, the application and challenges of
    the quantum internet are discussed here. Quantum communication uses qubits to
    exchange any information to the independent and multiple quantum nodes in a network.
    Quantum channels connect quantum nodes, but they are physically separated. Sending
    information through quantum channels is more secure than conventional ones. Only
    on the quantum internet is a quantum computer sending quantum data, quantum bits,
    from one place to another. Although yet in its early stages of research, the quantum
    internet has major effects in a variety of fields. A connection between multiple
    isolated quantum nodes over a quantum channel is called quantum internet. The
    laws of quantum mechanics are the driving force behind this revolutionary technology.
    The quantum internet is a network that will enable information flow between quantum
    nodes [10, 11]. An illustration of the Fig. 48.2 is presented below [10]. Fig.
    48.2 Structure of quantum internet Full size image Edge Node—Edge nodes are important
    and basic conditions of the quantum internet. It is required for long-distance
    communications. These nodes are quantum systems consisting of at least one qubit.
    Quantum Repeater—No-cloning theorem prevents classical telecommunication in quantum
    communication [12]. To solve this issue, quantum repeater protocols were developed,
    which, through entanglement swapping, produce long-distance entanglement from
    shorter-distance entanglement [9]. The ability to temporarily store the quantum
    information conveyed by photons in a quantum memory is necessary for understanding
    quantum repeaters in the real world, which is quite interesting. Quantum repeater
    is very important in long-distance communication systems [12]. There are four
    ways to perform the task, i.e., (1) entanglement between node to node, (2) entanglement
    stretching, (3) error management, and (4) network management. Quantum Switch—The
    quantum switch offers an edge in computation for several issues. Security and
    performance are designed and implemented by the quantum switch and are also cost-effective.
    Qubit regulates the order of a quantum switch made up of two quantum channels.
    In any case, the quantum switch applies an action 1 that can be trailed by other
    action 2 or reversibly [13, 14]. Quantum Channel—In communication through a quantum
    channel, the sender encrypts a message secretly, the receiver decrypts it, and
    the entire communication is perceived through a quantum system. The quantum encoder
    scheme differs from the classical system; quantum states send information over
    quantum channels [15, 16]. 48.3.1 Quantum Teleportation Quantum teleportation
    represents an important concept in quantum computing [17, 18]. Teleportation is
    a system that uses entangled states to send quantum information from one place
    to another in quantum networks. Given the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics,
    teleportation is the best option in this situation to prevent an attempt by an
    eavesdropper to obtain the key instantaneously. 48.3.2 Applications of Quantum
    Internet The applications of the quantum internet are classified according to
    the following genre [19, 20]: Quantum-based Cryptography—It is a secure mode of
    encryption that conveys information in a technique that is not possible to hack.
    Quantum-based cryptography is the method of encoding and securing the information
    so that the authentic one has the exact secret key to decode it. QKD protocol
    is used for secure communication. Quantum-Based Sensors—Quantum sensing is the
    latest technique that utilizes quantum mechanics principles to develop new kinds
    of sensing devices. Quantum sensors have higher accuracy, sensitivity, and precision.
    Along with quantum-based computation, simulation, and communication, it is incorporated
    into the group of quantum technologies. Distributed sensors are also supported
    in this technology. Accurate clock synchronization is possible with the help of
    this technique. 48.3.3 Challenges of Quantum Internet Decoherence—The idea behind
    quantum coherence is that an individual object has been divided into two distinct
    wave functions. Qubits are breakable, so the loss of information in quantum computing
    is called decoherence. To compute, the qubits should pair, measure their conditions,
    and then be reserved free of communications that cause noise and decoherence.
    Ecological factors are the basic reasons to collapse a qubit. There is an immense
    challenge in the making of a quantum computer designed with various features that
    try to interrupt the decoherence. Quantum decoherence occurs when there is no
    longer a certain phase relation between the two different states [21]. Imperfections
    of Quantum Teleportation—Since every way of communication is not perfect, so in
    quantum communication, imperfect quantum teleportation is normal. Decoherence
    is the cause of this type of imperfection. It also influences the quantum teleportation
    method as well as causes quantum entanglement and quantum distribution methods.
    Quantum communication suffers from ecological communications and loss of photons
    carrying qubits. Qubits are very fragile in nature, so at the time of interaction,
    some of the qubits are absolutely missing from the quantum environment [22]. Distribution
    of Entanglement—One of the major challenges for the quantum internet is the distribution
    of entanglement among different nodes present in the quantum network. It is a
    vital component of quantum mechanics. Entanglement swapping is a technique for
    dispersing the correlation between remote systems. In a quantum network, this
    technique helps to associate distinct nodes for long-distance communication. It
    is a key component of quantum cryptography as well as quantum computing and is
    very helpful for teleportation [23] (Fig. 48.3). Fig. 48.3 Entanglement swapping
    Full size image 48.4 Quantum Internet Protocol QKD and other protocols utilize
    quantum mechanics principles in quantum cryptography to build a secured cryptosystem
    [24]. Quantum cryptography is an entirely secure encryption process where secret
    information is exchanged between sender and receiver. Data replication or modification
    in quantum encryption is impossible because this method instantly alerts the sender
    and receiver. These protocols detect the existence of an eavesdropper in the cryptosystem
    who is trying to learn the key. So, this encryption provides secure communication
    and detects eavesdropping in an efficient manner. Bennett and Brassard invented
    quantum key distribution in 1984 [25]. QKD is the major key to providing secure
    communication in quantum networks. QKD is grounded on the elementary ideologies
    of no-cloning and the HUP theorem. QKD is a key sharing technology between two
    real users, ‘A’ and ‘B’. ‘A’ and ‘B’ are separated and want to send a confidential
    message without knowing the third party. So, quantum is added to this part. ‘A’
    and ‘B’ use entangled qubits to generate a unique encryption key. If hacker ‘E’
    tries to steal the key, the eavesdropping is detected immediately. In contrast
    to conventional cryptography, QKD uses principles of quantum mechanics to provide
    absolutely secured key cryptography. This type of method can detect the presence
    of a listener on the system trying to learn the key. In QKD, ‘A’ and ‘B’ have
    access to two communication channels, i.e., a private quantum communication channel
    that shares keys through the exchange of quantum particles and classical public
    communication that is shared, has error correction, and extension of privacy [26].
    In this way, the quantum internet ensures that quantum communication is more secure
    (Fig. 48.4). Fig. 48.4 Basic QKD model Full size image 48.4.1 BB84 Protocol Bennett
    and Brassard invented the BB84, based on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in
    1984. This is the most significant quantum protocol among other protocols [27].
    In the BB84 protocol as shown in Fig. 48.5, ‘A’ can provide an arbitrary secret
    key to ‘B’ by transferring photons. No-cloning theorem assures that the eavesdropper
    cannot measure the photons and sends them to ‘B’ without changing the photon’s
    state. Fig. 48.5 Flowchart of BB84 Full size image ‘A’ forwards a random state
    from {|0⟩, |0⟩, |+⟩, |−⟩}, each time B correctly guesses the basis, they receive
    a bit of the key. 48.4.2 Quantum Communication The most famous application of
    quantum internet is to use it for secure communication. Internet is the most crucial
    part of daily routine, and secure communication is the key objective in this period
    [28, 29]. So, secure communication means one sends the data to another one without
    any hazard. This security issue is resolved through cryptographic methods that
    secure the information with the help of a secret key. In quantum cryptography,
    no-cloning plays a vital part in ensuring the transferred data’s integrity and
    privacy. In classical communication, sender and receiver used common key encryption.
    This encryption is hard to break but not impossible. QKD offers a protected approach
    to enter in cloud systems using various protocols. Three key objectives are involved
    in quantum communications: safely delivering qubits across distances, creating
    shared entanglement across distances, and creating hidden and quantum-secured
    data [30]. So, a quantum computer promises to solve many issues much faster than
    a classical computer. The block diagram is shown in Fig. 48.6 [31]. Fig. 48.6
    Block diagram of quantum communication Full size image 48.4.3 Quantum Networks
    Incorporating a quantum communication system is now possible with a quantum network.
    Quantum networks use entanglement, superposition, and no-cloning properties, which
    are not present in classical networks. So, this network is inherently secure.
    It enables the parties to create long-distance quantum entanglement, which is
    useful for a variety of activities like creating multiparty-shared secrets whose
    security depends on distributed quantum computing and enhances sensing on encrypted
    data. Most of the time, quantum networks function similarly to classical networks
    [32]. But some specific issues can be resolved more effectively with it. The architecture
    of the quantum network is depicted in Fig. 48.7 [10, 31]. Fig. 48.7 Quantum network
    architecture Full size image 48.5 Comparative study between classical internet
    with quantum internet David Awschalom said, “The quantum internet represents a
    paradigm shift …”. Quantum networks enable information transmission through quantum
    bits between substantially isolated quantum systems [33]. Some elementary key
    differences between the traditional and quantum internet are listed in Table 48.1.
    Table 48.1 Elementary differences between the traditional internet and quantum
    internet Full size table 48.6 Summary of Related Works Jiajun Chen [31] covered

    applications of quantum communication, and the strengths and weaknesses of quantum
    networks. Ramakrishnan et al. [32] mainly focused on the quantum resources and
    architecture related to quantum computing. The review is based on circuits, photons,
    and the quantum repeaters engaged in a quantum internet. Singh et al. [29] presented

    switches, a very useful resource for communicating through quantum channels. Although

    48.7 Conclusion The paper accomplishes the fact that quantum computing is still
    in its initial stages. It is always an intriguing idea to combine quantum theory,
    physics, computational science, mathematics, and mechanics. The paper discusses
    the different areas of quantum computing, like quantum networks, quantum cryptography,
    quantum protocols, quantum communication, and quantum internet. Quantum internet
    has many applications that are impossible to explain on the classical internet
    today, although it can achieve many things in a more efficient manner. The main
    challenge in quantum internet is long-distance communication. Some quantum information
    is lost during the transmission process. To solve this issue, the quantum repeater
    enables entanglement swapping, which helps to associate discrete nodes for long-distance
    communication. However, there still remain some more challenges and issues that
    need to be resolved. References Fagbolu, O.O.: Comparative analysis of classical

  description: As a result of technological growth, WSNs enable creative practical
    solutions for anything from basic communication to sophisticated applications,
    which are not confined to a particular domain. In addition to the advances, there
    is an ongoing issue concerning the frequent threats or attacks on WSNs. The sinkhole
    attack, which jeopardizes the accuracy and trustworthiness of information in a
    WSN, is one of the most devastating attacks. Moreover, WSN routing schemes are
    extremely vulnerable to sinkhole attacks. To address the security challenges faced
    by WSNs, timely and reliable intrusion detection is of utmost importance. In this
    paper, a novel intrusion detection scheme, called Time Synchronized Multivariate
    Regressive Convolution Deep Neural Network Model (TSMR-CDNN), is introduced for
    sinkhole attack detection. TSMR-CDNN incorporates a reverse time synchronization
    scheme for its potential to provide precise clock skews and offsets, effectively

    a result of technological growth, WSNs enable creative practical solutions for
    anything from basic communication to sophisticated applications, which are not
    confined to a particular domain. In addition to the advances, there is an ongoing
    issue concerning the frequent threats or attacks on WSNs. The sinkhole attack,
    which jeopardizes the accuracy and trustworthiness of information in a WSN, is
    one of the most devastating attacks. Moreover, WSN routing schemes are extremely
    vulnerable to sinkhole attacks. To address the security challenges faced by WSNs,
    timely and reliable intrusion detection is of utmost importance. In this paper,
    a novel intrusion detection scheme, called Time Synchronized Multivariate Regressive
    Convolution Deep Neural Network Model (TSMR-CDNN), is introduced for sinkhole
    attack detection. TSMR-CDNN incorporates a reverse time synchronization scheme
    for its potential to provide precise clock skews and offsets, effectively reducing
    detection delays. The Broken-stick regression method is applied for the analysis
    of multivariate data such as clock features, RSSI, LQI, and energy by setting
    the threshold value, for enhancing its detection capabilities. The steepest gradient
    function is used to update the weight parameter in order to reduce the false positive
    rate. This approach minimizes the error rate, resulting in superior classification
    performance. The experimental results confirm that TSMR-CDNN outperforms the existing
    methods in terms of various metrics, and demonstrates 5% improvement in attack
    detection accuracy, 3% enhancement in precision, recall, and F-measure, and 10%

    14 March 2022 1 Introduction Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) refers to a particular
    class of ad-hoc networks made up of small sensor nodes that can perceive, analyze,
    and transmit data over a shared wireless channel [1]. In a WSN, sensors typically
    communicate wirelessly with a centralized base station (or head), transmitting
    the perceived data from a particular area. Deployment in open and unattended environments
    opens up the possibility of security attacks. This is because an insider is allowed
    to participate in the network and have complete access to all communications routed
    over the network, with the ability to alter, dampen, or eavesdrop on the contents
    [2]. This makes intrusion detection a critical task in WSNs to protect against
    security threats. Intrusion detection systems capable of detecting break-in attempts
    and protecting sensitive information from attackers are being devised by researchers.
    Machine learning (ML) approaches have become a common choice for building intrusion
    detection models due to their adaptability, scalability, and effectiveness in
    recognizing abnormal network behavior. These models are trained to identify intrusions,
    making them a valuable tool for enhancing WSN security. Common ML techniques used
    in WSN intrusion detection include Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random
    Forests, Neural Networks, and Clustering algorithms, among others [3]. Designing
    an efficient security system in WSNs and ensuring timely and accurate detection
    of intrusions within WSN is highly significant due to their unique constraints
    and deployment scenarios. Sinkhole attacks are among the most prevalent types
    of attacks [4]. Since it makes it easier for the attackers to carry out subsequent
    activities or some other attacks, it is a serious attack directed against the
    network layer. In an effort to completely disable the network’s functionality,
    adversaries try to influence traffic flows, latency, and other network aspects
    [5]. The identification of sinkhole attacks during data transmission is a significant
    problem because hostile attackers may get access to information from the data
    transferred through wireless channels. This underscores the significance of ongoing
    research and development efforts to address these challenges effectively. Among
    different attacks on WSNs, a sinkhole attack has the potential to hinder a network’s
    efficacy by enticing adjacent nodes with misleading information and facilitating
    the initiation of subsequent attacks [6, 7]. Sinkhole attacks can cause data packets
    to be discarded or manipulated as they transit through the hijacked node. With
    false routing path information, it draws nearby nodes and executes data forging
    or selective forwarding of data that passes through it. It can result in energy
    holes in WSNs by draining the energy of neighboring nodes, as well as unfair and
    sometimes harmful reactions based on erroneous data [8]. Although several methods
    to identify sinkhole attacks in WSNs have been presented in the literature, the
    accuracy and robustness of detecting a real attacker remain key issues. The efficacy
    of detection algorithms relies heavily on their accuracy in attack detection [9,10,11].
    Given the shortcomings of current solutions, it is crucial to devise new and enhanced
    methods that can identify attacks affecting WSNs in a more rapid and accurate
    manner. With this motivation, our research presents a novel intrusion detection
    model for sinkhole attack detection, called Time Synchronized Multivariate Regressive
    Convolution Deep Neural Network (TSMR-CDNN). The main objective of TSMR-CDNN is
    to enhance attack detection accuracy and legitimate node identification with minimum
    delay. TSMR-CDNN involves different attributes that, when combined, offer numerous
    advantages including improved attack detection accuracy, precise legitimate node
    identification, minimal detection delay, utilization of multivariate data for
    comprehensive analysis, reduced temporal complexity, and a lower false positive
    rate. These features collectively contribute to enhanced network security and
    intrusion detection in the context of sinkhole attacks. By using the convolution
    deep neural network with multiple layers for data processing, it can effectively
    differentiate between normal network behavior and malicious activities, resulting
    in higher detection accuracy. TSMR-CDNN is designed to minimize detection delay
    with the use of time synchronization mechanisms and precise clock skew information.
    In TSMR-CDNN, the reverse time synchronization mechanism is employed, considering
    that it can provide precise clock skews and offsets. The head node (i.e., base
    station) uses this to extract the sensor nodes’ clock characteristics and radio
    information. The model incorporates the utilization of multivariate data, including
    clock features, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Link Quality Indicator
    (LQI), and energy levels, for enhancing its detection capabilities. The estimated
    values are analyzed by applying Broken-stick regression, which uses threshold
    values to examine the multivariate data. In order to reduce the temporal complexity
    of attack detection, the Hardlimit activation function is subsequently applied
    to simultaneously identify legitimate nodes and detect sinkhole attacks. To minimize
    the false positive rate, the steepest gradient function is used in updating the
    weight parameter. This minimizes the error rate and leads to better classification
    results. Together, these attributes of TSMR-CDNN significantly strengthen network
    security and enhance intrusion detection capabilities, particularly in the context
    of countering sinkhole attacks. The major contributions of TSMR-CDNN are listed
    below. We propose a novel intrusion detection model called TSMR-CDNN to enhance
    the accuracy of sinkhole attack detection in WSN. We propose and employ the Reverse
    time synchronization mechanism to extract the clock skew features and radio information
    at the base station. We utilize the advantages of Broken-stick regression for
    analyzing the estimated features with the threshold value. To minimize the temporal
    complexity of detecting attacks, we adopt the Hardlimit activation function for
    identifying legitimate sensor nodes and detecting sinkhole attacks. We employ
    the Steepest gradient function for updating the weight parameters in order to
    minimize the false positive rate and to obtain the final better classification
    results. We perform extensive simulation analysis using different performance
    metrics such as attack detection accuracy, F-measure, recall, precision, and detection
    time. The remainder of the paper is split into the following sections: Sect. 2
    covers the related works. Section 3 details the TSMR-CDNN model. The detailed
    experimental setup and simulation analysis are presented in Sect. 4. Finally,
    Sect. 5 provides the concluding remarks. 2 Related Works Due to WSN’s constraints,
    it is difficult to mitigate security vulnerabilities, and as a result, several
    sorts of attacks are carried out to exploit WSN by attackers. To identify network
    attacks, several intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed. These
    methods often have to deal with the issue of inaccurate detection, either false
    positives or false negatives. Machine learning methods have been widely utilized
    for enhancing the efficiency of IDS-related aspects as well as adaptability. To
    accurately identify nodes and detect spoofing attacks, a node detection approach
    against spoofing attacks (NISA) was presented in [1]. Based on spatially correlated
    radio details, NISA enables defense against spoofing threats. Two types of NISA
    system implementation, referred to as central NISA and distributed NISA, respectively,
    were discussed. However, the computational complexity of attack detection was
    not improved by adopting a more advanced thresholding technique. For the detection
    of intrusions, a deep neural network based on a cross-correlation procedure to
    choose the best features was introduced in [2]. With this method, the model’s
    computational cost and data size are both reduced to the minimum. To identify
    the network intrusion, deep neural networks were deployed. However, it proved
    ineffective in improving the classification accuracy of the model. To guard against
    sinkhole attacks in the IoT ecosystem, an intrusion detection mechanism was devised
    in [3]. A strategy based on rich-resourced edge nodes was presented to identify
    sinkholes in IoT. When compared to earlier studies, the method improved false
    rate prediction by 0.37%. However, the time consumption of sinkhole attack detection
    was high. To guarantee data integrity during transmission, a lightweight and reliable
    technique was created in [4] based on the energy-effective WSN technique. The
    authors suggest a lightweight watermark technique that embeds the watermarking
    data using homomorphic cryptography and hash functions in addition to the sensor
    data. Energy usage, operational efficiency, delay, and packet delivery rate were
    all investigated. However, ML techniques were not implemented to detect the types
    of attacks in WSN transmission. A hop count-based detection approach was introduced
    in [5] to identify the consequences of sinkhole attacks. The performance was compared
    with Ibrahim’s algorithm. To evaluate the detrimental effects of the sinkhole
    attack, the ratio of packets delivered and the proportion of packets lost were
    also examined. The findings show that the functionality of the network is adversely
    affected by the sinkhole attack. The likelihood of detection and false positives,
    however, could not be precisely predicted. However, the set of rules was not specifically
    designed to detect the most common attacks, particularly in the case of sinkhole
    attacks. A specification-based mechanism for identifying intrusions based on the
    volume of input and output interactions was devised in [6]. In this work, the
    quantity of input/output transmissions gathered during the monitoring phase was
    used to establish rules utilizing an IDS specification-based method. Knowledge
    base rules were defined for normal functionality thresholds. Various guidelines
    were developed according to the contribution that every node makes towards increasing
    the sinkhole attack detection rates. However, the set of rules was not specifically
    defined to particularly detect sinkhole attacks. A novel mobile agent-based approach
    was introduced in [7] to identify and prevent sinkhole attacks based on the neighbors’
    reputation concept. In order to recognize and counteract sinkhole attacks, it
    makes use of each node’s trust score. To learn about the reputations of the nodes’
    neighbors, trust values are generated for each node. However, it failed to apply
    fuzzy logic to improve the detection of malicious nodes. It has not been demonstrated
    that the identification of malicious nodes has improved significantly. An artificial
    neural network model was developed in [8] for energy-based intrusion detection
    with lesser mean square error. Qualnet simulation was adopted to assess the network
    performance. The method uses an artificial neural network method to optimize the
    energy-based IDS. However, the amount of time required for the detection of intrusions
    was not reduced. An intrusion detection method was designed in [9] to protect
    the Edge-Based IoT environment against sinkhole attacks. A security study of the
    method is discussed to demonstrate its resistance to different sinkhole attacker
    variants. However, the detection of attacks with greater accuracy was a major
    challenging issue. The RFTrust model was developed in [10] to provide a lightweight
    solution for recognizing and eliminating sinkhole nodes based on trust parameters.
    By identifying and eliminating sinkhole nodes within the network, the method enhances
    trustworthy routing in the IoT context. A mathematical study is also presented
    to show the effectiveness of the method. A new detection technique was introduced
    in [11] against sinkhole attacks by measuring the Euclidean distance between sensor
    nodes and the head node. Though the technique enhanced the attack detection accuracy,
    the computation time was not reduced. An ML-based intrusion detection approach
    was developed in [12] for various types of attack detection. A new approach for
    the IoT-based WSN was developed in [13] for improving the network lifetime and
    stability using the association rule mining concept. However, the designed approach
    involves high computational complexity. An effective and safe data collection
    strategy for IoT was developed in [14]. But it was unable to handle deeper attack
    patterns. A compressive sensing-based encryption/decryption model was introduced
    in [15] using the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm for attack detection.
    But machine learning algorithm was not applied to enhance the performance of attack
    detection accuracy. A distributed denial-of-service attack detection model was
    proposed in [16] based on reoccurring spoofed ACK packets during the data transmission.
    A node authentication and spoofing detection method was developed in [17] using
    a machine learning approach for application in real-world WSN. In order to prevent
    the receiving end from becoming overloaded, it has been determined that a delay
    of 23 ms is the best. The findings showed that transmission session overload has
    an impact on DDOS success. However, the accuracy of attack detection was not improved.
    Artificial Intelligence algorithm was introduced in [18] for recognition and mitigation
    of wormhole attacks. However, better attack detection accuracy was not achieved.
    In [19], a multi-layer intrusion detection strategy was presented, utilizing a
    Naive Bayes classifier for making decisions on the examined packets in WSNs. However,
    it failed to improve the performance of a multi-layer intrusion detection model
    using deep learning techniques. For the purpose of identifying fraudulent nodes,
    [20] created a fuzzy-based reputation technique, which is subsequently optimized
    by applying an Artificial Bee Colony optimizer for spotting fraudulent nodes.
    To increase efficacy, the fitness function includes recommended deviation and
    interaction index deviation. According to simulation studies, even when the proportion
    of fraudulent nodes approaches 50%, the method retains a high rate of detection
    and an acceptable false-positive rate. However, it failed to examine the implications
    of dynamic thresholds and weights on the efficacy of the system. In [21], data
    encryption was employed within a smart irrigation system, underscoring the increasing
    need for robust security measures in the face of rising cyber threats. This strategic
    approach serves to fortify IoT security. However, the use of cryptographic algorithms
    adds overhead to the data packets, increasing their size. In resource-constrained
    IoT networks, this overhead can affect bandwidth utilization and data transmission
    efficiency. A hybrid encryption algorithm that combines ECC, RC4, and SHA-256
    was developed in [22]. This cryptographic fusion was devised to protect sensitive
    data within IoT-based irrigation systems, enhancing their overall security posture.
    However, ensuring compatibility between various IoT devices and platforms with
    different cryptographic algorithms can be challenging. Interoperability issues
    may arise if devices do not support the same encryption standards. [23] introduced
    a trustworthy and energy-efficient routing method for WSNs based on Fuzzy logic
    to determine the trustworthiness of various routes. This approach contributes
    to the reliability of data transmission. However, the performance and overhead
    in larger networks have not been adequately addressed. In the domain of mobile
    ad-hoc networks, [24] proposed a Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol aimed at
    quick identification of flooding attacks. This protocol not only identifies malicious
    actions but also imposes appropriate penalties and reevaluates the situation,
    adding a layer of security. However, the effectiveness of the protocol in handling
    a larger number of nodes and traffic loads are not evaluated. Moreover, the imposition
    of penalties and reevaluation of actions can introduce overhead that may affect
    network performance, especially in terms of latency. Harmony Search Algorithm
    (HSA) for the detection of faulty nodes was presented in [25]. Within this model,
    each memory vector in the HSA encompasses information regarding node energy and
    correlation between neighboring nodes’ data, facilitating the identification of
    problematic components within the network. Its performance with respect to different
    network settings and data traffic loads requires further investigation because
    implementing detection mechanisms that rely on memory vectors and correlation
    calculations can introduce additional computational overhead. In resource-constrained
    wireless networks, this extra overhead may impact the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption. Although several methods to identify sinkholes or other attacks in
    WSNs have been presented in the literature, the accuracy, rapidness and robustness
    of detection remain key issues. Given the shortcomings of current solutions, we
    propose TSMR-CDNN which offers advantages such as improved attack detection accuracy,
    precise legitimate node identification, minimal detection delay, utilization of
    multivariate data for comprehensive analysis, reduced temporal complexity, and
    a lower false positive rate. These features collectively contribute to enhanced
    network security and intrusion detection in the context of sinkhole attacks. 3
    Proposed TSMR-CDNN Model 3.1 Problem Formulation The WSN comprises an extensive
    number of low-powered and inexpensive sensor nodes. The basic characteristics
    of WSN make it subjected to numerous forms of attacks. Among the different types
    of attacks, the sinkhole attack is a type of attack in which the attacked node
    seeks to draw traffic from the network by delivering a fraudulent route update,
    which is then used to send false data to the head node. This is one of the adverse
    consequences of the sinkhole attack. Multiple nodes communicate with a single
    base station in an ad hoc network, hence the sinkhole only has to target the nodes
    near the head node rather than the network as a whole. For efficient detection
    of sinkhole attacks, we introduce a novel intrusion detection model called TSMR-CDNN.
    The different processes of the TSMR-CDNN model are discussed in the following
    sections. Fig. 1 Architecture of proposed TSMR-CDNN Full size image 3.2 System
    Model Reverse time synchronization scheme Time Synchronization in WSN is very
    important for basic communication because it provides the capability to detect
    movement, location, and proximity. In the time synchronization process, two parameters,
    i.e., (i) clock skew and (ii) offset represent the basic association between two
    hardware clocks. The accuracy in estimation is utilized for legitimate node detection
    based on the distinctiveness of hardware clocks. The reverse time synchronization
    scheme is employed for its ability to generate precise clock skews and offsets.
    The following definitions describe the clock skews between a sensor node’s hardware
    clock and the head node’s reference clock: $$\\begin{aligned} C_s=\\frac{C_H(S
    N)-\\omega _j}{t}-1 \\end{aligned}$$ (1) Therefore, $$\\begin{aligned} C_H(SN)=(1+C_s)t+\\omega
    _j \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where, \\( C_s \\) denotes the clock skews, C\\( _H \\)(SN)
    indicates the node’s hardware clock, t denotes the head node’s reference clock,
    \\( \\omega _j \\) indicates the offset between the two clocks. Received signal
    strength indicator (RSSI) A two-ray ground model is used to gauge the RSSI of
    the sensor node from the head node, as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} R S S I=\\frac{G_{t^*}
    * G_r * h_t^2 * h_r^2}{D^4} * P_T \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where, \\( G_t \\) and
    \\( G_r \\) represent the antenna gain of transmitter and receiver, \\( h_t\\)
    and \\( h_r\\) represent the height of transmitter and receiver antennas, the
    distance between the antenna of the transmitter and the receiver is denoted by
    D, and the transmitted signal power is denoted by \\(P_T\\). Link quality indicator
    (LQI) It is calculated by the head node to provide link quality information after
    the reception of every data packet. A greater LQI suggests a better connection
    quality and a lower rate of data loss, which are both connected to the reliable
    delivery of data packets. The LQI measurement is performed based on the packet
    reception ratio and RSSI value. $$\\begin{aligned} LQI=DP_{RR}\\times Norm(\\mu
    _{RSSI}) \\end{aligned}$$ (4) $$\\begin{aligned} Norm(\\mu _{RSSI})=\\frac{\\mu
    _{RSSI}}{60}+\\frac{100}{60} \\end{aligned}$$ (5) where, LQI denotes the Link
    quality indicator, DP\\( _{RR} \\) denotes the data packet reception ratio, \\(
    \\mu _{RSSI} \\) indicates the mean of RSSI, Norm denotes the normalization of
    \\( \\mu _{RSSI} \\). Energy of the sensor nodes (\\(E_{res}\\)): Energy is the
    other major parameter to enhance the network lifetime during the process of identifying
    attacks. Sinkhole attacks can result in energy holes in WSNs by draining the energy
    of neighboring nodes. \\( E_{res}\\) of a node is computed as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    E_{res}=T_E(SN)-Con_E(SN) \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where, \\(T_E(SN)\\) and \\(Con_E(SN)\\)
    denote the total and expended energy of the node, respectively. TSMR-CDNN Architecture
    diagram: The architecture diagram of the proposed TSMR-CDNN technique for attack
    detection and legitimate node identification for guaranteeing safe data transmission
    from source to head is presented in Fig. 1. The initial step involves providing
    the number of nodes to the input layer of a Convolutional Neural Network. Subsequently,
    the input is passed to the convolutional layer, where a linear mathematical operation,
    known as convolution, is performed. First, each node in the network sends it information
    to the head of the WSN. In the max-pooling layer, the reverse time synchronization
    process is applied after the reception of node packets by the head node. Using
    this, the head node retrieves the clock features and radio information of each
    node. The radio information includes metrics like RSSI and LQI. Additionally,
    the energy levels of the nodes are estimated. After estimating these values, they
    are directed to the fully connected layer of the network. In this layer, Broken-stick
    regression is applied to analyze the multivariate data (clock features, RSSI,
    LQI, energy) by setting the threshold value. Then the Hardlimit activation function
    is applied to simultaneously perform legitimate node recognition and detection
    of sinkhole attacks, which effectively reduces the time complexity of attack detection.
    Finally, the output layer reveals highly accurate results for the classified nodes
    and detected sinkhole attacks. TSMR-CDNN and other contemporary methods are evaluated
    using several performance criteria. These metrics include attack identification
    accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure, and time complexity. 3.3 TSMR-CDNN Algorithm
    Design The proposed deep neural network is a feed-forward model that generates
    the output classification results from a set of inputs. A number of layers, including
    an input, an output, and several hidden layers, constitute the proposed classifier.
    Each layer in the classifier contains individual units known as artificial neurons.
    These neurons are interconnected, with each neuron in one layer directly connected
    to neurons in the subsequent layer. The first layer, known as the input layer,
    receives the input, which in this case is the number of sensor nodes, SN= {\\(SN_1,
    SN_2, SN_3,\\ldots , SN_n\\)}, and one sink node SK deployed in the WSN. The last
    layer is the output layer. It has two units to provide the network outputs as
    sinkhole attacks and legitimate node identification. Between the input and output
    layers, there are two or more hidden layers. These hidden layers consist of a
    convolutional layer, a max-pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. The computational
    process is performed in the hidden layers. TSMR-CDNN scheme is scalable for handling
    a large number of WSN nodes due to its architecture, which is designed to efficiently
    extract and process features from multivariate data more efficiently through the
    use of a Broken-stick regression approach. The proposed Convolution Deep Neural
    Network Model with multiple layers, including convolutional layers and pooling
    layers is capable of concurrent data processing. In the context of WSNs, each
    sensor node’s data can be treated as a separate input, and the model can process
    multiple inputs concurrently, allowing it to handle a large number of nodes without
    a significant increase in computation time. The use of the steepest gradient function
    for updating the weight parameters helps in minimizing the errors, making it more
    efficient and scalable. All these features make TSMR-CDNN a suitable choice for
    the efficient detection of sinkhole attacks in extensive WSN deployments. 3.3.1
    Input Layer The first layer is the input layer which receives the input. Initially,
    a number of sensor nodes, SN= {\\(SN_1\\), \\(SN_2\\), \\(SN_3\\),..., \\(SN_n\\)},
    and one sink node SK are passed as input to the input layer of the convolution
    deep neural network. 3.3.2 Convolution Layer After that, the input is fed into
    the convolution layer, which performs a linear mathematical operation that involves
    the product of a set of weights with the input sensor nodes. $$\\begin{aligned}
    X=\\sum _{i=1}^{n} \\sum _{j=1}^{m}(SN_i\\times \\theta _j)+B \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) where, X indicates the convolutional layer output, \\( \\theta _j \\) denotes
    the weight, \\(*\\) indicates a numerical operator called a convolution, B denotes
    the bias with value equal to 1. To start with, every node within the network sends
    the sensed data to the head node of the WSN. 3.3.3 Maxpooling Layer Within the
    max-pooling layer, as the sensed information from the sensor nodes reaches the
    head node, a process is initiated to retrieve the clock characteristics and radio
    details. To extract clock features, a reverse time synchronization mechanism is
    employed, allowing the head node to gauge the clock skews of the sensor nodes.
    Then the radio details of the sensor nodes such as the RSSI, LQI, and E\\( _{res}
    \\) are obtained using the Eqs. 3–6. The estimated values are supplied to the
    fully connected layer, which performs parameter analysis to identify the legitimate
    and attack nodes. 3.3.4 Fully Connected Layer In this layer, the Broken-stick
    Regression technique is employed to assess the estimated parameters. Broken-stick
    Regression is a machine learning strategy used to assess independent variables,
    which in this case are the sensor nodes. The analysis is based on multivariate
    data, including clock features, RSSI, LQI, and energy levels. By setting a threshold
    value, the technique helps to identify patterns and relationships within the data,
    enabling the classification of sensor nodes as either legitimate or potentially
    involved in a sinkhole attack. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} Y=(C_s>avg\\_C_s(SN_L)\\
    \\& \\& \\ (RSSI>T_{RSSI})\\ \\& \\& \\ \\\\ (LQI>T_{LQI})\\ \\& \\& \\ (E_{res}>T_{E_{res}}))
    \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (8) where Y denotes the output of the Broken-stick
    regression, \\(T_{RSSI}\\), \\(T_{LQI}\\), and \\(T_{E_{res}}\\) indicate the
    threshold of the RSSI, LQI and \\(E_{res}\\), respectively, and \\(avg\\_C_s(SN_L)
    \\) denotes the average clock skew value of the legitimate sensor node. The analyzed
    results are then passed to the Hardlimit activation function, which allows the
    output neuron to produce a result equal to 1 if the input attains a threshold;
    otherwise, it outputs a result equal to 0. $$\\begin{aligned} f={\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}
    1, &{} \\text {legitimate node} \\\\ 0, &{} \\text {illegitimate node (sinkhole
    attack)} \\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$ (9) where f represents the outcomes
    of the Hardlimit activation function. When the value of f is 1, it signifies that
    the estimated parameter value exceeds the threshold. Otherwise, Hardlimit activation
    function returns 0. In this classification scenario, the output value of 1 denotes
    legitimacy, while the output value of 0 represents classification as a sinkhole
    attack node. With the classification results of normal and attack nodes, space
    complexity for accurate data storage and time is reduced. Error rate (ERR) textitestimation:
    After the classification process, the error rate is computed based on the actual
    and predicted results. $$\\begin{aligned} ERR=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum _{i=1}^{m}[(Act)-(Pred)]^2
    \\end{aligned}$$ (10) where m represents the number of observations. ERR is measured
    as the square of the difference between the actual (Act) and predicted (Pred)
    outcome of the activation function. To minimize the error, the node weight is
    updated with respect to the current error value. The steepest descent is applied
    for updating the weight of the sensor nodes. $$\\begin{aligned} \\theta _j(t+1)=
    \\theta _j(t)-L\\left[ \\frac{\\partial ERR}{\\partial \\theta _j} \\right] \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) where, \\( \\theta _j(t+1) \\) is the new weight, \\( \\theta _j \\)(t) indicates
    the current weight, L denotes the learning rate, and \\( \\frac{\\partial ERR}{\\partial
    \\theta _j} \\) represents the first-order derivative to determine the function’s
    local minima (that is, error rate) by updating the current weight w. 3.3.5 Output
    Layer Ultimately, at the output layer, accurate data classification results are
    achieved by minimizing the error. Algorithm 1 Time Synchronized Multivariate Regressive
    Convolution Deep Neural Network Classification Full size image 3.3.6 Description
    of TSMR-CDNN Algorithm The pseudocode of TSMR-CDNN algorithm is provided in Algorithm
    1. The step-by-step procedure for achieving accurate normal node identification
    and attack detection while minimizing time consumption using TSMR-CDNN model is
    detailed as follows. The number of sensor nodes is given to the input layer [Steps
    1–2]. After that, the input is sent to the convolution layer, where the input
    is convolved with the set of weights and summed with bias [Steps 3–5]. Each node
    delivers the sensed data to the head [Step 6]. For each received data packet,
    the base station extracts the clock features, RSSI, LQI, and energy in the maxpooling
    layer [Steps 7–12]. The estimated results are sent to the fully connected layer,
    where the regression analysis is executed to classify the sensor nodes [Steps
    13–14]. Then the activation function is applied to classify the legitimate node
    or attack based on the regression analysis [Steps 16–20]. After that, the error
    is computed for each predicted output. In order to minimize the error, the steepest
    descent is employed for updating the weight values. This process is iterated until
    it reaches the minimum error [Steps 21–26]. Ultimately, accurate classification
    results are obtained at the output layer. 4 Simulation Analysis Here, we present
    the results of our simulations and conduct a comparative analysis of the TSMR-CDNN
    technique with existing NISA [1] and DNN [2] methods. The simulations were carried
    out using the NS2.34 simulator. A WSN area of dimension 1100 m \\(\\times \\)
    1100 m containing a count of 50–500 mobile nodes was considered in the simulation.
    Sinkhole nodes account for 15–20% of the total number of nodes in the network.
    The performance of the TSMR-CDNN in sinkhole attack recognition was analyzed using
    the AODV routing protocol. To study the impact of node mobility, the speed of
    the mobile nodes was varied from 0 to 20 m/s. The random waypoint mobility model
    was chosen for simulating the movement of the nodes. Table 1 provides the used
    parameters in simulation. Table 1 Simulation parameters Full size table Next,
    we discuss the performance analysis of TSMR-CDNN and existing NISA [1], and DNN
    [2] methods with respect to different parameters that include (1) Attack detection
    accuracy, (2) Precision, (3) Recall, (4) F-measure, and (5) Attack detection time,
    as follows: 4.1 Attack Detection Accuracy Results Accuracy (ADA) is calculated
    by taking the ratio of the number of nodes that are correctly classified as either
    legitimate or attacked to the total number of nodes present in the network (Table
    2). ADA is measured in percentage (%), and is determined as below: $$\\begin{aligned}
    ADA=\\frac{TRP+TRN}{TRP+FLP+TRN+FLN}\\times 100 \\end{aligned}$$ (12) where, TRP
    denotes true positives, TRN indicates true negatives, FLP represents false positives,
    FLN denotes false negatives. Table 2 Comparison of attack detection accuracy Full
    size table Fig. 2 Attack detection accuracy results Full size image Figure 2 demonstrates
    the performance analysis of attack detection accuracy with respect to varying
    number of nodes in WSN. The attack detection accuracy is measured for the three
    methods, TSMR-CDNN and existing NISA [1] and DNN [2]. Among the three methods,
    the proposed TSMR-CDNN achieved higher attack detection accuracy than the other
    methods. Let’s consider a network scenario where we have a total of 50 nodes.
    By applying TSMR-CDNN, the accuracy was observed to be 94% and the accuracy of
    existing NISA and DNN were 86% and 90%, respectively. Similarly, different performance
    outcomes are obtained for all approaches when the number of nodes is varied. According
    to the average of 10 results, the attack detection accuracy was increased by 6%
    and 4% when compared to NISA and DNN, respectively. This is because the proposed
    TSMR-CDNN technique uses Broken-stick regression for analyzing the clock characteristics
    and radio details such as the RSSI, LQI, and energy of nodes by means of threshold
    values. The Hardlimit activation function is applied to simultaneously perform
    legitimate sensor node identification and sinkhole attack detection. This resulted
    in better performance of TSMR-CDNN. 4.2 Precision Results Precision is determined
    in terms of the true positives and false positives in the legitimate or attack
    node classification, as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} PRE=\\frac{TRP}{TRP+FLP} \\times
    100 \\end{aligned}$$ (13) where PRE is the precision, which is expressed as percentage
    (%). TRP denotes true positives, and FLP indicates false positives, respectively
    (Table 3). Table 3 Comparison of precision Full size table Fig. 3 Precision results
    Full size image Figure 3 depicts the simulation results in terms of precision
    with respect to the three different methods, namely TSMR-CDNN, NISA and DNN. The
    performance outcomes for precision are higher using TSMR-CDNN technique than the
    existing methods. With simulation conducted using 50 sensor nodes, the precision
    was observed to be 95.45% for TSMR-CDNN, and 89.74% and 92.85% using NISA and
    DNN, respectively. Improved result for TSMR-CDNN indicates that all the sensor
    nodes are accurately classified to obtain higher true positive results and lesser
    false negative results. Finally, after averaging the results from ten experiments,
    it was observed that the precision performance of TSMR-CDNN showed a significant
    improvement of 4% than the NISA method and 2% than the DNN method. These findings
    suggest that the TSMR-CDNN approach is more effective in accurately identifying
    and classifying nodes, resulting in a higher precision rate when compared to the
    existing NISA and DNN. With this method, the true positive rate is enhanced by
    applying a convolutional deep neural network classifier for analyzing the clock
    features and radio information by applying the regression function. The use of
    the steepest descent algorithm minimized the last square error and resulted in
    a reduction of the false positive rate. 4.3 Recall Results Recall is determined
    in terms of true positives and false negatives in the legitimate or attack node
    classification, as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} REL=\\frac{TRP}{TRP+FLN}\\times
    100 \\end{aligned}$$ (14) where, REL denotes the recall (expressed in percentage
    (%)). TRP denotes true positives, and FLN indicates false negatives (Table 4).
    Table 4 Comparison of recall Full size table Fig. 4 Recall results Full size image
    Figure 4 demonstrates the performance results of recall under varying number of
    sensor nodes. The performance in the recall rate is found to be relatively higher
    using the TSMR-CDNN technique upon comparison with NISA and DNN. This is proved
    through the statistical assessment. For the initial simulation, we consider a
    network setup consisting of 50 sensor nodes. The performance of recall was observed
    to be 97.67%, 92.10%, and 95.10% by applying TSMR-CDNN, NISA, and DNN, respectively.
    According to the comparative results, the recall results of TSMR-CDNN is enhanced
    by 3% and 2% than NISA and DNN, respectively. This is because TSMR-CDNN uses Hardlimit
    activation function to classify the normal or attacks; and accurately provides
    the labels, which improves the true positives and reduces the true negative results.
    4.4 F-Measure Results By taking the average of precision (PRE) and recall (REL),
    the F-measure provides a comprehensive evaluation of the system’s ability to classify
    and identify nodes accurately (Table 5). It is expressed in % and is calculated
    as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} F-ME=\\left[ 2 \\times \\frac{PRE \\times REL}{PRE+
    REL} \\right] \\times 100 \\end{aligned}$$ (15) Table 5 Comparison of F-measure
    Full size table Fig. 5 F-measure results Full size image Figure 5 reveals the
    F-measure results under different number of sensor nodes. F-measure is calculated
    according to the precision and recall performance during the classification process.
    From the observed simulation results, F-measure was found to be 96.54% using the
    TSMR-CDNN technique, 90.90% using NISA, and 93.97% using DNN. From the result,
    it is evident that the F-measure performance of TSMR-CDNN is considerably improved
    than the other compared methods. By applying TSMR-CDNN technique, the performance
    in terms of precision as well as recall is significantly improved during the node
    classification process. This improved the F-measure results using the TSMR-CDNN
    technique. The overall performance results indicate that the F-measure using TSMR-CDNN
    technique is considerably improved by 4% than NISA and 2% than DNN, respectively
    (Table 6). $$\\begin{aligned} ADT=\\sum _{i=1}^{n}SN_i \\times T(CSN) \\end{aligned}$$
    (16) Fig. 6 Attack detection time results Full size image Table 6 Comparison of
    ADT results Full size table 4.5 Attack Detection Time Results The overall attack
    detection time (ADT) refers to the time taken by the algorithm to predict the
    classification results for legitimate and attack nodes. It is an important metric
    to assess the efficiency and speed of the algorithm in detecting attacks. It is
    computed based on the number of sensor nodes (n) and the time (in milliseconds)
    it takes to classify each sensor node (T(CSN)). The formula is as follows: Figure
    6 reveals the graphical depiction of sinkhole attack detection time using the
    three methods, TSMR-CDNN, NISA, and DNN, respectively. From the figure, we can
    infer that there is a positive correlation between the number of nodes and the
    time consumption for node classification. As the number of nodes increases, the
    time required for classifying each node also increases. During the simulation
    with 50 sensor nodes, the TSMR-CDNN algorithm demonstrated an attack detection
    time of 17.5 ms. On the other hand, the NISA algorithm took approximately 22 ms
    for overall attack detection, while the DNN algorithm took around 20 ms. It is
    revealed from the results that the sinkhole attack detection time using TSMR-CDNN
    was reduced by 13% and 7% when compared to NISA and DNN, respectively. The improvement
    is due to the measurement of the clock characteristics and radio details of the
    nodes. The features extracted from the nodes are subjected to a regression process
    to analyze and accurately classify the nodes as either legitimate or sinkhole
    attack nodes. This helps to minimize the attack detection time. 5 Conclusion The
    paper introduces a novel intrusion detection model named TSMR-CDNN for the identification
    of legitimate nodes and the detection of sinkhole attacks in WSNs. The model utilizes
    clock characteristics and radio details to effectively differentiate between legitimate
    nodes and nodes involved in sinkhole attacks. Upon receiving data packets from
    the nodes, the clock features and radio information of each node are estimated
    within the maxpooling layer. These estimated features are then analyzed using
    the regression function and a threshold value to determine if a node is legitimate
    or part of a sinkhole attack. The activation function classifies the node based
    on minimal error. To evaluate the performance of TSMR-CDNN, a comprehensive simulation
    assessment is conducted, considering different number of sensor nodes. The statistical
    analysis of the results confirms that TSMR-CDNN outperforms the existing methods
    in terms of attack detection accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure, and detection
    time. The results reveal that TSMR-CDNN exceeds the existing methods with a 5%
    improvement in attack detection accuracy, a 3% enhancement in recall, precision,
    and F-measure, and a 10% reduction in attack detection time, respectively. The
    proposed model demonstrates higher accuracy and efficiency in identifying normal
    nodes and detecting sinkhole attacks, making it a promising solution for intrusion
    detection in WSNs. In the future, our focus will be on further minimizing attack
    detection time by improving data classification. Our future efforts will also
    extend to addressing data classification challenges with reduced complexity at
    the early stages of development. Data availability: N/A References Huan, X., Kyeong,

  description: The Critically Endangered Cantor’s giant softshell turtle Pelochelys
    cantorii is a freshwater turtle found in South and Southeast Asia. Its population
    is declining because of habitat destruction and alteration, and hunting for its
    meat. Data on the species’ ecology, behaviour, population size, distribution and
    threats are limited, and previous surveys undertaken in India have failed to detect
    individuals in the wild. This lack of data hinders strategic conservation planning.
    Ecologists and conservationists increasingly utilize local ecological knowledge
    to determine the status and gain insights into the ecology of threatened and rare
    species that are difficult to detect in field studies. To examine the historical
    and current occurrence of Cantor’s giant softshell turtle, we conducted community
    interviews along the Chandragiri River in Kerala, India. With data from these
    interviews, we identified multiple sites where the species continues to occur.
    Older respondents and those that used the river for fishing and irrigation were
    more likely to report sightings of the species. Our findings also improved knowledge
    about the turtles’ seasonal and diel activity patterns. A network of key informants
    identified through the interviews provided information on turtle bycatch, sightings
    and nesting. This network is being utilized for the continued monitoring of the
    species and could help in devising evidence-based management strategies for softshell
    turtles in India. These methods can also be adopted more widely for other threatened
    species of freshwater turtles globally.

    Introduction Cantor''s giant softshell turtle Pelochelys cantorii (Gray 1864)
    is a Critically Endangered yet widely distributed freshwater turtle in South and
    Southeast Asia (Bour, Reference Bour, Balian, Lévêque, Segers and Martens 2008;
    Das, Reference Das 2008; Choudhury et al., Reference Choudhury, Das, Horne, Li,
    McCormack and Praschag 2021). The species belongs to the family Trionychidae,
    which comprises highly aquatic and predominantly carnivorous turtles (Praschag
    et al., Reference Praschag, Hundsdörfer, Reza and Fritz 2007), with a wide variation
    in size amongst species (Fitch & Plummer, Reference Fitch and Plummer 1975). Being
    mainly scavengers, softshell turtles are important for freshwater ecosystems because
    they help maintain water quality and trophic webs (Fitch & Plummer, Reference
    Fitch and Plummer 1975; Ali et al., Reference Ali, Javid, Hussain and Bukhari
    2018; Lovich et al., Reference Lovich, Ennen, Agha and Gibbons 2018). Natural
    predation of P. cantorii individuals and eggs is not documented, and adult individuals
    can become apex consumers with no natural predators (de Miranda, Reference De
    Miranda 2017). However, jackals, wild boars, monitor lizards and feral dogs have
    been observed to predate the eggs and juveniles of other large softshell turtles
    (Palot & Radhakrishnan, Reference Palot and Radhakrishnan 2004). Pelochelys cantorii
    is an Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species, meaning
    it is a global priority for conservation (Gumbs et al., Reference Gumbs, Gray,
    Böhm, Hoffmann, Grenyer and Jetz 2020) because of its disproportionate contribution
    to phylogenetic diversity and high risk of extinction according to the IUCN Red
    List. It is also listed in Appendix II of CITES, limiting its trade. The species
    is legally protected in many countries, including Viet Nam, Myanmar, the Philippines
    and China. In India, the species is listed under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife
    (Protection) Act, 1972. Hunting or trade of species listed in Schedule I is an
    offence punishable with penalties and/or imprisonment. However, management of
    freshwater fauna, especially outside protected areas, is insufficient in India
    (Raghavan et al., Reference Raghavan, Das, Nameer, Bijukumar and Dahanukar 2016).
    Law enforcement is generally weak outside protected areas because of limited availability
    of resources (Aiyadurai et al., Reference Aiyadurai, Singh and Milner-Gulland
    2010; Milda et al., Reference Milda, Ramesh, Kalle, Gayathri and Thanikodi 2020).
    Additionally, population management and the planning and implementation of conservation
    interventions for P. cantorii are hampered because data on the species’ ecology,
    behaviour, population size, distribution and threats are limited. Most of our
    knowledge about the ecology and biology of P. cantorii has been obtained from
    captive populations in China (Chen et al., Reference Chen, Zhou, Peng, Huang and
    Chen 2013; Xinping et al., Reference Xinping, Xiaoyou, Jian, Jianhua and Zicheng
    2015; Zhang et al., Reference Zhang, Li, Zhao, Chen and Zhu 2016, Reference Zhang,
    Li, Zhao, Chen and Zhu 2018; Xiaoyou et al., Reference Xiaoyou, Xiaodan, Chen,
    Xiaoli, Jian, Quanbo and Xinping 2019). Information gathered from the few existing
    records of the species in the wild suggests that it prefers aquatic habitats,
    including lakes, rivers, estuaries and coastal areas (Das, Reference Das 2008).
    In India, only 15 records of P. cantorii have been published since 1970 (Jain
    et al., Reference Jain, Cavada-Blanco, Palot, Das, Deepak and Das 2021), many
    of which are anecdotal or refer to bycatch. Only a few surveys of the species
    have been carried out, and these failed to document its presence (Sirsi, Reference
    Sirsi 2010; Behera et al., Reference Behera, Panda, Dutta and Nayak 2019). Although
    these studies could suggest local extirpation, the lack of records may also be
    a result of the turtle''s elusive behaviour that reduces detection probability
    when using traditional ecological survey methods. Cantor''s giant softshell turtle
    is a highly aquatic species that spends extended periods buried in the sand at
    the bottom of water bodies (Behera et al., Reference Behera, Panda, Dutta and
    Nayak 2019; Xiaoyou et al., Reference Xiaoyou, Xiaodan, Chen, Xiaoli, Jian, Quanbo
    and Xinping 2019), rendering baited traps ineffective for detecting these individuals
    (Sirsi, Reference Sirsi 2010). Similarly, detection probabilities using visual-based
    survey methods tend to be low unless previous knowledge suggests the species occurs
    in the surveyed area. Because of these difficulties, gathering baseline information
    about P. cantorii remains challenging, and making even basic plans for the conservation
    and management of wild P. cantorii populations is problematic at local, provincial
    and national levels. A possible solution is to utilize local ecological knowledge
    to gather crucial information on species status, occurrence records and extinction
    risk (Pan et al., Reference Pan, Wei, Cunningham, Li, Chen, Milner-Gulland and
    Turvey 2016). Local ecological knowledge accumulated by people over their lifetime
    has proven to be a useful tool for obtaining ecological information on globally
    threatened, rare and/or elusive species that cannot otherwise be acquired using
    traditional ecological surveys (Azzurro et al., Reference Azzurro, Moschella and
    Maynou 2011; Turvey et al., Reference Turvey, Fernández-Secades, Nuñez-Miño, Hart,
    Martinez, Brocca and Young 2014; Kanagavel et al., Reference Kanagavel, Parvathy,
    Tapley, Nirmal, Selvaraj and Raghavan 2020). This is a cost-effective approach
    that is particularly useful for obtaining data on easily identifiable, large and
    morphologically distinct species (Turvey et al., Reference Turvey, Fernández-Secades,
    Nuñez-Miño, Hart, Martinez, Brocca and Young 2014). To support the conservation
    of P. cantorii, we aimed to gather local knowledge on the species’ presence and
    ecology in Chandragiri River, Kerala, India. We used interview-based surveys to
    systematically record past sightings, information on hunting and data on the nesting
    ecology of the species. Through these interviews we also identified key informants
    and created an active network for the long-term local reporting and management
    of the species. Study area We conducted the study over a 63-km stretch of Chandragiri
    River in the Kasaragod district of Kerala, India. The Chandragiri River originates
    in the neighbouring state of Karnataka and flows west into Kerala for c. 110 km,
    with a total drainage basin of 957 km2 (Chandramohan & Balchand, Reference Chandramohan
    and Balchand 2007). The river supports permanent and temporary freshwater habitats,
    including streams, marshes and pools, before draining into the Arabian Sea, forming
    a tropical estuarine system supporting mangrove wetlands. Kerala experiences two
    monsoon seasons: the south-west monsoon during June–September and the north-east
    monsoon during October–November. The study area receives mean annual rainfall
    of 3,350 mm, most of which falls during the south-west monsoon (Diju & Thamban,
    Reference Diju and Thamban 2006). Temperatures are lower in the winter, during
    November–mid February, with a dry and warm season following that lasts until May.
    Kasaragod has 38 political divisions, called grama panchayats, which are further
    divided into 663 wards. A pilot study in four wards adjacent to Chandragiri River
    suggested that local knowledge of P. cantorii was influenced by whether people
    used the river for irrigation and/or subsistence fishing. As the communities residing
    close to the river tend to visit it frequently, we only targeted 40 wards adjacent
    to the river in six panchayats: Chemnad, Chengala, Muliyar, Bedadka, Karadka and
    Delampady (Fig 1). These panchayats jointly had a population of 1,851 people (952
    men/boys and 899 women/girls) above the age of 6 years (District Census Handbook,
    2011). In this area people predominantly follow Hindu (56%), Muslim (37%) or Christian
    (7%) religions, with smaller numbers of Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains. Fig. 1 Study
    area in Kasaragod district, Kerala, India, including the six panchayats along
    Chandragiri River where we conducted interview surveys to determine the historical
    and current presence of Cantor''s giant softshell turtle Pelochelys cantorii.
    Amongst the communities in the study area, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
    (according to Articles 341, 342, 366(24) and 366(25) of the Indian Constitution;
    Supplementary Material 1), comprise only 0.04% and 0.02% of the district population,
    respectively. The most frequently spoken language in Kasaragod is Malayalam, with
    a smaller number of people also speaking Tulu, Kannada, Konkani and Marathi (District
    Census Handbook, 2011). Methods Data collection We collected data during June–December
    2019 through semi-structured interviews. We initially identified interviewees
    using chain referral (snowball) sampling, followed by opportunistic sampling (Koerber
    & McMichael, Reference Koerber and McMichael 2008). We asked each interviewed
    respondent to recommend potential additional interviewees who were knowledgeable
    about P. cantorii. Most respondents just provided contact details of the referred
    individual(s), but on occasion the respondent accompanied us for the interview
    with the referred person. Once the snowball sampling approach provided no further
    interviewees, we employed opportunistic sampling to improve the representation
    of our sample. We identified people who lived close to Chandragiri River and were
    willing to be interviewed. We only interviewed one person per household, unless
    the family members had different information on turtle sightings. On approaching
    potential interviewees, we introduced ourselves and described the objectives and
    purpose of the project and the processes for data management. We then obtained
    free, prior and informed verbal consent to participate in the study. All interviewees
    were at least 18 years of age, and they could terminate the interview at any time.
    We did not share respondent names and personal information with anyone outside
    the research team. We conducted the interviews in Malayalam, with assistance from
    a local resident who acted as interpreter. One female and one male interviewer
    conducted interviews to reduce potential gender biases, and we carried out the
    interviews individually to avoid social desirability bias (Grimm, Reference Grimm,
    Sheth and Malhotra 2010) and to increase the likelihood of people sharing potentially
    sensitive information (e.g. on turtle hunting). Some respondents were willing
    to engage in longer conversations beyond the interviews, providing richer contextual
    information; we subsequently refer to them as informants. Interviews comprised
    14 items, including open- and close-ended questions. We designed the interviews
    to: document sightings of P. cantorii (both recent and historical) that we later
    verified whenever possible; document how local communities use the river; identify
    the seasonality of turtle sightings, bycatch and nesting activities; and establish
    trusting relationships on which to build an active monitoring network with local
    communities. We asked respondents to describe the appearance of P. cantorii (we
    used the vernacular name paala poovan as a prompt) and showed them pictures of
    turtle species including P. cantorii and various native and non-native softshell
    turtles (Nilssonia leithii, Chitra indica, Lissemys punctata, Apalone ferox),
    a sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) and a hardshell turtle (Melanochelys trijuga)
    for validation. In the event of erroneous identification by the respondent, we
    did not consider the interview data for further analysis. Whenever possible, we
    verified sightings by asking the respondents to provide photographic proof, visiting
    the sighting locations and/or corroborating the sighting through supporting interviews.
    Before concluding the interviews, we encouraged respondents to provide any other
    pertinent information about turtles that may not have been covered during the
    interview. To create an alert network and systematically document any future sightings,
    we asked all informants to contact a project team member in case of a P. cantorii
    sighting. Informants who agreed to be a part of the alert network are subsequently
    referred to as key informants. We contacted key informants frequently to update
    them on the progress of the project and to conduct informal discussions to obtain
    any new information on the species, including reports on bycatch, sightings, nesting
    or hunting. As a part of the alert network, we also asked key informants to invite
    other interested community members to join the network, irrespective of whether
    or not they had previously sighted the species. In cases of bycatch or nesting
    reports, a team of two or three people visited the site to rescue and release
    the turtle and/or safeguard the nests. We recorded all sightings and hunting reports
    in our database. We grouped the information obtained from the interviews into
    five broad themes: socio-demographic data, river usage and sighting information
    (year, month, season and time of day), habitat type (flowing water or deep isolated
    pool), information on nesting (nesting months, nest and/or egg reports, nest characteristics)
    and records of dead turtles (bycatch, hunting or other cause; Table 1). Within
    each theme, we coded open answers into categories in a post hoc manner to facilitate
    analyses. Table 1 Description of five themes included in the semi-structured interviews
    administered during June–December 2019 in six panchayats along Chandragiri River
    in Kerala, India (Fig. 1), regarding Cantor''s giant softshell turtle Pelochelys
    cantorii. Data analysis The same interpreter who conducted the interviews translated
    the interview responses into English. We used logistic regression to determine
    the effect of river use and respondent age on the probability of sighting P. cantorii
    in the study area. We used the glm function from the stats package in R 4.3.1
    (R Core Team, 2023) to run the binomial logistic regression. We performed model
    selection using the stepAIC function from the MASS package (Venables & Ripley,
    Reference Venables and Ripley 2002). We performed model diagnostics using the
    DHARMa package (Hartig, Reference Hartig 2022), to ensure that the data met the
    assumptions of linearity, homogeneity of variance and normality. We explored the
    associations between frequency of sightings and habitat, time of the sighting
    and seasonality using Fisher''s exact tests, having classified these nominal variables
    within two categories (‘seen’ and ‘not seen’; McDonald, Reference McDonald 2014).
    We coded responses regarding the time of year when sightings occurred into ‘dry
    season’ (January–May) and ‘monsoon season’ (June–December). When respondents were
    uncertain about the time of the year when they had seen the species, we excluded
    the response from the analysis. Similarly, we used two categories for time of
    day: ‘daytime’ (05.00–17.00) and ‘night-time’ (17:01–04:49). We considered sightings
    at different times from the same respondent as separate entries for the analysis.
    Use of Chandragiri River varied between different sections of the river and between
    communities, with most respondents using the river for one or more of the following
    activities: subsistence fishing, irrigation, bathing and washing (clothes and
    livestock). As with time of sightings, we accounted for different uses as separate
    data points for the binomial logistic regression. Results Demographics We completed
    150 interviews, with 93 of these interviews instigated via opportunistic sampling.
    Respondent age ranged from 20 to 89 years (median = 49 years; Fig. 2). We interviewed
    more men (71%, n = 106) than women (29%, n = 44), as in most cases the male member
    of the family volunteered to respond during opportunistic sampling. Such cultural
    aspects leading to gender bias in our dataset could not be avoided with our sampling
    design. Most respondents were farmers (45%), followed by homemakers (persons involved
    in housekeeping; 24%) and daily wagers (persons involved in manual labour, including
    construction work, harvest and other activities; 23%). Eight per cent of respondents
    had more than one occupation or were retired. Fig. 2 Relationship of the probability
    of Cantor''s giant softshell turtle Pelochelys cantorii sightings and respondents’
    age (Table 2) in the six surveyed panchayats in Kasaragod, Kerala, India (Fig.
    1). The grey area denotes the 95% CI. Table 2 Results of logistic regression of
    the probability of sighting Cantor''s giant softshell turtle with respondents’
    age (Fig. 2) and the usage of the river (subsistence fishing and irrigation) in
    the surveyed panchayats of Kasaragod, Kerala, India. Influence of river usage
    and respondent age on knowledge of the turtle A total of 86 interviewees reported
    using Chandragiri River for one or more purposes, mainly for irrigation (n = 67),
    subsistence fishing (n = 26), washing (n = 20) and bathing (n = 8). Most respondents
    did not list fishing as their occupation; however, 30% of river users (n = 26)
    reported subsistence fishing. Model selection showed that age, subsistence fishing,
    irrigation and bathing were the top predictors of sighting P. cantorii (Supplementary
    Tables 1 & 2). However, we removed bathing from the final model because it was
    not statistically significant and respondents using the river for bathing also
    used it for other activities (Supplementary Table 3). Respondents using the river
    for subsistence fishing and irrigation had a greater probability of sighting the
    turtle (Table 2) than those who only used the river for washing. The probability
    of having seen P. cantorii also increased with respondent age (Fig. 2): 76% of
    respondents aged 60 years and above reported direct observation of P. cantorii,
    compared to only 28% of respondents below the age of 30 years. Local ecological
    knowledge of P. cantorii Only three respondents failed the validation question
    and could not discriminate P. cantorii from the other turtle species. Nearly half
    (48%; n = 72) of respondents reported having seen P. cantorii at least once in
    their lifetime. Of these respondents, 68% (n = 49) reported having seen the turtle
    only once, and 32% (n = 23) reported having seen it more than once. Most respondents
    (n = 61) reported sightings during 2010–2019, with almost half (n = 30) reporting
    sighting the species in 2019 (Table 3). From these, multiple respondents reported
    sightings in the same pool in 2019, suggesting that the same individual may have
    been observed in multiple sighting reports. Most respondents who had observed
    P. cantorii (81%, n = 58) reported having sighted the turtle in the afternoon
    during 12.00–15.00. The results from the Fisher''s exact test also showed a statistically
    significant association between sighting of the species and time of the day (P
    < 0.001; Table 4), with the probability of sighting the species in the day being
    seven times higher than at night (odds ratio = 6.99, 95% CI = 3.73–13.62). We
    found no significant association between habitat type (isolated deep pools vs
    flowing rivers) and sighting of the species (P = 0.87, odds ratio = 0.89, 95%
    CI = 0.45–1.79). Table 3 Reported sightings of Cantor''s giant softshell turtle
    during 1970–2019 in the six surveyed panchayats of Kasaragod, Kerala, India. Table
    4 Fisher''s exact test results regarding the association between sightings of
    Cantor''s giant softshell turtle (seen and not seen) with habitat, time of the
    day and season in the six surveyed panchayats of Kasaragod, Kerala, India. Seasonality
    Sightings of P. cantorii were more frequent during the dry season (March–May),
    with 44% of all sightings (n = 32). There were eight reports of turtle sightings
    in the winter (November–February), only one respondent reported seeing the species
    during the south-west monsoon (in September), six reported sightings during the
    north-east monsoon (October–November), and more than one-third of respondents
    (n = 25) were unsure of when they had observed the turtle (Fig. 3). The results
    of the Fisher''s exact test showed that the probability of sighting an individual
    was 11 times higher during the dry season than during the monsoons (P < 0.001,
    odds ratio = 11.22, 95% CI = 4.37–32.96; Table 4). Fig. 3 The number of respondents
    (of a total of 72) who reported having sighted Cantor''s giant softshell turtle
    across different seasons in the six surveyed panchayats in Kasaragod, Kerala,
    India. The category ‘Unsure’ comprises reports for which respondents were not
    certain of the season when the turtle was sighted. Nesting Ten per cent (n = 15)
    of respondents provided information on the nesting behaviour of the species, and
    all agreed that nesting occurs on the riverbanks. Six per cent of respondents
    (n = 9) could provide information on the nesting period (November–May). Three
    respondents provided detailed information about the nests. They reported that
    nests are 30–40 cm deep and eggs are laid in a spiral-chain fashion. One respondent
    recounted seeing c. 100 round, soft eggs within a nest. Behaviour of P. cantorii
    Ten informants reported that the species does not bask during the daytime; however,
    individuals raise their head above the water surface to breathe for a few seconds
    and then go back into deep waters (c. 5–10 m). Six informants believed the species
    to be highly secretive and shy and that it only comes out onto the riverbank at
    night. Six informants reported seeing the turtle jumping out of the water like
    a porpoise during the dry season. These informants were from the same community
    and used the same section of the river, and this behaviour was not reported in
    the other wards. Hunting of P. cantorii Approximately 15% of respondents (n =
    23) reported catching the turtle at least once in their lifetime, and 13% (n =
    19) reported targeted hunting of the species. Fewer than 3% (n = 4) of the respondents
    reported catching it as bycatch. In 87% (n = 20) of all catch incidents, the captured
    turtle was either consumed or sold locally for consumption. In all catch instances
    (bycatch or targeted), the turtles did not die whilst in the fishing gear but
    were killed deliberately. Only on two occasions were turtles confiscated by the
    State Forest Department after being found dead. Five informants told us that they
    used to hunt the species c. 2–3 decades ago when it was more abundant (a perception
    shared amongst these informants). These five informants ranged from 45 to 72 years
    old (median = 61 ± SD 10 years). Four of these informants continued to use the
    river for subsistence fishing and irrigation. Alert network and its advantages
    We established a network from the respondent pool by identifying individuals with
    substantial information on the study species who were willing to be key informants
    in their locality. We called this the ‘alert network’, and it comprised 35 key
    informants who lived near the study area. The motivation behind creating a local
    alert network was to involve local communities in data collection and to create
    a sustainable, locally led monitoring network for the species. So far, the network
    has resulted in 24 calls reporting nine direct and indirect sightings, seven bycatch
    events and six P. cantorii nests during 2019–2022. All of the bycaught turtles
    were rescued and released back to the catch locations. The reports obtained through
    the alert network confirmed the presence of a breeding population and provided
    information on the nesting ecology of the species (Plate 1). Plate 1 (a) Adult
    Cantor''s giant softshell turtle Pelochelys cantorii bycatch and (b) hatchling
    from a nest reported by the alert network in Kasaragod, Kerala, India. Discussion
    In this study, we gathered information on the elusive P. cantorii from local ecological
    knowledge of communities living adjacent to Chandragiri River in Kasaragod District,
    Kerala, India. Whereas past studies struggled to gather data on the species using
    ecological survey techniques (Sirsi, Reference Sirsi 2010; Behera et al., Reference
    Behera, Panda, Dutta and Nayak 2019), our study recorded multiple sighting reports
    (Jain et al., Reference Jain, Cavada-Blanco, Palot, Das, Deepak and Das 2021)
    and critical ecological information, highlighting the importance of local ecological
    knowledge as a data source, and of community-based interviews to obtain such data.
    The data presented in our study will help to design future survey strategies for
    P. cantorii and to direct ongoing work to record ecological information that is
    critical for the species’ conservation. We found that only people who regularly
    use the river for subsistence fishing and irrigation were able to provide information
    on the species. This allowed us to establish an alert network and guide more effective
    collaboration with fishing and farming communities to facilitate long-term monitoring
    programmes for the species across this region. Our study establishes a framework
    for the use of this approach in other parts of the species’ range. Our results
    confirm the presence of P. cantorii at the study site and suggest that it could
    be rare in Chandragiri River, with fewer than 50% of respondents being aware of
    the presence of P. cantorii. Furthermore, key informants perceived that the population
    had declined in recent decades, with fewer reports of bycatch in the years preceding
    the survey. However, the information gathered through interviews shows that most
    sightings occurred during 2010–2019 and predominantly in 2019. This could be the
    product of bias or a skewed number of interviewees within the age groups. Recollection
    bias can render local ecological knowledge inaccurate or incomplete, as interviewees
    usually cannot perfectly recall past events (Hamilton et al., Reference Hamilton,
    de Mitcheson, Aguilar-Perera, Sadovy de Mitcheson and Colin 2012). Combined with
    a potential recency effect, by which interviewees mostly recall only the most
    recent past (Carothers et al., Reference Carothers, Brown, Moerlein, López, Andersen
    and Retherford 2014), this could have increased the frequency of reported sightings
    during the time just prior to the survey. As sightings of P. cantorii are relatively
    rare in the study area, respondents may only recall their most recent sighting(s).
    This bias was potentially increased by the news coverage of a mass die-off of
    fish within an isolated deep pool of Chandragiri River in May 2019 (Nair et al.,
    Reference Nair, Tholkudiyil and Shaji 2021). Although the lack of knowledge regarding
    the biology and ecology of P. cantorii limits our capacity to validate the information
    obtained from local people, we believe it is reliable. We gathered multiple corroborating
    accounts of bycatch, sightings and nesting, giving us confidence in the validity
    of the data. Another form of bias could have arisen from the local naming of the
    species. Pelochelys cantorii is known across the study area as paala poovan. This
    name derives from a local name for the flower of the species Tabernaemontana heyneana
    in Malayalam. According to local communities, the snout of this turtle species
    resembles the stigma of T. heyneana, and the white colour of the flower is equated
    to the white plastron of the turtle. A similar name of paale poo is used in the
    neighbouring state of Karnataka for Leith''s softshell turtle Nilssonia leithii
    (Sirsi, Reference Sirsi 2010). In the study area the name paala poovan is reportedly
    only used for P. cantorii; however, reporting bias could occur if respondents
    confuse the two species. We addressed this bias by asking the respondents to identify
    the species from the photographs of different turtle species, including N. leithii.
    Most informants reported that individuals of P. cantorii are frequently seen in
    deep pool areas, especially during the dry season. However, the Fisher''s exact
    test showed that sightings were independent of habitat type (isolated deep pool
    vs flowing river). It has been previously observed that the species inhabits deep
    pool areas in the Mekong River in Cambodia (Emmett, Reference Emmett 2009), and
    similar accounts were shared by the local communities in Odisha, India (Behera
    et al., Reference Behera, Panda, Dutta and Nayak 2019). It is unclear whether
    the species prefers one habitat type over the other or whether these observations
    can be attributed to habitat availability. Our results could be biased because
    of the small sample size used in the test. It is also possible that some respondents
    misinterpreted the question about habitat type (providing habitat information
    only relating to their most recent turtle sighting), and hence the data could
    be biased. In future surveys, focus groups with key informants could be used to
    address this issue. Our analysis suggests that there is a strong positive association
    between the dry season and sightings of P. cantorii. This could be influenced
    by the use patterns of the river and adjacent areas by respondents as well as
    seasonal changes that could alter sighting probability. Information from the interviews
    suggests that sightings of the turtle become more likely as the water begins to
    recede in mid December and increase further as the river level falls during the
    dry season. Contrasting with reports of sightings in estuarine habitats during
    the monsoons (Palot & Radhakrishnan, Reference Palot and Radhakrishnan 2011),
    respondents reported that it was rare to sight this species in the river or estuarine
    areas during the south-west monsoon. None of our key informants could provide
    information on the movement of P. cantorii during the monsoons, but some hypothesized
    that the species might move towards the sea or take refuge in deeper sections
    of the river. The surveys show that the species is seen mainly during afternoon
    hours. The turtles were always observed in the water and never basking on the
    riverbanks. Consequently, informants reported that the species only comes out
    onto the riverbanks at night. Reports of sightings during night-time were few,
    possibly because the study area is sometimes visited by elephants and therefore
    community members do not frequently visit the river at night. This could explain
    why most sightings were made during the afternoon in the study area. The nesting
    and breeding ecology of P. cantorii is poorly studied. It has been previously
    suggested that in India the species moves towards estuarine habitats during August–October
    to breed (Palot & Radhakrishnan, Reference Palot and Radhakrishnan 2011), but
    nesting has also been reported to occur during December–March (Behera et al.,
    Reference Behera, Panda, Dutta and Nayak 2019). Only a few of the informants in
    our study had any knowledge of the nesting ecology of P. cantorii. We also received
    contrasting information on the nesting period, with one informant reporting nesting
    during November–December, five reports of nesting during January–March and three
    reports of nesting during April–May. However, the key informants reported nesting
    of the species to have occurred consistently during January–February over 3 years
    (2020–2022). Our team has monitored these nests, confirming the nesting period
    of the species to be during January–February in Kerala (Jain et al., unpubl. data).
    Although local ecological knowledge provides essential insights into species ecology,
    there are limitations to this approach. Clarifying the purpose of each question
    in the interview is of paramount importance. If respondents misinterpret a particular
    question, it could change the information provided or introduce bias (Brook &
    McLachlan, Reference Brook and McLachlan 2005; Hamilton et al., Reference Hamilton,
    de Mitcheson, Aguilar-Perera, Sadovy de Mitcheson and Colin 2012). For example,
    when asked about the habitat preference of P. cantorii, most respondents only
    provided habitat information for their most recent sighting of the species. To
    address this, we collected information in an open-ended format, wherein respondents
    were given additional context for each question they did not fully understand.
    The interviewer''s level of familiarity with the respondents can also influence
    the responses (Brook & McLachlan, Reference Brook and McLachlan 2005), which was
    apparent in some cases during our study. We observed that respondents appeared
    more comfortable sharing information when we were accompanied by a local person
    who was familiar to them. Additionally, our sampling methods (snowball and opportunistic
    sampling) could have introduced selection biases. As the study area is culturally
    diverse and religiously demarcated, snowball sampling may have led to over- or
    under-representation of different groups depending on the initial interviewee
    who provided referrals. During opportunistic sampling we only targeted panchayats
    and areas close to Chandragiri River and assumed that communities distant from
    the river would be unaware of the species. This could have influenced our results
    and a more representative survey is required to address this potential bias. In
    the study area, P. cantorii is threatened by the consumption of its meat, despite
    its protected status and the penalties for hunting, trading and consuming the
    species. Although the species does not have any particular nutritional or medicinal
    benefit (Emmett, Reference Emmett 2009) and the quality of its meat is poor (Shepherd,
    Reference Shepherd 2000), in some places the meat of P. cantorii is believed to
    cure paralysis and dyspnoea (Rahman et al., Reference Rahman, Mamun, Rahman, Hossain,
    Minar and Maheen 2013). Our findings suggest that in the study area, the species
    is consumed only for its meat and only opportunistically, with such consumption
    having no associated cultural or medicinal values. It was notable from the interviews
    that the turtles, whenever caught, were either consumed or sold locally. However,
    these reports may not reflect the true levels of hunting and consumption, given
    that many respondents may have perceived the questions related to these activities
    as sensitive. Many studies have reported the consumption of P. cantorii meat (Das,
    Reference Das 2008), with a lack of awareness amongst local people (both communities
    and governing authorities) and inadequate enforcement of laws outside protected
    areas resulting in continued hunting of threatened turtles in India (Bhupathy
    et al., Reference Bhupathy, Choundry, Hanfee, Kaylar, Khan, Platt and Rashid 2000).
    The calls for turtle rescues made during our study through the alert network suggest
    that awareness amongst local communities regarding the species and its legal protection
    can reduce killing through bycatch or targeted hunting. In addition, proper training
    of forest officers and strict enforcement of existing laws could potentially reduce
    this threat (Choudhury, Reference Choudhury 2001). The importance of local knowledge
    for biodiversity monitoring has been increasingly recognized over the past 2 decades.
    Local ecological knowledge has provided valuable information regarding rare and/or
    possibly extinct species in cases where expensive ecological survey methods have
    been ineffective (Johannes et al., Reference Johannes, Freeman and Hamilton 2000;
    Turvey et al., Reference Turvey, Risley, Moore, Barrett, Yujiang and Xiujiang
    2013). For instance, local ecological knowledge has been key to determining the
    status of the Critically Endangered Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus
    (Pan et al., Reference Pan, Wei, Cunningham, Li, Chen, Milner-Gulland and Turvey
    2016; Turvey et al., Reference Turvey, Chen, Tapley, Liang, Wei and Yang 2021).
    Similarly, the information gathered from key informants in this study has provided
    critical information on P. cantorii nests and active nesting sites, considerably
    reducing the sampling effort in our ecological surveys. In combination with field
    surveys, local knowledge can also help with species assessments (Kanagavel & Raghavan,
    Reference Kanagavel and Raghavan 2012), and to identify key informants who can
    play a critical role in the long-term conservation of the species in the study
    area. The alert network established through our study initiated the first ever
    community-based plan directed at conserving freshwater turtles in India, through
    which people voluntarily report sightings, nesting information and bycatch of
    the species. These reports have enabled us to identify priority conservation areas
    and subsequently to identify threats to these priority areas, including illegal
    sand mining, construction of dams causing flooding of nesting grounds, and fishing
    and agricultural pressures, reinforcing the need for immediate conservation intervention
    (Jain et al., unpubl. data). The results of this study have enabled us, in collaboration
    with local governments, to conduct multiple training and awareness sessions (January
    2020, January 2021, March 2021) with the key informants on the rescue and safe
    release of bycaught turtles. We have also established helpline numbers for anonymously
    reporting hunting activity and inundated nests, and have initiated efforts to
    hire local community members to participate in nest protection programmes. These
    initiatives are ongoing in the study area, and we recommend that they are continued
    to ensure the long-term monitoring and conservation of the P. cantorii population.
    Establishing trust and shared knowledge between local communities and governments
    can be effective for managing threatened species outside protected area networks.
    Our study therefore demonstrates the importance and value of local ecological
    knowledge for understanding and addressing conservation issues for globally threatened
    and elusive species. Wide-scale incorporation of this approach to gathering ecological
    data on P. cantorii could fill knowledge gaps and help to reduce the extinction
    risk that this species faces. Author contributions Project conceptualization:

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming in the contemporary
    world has gained paramount importance while playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing
    agricultural practices [1]. Conversely, the increasing global population along
    with environmental challenges have made the adoption of smart farming techniques
    indispensable. By leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and precision agriculture,
    smart farming not only enhances productivity but also addresses the pressing need
    for sustainable resource management [2]. On the other hand, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has been a promising technology to provide connection among a large volume
    of devices that are deployed to provide a specific service for smart agriculture.
    A wide range of different use cases such as smart greenhouse monitoring, pest
    control, and irrigation/soil management can be considered [1], [3]. These use
    cases are mostly computation intensive and delay-sensitive [1], [4], [5]. A large
    volume of connected devices implies a large volume of data that must be processed
    accurately in a timely manner [6]. Such data computation and analysis demands
    a significant amount of processing and storage resources which put a constraint
    on energy-limited IoT devices. Depending on the specific application, the aggregated
    data from monitoring sensors, and captured images/videos from installed cameras
    in the field need to be processed in real-time to turn raw data into usable information.
    Introducing IoT and its applications in modern agriculture provides this industry
    with suitable tools to support farmers for better productivity, quality, and profitability
    [1]. Therefore, the scope of IoT extends beyond just agricultural land, encompassing
    a broader spectrum that includes the supply chain as well [7], [8]. Battery-operated
    IoT devices lack the capability to perform energy-intensive computations independently.
    Additionally, they face challenges related to limited processing power and storage
    capacity [9]. Therefore, MEC is proposed as a promising technology to address
    these limitations by offering additional computation and storage resources for
    IoT systems. This is achieved by providing servers where IoT devices can offload
    their computation tasks [10], [11]. On the other hand, large-scale agricultural
    operations often involve the distribution of IoT devices across expansive areas.
    In such scenarios, challenges may emerge concerning communication, particularly
    with issues related to the limited reachability between IoT devices and MEC infrastructure.
    To address these challenges, a proposed solution involves the integration of a
    network comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the capabilities
    of MEC [12], [13]. This approach aims to mitigate communication limitations stemming
    from the constrained transmission power of IoT devices and simultaneously improve
    network coverage. Due to the easy-to-deploy, cost-effective, and strong capabilities
    of the UAVs, UAV-aided MEC has attracted much attention and is widely utilized
    in smart agriculture to provide a high-quality line-of-sight (LoS) link to IoT
    devices [1], [3], [5], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The versatility and mobility exhibited
    by UAVs in response to changing weather conditions, alongside their straightforward
    deployment and economically viable maintenance costs, collectively establish UAVs
    as a proficient solution for supplying IoT devices with the necessary resources.
    Nevertheless, the UAVs themselves are quite often battery-powered which means
    their available energy is limited [6]. 1) Age of Information Besides energy, the
    freshness of information is another important aspect that needs to be considered
    in environmental monitoring and smart agriculture applications in which rapid
    protective and/or recovery actions are needed. Being more specific, within the
    realm of environmental monitoring applications and precision farming [18] in a
    UAV-aided MEC network, the IoT devices are strategically dispersed throughout
    specified regions to seamlessly gather real-time environmental data. Then the
    collected and pre-processed data by the UAVs finds its transmission route toward
    a localized MEC server; where a comprehensive analysis is conducted to facilitate
    the extraction of pertinent insights. These insights, in turn, play a pivotal
    role in fostering prompt agricultural decision-making and actions. The objectives
    can be the refinement of operations, the performance optimization, or the reduction
    of expenditure [1], [14], [19]. This expansion of smart agriculture’s scope ensures
    a secure and sustainable food supply chain, underpinned by contextual and situational
    awareness derived from real-time event processing [20]. Accordingly, such applications
    are characterized by their intensive computational demands and time-sensitive
    nature [1], [3], [5], [14], [18]. Concisely, the freshness of information becomes
    a critical factor that demands careful consideration. Packet delay and inter-delivery
    times, as two exemplary metrics that are commonly used to quantify the performance
    of real-time applications, are not adequate to represent the freshness of information
    received at the destination. Recently, age of information (AoI) has been proposed
    as a novel criterion to quantitatively evaluate the freshness of information [6],
    [17], [21]. For a flow of data packets, and with emphasis on the freshness of
    data at the destination, AoI is defined as the time elapsed from receiving the
    most recent packet belonging to that data-packet flow [22], [23]. 2) Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) From the above discussion, in the context of UAV-enabled
    smart agriculture paradigm – which constitutes the focal point of this paper –
    UAVs are confronted with a substantial amount of data necessitating prompt processing.
    This scenario embodies a dynamic computational framework wherein a bunch of processing
    functions demands seamless implementation across both the UAVs and the local server
    [20], [24], [25]. NFV is a key technology for implementing and managing computing
    machines in a reliable, efficient, and robust manner [26]. The NFV virtualizes
    the network functions (NFs) and abstracts them from the physical hardware, which
    enables rapid service function chaining (SFC) and service provisioning in UAV-aided
    MEC applications [27]. Considering the data-intensive and computation-based application
    of smart agriculture, multiple computing functions in the form of virtual network
    functions (VNF) should be deployed sequentially and orderly to provide the processed
    data for the final decision-making at the local MEC-server. Utilizing NFV significantly
    enhances the agility in deploying and managing network components and improves
    the robustness and scalability of networks [27], [28]. Therefore, a critical challenge
    to address is the optimal and efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions
    (VNFs) and determining how to route information packets among VNF components over
    the available NFV infrastructure, i.e., UAVs and the MEC server. The decision
    to distribute and allocate VNFs between both UAVs and the server, rather than
    solely on one of them, aligns with the primary goal of the proposed scheme—to
    minimize the Age of Information (AoI) while maintaining energy efficiency. Network
    traffic and the workload on both UAVs and MEC servers fluctuate over time, while
    changing channel conditions between the parties necessitate adjustments in the
    required communication resources for packet forwarding. Furthermore, certain processing
    functions, such as compression, may alter the packet size, so the trade-off of
    performing these functions locally and sending the smaller packets with spending
    fewer communication resources versus doing the entire processing locally becomes
    pivotal. Consequently, the placement must dynamically adjust to new conditions
    to ensure the minimization of AoI and energy efficiency [28]. In light of this,
    a general condition has been considered where the VNFO can, depending on network
    conditions (processing node resources, service type, and channel conditions),
    decide on the optimal placement to minimize AoI and energy consumption. The work
    presented in [24] is a use-case of the practical implementation of smart agriculture
    in real-world contexts; where, the authors leverage a confluence of cloud computing,
    edge computing, and NFV technology to conceive a comprehensive framework tailored
    to the essential demands of soilless precision farming practiced within a fully-recirculating
    greenhouse [24]. 3) Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) The VNF placement and
    scheduling in our network settings can be expressed as integer programming with
    some constraints that reflect the service requirements and the network infrastructure’s
    restrictions. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-complete and there is no standard
    solver that can solve such problems in polynomial time [29], especially for large-scale
    networks where the required computation to find the optimal solution increases
    exponentially. Recently, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligent
    (AI) based solutions appear as a viable way to solve such complex problems in
    polynomial time [17], [29], [30]. Since its inception in 2017 [31], Federated
    Learning (FL) has reshaped many emerging intelligent IoT systems toward advanced
    FL architecture. The distributed nature of FL, where some agents cooperatively
    train a global ML model without directly sharing the local data, makes FL an attractive
    alternative to traditional centralized ML schemes. To be more specific, FL by
    pushing intelligent ML functions to the network edge enhances the privacy and
    scalability of IoT applications and networks [30]. In this paper, our focus is
    on use cases in smart agriculture that require live streaming and analysis, such
    as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Specifically, we address the flexible
    dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs within the context of delay-sensitive
    services. The approach involves distributing VNFs across processing nodes, utilizing
    UAVs and local MEC server in a UAV-aided MEC network. The objective is to perform
    SFC while ensuring the freshness of information by jointly minimizing AoI and
    total energy consumption throughout the network. Condensing the system model and
    the definition of the problem, we present the following key insights: In the realm
    of smart agriculture applications, real-time information is collected by IoT devices
    on a smart farm and transmitted through hovering UAVs to the local server. VNFs
    must be executed sequentially on the raw packets, as they represent split functionalities
    of a single processing job. Meanwhile, certain VNFs, such as compression, may
    potentially alter packet sizes. Various service types are assumed, each with its
    specific VNF chain. The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and
    scheduling of VNF chains on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting
    for processing time, transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit
    and processing power) in a distributed manner. We will demonstrate analytically
    that the problem: Exhibits circular symmetry, wherein the optimal policies of
    the agents (UAVs) are identical. The local observations of the agents serve as
    sufficient statistics for determining the optimal policy, We will show how these
    two features will simplify the problem significantly. Subsequently, we present
    a novel solution for solving the modeled problem. The main contributions of our
    paper are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    time that the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop
    UAV-aided MEC network for smart agriculture is considered, while the problem is
    formulated as a joint AoI and Energy minimization. We formulate this joint optimization
    problem as a decentralized partially observable MDP (DEC-POMDP), where the parties
    are not aware of the true state and just make decisions based on their local observations.
    We adopted the structural feature of the problem and have analytically shown that
    under the satisfaction of certain symmetry conditions, the local observation of
    the parties (agents) would be a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal
    solution. As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we proposed a novel FL-based
    algorithm called Asynchronous FL Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) in which a set of distributed
    parties learn in parallel and aggregate their own experience through a coordinator.
    A Multi-hop network is considered, where the UAVs can offload their computing
    tasks to the other UAVs as well as the local MEC server. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: In Section II some state-of-the-art studies will be reviewed.
    Section III describes the system model and the main components of the system in
    detail. Section IV presents the problem definition and formulation. In Section
    V, the problem is expressed as a DEC-POMDP, and some analytical results are given
    that support our proposed FL-based solution presented in Section VI. The complexity
    analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section VII. The effectiveness
    and performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Section VIII. Finally,
    Section IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Works In this section, we
    review some state-of-the-art studies on AoI and energy-aware UAV-aided MEC for
    smart agriculture. The prospects of using UAVs for smart agriculture are immense.
    Moreover, UAVs are easy to deploy and cost-effective which motivates their use
    in smart agriculture [1], [6], [32]. For a comprehensive survey on IoT-based smart
    agriculture and the emerging technologies mentioned in the previous section refer
    to [1]. In [13], Mozaffari et al. have considered the reliable design of IoT’s
    uplink communication in a scenario in which multiple UAVs are deployed to collect
    data from ground IoT devices. In particular, a framework for jointly optimizing
    the trajectory of the UAVs, IoT-to-UAV association, and IoT’s uplink power is
    proposed with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption and mobility
    of the UAVs. However, in the formulated problem, the delay of the forwarded data
    across the UAV network is not considered. Nguyen et al. [5] have considered this
    issue as the problem of processing deadline-critical tasks which are fed to a
    network of hovering UAVs that support the IoT devices deployed in a smart farm.
    It is assumed that the smart farm is equipped with a multi-access MEC infrastructure.
    In such a circumstance, the energy-efficient monitoring problem is modeled as
    a multi-objective maximization problem which aims to maximize the number of tasks
    that are successfully processed before their deadline. Then, a Q-Learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. The same authors in [5] have extended
    their proposed scheme to a DQN-based solution [33] and to a multi-actor-based
    risk-sensitive RL approach [32]. Although, the goal of the aforementioned studies
    is to minimize the energy consumption in the network, however, the proposed solutions
    are basically centralized and the communication overhead of the centralized approaches
    is itself a source of energy waste. The AoI as a metric for determining the freshness
    of information has been used in some recent works On UAV-aided IoT networks [6],
    [17], [23], [34], [35]. Buyukates and Ulukus [34] examined a status update system
    where update packets require processing to extract embedded useful information.
    The source node sends information to a computation unit (CU) with a master node
    and worker nodes. The master node assigns tasks, aggregates results, and sends
    them back to the source node for updating. The analysis focuses on the age performance
    of various schemes in the presence of stragglers, considering i.i.d. exponential
    transmission delays and i.i.d. shifted exponential computation times. Then, the
    best scheme that minimizes the average age is presented. In [35], the authors
    analyzed the average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI (PAoI) in a
    multiuser Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. The system considers three computing
    schemes: local computing, edge computing, and partial computing (where the computational
    tasks are partially performed at the edge and the remaining is performed by the
    local server). To address the complexity, upper and lower bounds on average AoI
    are provided, enabling an examination of optimal offloading decisions based on
    MEC system parameters. In [6], Han et al. modeled a UAV-aided IoT network using
    a Markov chain. The freshness of data packets is defined using AoI and they analyzed
    the IoT devices as first-come-first-served (FCFS) model and M/M/1 queue. Sun et
    al. [17], employed AoI to propose an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for
    IoT networks in which the UAVs are used to collect data. Here, AoI is used to
    quantify the temporal correlation among data packets. Then, an algorithm for determining
    the UAV’s flight speed, hovering locations, and allocated bandwidth to IoT devices
    is proposed that jointly minimizes energy consumption and the weighted sum of
    expected average AoI in the network. In [23], a UAV-aided wireless powered IoT
    scheme is proposed, where a UAV flies from a data center toward IoT sensory nodes
    to transfer energy and collect their information and then it returns back to the
    data center. The goal is to minimize the average AoI of the collected data from
    sensor modes. For such circumstances, an optimization problem is formulated, and
    then a suboptimal method is proposed that first decomposes the problem into two
    subproblems. The solution to the first subproblem is the input for the second
    subproblem. It is worth mentioning that the AoI is basically an end-to-end metric;
    Hence, even though the aforementioned works try to minimize the AoI, for the use
    cases in smart agriculture that the captured data needs some live processing before
    being turned into useful information, these approaches are not effective as they
    just consider the problem of finding the best data flow path. In the context of
    UAV-aided MEC for IoT networks, each service can be represented as a service function
    chain (SFC) consisting of ordered processing functions in the form of VNFs that
    can be geographically placed on to local MEC-server or the UAVs. However, in a
    network with numerous IoT devices and dynamic network load, the placement of VNF
    instances and routing among them in an optimal and efficient manner is a challenging
    problem [27], [28]. In the literature, this problem is referred to as the SFC
    dynamic orchestration problem (SFC-DOP) [27]. In [27], Liu et al. presented a
    DRL-based framework for dynamic SFC orchestration in IoT networks. Huang et al.
    in [36] dealt with the problem of scalability and flexibility of static orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs. Then, a FL-based SFC orchestration is proposed which is scalable
    and benefits from low communication cost. Table 1 presents an overview of the
    previously mentioned studies, emphasizing the main topics they concentrated on.
    Although, in the literature, the UAV-aided MEC architecture is mainly proposed
    as a technique to compensate for the energy and computational limitations of IoT
    networks, however, existing solutions for NFV-enabled SFC require IoT nodes to
    exchange large volumes of local data with a centralized server or among the distributed
    agents. Considering the energy limitation of IoT devices and battery-powered UAVs,
    this significantly causes waste of the network energy. In this paper, we deal
    with this inconsistency and propose a novel FL-based solution for the dynamic
    orchestration of SFCs in a multi-hop and UAV-aided MEC network. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of dynamic orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop UAV-aided MEC network is considered. What makes
    our approach unique is the adoption of the inherent structural aspects of the
    problem, typical in most scenarios, to introduce a decentralized solution that
    is analytically demonstrated to be valid. The proposed method is asynchronous
    FL-based, enabling distributed parties to independently learn locally and subsequently
    contribute to the training of the global model asynchronously [38], [39]. In other
    words, the parties are allowed to directly share gradients with the coordinator
    (here, the MEC server) after every local update and asynchronous of the other
    parties. This further enhances the training speed and efficiency of our proposed
    approach [39]. The coordinator in turn can perform the aggregation and update
    the global model whenever an update from one of the distributed parties is received.
    This approach improves the whole system’s scalability and alleviates the straggler
    impact, i.e., users who may have slower performance [38]. TABLE 1 Summary of Related

    We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications, where,
    the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network operators
    by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases from remote
    monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig. 1, a set N
    of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and send the
    packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered, where packets
    are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering UAVs toward the
    local server. We consider applications in which some processing functions, from
    primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g., object recognition)
    must be sequentially performed on the raw packets. Each IoT device is associated
    with one of the UAVs in its range. U denote the set of all U UAVs in the network.
    The local server is indeed a MEC-server1 denoted by M . A set S={ S k } K k=1
    with |S|=K different service types is assumed. Each service type S k itself consists
    of a set F k ={ F k f } F k f=1 including F k different processing functions that
    should be performed on the packets of that service and F denotes a set of all
    processing functions of all services, F= ⋃ k∈S ( F k ) . The input and output
    packet sizes of the function f of service type k are ρ k f and ϱ k f , respectively.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Let s k n ∈{0,1} denote the service type k∈S
    in IoT node n∈N is active, s k n =1 , or not, s k n =0 . In each IoT node one
    of the K different services is running, ∑ k∈S s k n =1,∀n∈N . To perform the processing
    functions, the MEC-server M and each UAV u is able to run F= ∑ k∈S F k different
    VNF types on their physical computing machine.2 The proposed architecture is based
    on ETSI-NFV standard [40] which is a globally accepted architecture for implementing
    the NFV. According to ETSI-NFV, in each physical machine (processing node) p∈U∪M
    (All U UAVs and the local server M), the VNF manager (VNFM) is responsible to
    manage its computing and storage resources among the VNFs it hosts. The total
    available resources at processing node p is indicated by C p , the computing capacity
    in Hz, and B p , the memory capacity in Byte. The VNF orchestrator (VNFO), hosted
    by the local server, places and schedules the chain of VNFs through Aerial Domain
    and Local (MEC) Server. For a summary of the key symbols and variables used in
    the system model and problem formulation, refer to Table 2. TABLE 2 Key Symbols
    and Variables B. VNF Placement and Scheduling We consider a discrete-time system
    with two hierarchical timing levels. First, the time is divided into equal time
    slots TS with duration T indexed by t=1,2,… . On top of that, we have the VNF-scheduling
    time slots t ~ with duration T ˜ that is multiples of T , and it is a single round
    of VNF placement and scheduling update. At the beginning of each time slot t ~
    , the VNFO updates the VNF placements. Each UAV u segregates data packets from
    IoT nodes sharing the same service type, say k , into a packet-flow Υ k u (t)
    , which it then transmits across the aerial network to the local server. The set
    F k ={ V fk } F k f=1 of F k different VNFs (processing functions) must be performed
    on data packets of the IoT nodes with service type k . At the beginning of each
    VNFO-level time slot t ~ , the VNFO determines the set of processing nodes Δ k
    u ( t ~ ) that participate in serving the k th service packet-flow Υ k u (t) of
    UAV u at t th TS. Each selected processing node p∈U∪M that belongs to Δ k u (
    t ~ ) performs a subset B k up ( t ~ ) of all functions F k that is supposed to
    be performed on the packet flow of service type k belongs to UAV u : B k up (
    t ~ )={ F k f  :  f ˙ k up ≤f≤ f ¨ k up }, B k up ( t ~ )⊆ F k , (1) View Source
    where f ˙ k up (S) and f ¨ k up (E) are the first and the last function (VNF)
    that p performs on the packet flow of service type k of UAV u . In summary, for
    each packet-flow Υ k u (t) , the VNFO selects and schedules the processing nodes
    that handle F k . These nodes can be each one of any other UAVs (intra-domain
    offloading) or local server (inter-domain offloading). Remark 1:Let P to−do p
    ( t ~ )={(u,k,f) : f∈ F k u is running on p} indicate a set of all assigned VNFs
    to the processing node p∈U∪M . We assume all assigned VNFs P to−do p ( t ~ ) to
    processing node p should be finished in a single round of VNF scheduling t ~ .
    Fig. 2 provides a comprehensive representation of crucial elements related to
    the proposed orchestration solution and the communication dynamics within the
    network. Operating at two distinct timing levels, the figure elucidates: 1) The
    VNFO timing (Tier 1), emphasizing interactions pivotal for establishing the proposed
    orchestration solution, and 2) the network-wide communication (Tier 2), encompassing
    all entities within the network. FIGURE 2. Network-wide timing model. Show All
    The upper segment of the figure illustrates how UAV 1 manages received packet
    flows from IoT nodes, accommodating two distinct service types. Following the
    assumed VNFO policy in a single round of VNF placement and scheduling, it is evident
    that for packets of service type 1, UAV1 processes them and subsequently forwards
    them to UAV3. UAV3, after performing the assigned VNFs, then forwards the packets
    to the local server, i.e., the final destination. Conversely, for packets of service
    type 2, UAV1 initiates some initial processing and then directly forwards them
    to the local server, where all remaining VNFs are executed. The lower section
    of the figure is dedicated to illustrating VNFO level operation, depicting control
    packets exchanged between the local server and agents for the training of the
    VNFO model. Further clarification on this VNFO communication is postponed to subsequent
    sections within the article. C. Communication (Access) Network There are three
    communication links among the network nodes: the wireless links between IoT nodes
    and an aerial network consisting of UAVs, the UAV-to-UAV wireless links, and the
    wireless link between the UAVs and the local terrestrial server. Let random process
    g nu (t)∈C denote the channel loss between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U , then the
    achievable bit rate of node n in up-link direction at time instant t will be R
    nu (t)= w n log 2 (1+ p nu | g nu (t)| σ 2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U , where w n and σ 2 denote
    the channel bandwidth of IoT device n and the noise variance, respectively, and
    p nu is the transmission power level. The channel between IoT nodes and UAVs and
    between UAVs and the local server can be modeled as an air-to-ground channel model
    [41]. According to this model, the path loss, g nu can be calculated as [37],
    g nu (t)= ( 4πf c ) 2 d 2 (t) η e , (2) View Source where f , c , and d are frequency
    of operation, speed of light, and distance between the transmitter and receiver,
    respectively; and η e is the average of excessive path loss in two cases of existing
    a LoS path, η LoS e , and non-LoS case, η nLoS e , η e = p LoS × η LoS e +(1−
    p LoS )× η nLoS e , (3) View Source where p LoS is the probability that a LoS
    path exists and can be closely approximated as [37], p LoS = 1 1+aexp−b(ψ−a) ,
    (4) View Source where, a and b are environment-related parameters. Similarly,
    in the downlink direction, the achievable bit rate of the link between UAV u∈U
    and MEC server M at time instant t will be R uM (t)= w uM log 2 (1+ p uM | g uM
    (t)| σ 2 ),∀u∈U , where w uM denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise variance,
    p uM is the transmission power level, and random process g uM (t)∈C denotes the
    channel Loss at time t . Finally, the UAV-to-UAV wireless channel also follows
    the same mathematical model, however, the only difference is that the probability
    of existing LoS is equal to 1, p LoS =1 . For each UAV u and service type k ,
    τ k u (t) is defined as the expectation value of IoT access network delay with
    respect to transmission rate R nu (t) , τ k u (t)= E R nu [ τ k nu (t)], τ k nu
    (t)= D nu /C+ Λ k nu / R nu (t), (5) View Source where, E R nu denotes the expectation
    with respect to R nu , D nu is distance between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U and Λ
    k nu is the packet length of service type S k ∈S . For the aerial radio links,
    Let random process g u u ´ (t)∈C denote the channel power gain between UAV u∈U
    and UAV (or local server M) u ´ ∈U∪M , then the achievable bit rate of the link
    at time instant t will be R u u ´ = w u u ´ log 2 (1+ p u u ´ | g u u ´ (t)| σ
    2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U∪M , where w u u ´ denote the channel bandwidth between UAV u , and
    UAV (or local server) u ´ , σ 2 is the noise variance, and p u u ´ is the transmission
    power level. In the following sections, we will focus on the VNFO’s functionality,
    and resource allocation of the radio access part is beyond the scope of this paper;
    hence, without loss of generality, we assume a fixed power and bandwidth allocated
    to all the participating nodes. SECTION IV. Problem Formulation Let χ fk pu (
    t ~ )∈{0,1} denote whether the processing node p at time slot t is selected to
    run VNF function f on the packet of the k th service type of UAV u : χ fk pu (
    t ~ )= { 1, 0, if p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ )andf∈ B k pu ( t ~ ) otherwise ∀k∈S,u∈U. (6)
    View Source For each service type k∈S of UAV u , only one of the processing nodes
    (UAVs or MEC-server) must be selected for serving each function f∈ F k : ∑ p∈U∪M
    χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k . (7) View Source
    The relation (7), both left and right expressions together, implies that the packets
    belonging to the service packet-flows travel a loop-free route. Each packet belongs
    to packet-flow Υ k u (t) needs a specific computational capacity c fk in CPU cycle.
    Assuming that all the processing capacity of processing node p in a single time
    slot with duration T ˜ is C p T ˜ , to be assured that the computing capacity
    of the selected processing node is enough to serve the assigned VNFs and the scheduler
    does not exceed the processing node’s budget, the following condition at each
    VNF-scheduling time slot t ~ should be satisfied: ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do
    p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T ˜ ,∀p∈U∪M. (8) View Source The same condition also
    needs to be fulfilled regarding the storage capacity requirement b fk (in Bytes):
    ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p ,∀p∈U∪M (9) View Source
    where B p is the total amount of available storage capacity of the processing
    node p . A. Age of Information In order to quantify the freshness of the received
    packet at the destination, the AoI metric is adopted. As soon as an IoT node has
    a packet to send, it connects to its serving UAV and sends packets.3 For each
    packet flow of service type k that UAV u∈U receives directly from the IoT nodes
    that are connected to it and running this service type, the arrival time t k u
    is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the time slot t in which
    any packet has arrived in. Let Θ k u (t) denote the AoI of the packet-flow of
    service type k in UAV u , it can be calculated as, Θ k u (t)={ τ k u +T− t k u
    , Θ k u (t−1)+T, if  α k u (t)=1 if  α k u (t)=0 ∀k∈S,u∈U (10) View Source where
    binary variable α k u (t)∈{0,1} indicates whether any new packet of service flow
    k at TS t is received, α k u (t)=1 , or not, α k u (t)=0 . By definition, for
    every time slot t in which the UAV does not receive a new packet from a service
    packet flow, the AoI of that service packet flow increases by T . On each received
    packet from IoT node n with service type k , the set F n k of VNFs (processing
    functions) should be performed. As stated above, the VNFO determines the set of
    processing nodes p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) that participate in performing the VNFs on packet-flow
    Υ k u (t) by performing the set B k up ( t ~ ) of VNFs. B k up ( t ~ )=∅ means
    p hosts none of the required VNFs of Υ k u (t) . Let Δ k u ( t ~ )={ p 1 , p 2
    ,…, p L } denote the sequence of all UAVs that are already selected to sequentially
    do the chain of VNFs on the received packets of service type k . The processing
    time of every packet of this flow will be, Φ k u (t)= ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⌈ τ fk p v−i p v (t) T ⌉T+ ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v ( t ~ ) (⌈ θ k ϑ T ⌉T ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ), ∀k∈S,u∈U
    τ fk p v−i p v (t)= D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i p v (t) F k
    f = f ¨ k u p v−i , (11) View Source where θ k ϑ is the run time of ϑ th VNF for
    service type k , Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) is the packet length of service type S
    k ∈S after doing the last VNF f ¨ k u p v−1 of the chain in p v−1 , and, Assuming
    that the queueing delay is negligible, τ fk p v−1 p v is total transmission delay
    between p v−1 and p v consists of propagation delay and transmission delay. If
    the binary variable β k u ( t ~ )∈{0,1} indicates whether the VNF scheduling (at
    VNF-scheduling time slots t ~ ) for the flow of packets belong to service type
    k of UAV u was successful, then, the AoI at the Local server will be, Π k u (t)={
    Θ k u (t)+ Φ k u (t), Π k u (t−1)+ T ˜ , if  β k u ( t ~ )=1 if β k u ( t ~ )=0
    ∀k∈S,u∈U. (12) View Source Note that T ˜ is the duration of a single round of
    VNF placement and scheduling. B. Energy Consumption The energy consumption of
    the network in the uplink direction can be calculated as, P UL (t)= ∑ n∈N ∑ k∈S
    ∑ u∈U s k n p nu Λ k nu / R nu (t), (13) View Source where Λ k nu / R nu (t) is
    the transmission time between IoT node n , with service type k , and UAV u at
    TS t . The other energy-consuming part of the access network is transmission among
    the processing nodes. If we represent the energy consumption in the aerial domain
    (including UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-MEC links) at TS t with P Aerial (t) , then it
    will be as, P Aerial (t)= τ fk p v−i p v (t)= F k f = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k
    u p p v−i p v τ fk p v−i p v (t), D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i
    p v (t), f ¨ k u p v−i , (14) View Source where Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) , f ¨ k
    u p v−1 and τ fk p v−1 p v are defined like (11). Finally, if Ψ k ϑ denotes the
    power each machine, that hosts the ϑ th VNF of service type k , consumes to run
    this VNF on each packet of this service type, then, the total network-wide required
    energy for performing the VNFs across a single packet of all service type can
    be calculated as follows: P NFV = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v Ψ k
    ϑ θ k ϑ . (15) View Source In a single term, P NFV represents the energy consumption
    resulting from VNFs processing. Using (13)–(15), the total energy consumption
    of the network to process a single packet across all the service types belonging
    to all UAVs would be, P Total (t)= P UL (t)+ P Aerial (t)+ P NFV . (16) View Source
    The UAVs use a battery, hence their available energy to do the processes and perform
    the required communications is limited. Therefore, we need an energy-efficient
    VNFO solution with minimum communication overhead. A centralized ML method will
    be optimal, but it requires a large communication transaction to share the local
    observation with the central controller. Another drawback of adopting centralized
    architecture is that the centralized coordinator is not scalable and from the
    processing and communication viewpoint is a single point of failure. Therefore,
    in this paper, we deal with proposing a solution for the following problem of
    distributed NFV orchestration through the UAVs as distributed VNFO agents. Problem
    1 (Distributed VNFO for Joint AoI and Energy Minimization):Considering the service
    requirements of IoT nodes, UAVs/MEC-server available resources, and the condition
    of access networks, what is the optimal strategy of VNF placement and scheduling
    in each UAV to jointly minimize the average AoI and total energy consumption at
    the Local Server: Minimize χ fk pu ( t ~ ) s.t. γ AoI [ 1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u
    (t)]+ γ E P total (t), ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t
    ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k , ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T,
    ∀p∈U∪M, ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p , ∀p∈U∪M.
    (17) View Source In each VNFO-level time slot T ˜ the orchestrator sequentially
    decides on the chain of VNFs of the service flows belonging to UAVs. For a class
    of stochastic sequential decision-making problems, the Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) has been a powerful framework for the mathematical formulation and study
    of this type of problems. Another point that is worth mentioning is that our proposed
    method in Section VI is FL-based where the UAVs follow the same model trained
    cooperatively. Therefore, minimizing the average AoI over UAVs or minimizing the
    maximum value of AoI over UAVs are basically the same. Depending on the environment
    state, the MDP output will be the best action (or at least the best upon the history
    of the observations and actions) which maximizes a specific utility function [42].
    For the case that the state is not fully observable to the deciding agent or the
    agent’s observations are exposed to noise or some source (sort) of uncertainties,
    another extended class of decision-making processes called Partially Observable
    MDP (POMDP) is adopted [43]. Both MDP and POMDP in their original scope are defined
    centralized [42], [43]. Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) is the extended
    version of POMDP in which a set of distributed agents are involved in the decision-making
    process [44], [45]. By definition, if every agent has the same individual reward
    function, the POSG model becomes the Decentralized POMDP (DEC-POMDP) [45]. In
    the following two sections, first, we show how the problem can be modeled as a
    DEC-POMDP and then we will present our proposed method to solve the developed
    DEC-POMDP. SECTION V. DEC-POMDP Formulation In a multi-agent MDP with state uncertainty,
    a DEC-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple with the following definition. Definition
    1 (DEC-POMDP Model):DEC-POMDP G with a set U of U agents is defined as a tuple
    G=⟨U,S, b 0 ,A,O,T,O,R⟩ , where S is the finite set of global environment states,
    b 0 is the probability of the environment initially being in state s∈S , A= ∏
    u∈U A u is the joint action of all agents, where A u is the set of actions available
    to agent u , O= ∏ u∈U O u is joint observation, where O u is the observations
    available to agent u , T is the transition function T :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×S→[0,1]
    , where T( s ´ |s,A(s)) is defined as the transition probability from state s
    to s ´ by doing joint action A(s) , O is the observation function O :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×O→[0,1]
    , where O(O|s,A(s)) is defined as the joint observation at state s by doing joint
    action A(s) , R={ r u } U−1 u=0 is a set of reward functions r u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))→R
    , where r u (s,A(s)) is defined as the reward received by u when A(s) is executed
    at the global state s . In a DEC-POMDP, each agent u∈U based on its local observation
    o u ∈ O u and a local policy π u performs an independent action a u ∈ A u . In
    each partially observable state s , the joint action A(s)= ∏ u∈U a u (s) from
    the joint policy P= ∏ u∈U π u determines the next global state s ´ and joint observations
    O according to transition and observation probability of T( s ´ |s,A(s)) and O(O|s,A(s))
    , respectively. According to Problem 1, our purpose is to find the best choice
    for the sets Δ k u (t) of processing nodes p and B k up (t) of the VNF chains
    for serving packet-flow Υ k u (t) of any service type k∈S of UAVs u∈U in a distributed
    manner. Remark 2 (Source of Uncertainties):We have considered a multi-hop network
    architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which, 1) each agent u is not aware of
    the other agents’ observation o −u  (−u refers to all the agents except u , o
    −u = ∏ u ´ ≠u o u ´ ) , nor the action a −u ,4 2) each agent observes the result
    of doing its own action and the actions of the other agents, while it is not aware
    of the global state nor the action of the other agents. Therefore, according to
    Definition 1, it can be inferred that Problem 1 in its decentralized form is a
    DEC-POMDP. FIGURE 3. System model as a DEC-POMDP. Show All In DEC-POMDP, each
    agent based on its actions and observations creates a local database that in time
    t can be represented as h u ( t ~ )={ a u ( t ~ −1), o u ( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1
    ,∀u∈U , where a u ( t ~ −1) and o u ( t ~ ) are the action of u at time slot t
    ~ −1 and its corresponding observation at t ~ . All the information is available
    to all the U agents at time t ~ defines as the joint history H( t ~ )= ∏ u∈U h
    u ( t ~ )={A( t ~ −1),O( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1 . The POMDP state is hidden from the
    agents. Hence, the agents would not be able to choose their actions based on knowing
    the true state. The standard approach for dealing with POMDPs is to find a solution
    to the fully observable equivalent belief-MDP [43]. Where, belief B(s, t ~ )=P(s(
    t ~ )=s|H( t ~ ),B(0)),∀s∈S defines as a probability distribution over the state
    space of the original POMDP knowing the joint history H( t ~ ) , i.e., all the
    available information from the sequence of interactions that the agents have had
    until now,where B(0) is the initial value the belief state function. Belief state
    function B(s, t ~ ) is known as sufficient statistic for the history H( t ~ )
    [45]. Upon performing a new interaction at t ~ +1 , the belief value is updated
    from the belief point at time t considering the new interaction {A( t ~ −1),O(
    t ~ )} . Despite the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer
    the action (the policy) of the other agents. This leads to the definition of multi-agent
    belief function [46] with the following definition, b u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s× π −u (s))→[0,1],∀u∈U
    b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=P(s( t ~ )=s, π −u | h u ( t ~ ), b u (0)), π −u = ∏ u ´ ∈U,
    u ´ ≠u π u ´ . (18) View Source As it is evident, the multi-agent belief function
    is defined in a space that is a combination of the hidden global state s and joint
    policy π −u of the other agents. From Bellman expectation equation [47], the action-value
    function Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u ] is the expected return starting from
    state hidden state s , taking action a π u according to policy π u , while the
    other agents follow the joint policy π −u , Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~
    ]= E{ R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u Q π u, t ~ +1 [( s ´ , π −u ), a π u,
    t ~ +1 ]}. (19) View Source where the action-value function decomposed into immediate
    reward plus discounted action-value of the successor state, and γ u is the discount
    factor of agent u . With some mathematical manipulation, (19) can be written as,
    Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]= R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u ∑ (
    o u , o −u )∈O O[ o u , o −u |s,( a π u , a −π −u )] ∑ s ´ ∈S T[ s ´ |s,( a −π
    −u )] × ∑ ( a π u , a −π −u )∈A π u ( a π u | s ´ ) Q π u,t [( s ´ , π −u ( o
    −u )), a ´ π u, t ~ +1 ( o u )]. (20) View Source Using (18), for a given belief
    state function b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) , the action-value function Q π u, t ~ ( b
    u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ ) will be, Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ )= ∑ s∈S ∑ π
    −u b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]. (21) View Source
    For an enough large value of t ~  ( t ~ →∞) , the goal is to find the optimal
    policy π ∗ u among available policies π u which leads to the optimal Q-value (action-value)
    function, Q ∗ u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a u, t ~ )=arg max π Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ ,
    a π u, t ~ ). (22) View Source There is no straightforward solution for the aforementioned
    DEC-POMDP problem. Among decentralized methods, multi-agent solutions also need
    a large volume of communication overhead between the agents to share their local
    observations to converge. FL does not have the communication overhead of the centralized
    techniques and also does not necessitate the agents to share all of the data and
    local observations to converge. Although this specification is for providing privacy,
    in our problem it provides us with the gain of energy efficiency that arises because
    the agents (UAVs) do not need to share all of their observations. A few efforts,
    [45], [48], [49], have been made in the literature to capture and exploit some
    structural specifications of the understudied system (application) to find or
    at least simplify the problem of finding optimal policy (22). One of these works
    is one presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], in which the authors have developed
    a class of POSGs that is characterized by symmetry across players in terms of
    cost and state dynamics. In view of this research, within the APPENDIX, we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP and prove that Problem 1belongs to this class and
    is Circularly Symmetric. This implies that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the
    same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . In essence, this necessitates a distributed solution
    to determine the best policy while ensuring uniformity across all agents. Furthermore,
    in accordance with the circular symmetry characteristic of the problem, in Corollary
    22 we prove that local observations serve as sufficient statistics for each agent
    to ascertain the best policy. Corollary 22 guarantees that the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) serves as a sufficient statistic to determine the optimal policy π
    ∗ for the agents (UAVs). This implies that the information encapsulated in the
    local observations of the individual agents is comprehensive enough to determine
    the optimal policy π ∗ . While this corollary does not suggest a particular method
    for identifying the optimal policy, it is promising and justifies our proposed
    FL-based algorithm in which the agents collaboratively engage in training a globally
    shared model. This approach aligns with the notion that leveraging decentralized
    insights from each agent’s local observations can contribute to the derivation
    of an effective and globally optimal policy because their observations are sufficient
    statistics. Capitalizing on the promising findings in this section, the subsequent
    section introduces our proposed approach to address Problem 1. SECTION VI. Symmetry-aided
    Asynchronous Federated DQN Framework In this section, we introduce our proposed
    Asynchronous Federated Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) algorithm and the components we
    have used in the proposed model as depicted in Fig. 4. In traditional RL, the
    problem is modeled as an MDP consisting of a tuple {s( t ~ ),a( t ~ ),r( t ~ ),s(
    t ~ +1)} . At each decision-making time t ~ , the agent is at state s( t ~ ) and
    takes an action a( t ~ ) based on a policy π that causes a state transition from
    s( t ~ ) to s( t ~ +1) while an immediate reward r( t ~ ) incurred. For our POMDP
    case in which the true state of the network is hidden, the true state s( t ~ )
    is replaced with belief-state b( t ~ ) . Mainly, the RL aims to guide the agent
    to find the best policy π ∗ defined as the best mapping from observation o( t
    ~ ) to action a( t ~ ) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted future
    rewards R( t ~ )= E π { ∑ ∞ l=t γ (l− t ~ ) r(l)} , where γ∈[0,1] is a discount
    factor indicating how much future rewards is important. For our DEC-POMDP problem,
    this relation maps to (19). FIGURE 4. Block diagram of the proposed Asynchronous
    Federated-DQN (AFDQN). Show All A. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Part To estimate Q-value
    functions (21), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed, where Q-values
    are predicted using deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The
    estimated Q -functions are represented by { Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ
    u ( t ~ )) } U−1 u=0 , where the parameter θ u ( t ~ ) represents the weights
    of the agent u ’s neural network (NN). The updated value of θ u ( t ~ ) is used
    to approximate the true values of Q u ( t ~ ) [21], [50]. Let’s define the loss
    function L( θ u ( t ~ )) as the expectation value of the mean squared error of
    the estimated Q-value Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) from the target
    value y( t ~ ) [21], L( θ u ( t ~ ))=E[(y( t ~ )− Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~
    ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (23) View Source where, y( t ~ )= r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u
    ( t ~ +1) Q u ( o u ( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1); θ u ( t ~ )) and a u ( t ~ +1) indicates
    the agent’s action generated by the DNN at t ~ +1 , given the observation o u
    ( t ~ +1) . At each iteration, the deep Q -function approximator is trained to
    learn the best estimate of the Q-function by minimizing the loss function L( θ
    u ( t ~ )) . To improve the stability of the algorithm and cope with samples correlation,
    as depicted in Fig. 4, two novel techniques, namely Fixed Target Network [51]
    and Experience Replay Buffer [52] are deployed, respectively. Utilizing these
    two techniques, the loss function L( θ u ( t ~ )) can be written as L( θ u ( t
    ~ )) = E D [( r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u ( t ~ +1) Q u (b( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1);
    θ ´ u ( t ~ )) − Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (24) View
    Source where θ ´ u ( t ~ ) denotes the target network parameters, and the expectation
    E D is taken over the randomly selected mini-batches of samples from the replay
    buffer D . B. Federated Learning Part As it is illustrated in Fig. 4, we have
    two main entities, the set U={0,1,…,U−1} of UAVs that are our distributed agents
    or in FL terminology, the agents, and the coordinator that in our model is local
    server (MEC-server). FL allows the UAVs (agents) to train a shared global model
    parameterized by θ g that is an exact copy of the agents’ local model { θ u }
    u=U−1 u=0 using their own dataset { D u } u=U−1 u=0 , while the original data
    remains in UAVs. After local training, agents share their local model updates
    with the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the received updates to
    build the global model θ g . As a result, relying on the distributed data training
    at the agents, the local server is able to enhance the training performance without
    significant communication overhead as it just needs an update of the local model
    parameters, not the agents’ local data. The federated learning procedure of our
    proposed method includes the following key steps. 1) Distributed Local Training
    Primarily, the local server initializes the global model, θ g,0 , and transmit
    it to the agents. Upon receiving θ g,0 , during VNFO time slots t ~ the agents
    interact with environment and train their local model { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0
    using their own data set { D u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 by minimizing a loss function
    { L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) } u=U−1 u=0 , θ ∗ u =arg min π u L u ( θ u (( t ~ ))),∀u∈U.
    (25) View Source Then, the agents upload their local update on { θ u ( t ~ ) }
    u=U−1 u=0 to the coordinator for aggregation. 2) Model Aggregation After collecting
    the agents’ local model updates, the next step is aggregating them into a new
    version of the global model which is performed by the coordinator by solving the
    following optimization problem. Problem 2 (Model Aggregation):Given the local
    model updates { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 of all agents, and knowing the local loss
    functions { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 , what is the optimal strategy for aggregating
    the local model that minimizes the global loss, θ ∗ g , L ∗ g =arg min L g , θ
    g L g ( ∏ u∈U L u ( θ g (( t ~ )))). (26) View Source According to Problem 2,
    θ ∗ g is the optimal value for θ g with having the local updates in hand; and
    L ∗ g is the best function (the best method) for aggregating the local loss function.
    The loss-aggregation function L ∗ g indicates the relative contribution of each
    agent on the global model, however, there is not a fixed method for determining
    this function and it depends mostly on the structure and specific features of
    the problem. Corollary 1:According to Lemma 2, The best setting for loss functions
    is (24) and { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 =L(⋅) , The optimal way for aggregating the
    local updates is averaging among the agent’s contributions, thus (25) can be rewritten
    as, θ ∗ g = ∑ u∈U ω u θ u , where ω u represents the relative contribution of
    each agent on the global model. After the derivation of a new update of θ g the
    coordinator broadcasts it to all agents. Upon receiving the update from the coordinator,
    the agents upgrade their local model accordingly. Until achieving a predefined
    level of accuracy or convergence of the global loss function, this process is
    continued. C. Asynchronous Networking The communication among the network entities
    follows the time slots t , but slot scheduling in which the agents share their
    own local model with the coordinator is distributed and asynchronous. Upon receiving
    an update, the coordinator aggregates it with the global model and updates the
    agents with the newly updated global model. In this way, we do not impose a strict
    constraint on synchronous communication with the local server (the coordinator).
    This significantly decreases the networking overhead in comparison with synchronous
    federation among distributed agents. During the training phase, we consider episodes
    in which the agent presets to a random initialization setting and starts interaction
    with the environment, and learns from its experience. Each episode contains T
    ˆ VNF scheduling round t ~ . In the deployment phase, the stream of packets that
    belong to different services is assigned based on an optimally determined VNF
    placement/scheduling policy. To avoid service interruption any fine-tuning and
    policy adaption to environmental changes, including the time the algorithm spends
    on fine-tuning and finding the optimal solution by coordinating multiple agents
    to train the global model, can be done in parallel. Definition 2 (Global Update
    Period):global update period 1≤η≤ T ˆ is defined as the period of updating the
    coordinator by the agents. We have two special settings, AFDQN-SGD ( η=1 ): In
    this case, every VNF scheduling slot t ~ , the agent sends the locally calculated
    SGD, ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator uses the
    received local data to perform one step of gradient descent: θ g ( t ~ +1)= θ
    g ( t ~ )− γ ˙ ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )). (27) View Source AFDQN-Avg ( η= T ˆ ):
    In this case, only one time during each episode, the agent sends the whole parameter
    θ u ( t ~ ) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator updates θ g ( t ~ ) accordingly,
    θ g ( t ~ +1)=(1− γ ¨ ) θ g ( t ~ )+ γ ¨ θ u ( t ~ ), (28) View Source where,
    γ ˙ and γ ¨ are AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg forgetting factors, respectively. Introducing
    the forgetting factors γ ˙ and γ ¨ allows for the adjustment of learning rates
    during model updates. Rather than updating the global model instantly upon receiving
    a local update, it is beneficial to employ a weighted average approach, considering
    both the most recent update and the previous value of the Agent’s NN weight θ
    g . This approach, known as Asynchronous Weight Averaging [53] in the literature,
    proves advantageous in alleviating the impact of outdated updates, commonly referred
    to as stale weights, and consequently, it enhances overall stability. The only
    point is that the forgetting factors should be chosen small enough. Another worth
    mentioning point is that the AFDQN-SGD and a centralized approach doing mini-batch
    SGD in the local server are essentially different as the former is asynchronous,
    distributed, and fully based on local data. The details of the proposed AFDQN
    algorithm are described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: AFDQN- η Algorithm Show All
    Considering our optimization problem, for each agent u∈U at VNF scheduling round
    t ~ , we define the observation space O u , the action space A u , and the reward
    function R u as follows: Observation: We define the observation space as a vector
    of: 1) CPU and storage requested by the local service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } k as { c fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k and { b fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k , respectively, 2)
    available CPU { C p } p and storage { B p } p of the processing nodes, 3) service
    arrival time { t k u } k , and 4) the transmission rate { R u p ´ } U∖ u ´ ∪M
    of the links between agent u and the other processing nodes. Therefore, the observation
    o u ( t ~ ) can be written as O u ( t ~ )= {{ c fk (t) } f,k ,{ b fk (t) } f,k
    , { C p } p ,{ B p } p ,{ t k u } k ,{ R u p ´ } U∖u⋃M } t= t ~ . (29) View Source
    Action: The action space is defined as all possible placement of the required
    VNFs for service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ } k as A u ( t ~ )={ χ fk pu ( t ~ )},∀p∈U∪M,k∈S,f∈
    F k . (30) View Source Reward: Our objective is to orchestrate the VNFs in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and total energy consumption over the network.
    So we define the reward as a linear combination of three terms as follows: R u
    ( t ~ )= ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u ( t ~ )= Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )= ζ k u ( t ~ )= δ NFV ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u
    ( t ~ )+ δ AoI Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )+ δ E P total ( t ~ ), 1 K ∑ k∈S ζ k u ( t ~ )
    1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u ( t ~ ) { +1, −10, if (7)-(9)are satisfied otherwise. (31)
    View Source where δ NFV , δ AoI and δ E are the normalization factors for NFV
    scheduling result, AoI, and the energy consumption, respectively; ζ k u ( t ~
    ) is defined as the reward assigned to the result of NFV placement for service
    flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ . SECTION VII. Complexity Analysis In this section, we determine
    the computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1. We analyze the algorithm’s
    complexity through two distinct phases: Model Training and Action Selection, which
    occur during the deployment of the trained model. During each iteration of the
    global update period η , the process involves the training of local models by
    the agents (UAVs) and subsequently, the asynchronous aggregation of these local
    models by the MEC server to form the global model. The complexity of the local
    model training conducted by the agents can be expressed as the sum of two components:
    the complexity of action selection and the complexity of the back-propagation
    algorithm for each sample within the replay buffer. This sum is then further multiplied
    by the mini-batch size and η . It is worth noting that the multiplication by the
    mini-batch size accounts for the fact that, in each training iteration, the local
    agent randomly selects a mini-batch of samples from its own local replay buffer.
    The computational complexity of action selection in a fully connected neural network
    with a fixed number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer is directly
    proportional to the sum of the input size and the output size of the neural network
    being used [54], [55]. The input size of the neural network is equivalent to the
    size of the state space, which from (29) is given by 2KF+2(U+1)+K+(U−1)+1 ; and,
    the output size of the neural network is equal to the size of the action space.
    which from (30) is given by KF(U+1) . It’s worth recalling that F= ∑ k∈S F k represents
    the overall count of distinct VNFs required to be executed across all service
    types. Hence, the computational complexity associated with action selection is
    represented by O(KFU) . Conversely, as indicated in equation [54], [55], for a
    specific sample extracted from the replay buffer, the computational complexity
    of the back-propagation process is directly proportional to the product of the
    neural network’s input and output sizes. Consequently, in our specific scenario,
    derived from the preceding computations, the overall algorithmic complexity for
    each agent can be expressed as O(ηO K 2 F 2 U) , where, O denotes the batch size.
    From Algorithm 1, each agent repeats the whole process of local model training
    η times preceding sharing the results with the local server. The last step is
    the aggregation process. While our algorithm conducts asynchronous aggregation,
    it’s important to note that the processing load escalates proportionally with
    the number of UAVs, U . As a result, the overall computational complexity for
    the training phase across the entire network is given by O(ηO F 2 K 2 U 2 ) .
    Based on the prior discussion, the complexity associated with the action selection
    for all U agents during the deployment phase is denoted as O(KF U 2 ) . SECTION
    VIII. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated. The performance results are compared for four different
    methods of AFDQN-SGD, AFDQN-Avg, AFDQN with parameter η≠{1, T ˆ } , and a centralized
    case. In the centralized DQN method, all the observations are forwarded to the
    local server and the local server performs the VNF scheduling. Hence, its performance
    can be considered as an upper bound for the proposed AFDQN method. A. Simulation
    Setup The simulation is implemented by Python using OpenAI gym [56], a widely
    used tool for developing RL algorithms, and conducted in a computer with Intel
    Core i7–10700 CPU 2.90 GHz and 64 GB RAM. Using simulation, the impact of parameter
    η , the number of IoT nodes, and the effect of the received load by the agents
    are evaluated. To this purpose, while T ˆ =60 , five different values for the
    parameter of η consisting of 1 (corresponds to AFDQN-SGD), 10, 20, 30, and 60
    (corresponds to AFDQN-Avg) are considered. The other model parameters and simulation
    settings are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The proposed system model entirely
    matches none of the existing related works. However, the simulation parameters
    have been chosen to be in line with the typical values commonly used in similar
    studies within this context [6], [32], [33], [36], [37]. TABLE 3 Model Parameters
    and Simulation Settings Part I TABLE 4 Model Parameters and Simulation Settings
    Part II B. Simulation Results In Fig. 5, the convergence behavior of the AFDQN
    method is compared with the centralized method as a baseline. The two extreme
    cases of AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg are considered. As is evident from this figure,
    for the AFDQN method we have some variations around the value where it converged.
    The absolute value of these variations in AFDQN-Avg is more than AFDQ-SGD, and
    in AFDQN-SGD’s case, they are around the value achieved by the centralized method.
    Also, the AFDQN-Avg converged to a smaller value for total return, we expect this
    result will also be reflected in the performance of AFDQN-Avg against AFDQN-SGD.
    This will be investigated in the following experiments. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), the minimum achievable average AoI and total energy consumption are investigated.
    The AoI value is averaged over all the agents and the total energy consumption
    is defined as the total energy consumption for sending a single packet of each
    service flow through the network from IoT nodes toward the local server. As can
    be seen, the maximum energy consumption of the three methods is limited to a maximum
    value corresponding to the maximum value of resources that the processing nodes
    can allocate to the requests. As a result, the negative side effect of the methods’
    drop in performance is mostly reflected in the value of the averaged AoI. For
    the AFDQN-Avg, this point is evidenced in Fig. 6(a), where we can see that at
    several points the values of the averaged AoI are more than 1 second. However,
    this is the worst-case choice for selecting the global update period η . Form
    Fig. 6(a), for the proposed AFDQN, we could achieve an average AoI of less than
    200 msec, which is acceptable for most real-time applications. Therefore, performance
    close to the centralized case can be achieved by the proposed method in a distributed
    manner, relying solely on the local observations of the UAVs and the sharing of
    trained local models, thus eliminating the need for exchanging the local observations,
    which can be time and energy-consuming. FIGURE 5. Episodic reward of agent 1 for
    the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All FIGURE 6. (a) Average episodic AoI. (b) Average episodic total energy consumption
    of the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All In Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), the network energy efficiency versus service availability
    is drawn. The network-wide energy efficiency is defined as the total number of
    successfully-supported service flows divided by the total energy consumption throughout
    the network to send a single packet from each one of the services flows. Also,
    service availability is defined as the percentage of the service flows that are
    supported successfully. In Fig. 7(a), the average network energy efficiency and
    the sample values in our simulation, as well as the standard deviation of the
    value, for AFDQN- 20 (η=20) are shown. The averaged network efficiency with increasing
    the value of the service availability increases in a way that for the service
    availability of more than 80 percent, it converges to around 82 percent. This
    convergence for large value of service availability shows that we were eventually
    able to provide energy efficiency as one of our objective functions. In Fig. 7(b),
    where the proposed AFDQN method with different values of η∈{20,30,60} is compared
    with the centralized approach, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the
    centralized approach degrades as the availability reaches 100%. This behavior
    is because the centralized method has a single NN for all UAVs. For the availability
    values near 100%, the centralized agent is not able to do the job as efficiently
    as the AFDQN method where each agent has its own NN. FIGURE 7. Network-wide energy
    efficiency vs. percentage of service availability. The shaded area represents
    the standard deviation (SD) from the average value: (a) For AFDQN with η=20 .
    Sample values are shown for more illustration. (b) For AFDQN with η=20 , η=30
    , AFDQN-Avg and centralized architecture. Show All As illustrated in Table 3,
    the load of services (in terms of requested CPU and storage resources) is modeled
    as a normalized uniform random variable. The standard deviation (SD) of the values
    for both CPU request values and storage is 1.3 percent. In Fig. 8, the impact
    of increasing this value, up to 6 times the primary value of 1.3, on the network’s
    performance is examined. The network is first trained with the primary input-load
    SD value of 1.3, and then, we incrementally raised the SD of the input load. This
    can be implicitly considered as a test under non-stationary load. It is evident
    that in this situation the AoI will increase, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To be
    more specific, we considered a threshold of one second for the acceptable AoI.
    Hence, we have also drawn a graph of AoI violation (in percentage) in conjunction
    with the bar chart of averaged AoI to better reflect the effect of the load SD.
    The results demonstrate that the AFDQN-Avg method has better performance in this
    situation, which appears to contradict our previous observations where we concluded
    that decreasing the global update period improves the performance. This observation
    can be explained using the non-stationary behavior of the input load. In this
    case, the AFDQN-Avg lets the agents learn the variations and input model better,
    in comparison with AFDQN-10, which was chosen as an example for a case between
    two extreme cases, AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg. FIGURE 8. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation
    percentage for AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg versus standard deviation (SD) of the load
    normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All The effect of increasing
    the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and Energy consumption is investigated
    in Fig. 9. For this experiment, two AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg cases are considered.
    The results show that AFDQN-10 had better performance than AFDQ-Avg. Another important
    point that should be mentioned relates to the behavior of the network for a large
    number of IoT nodes, e.g., 120 or more. As the number of IoT nodes increases,
    the load of the agents increases directly, this means that there are more CPU
    and storage requests. Because the resources in the processing nodes are limited,
    there comes a point where an increase in the number of IoT nodes will lead to
    more request rejection responses. In this situation, the fresh packets will drop,
    and that causes an increase in the AoI value. However, the network energy consumption
    does not change because the volume of the active processes does not change and
    remains equal to the maximum capacity of the processing nodes. FIGURE 9. The effect
    of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and energy consumption.
    Show All For further exploration, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 compare the performance
    of the proposed algorithm against two baseline algorithms: Multi-agent DQN (MDQN)
    [57] and the adapted version of heuristic Minimum-Delay algorithm [58]. In MDQN
    the agents operate independently based on locally trained models without coordination.
    The agents are equipped with an identical neural network featuring the same specifications
    as AFDQN. Conversely, the Minimum Delay algorithm selects actions at each VNF
    scheduling round t ´ to minimize end-to-end delay (not AoI) between IoT nodes
    and the local server. FIGURE 10. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation percentage for
    AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay versus standard deviation (SD)
    of the load normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All FIGURE
    11. The effect of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and
    energy consumption for AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay. Show All
    In Fig. 10, a comparison similar to Fig. 8 assesses the impact of increasing load
    standard deviation (SD) on network performance in terms of AoI and AoI violation.
    Generally, an increase in SD raises the average AoI and AoI violation percentage
    for all methods, as larger SD values force agents to find the best action across
    a larger state space. As it is evident, the proposed AFDQN method exhibits the
    smallest average AoI and AoI violation percentage compared to baseline methods.
    However, the Minimum Delay method performs the worst due to its localized short-term
    target. Finally in Fig. 11, the impact of increasing the number of IoT nodes per
    agent (UAV) on the proposed method’s performance in terms of AoI and energy consumption
    is explored and compared with MDQN and Minimum Delay algorithms. Results demonstrate
    the superior performance of the proposed AFDQN method compared to baselines. Additionally,
    as the number of IoT nodes reaches 120 and beyond, there is an increased demand
    for CPU and storage; limited resources in processing nodes eventually lead to
    increased rejection of requests, causing a rise in AoI. However, network energy
    consumption remains unchanged, as the volume of active processes remains equal
    to the maximum capacity of processing nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion We considered
    the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in smart agriculture
    applications to jointly minimize the AoI and energy consumption throughout the
    network. Especially, the problem is formulated as a decentralized POMDP. Then,
    adopting the symmetric structure of the network, we analytically proved that the
    optimal policy among the agents is behaving similarly. Accordingly, a novel federated-based
    DQN method was proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed method
    is distributed and energy efficient, as the local agents just need to share the
    parameters of their locally trained model with each other. Although the primary
    goal of this method is to provide privacy among the agents, in our problem, this
    significantly decreased the communication overhead, and additionally, the total
    energy consumption of the network. In terms of freshness of information, the AoI
    is minimized jointly, and the achieved value for the AoI, while the parameter
    setting is set to be close to real values, is appropriate for most real-time applications.
    Appendix In this section, we aim to simplify the problem of determining the optimal
    policy (22) by utilizing some structural specifications of the developed system
    and problem. Inspiring by the work presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP based on the Definition and Lemma presented below.
    Definition 3 (Symmetric DEC-POMDP):A DEC-POMDP is called symmetric if the following
    conditions hold: A u = A u ´ and γ u = γ u ´ , ∀u, u ´ ∈U∀u∈U , ∀a∈A , and an
    arbitrary permutation function σ(.) : r u (s,σ(a))= r σ(u) (s,a) , and T(⋅|s,σ(a))=T(⋅|s,a)
    . Lemma 1:Let G be a symmetric DEC-POMDP, for any u, u ´ ∈U , if π u = π u ´ ,
    then, π u is ϵ -best-response to π −u if and only if π u ´ is ϵ -best-response
    to π − u ´ , where ϵ -best-response (for an arbitrary ϵ≥0) defines as a policy
    that achieves (reach) a reward (cost) within ϵ of the maximum (minimum) value.
    In our VNF scheduling problem, as it is depicted in Fig. 3, at each VNF scheduling
    round t ~ , each distributed agent u∈U , has K packet-flow { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } K k=1 belong to different services each of which requires running F k different
    VNFs on their packets. The agents decide on how to place these VNFs into available
    processing nodes, i.e., other U−1 UAVs, the local server, or itself, in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption according to (17).
    All the agents follow the same goal and the priorities among the agents are the
    same. Without loss of generality, we assume that the agents have chosen the same
    discount factor, { γ u } u∈U =γ . Thus, it can be found that the agents conceptually
    have the same model; an intuitive inference that can be figured out better using
    the following Index Mapping rule. Definition 4 (Index Mapping):For each function
    f∈ F k of packet-flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ , by definition we assume that the policy
    π u ( t ~ ) outputs I fk u ∈{0,1,…,U−1,M} is the i th candidate processing node,
    I i , as depicted in Fig. 12. The actual selected processing node among p∈{u∪{
    u ´ } u ´ ≠u ∪M} , will be, p u ( t ~ )={ [(u+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M
    if  I i = I M , ∀ I fk u = I i . (32) View Source Then, χ fk pu (|t= t ~ )=1 ,
    and X k u , B k pu will be updated accordingly. FIGURE 12. Index mapping mechanism.
    Show All Now, according to Definition 3and Definition 4, the following lemma can
    be driven. Lemma 2:Problem 1is a symmetric DEC-POMDP. Proof:According to Definition
    4, the agents have the same set of actions { A u } u∈U ={ I i } i∈U∪M , so the
    condition (i) of Definition 3 is met. Let define C ℓ as circular shift operand
    with arbitrary value of ℓ , C ℓ (⋅)=[⋅+ℓ]modU . Considering a circular shift of
    ℓ over joint action A , C ℓ (A) , we will have, a C ℓ (u) = a u , thus from (32),
    for each I fk C ℓ (u) = I fk u = I i the selected processing node p C ℓ (u) (t)
    will be, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )={ [( C ℓ (u)+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M if  I
    i = I M , ∀ I fk C ℓ (u) = I i . View Source Or, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )= C ℓ ( p u
    ( t ~ )). (33) View Source Equation (33) means Problem 1 is circularly symmetric.
    To be more specific, we do not have any special dependency on the identity of
    the agents and the state transitions depend only on the profile of joint actions
    performed by all agents. Accordingly, permuting the agents’ actions does not change
    the conditional transition probabilities, T(⋅|s, C ℓ (A))=T(⋅|s,A) , and this
    permutation will lead to a corresponding permutation of rewards, r C ℓ (u) (s,A)=
    r u (s, C ℓ (A)) . Hence, the second condition of Definition 3 is also satisfied
    and the proof is complete. According to Lemma 2, being circularly symmetric means
    that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . For such
    a condition, Lemma 1implies that the problem of finding the best policy can be
    reduced to finding π ∗ u , the best response to ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ´ , while π u ´ =
    π u ,∀ u ´ ≠u . Although this result is promising, from an implementation viewpoint,
    proposing a distributed solution for finding the best policy while requiring the
    same policy for all the agents is challenging. Recalling (18), in addition to
    the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer the action (the
    policy) of the other agents. The subsequent Corollary establishes a connection
    between this inference and solely relying on the local observations of the agents,
    thereby rendering it feasible. Corollary 2:With the same initialization of the
    belief function, { b u (0) } U−1 u=0 =b(0) , for a circularly symmetric DEC-POMDP,
    the local observation h u ( t ~ ) is a sufficient statistic for determining the
    optimal policy π ∗ . Proof:Assume that using a mechanism, the agents peruse the
    same policy π u ( t ~ ) , while they are learning the optimal policy π ∗ . Then,
    the multi-agent belief state b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) would be, b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=
    = = b u, t ~ ⎛ ⎝ s, ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ⎞ ⎠ P(s( t ~ )=s| h u ( t ~ ), b u (0), π u )
    b π u u (s, t ~ ).∀u∈U (34) View Source So, for each agent u , the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) and knowing its local policy π u is enough for determining the belief-state
    b π u u (s, t ~ ) . In a DEC-POMDP, the set { b π u u (s, t ~ ) } U−1 u=0 is sufficient
    statistic for the joint history H , and the proof is complete. Authors Figures

    of the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless communication technologies, emerging
    applications in the sixth-generation communication network (6G) that possess characteristics
    of low latency and high computation intensity, such as augmented reality, sensory
    interconnection, and holographic communication, are becoming mainstream IoT device
    applications. As the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless communication methods
    advance, new applications in the sixth-generation (6G) network—like augmented
    reality, sensory interconnection, and holographic communication—that have low
    latency and high computation intensity are starting to become commonplace IoT
    device applications. These applications primarily involve real-time interactions
    and require real-time processing of massive data, which is challenging to achieve
    on IoT devices with limited storage and computational resources. The emergence
    of MEC addresses this issue by sinking computational resources from cloud data
    centers to the network edge close to IoT devices. This enables devices to offload
    complex tasks to base stations (BS) at the network edge for rapid processing.
    Additionally, the fusion of IoT and social networks in 6G results in IoT devices
    no longer being independent entities; they establish social connections autonomously.
    IoT devices with social connections can communicate and exchange information with
    each other, thereby gaining additional benefits. During task offloading, IoT devices
    can evaluate the service quality of a base station based on information obtained
    from other devices and offload more tasks to stations with better service quality
    to maximize utility. The social effects between IoT devices impact other devices
    with social connections to the same IoT device, potentially increasing the offloading
    to the same base station. Therefore, considering the social effects of IoT devices
    in offloading problems is essential. Pricing, offloading volume, and delay energy
    cost are some of the aspects that are taken into consideration while evaluating
    the offloading techniques of IoT devices and the pricing of computing services
    at base stations. In order to optimize utility during task offloading, IoT devices
    can assess a base station''s service quality based on data gathered from other
    devices and offload more work to stations with higher service quality. Other devices
    that have social links to the same IoT device are impacted by the social impacts
    between IoT devices, which may increase the offloading to the same base station.
    Existing research on MEC task offloading primarily focuses on optimizing task
    offloading decisions when devices are within the service range of different base
    stations. This is achieved by designing algorithms that minimize system costs,
    energy consumption, or task execution delays. In the 6G era, to realize terahertz
    communication, a large number of base stations are densely deployed, with a density
    of approximately 40 to 50 BS/km2. This increases the overlapping areas of base
    station signal coverage, causing complications in offloading decisions, server
    selection, and competition for computational resources. A computer network that
    is designed to handle a large number of data messages with the least amount of
    delay is said to have low latency. These networks are made to handle tasks that
    need access to quickly changing data in almost real-time. Everyone understands
    that high latency results in additional lag, which significantly reduces the fun
    of gaming. reduced latency results in reduced lag and more fluid gaming. Studying
    task offloading methods in the overlapping areas of 6G-supported MEC systems is
    of great significance for improving network service quality. A recent development
    in computational analysis called \"Data Driven Computing\" makes use of supplied
    data to generate predictions directly. To prove its effectiveness, this thesis
    first defines Data-Driven solvers and provides instances of solved static mechanics
    problems. The technology known as \"mobile computing\" enables users to connect
    and transfer data, audio, and video across devices without being restricted by
    cables and cabling to a fixed location. This paper studies the task offloading
    problem in 6G MEC systems, which differs from 5G MEC systems in several aspects:
    6G MEC systems employ terahertz communication technology between IoT devices and
    base stations, which enhances network densification and leads to a substantial
    overlap in base station signal coverage areas; IoT devices are not independent
    entities in 6G but have social connections with each other. When studying the
    overlapping area task offloading problem in 6G, this paper comprehensively considers
    constraints such as latency, system energy consumption, social effects, and economic
    incentives. The objective is to maximize base station profit and IoT device utility.
    By utilizing a combination of many-to-one matching game and Stackelberg game methods
    from game theory, this paper proposes a game theory-based task offloading algorithm
    to optimize base station pricing strategies, IoT device base station selection
    strategies, and task offloading strategies. The value of one currency in relation
    to another is referred to as the bilateral exchange rate. As the most traded currency
    in the world, the US dollar (USD) is usually used to quote bilateral exchange
    rates. Investors, exporters, and importers may all plan without worrying about
    currency fluctuations when the system is steady. A central bank''s ability to
    change interest rates in response to changes in the economy is, nevertheless,
    constrained by a fixed-rate system. Additionally, when a currency becomes overvalued
    or undervalued, market adjustments are prevented by a fixed-rate regime. Simulation
    results demonstrate the convergence property of the proposed algorithm (OBGT).
    Compared to the pure Stackelberg game algorithm, the OBGT algorithm increases
    the average base station profit by approximately 30.3% and enhances the average
    IoT device utility by around 35.5%. This study aims to investigate the problem
    of task offloading in the setting of several Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    located inside overlapping base station coverage regions. The principal objective
    is to maximize the productivity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and augment
    base station profitability while upholding stringent task latency constraints.
    2 Related work Within the realm of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems, a considerable
    body of research has been dedicated to the pursuit of enhancing system utility
    through the optimization of user task offloading mechanisms. A kind of network
    architecture known as multi-access edge computing (MEC) offers cloud computing
    capabilities and an IT service environment at the network''s edge. MEC aims to
    lower latency, guarantee extremely effective network operation and service delivery,
    and enhance user satisfaction. The offloading problem in multi-edge server (MEC)
    systems was examined by the author [13], considering the dynamic character of
    the network environment and the stochasticity of task arrivals. The unpredictable
    nature of task arrivals and the dynamic nature of the network environment. The
    authors published a deep reinforcement learning method that considers task offloading
    decision-making in its entirety. The objective of this method is to effectively
    optimize these decisions in order to achieve long-term utility maximization. The
    topic of maximizing overall utility in latency-sensitive IoT systems was addressed
    by the Author [14], considering both static and dynamic task offloading request
    parameters. Maximizing long-term utility through effective optimization of these
    decisions is the aim of this approach. It was discussed how to optimize overall
    usefulness in latency-sensitive Internet of Things systems while considering request
    parameters for both static and dynamic job offloading. The researchers created
    techniques that may be used online and approximated algorithms that are both efficient.
    The researcher [15] conducted a study on work scheduling in collaborative edge
    servers and presented an online approach aimed at optimizing system utility while
    adhering to worst-case delay requirements and long-term energy consumption limitations.
    The previously described algorithms have been developed to maximize the effectiveness
    of work offloading tactics, IoT device base station selection strategies, and
    base station pricing methods for computing services. In terms of achieving lucrative
    compute job offloading in MEC systems, the OBGT algorithm outperformed simple
    Stackelberg game algorithms and random offloading techniques. The economic dimensions
    of MEC systems were mainly neglected in these studies, as they assumed that base
    stations would offer computing services to consumers without any associated costs.
    Nevertheless, the execution of offloading activities depletes the storage and
    computing capacity of base stations. Because base stations are inherently self-serving,
    it is conceivable that their readiness to participate in task offloading could
    depend on the availability of financial rewards sufficient to cover the costs
    of providing computing services. Game theory has been widely used to address issues
    related to job offloading in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environments. The provision
    of computer services, including as servers, storage, databases, networking, software,
    analytics, and intelligence, via the internet is known as cloud computing. The
    Stackelberg game model proposed by the author [16] focuses on the interaction
    between MEC servers and users, aiming to optimize utility for both entities. The
    researchers employed a differential evolution technique in order to derive equilibrium
    strategies. In their study, Author [17] examined the impact of device battery
    capacity and task delay limitations on mobile edge computing (MEC) offloading.
    They put forth an auction-based pricing model aimed at maximizing the profit of
    edge nodes. The task execution latency and energy consumption in Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) systems were taken into account by the Author [18]. They formulated the
    offloading problem as a reputation-based bargaining game with the objective of
    minimizing system delay and energy consumption. The aforementioned analyses failed
    to consider the practical situation of overlapping service regions resulting from
    the high concentration of base station deployments. By shifting computing to more
    capable nearby devices such as edge nodes, fog nodes, Cloudlets, base stations,
    or access points offloading is a way to boost the capabilities of mobile systems.
    Complications arise in the deployment and administration of devices and infrastructure
    for edge computing. The deployment of edge applications, software upgrades, remote
    device administration, and monitoring present difficulties. Presently, a cohort
    of academics has initiated an exploration of work offloading predicaments within
    contexts characterized by overlapping service sectors. By maximizing mobile device
    execution time and energy consumption, the offloading decision is determined.
    In contrast to Clone Cloud, MAUI enables coding level change of offloading programs
    to optimize mobile device energy savings. Data movement from one digital device
    to another is referred to as offloading. In order to expand the capabilities of
    mobile devices, this technique transfers computations to ingenious computers.
    Compared to the traditional client–server architecture, this approach is distinct.
    The task offloading problem was investigated literature [19] within the limitations
    of processing capabilities of edge servers and the presence of uncertainty in
    interference. The authors put forth a distributed algorithm with minimal complexity
    that converges to a pure Nash equilibrium. The objective of this method is to
    maximize user-perceived pleasure in regions that overlap. In their study, the
    Author [20] examined the joint optimization problem of network selection and task
    offloading for numerous devices situated in overlapping areas. They proposed an
    online approach aimed at minimizing the delay in task execution. The topic of
    overlapping area task offloading was conceptualized by the Author [21] as a non-cooperative
    game, wherein an analysis was conducted to quantify the delays associated with
    local execution and offloading. A non-cooperative game in which the local execution
    and offloading delays were measured through study. To reduce total job completion
    latency, the authors implemented a distributed work offloading system. Still,
    these literary works overlooked the social consequences of the interplay of different
    technologies. Including social utility could increase the efficiency of offloading
    computational activity. 3 System model 3.1 Network model Within the framework
    of the 6G network, a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system is comprised of a collection
    of N base stations that possess the capability of terahertz communication, alongside
    a multitude of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To provide effective processing
    for intricate jobs while utilizing the overlapping 6G network base station coverage.
    By resolving task offloading issues and considering task delay, energy consumption,
    societal effects, and financial incentives, a multi-access edge computing network
    architecture that incorporates many base stations and Internet of Things devices
    is built. To optimize base station profitability and IoT device utilities, pricing
    strategies for base stations, IoT device base station selection, and job offloading
    techniques are combined. The base stations exhibit heterogeneity in terms of bandwidth
    and communication capabilities, resulting in partial overlap of their respective
    service areas. Because of the base stations'' disparate communication and bandwidth
    capacities, there is some partial overlap between their separate service zones.
    Each base station is connected to an edge server that is computationally capable.
    The combination of base stations and edge servers is considered a single, cohesive
    unit. Base stations provide communication with Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
    while edge servers provide these IoT devices with processing power. The integration
    of base stations and their corresponding edge servers is regarded as a cohesive
    entity, wherein base stations enable connection with Internet of Things (IoT)
    devices, while edge servers offer computing capabilities to these IoT devices.
    The collection of base stations is represented as N = {1,2,…,n,…,N}, whereas the
    collection of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is represented as I = {1,2,…,i,…,I}.
    In the scenario when Internet of Things (IoT) devices are situated within regions
    that are encompassed by overlapping base station areas, the execution of a task
    that demands significant computational resources becomes necessary. The computationally
    demanding task for an IoT device i can be formally defined as a tuple G_i = {S_i,
    T_imax}, where S_i is the total quantity of the task data, and T_imax indicates
    the maximum acceptable delay for the task. Efficient local processing of activities
    poses a significant challenge due to the constrained battery and computational
    resources of IoT devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices possess the capability
    to autonomously choose a suitable base station among the available options that
    cover their designated service areas, hence facilitating the offloading of duties.
    The vital task of guaranteeing the secure and effective release of oil from an
    offshore production or storage unit to a shuttle tanker is carried out by an offloading
    system. A novel technique for offloading tasks in edge computing Task offloading
    is the technique by which user equipment handles certain computationally demanding
    activities and wirelessly transmits the data generated by these programs to an
    edge server in exchange for continuous or other indicator weighing. As shown in
    Fig. 1, IoT device MD1 is simultaneously covered by base stations BS1, BS2, and
    BS3. MD1 can choose to offload its task to BS1, BS2, or BS3. The coverage radius
    of base stations is denoted as dBS. When IoT device i is within the service area
    of base station n, \\({\\chi }_{i,n}=1\\); otherwise, \\({\\chi }_{i,n}=0\\).
    The base station selection strategy for IoT devices can be represented by a matrix
    \\({{\\varvec{\\eta}}}^{I\\times N}\\) where the selection strategy for IoT device
    i is \\({{\\varvec{\\eta}}}_{i}=\\left\\{{\\eta }_{i,1},\\cdots ,{\\eta }_{i,n},\\cdots
    ,{\\eta }_{i,N}\\right\\}\\), and \\({\\eta }_{i,n}\\) is a binary variable. When
    IoT device i chooses base station n for task offloading, \\({\\eta }_{i,n}=1\\),
    and vice versa, \\({\\eta }_{i,n}=0\\). Fig. 1 Multi-BS and Multi-IoT devices
    MEC system Full size image 3.2 Communication model The molecular absorption loss
    and free space loss of terahertz signals are considered when Internet of Things
    devices communicate with base stations. During the communication between IoT device
    i and base station n, the terahertz signals'' molecular absorption loss Molecular
    absorption is the process by which a molecule interacts with light and absorbs
    light energy of a specific wavelength, moving it from its ground state to an excited
    state with higher energy. When IoT devices communicate with base stations through
    terahertz signals, the molecular absorption loss and free space loss of terahertz
    signals are taken into account [21]. When IoT device i communicates with base
    station n, the molecular absorption loss of terahertz signals is expressed as
    follows: $${A}_{i,n}^{{\\text{abs}}}={e}^{{k}_{\\text{ats }}}(f){d}_{i,n}$$ (1)
    where f is the carrier frequency, \\({d}_{i,n}\\) represents the distance between
    IoT device i and base station n, \\({k}_{{\\text{abs}}}\\)(f) is the medium absorption
    coefficient., The free space loss of terahertz signals is expressed as follows:
    $${A}_{i,n}^{{\\text{los}}}={\\left(\\frac{4\\pi f{d}_{i,n}}{c}\\right)}^{2}$$
    (2) where c represents the speed of light. When IoT device i communicates with
    base station n using terahertz signals, the total path loss can be calculated
    as follows: $${A}_{i,n}^{\\text{total }}={A}_{i,n}^{{\\text{abs}}}+{A}_{i,n}^{\\text{los}}$$
    (3) When IoT device i selects base station n for task offloading, the data transmission
    rate of IoT device i is given by: $${r}_{i,n}={B}_{n}{{\\text{log}}}_{2}\\left(1+\\frac{{p}_{i}{G}_{{\\text{r}}}{G}_{{\\text{t}}}{\\left({A}_{i,n}^{\\text{total
    }}\\right)}^{-1}}{{\\sigma }^{2}}\\right)$$ (4) where \\({B}_{n}\\) is the bandwidth
    of base station \\(n\\), \\({p}_{i}\\) is the transmission power of IoT device
    i, \\({G}_{{\\text{r}}}\\) and \\({G}_{{\\text{t}}}\\) represent the receive antenna
    gain and transmit antenna gain, respectively, and \\({\\sigma }^{2}\\) is the
    variance of Gaussian noise. In the system, IoT devices perform fine-grained offloading,
    where a part of the compute-intensive task is offloaded to a base station, and
    the other part is processed locally. Assuming IoT device i offloads a task of
    size \\({D}_{i}\\), the uplink transmission delay for offloading the task to base
    station n is given by: $${T}_{i}^{{\\text{tran}}}=\\frac{{D}_{i}}{{r}_{i,n}}$$
    (5) The transmission energy consumed by IoT device i to transmit the task to the
    base station is given by: $${E}_{i}^{{\\text{tran}}}={p}_{i}{T}_{i}^{{\\text{tran}}}$$
    (6) 3.3 Computational model When a portion \\({D}_{i}\\) of the computation-intensive
    task is offloaded by IoT device i to the base station, the amount of local computation
    required becomes \\(\\Lambda \\left({S}_{i}-{D}_{i}\\right)\\). The local computation
    latency for IoT device i is expressed as: $${T}_{i}^{{\\text{joc}}}=\\frac{\\Lambda
    \\left({S}_{i}-{D}_{i}\\right)}{{f}_{i}}$$ (7) where \\(\\Lambda \\left({S}_{i}-{D}_{i}\\right)\\)
    represents the required computational resources for local computation, Λ denotes
    the number of CPU cycles needed per bit of data, and \\({f}_{i}\\) is the computational
    capacity of IoT device i. Similarly, the energy consumption of IoT device i for
    local computation can be represented as: $${E}_{i}^{\\text{loc }}={\\kappa }_{i}\\Lambda
    \\left({S}_{i}-{D}_{i}\\right){f}_{i}^{2}$$ (8) where \\({\\kappa }_{i}{f}_{i}{}^{2}\\)
    represents the energy consumption of IoT device i per unit of computational resource,
    and \\({\\kappa }_{i}\\) depends on the architecture of IoT device i. When a part
    of the task from IoT device i is offloaded to base station n for processing, the
    computation latency at base station n is given by: $${T}_{n}^{{\\text{ami}}}=\\frac{{Q}_{i}}{{L}_{n}}$$
    (9) where Qi is the computational resource required to complete Di, and Ln is
    the computational capacity of base station n. For base station n, the energy consumption
    to perform computation on the offloaded task from IoT device i is: $${E}_{{\\text{n}}}^{{\\text{omm}}}={\\alpha
    }_{n}{Q}_{i}$$ (10) where \\({\\alpha }_{n}\\) represents the energy consumption
    per unit of computational resource at base station n. The overall delay of task
    execution includes the latencies associated with local computing, task transmission,
    and edge computation. Given the premise that the task requiring significant computational
    resources can be concurrently done both locally and at the Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) edge, the overall latency for task execution is determined by the longer
    duration between the local computation delay and the combined latency of task
    transmission and edge computation. The total task execution latency for IoT device
    i can be expressed as: $${T}_{i}={\\text{max}}\\left\\{{T}_{i}^{\\text{loc }},\\left({T}_{i}^{{\\text{tran}}}+{T}_{n}^{{\\text{com}}}\\right)\\right\\}$$
    (11) 3.4 Utility and profit models Considering the rationality and self-interest
    of the MEC system, base stations need to charge a certain fee for providing computational
    services to IoT devices, in order to compensate for the costs incurred in processing
    tasks. Different wireless communication methods exist. These consist of Bluetooth,
    infrared, wireless networks, satellites, and mobile devices. Regretfully, a lot
    of businesses are unaware of the potential benefits or ways to employ this technology.
    The transfer of data and voice over a wireless network occurs without the need
    for cables or wires. Data is sent by electromagnetic signals that are broadcast
    from sending facilities to intermediate and end-user devices in lieu of a physical
    link. The pricing set by base stations for providing computational services to
    IoT devices is denoted as \\(P = \\{{P}_{1}, ...,{P}_{n}, ..., {P}_{N}\\},\\)
    where \\({P}_{n}\\) represents the computational service price of base station
    n. Each base station has different communication and computational capacities,
    allowing them to set different prices. In contrast, Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    will opt for the most advantageous base station for job offloading by considering
    the pricing of the available base stations. The quantity of data that is offloaded
    can be denoted as\\(D = \\{{D}_{1}, ...,{D}_{i}, ..., {D}_{I}\\}\\), where \\({D}_{i}\\)
    indicates the amount of data offloaded by IoT device i. To attain the objective
    of optimizing the usefulness of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the profitability
    of base stations, both IoT devices and base stations will develop methods that
    are advantageous to their respective interests. 3.4.1 Utility model The utility
    of IoT devices can be represented as the satisfaction derived from task offloading
    minus the cost of task execution. For an IoT device i belonging to the set I,
    the utility function can be expressed as follows: $${U}_{i}={F}_{i}-{C}_{i}$$
    (12) Here, \\({F}_{i}\\) represents the satisfaction function of IoT device i,
    and \\({C}_{i}\\) represents the cost function of IoT device i. The satisfaction
    function \\({F}_{i}\\) for IoT device i is defined as follows: $${F}_{i}=\\sum_{n=1}^{N}
    {\\eta }_{i,n}\\left({a}_{i}{D}_{i}-\\frac{1}{2}{b}_{i}{D}_{i}^{2}+\\sum_{j\\ne
    i} {\\eta }_{j,n}{\\omega }_{ij}{D}_{i}{D}_{j}\\right)$$ (13) where \\({\\eta
    }_{i}\\),n is a binary variable associated with the base station chosen by IoT
    device i. The first two terms in the parentheses of the satisfaction function
    represent the individual gains of IoT device i when offloading data amount \\({D}_{i}\\).
    Here, \\({a}_{i}\\) and \\({b}_{i}\\) are the satisfaction coefficient and sensitivity
    coefficient of IoT device i with respect to the offloaded data amount. Both \\({a}_{i}\\)
    and \\({b}_{i}\\) are greater than 0. Considering the social effects among IoT
    devices, they can derive additional benefits from information provided or shared
    by other devices. The last term in the satisfaction function reflects the social
    effect among users. It represents the extra benefit that IoT device i gains from
    other IoT devices with the same base station selection strategy. The social relationship
    between IoT devices i and j is defined as \\({\\omega }_{ij}\\), reflecting the
    strength of their connection. Additionally, the impact between IoT devices is
    mutual, meaning \\({\\omega }_{ij} = {\\omega }_{ji}\\), and a higher value of
    \\({\\omega }_{ij}\\), indicates a stronger relationship between IoT devices i
    and j, leading to a greater influence on each other. When IoT device offloads
    data amount \\({D}_{i}\\) to base station n for processing, it needs to purchase
    computing services from base station n. The cost function of IoT device i consists
    of two parts: One part is the cost of purchasing computing services from the base
    station, and the other part is the cost of local computation and data transmission
    for the task. This can be expressed as follows: $${C}_{i}=\\sum_{n=1}^{N} {\\eta
    }_{i,n}\\left({P}_{n}{D}_{i}+\\varepsilon {E}_{i}^{\\text{loc }}+\\varsigma {E}_{i}^{\\text{tran}}\\right)$$
    (14) where the cost paid to base station n is defined as \\({P}_{n}*{D}_{i}\\),
    \\(\\varepsilon \\) and \\({k}_{i}\\) are the unit costs of computing energy and
    transmission energy for IoT device i, respectively. Correspondingly, the utility
    function of IoT device i is given by: $${U}_{i}=\\sum_{n=1}^{N} {\\eta }_{i,n}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}{a}_{i}{D}_{i}-\\frac{1}{2}{b}_{i}{D}_{i}^{2}+\\sum_{j\\ne
    i} {\\eta }_{j,n}{\\omega }_{ij}{D}_{i}{D}_{j}-{P}_{n}{D}_{i}-\\\\ \\varepsilon
    {\\kappa }_{i}\\Lambda \\left({S}_{i}-{D}_{i}\\right){f}_{i}^{2}-\\zeta {p}_{i}\\frac{{D}_{i}}{{r}_{i,n}}\\end{array}\\right)$$
    (15) 3.4.2 Profit model The profit function of base station n is the difference
    between the revenue generated from providing computing services to IoT devices
    and the cost of processing tasks. Because it influences how well a computer can
    perform tasks, computing power is important. As a computer''s power improves,
    so do its processing speed and number of concurrent processes. Consequently, higher
    computational efficiency computers sometimes have higher prices than lower power
    processors. The profit function of base station n is defined as follows: $${U}_{n}=\\sum_{i=1}^{I}
    {\\eta }_{i,n}\\left({P}_{n}{D}_{i}-\\gamma {\\alpha }_{n}{Q}_{i}\\right)$$ (16)
    where the unit cost of computing energy consumption for base station n is defined
    as γ. 3.5 Problem description The objective of this study is to examine the issue
    of work offloading in the context of several Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    that are situated inside overlapping coverage regions of base stations. The primary
    goal is to optimize the efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and enhance
    the profitability of base stations, all while maintaining strict task latency
    limitations. The primary objective of base stations is to maximize their financial
    gains through the identification of the most advantageous pricing for computing
    services. Conversely, IoT devices strive to optimize their overall usefulness
    by carefully selecting base stations and implementing effective mechanisms for
    job offloading. The optimization problem for base station n can be formulated
    as follows: $$ \\begin{array}{*{20}l} {\\mathop {{\\text{max}}}\\limits_{{P_{n}
    }} U_{n} } \\hfill \\\\ {{\\text{s}}{\\text{. t}}{. }C1:P_{n} > 0,\\forall n \\in
    N} \\hfill \\\\ {{\\text{C2: }}0 \\le D_{i} \\le S_{i} ,\\forall i \\in I} \\hfill
    \\\\ {{\\text{C3: }}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{I} \\chi_{i,n} \\eta_{i,n}
    \\le M_{n} ,\\forall i \\in I} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} $$ (17) Constraint C1
    ensures that all base station computing service prices are greater than zero.
    Constraint C2 limits the offloaded data volume for each IoT device, ensuring that
    the offloaded data does not exceed the total size of its computational task. Constraint
    C3 indicates that base station n can provide computing services for a maximum
    of Mn IoT devices simultaneously. IoT devices aim to maximize their utility. The
    optimization problem for IoT device i is formulated as follows: $$ \\begin{array}{*{20}l}
    {\\mathop {{\\text{max}}}\\limits_{{\\eta_{i} ,D_{i} }} U_{i} } \\hfill \\\\ {{\\text{s}}{\\text{.
    t}}{. }C1:P_{n} > 0,\\forall n \\in N} \\hfill \\\\ {{\\text{C }}2:0 \\le D_{i}
    \\le S_{i} ,\\forall i \\in I} \\hfill \\\\ {{\\text{C3: }}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i
    = 1}^{I} \\chi_{i,n} \\eta_{i,n} \\le M_{n} ,\\forall i \\in I,\\forall n \\in
    N} \\hfill \\\\ {{\\text{C4: }}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{n = 1}^{N} \\chi_{i,n}
    \\eta_{i,n} = 1,\\forall i \\in I,\\forall n \\in N} \\hfill \\\\ {{\\text{C5:
    }}T_{i} \\le T_{i}^{max} ,\\forall i \\in I} \\hfill \\\\ {C6:\\eta_{i,n} \\in
    \\left\\{ {0,1} \\right\\},\\forall i \\in I} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} $$ (18)
    Constraint C4 ensures that each IoT device can only select one base station for
    task offloading. Constraint C5 defines the restriction on the total task execution
    latency, ensuring that the total task execution latency does not exceed the device''s
    maximum tolerable task delay. Constraint C6 specifies that \\({\\eta }_{i,n}\\)
    is a binary variable. In the optimization problem for IoT devices, there exists
    a strong coupling between the decisions of selecting a base station and offloading
    tasks. A matrix that shows the base station selection strategy for IoT devices
    can be used to represent the strategy. This optimization problem can be successfully
    solved by using a many-to-one matching game model to determine the best base station
    selection strategy for Internet of Things devices, assuming that the job offloading
    method is known. Assuming that the task offloading strategy is given, this optimization
    problem can be effectively addressed by formulating a many-to-one matching game
    model to obtain the optimal base station selection strategy for IoT devices. In
    the absence of any changes, the IoT devices’ matching strategy is updated. By
    repeating the exchange matching process until no blocking pairings remain, the
    matching game is stabilized, and the best base station selection method for Internet
    of Things devices is identified. The utility function for an IoT device is obtained
    after utilizing the base station selection method for the device. Based on the
    IoT devices'' base station selection strategy, a two-stage Stackelberg game model
    is established to further explore the interaction between IoT devices and their
    chosen base stations, leading to the determination of the optimal pricing strategy
    for base stations and the optimal task offloading strategy for IoT devices. 4
    Many-to-one matching game 4.1 Matching game model Matching games can be used to
    model allocation problems between two different groups of people based on how
    their preferences relate to each other [22]. It is used in economics to comprehend
    economic behaviors, including those of markets, businesses, and consumers. Additionally,
    game theory has been widely applied in the social sciences. A variety of scenarios
    are outlined and their most likely outcomes are predicted using game theory. The
    problem of choosing a base station for an IoT device can be thought of as a matching
    game between IoT devices and base stations. Definition 1: Given two disjoint sets
    of participants N and I, a many-to-one matching function φ is a mapping from the
    power set of N ∪ I to N ∪ I, such that for all i ∈ I and n ∈ N: (1) \\(\\varphi
    (i)\\in N,\\varphi (n)\\in I\\); (2) \\(\\left| {\\varphi \\left( i \\right)}
    \\right| = 1,\\left| {\\varphi \\left( n \\right)} \\right| \\le M_{n}\\); (3)
    \\(\\varphi (i)=n\\iff i\\in \\varphi (n)\\)。 Condition (1) says that each IoT
    device is matched with a subset of base stations and that each base station is
    matched with a subset of IoT devices. Condition (2) says that each IoT device
    can only be paired with one base station, and that a base station can provide
    computer services to a maximum of Mn IoT devices. Condition (3) makes it clear
    that IoT gadget i and base station n are compatible with each other. The symbol
    ≻ represents the preference relation between base stations and IoT devices. For
    any IoT devices \\(i,{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\in I,{>}_{i}\\) represents the
    preference of IoT device i for different base stations. For any two base stations
    n and \\(n,{n}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\in N\\left(n\\ne {n}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)\\)
    and matching functions φ and φ'', where \\(,n\\in \\varphi (i),{n}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\in
    {\\varphi }^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}(i)\\) the preference relation of IoT device
    i is as follows: $$(n,\\varphi ){\\succ }_{i}\\left({n}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}},{\\varphi
    }^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)\\iff {U}_{i}(n)>{U}_{i}\\left({n}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)$$
    (19) where \\({U}_{i}(n)\\) and \\({U}_{i}\\left({n}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)\\)
    represent the utility of IoT device i when choosing base station n and n'', respectively.
    Equation (19) indicates that IoT device i prefers selecting base station n over
    n'' because the utility obtained when matched with base station n is greater than
    that obtained when matched with base station n''. The preference of base station
    n for different IoT devices is represented by ≻n. For two sets of IoT devices
    I1 and I2 ⊆ I, and two matching functions φ and φ'', where I1 ∈ φ(n) and I2 ∈ φ''(n),
    the preference relation of base station n can be expressed as follows: $$\\left({I}_{1},\\varphi
    \\right){>}_{n}\\left({I}_{2},{\\varphi }^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)\\iff
    {U}_{n}\\left({I}_{1}\\right)>{U}_{n}\\left({I}_{2}\\right)$$ (20) Definition
    2 Given a matching function φ and two matching pairs \\((i, n)\\) and\\((i{\\prime}
    , n{\\prime} )\\), where\\(n\\in \\varphi (i), n{\\prime}\\in \\varphi (i{\\prime}
    )\\),\\(n\\notin \\varphi (i{\\prime} )\\), and \\(n{\\prime}\\notin \\varphi
    (i),\\) the exchange matching is represented as \\({\\varphi }_{i}^{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}=\\varphi
    {\\prime}/\\{(i, n), (i{\\prime}, n{\\prime} )\\}\\cup \\{(i, n{\\prime} ), (i{\\prime},
    n)\\}.\\) In an exchange matching, with other IoT devices'' base station selection
    strategies remaining unchanged, two IoT devices i and i'' exchange the base stations
    they are connected to. If the exchange matching is successful, IoT devices i and
    i'' form a blocking pair. The definition of a blocking pair is as follows. Definition
    3 Given a matching function φ and two IoT devices \\((i, i{\\prime} ),\\) if there
    exist\\(n\\in \\varphi (i),{n}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\in \\varphi \\left({i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)\\),
    and satisfy: (1) \\(\\forall x\\in \\left\\{i,{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}},n,{n}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right\\}\\)
    \\({U}_{x}\\left({\\varphi }_{i}^{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}\\right)\\ge {U}_{x}(\\varphi
    )\\); (2) \\(\\exists x\\in \\left\\{i,{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}},n,{n}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right\\}\\)
    \\({U}_{x}\\left({\\varphi }_{i}^{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}\\right)\\ge {U}_{x}(\\varphi
    )\\)。 Then the exchange matching \\({\\varphi }_{i}^{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}\\)
    holds. The pair of IoT devices \\(\\left(i,{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)\\)
    is marked as a blocking pair for the matching function φ. Condition (1) implies
    that the participants'' utilities cannot decrease after the exchange matching
    \\({\\varphi }_{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\) condition (2)
    signifies that at least one participant''s utility increases after the exchange
    matching \\({\\varphi }_{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\). The
    exchange operation not only enhances participants'' utilities but also avoids
    cycles between two equivalent matchings. Based on Definition 3, the definition
    of bilateral exchange stability for the proposed many-to-one matching is as follows.
    Definition 4 A many-to-one matching is said to be bilaterally exchange stable
    if and only if there are no blocking pairs in the many-to-one matching model.
    4.2 Optimal base station selection algorithm based on exchange matching To achieve
    stable matching, an optimal base station selection algorithm based on exchange
    matching is proposed. In an exchange matching, two IoT devices, i and i'', swap
    the base stations they are linked to, while the base station selection techniques
    of the other IoT devices stay the same. IoT devices i and i'' create a blocking
    pair if the exchange matching process is successful. A blocking exchange matching
    is defined and suggested to be used. The specific steps are outlined in Algorithm
    1. Initially, IoT devices and base stations are randomly matched with each other.
    Next, two IoT devices are randomly selected for exchange matching, and based on
    Definition 3, it is checked whether these two IoT devices form a blocking pair.
    If a blocking pair is identified, the matching strategy of the IoT devices is
    updated; otherwise, the matching remains unchanged. Finally, the exchange matching
    process is repeated until no blocking pairs exist, thereby achieving stability
    in the matching game and determining the optimal base station selection strategy
    for IoT devices. Algorithm 1 Optimal Base Station Selection Algorithm Based on
    Exchange Matching Full size image Assuming Algorithm 1 converges after T1 iterations,
    with Θ exchange matches in each iteration, the time complexity of the algorithm
    is O(T1Θ). In the worst-case, IoT device i matches with all possible matching
    IoT devices, considering all potential exchange match combinations. In this scenario,
    the time complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(T1I(I-1)/2). Lemma 1: Algorithm 1 can
    converge to a stable matching. Proof: Let''s assume that after the exchange matching
    operation between IoT devices i and \\({i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\), their utility
    functions are represented as \\({U}_{i}\\left({\\varphi }_{i}^{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}\\right)\\)
    and \\({U}_{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}\\left({\\varphi }_{i}^{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}\\right)\\).
    According to Definition 3, it is known that the utilities of IoT devices satisfy
    \\({U}_{i}\\left({\\varphi }_{i}^{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}\\right)\\ge {U}_{i}(\\varphi
    ),{U}_{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}\\left({\\varphi }_{i}^{{i}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}}\\right)\\ge
    {U}_{i}(\\varphi )\\), and at least one of the IoT devices experiences an increase
    in utility after the exchange operation. Furthermore, the potential number of
    matches between IoT devices and base stations is limited. Therefore, Algorithm
    1 will terminate after a finite number of iterations and converge to a stable
    matching. Thus, Lemma 1 is proven. 5 Two-stage Stackelberg game 5.1 Stackelberg
    game model Building upon the IoT devices'' base station selection strategies outlined
    in Sect. 4, we formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game model for IoT devices''
    task offloading and their selected base stations'' pricing strategies. In this
    model, base stations act as leaders, while IoT devices act as followers. The leaders
    aim to maximize their own profits, while the followers aim to maximize their own
    utilities. In the first stage, each base station sets its computation service
    prices and communicates them to the IoT devices. In the second stage, IoT devices
    make task offloading decisions based on the computation service pricing set by
    the base stations. The leader and the follower adjust their strategies based on
    each other''s actions until their strategies no longer change. To tackle this,
    a many-to-one matching game paradigm was created. The goal of the BSSM algorithm
    is to optimize base station selection processes for Internet of Things devices.
    A two-stage Stackelberg game was used to study the relationship between base station
    pricing methods and offloading tactics, which resulted in the creation of the
    TOBR and OBGT algorithms. After obtaining the IoT device''s base station selection
    strategy using Algorithm 1, the utility function for IoT device i when selecting
    base station n for task offloading can be expressed as follows:\" $${U}_{i}\\left({P}_{n},{D}_{i},{D}_{-i}\\right)=\\&{a}_{i}{D}_{i}-\\frac{1}{2}{b}_{i}{D}_{i}^{2}+\\sum_{j\\ne
    i,{\\eta }_{j,n}=1} {\\omega }_{ij}{D}_{i}{D}_{j}- {P}_{n}{D}_{i}-\\varepsilon
    {\\kappa }_{i}\\Lambda \\left({S}_{i}-{D}_{i}\\right){f}_{i}^{2}-\\zeta {p}_{i}\\frac{{D}_{i}}{{r}_{i,n}}$$
    (21) Here, D-i represents the task offloading strategy of other IoT devices except
    for IoT device i. Additionally, the profit function of base station n can be expressed
    as follows: $${U}_{n}\\left({P}_{n},D\\right)=\\sum_{{\\eta }_{i,n}=1} \\left({P}_{n}{D}_{i}-{\\gamma
    }_{{\\alpha }_{n}}{Q}_{i}\\right)$$ (22) The optimization problem for the leader
    (base station) can be defined as follows: $$ \\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\mathop
    {{\\text{max}}}\\limits_{{P_{n} }} U_{n} \\left( {P_{n} ,D} \\right)} \\\\ {{\\text{s}}{\\text{.
    t}}{. }P_{n} > 0,\\forall n \\in N} \\\\ {0 \\le D_{i} \\le S_{i} ,\\forall i
    \\in I} \\\\ \\end{array} $$ (23) The follower (IoT device), knowing the leader''s
    pricing strategy, optimizes its utility by changing its own offloading strategy.
    The optimization problem for the follower can be described as follows: $$ \\begin{array}{*{20}c}
    {} & {\\mathop {{\\text{max}}}\\limits_{{D_{i} }} U_{i} \\left( {P_{n} ,D_{i}
    ,D_{ - i} } \\right)} \\\\ {{\\text{ s}}{\\text{. t}}{. }} & {P_{n} > 0,\\forall
    n \\in N} \\\\ {} & {0 \\le D_{i} \\le S_{i} ,\\forall i \\in I} \\\\ {} & {T_{i}
    \\le T_{i}^{{{\\text{max}}}} ,\\forall i \\in I} \\\\ \\end{array} $$ (24) 5.2
    Second-stage Stackelberg game Stackelberg equilibrium refers to a scenario in
    the Stackelberg game where both the leader and the follower update their strategies
    based on each other''s strategies until their strategies remain unchanged and
    neither can unilaterally change their strategy to increase their utility. The
    Stackelberg equilibrium for the two-stage Stackelberg game between IoT devices
    and base stations is defined as follows:\" Definition 5: In a Stackelberg game,
    the base station pricing strategy \\({P}^{*}=\\left\\{{P}_{1}^{*},\\cdots \\right.,\\left.{P}_{n}^{*},\\cdots
    ,{P}_{N}^{*}\\right\\}\\) and the IoT device task offloading strategy \\({D}^{*}=\\left\\{{D}_{1}^{*},\\cdots
    \\right.,\\left.{D}_{i}^{*},\\cdots ,{D}_{I}^{*}\\right\\}\\) achieve a Stackelberg
    equilibrium if and only if: $$ U_{i} \\left( {P_{n}^{*} ,D_{i}^{*} ,D_{ - i}^{*}
    } \\right) \\ge U_{i} \\left( {P_{n}^{*} ,D_{i} ,D_{ - i}^{*} } \\right)U_{n}
    \\left( {P_{n}^{*} ,D^{*} } \\right) \\ge U_{n} \\left( {P_{n} ,D^{*} } \\right)
    $$ (25) where \\({P}^{*}=\\left\\{{P}_{1}^{*},\\cdots ,{P}_{n}^{*},\\cdots ,{P}_{N}^{*}\\right\\}\\)
    represents the optimal pricing strategy for the base stations, \\({D}^{*}=\\left\\{{D}_{1}^{*},\\cdots
    ,{D}_{i}^{*},\\cdots ,{D}_{I}^{*}\\right\\}\\) represents the optimal task offloading
    strategy for IoT devices, and \\({D}_{-i}^{*}=\\left\\{{D}_{1}^{*},\\cdots ,{D}_{i-1}^{*},{D}_{i+1}^{*},\\cdots
    ,{D}_{I}^{*}\\right\\}\\) represents the optimal task offloading strategies for
    other IoT devices excluding IoT device i. By setting the first derivative of the
    IoT device utility function to zero, the optimal task offloading strategy for
    IoT devices can be obtained: $$\\&\\frac{\\partial {U}_{i}\\left({P}_{n},{D}_{i},{{\\varvec{D}}}_{-i}\\right)}{\\partial
    {D}_{i}}={a}_{i}-{b}_{i}{D}_{i}+\\sum_{j\\ne i,{\\eta }_{j,n}=1} {\\omega }_{ij}{D}_{j}-{P}_{n}+\\varepsilon
    {\\kappa }_{i}\\Lambda {f}_{i}^{2}-\\zeta \\frac{{p}_{i}}{{r}_{i,n}}=0$$ (26)
    The optimal task offloading strategy for IoT device i can be represented as $$
    D_{i}^{*} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {0,} \\hfill & {\\theta \\le 0}
    \\hfill \\\\ {\\theta ,} \\hfill & {0 < \\theta < S_{i} } \\hfill \\\\ {S_{i}
    ,} \\hfill & {\\theta \\ge S_{i} } \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (27)
    where \\(\\theta =\\frac{{\\Gamma }_{i}-{P}_{n}}{{b}_{i}}+{\\sum }_{j\\ne i,{\\eta
    }_{j,n}=1} \\frac{{\\omega }_{ij}}{{b}_{i}}{D}_{j}\\). The optimal task offloading
    decision for IoT device i can be divided into two parts: the first part is the
    first term of θ, which represents the individual demand of IoT device i, where
    \\({\\Gamma }_{i}={b}_{i}+\\varepsilon {\\kappa }_{i}\\Lambda {f}_{i}^{2}-\\zeta
    \\frac{{p}_{i}}{{r}_{i,n}}\\); the second part is the second term of θ, which
    represents the social influence on IoT device i. Assumption 1: For all IoT devices\\(i,i\\in
    I,{\\sum }_{j\\ne i,{\\eta }_{j,n}=1} \\frac{{\\omega }_{ij}}{{b}_{i}}<1\\). Assumption
    1 is an important condition for the existence of the second-stage Stackelberg
    equilibrium. Based on Assumption 1, it can be deduced that the social influence
    on IoT device i, \\(\\sum_{{j \\ne i,\\eta_{j,n} = 1}} \\frac{{\\omega_{ij} }}{{b_{i}
    }}D_{j} \\le \\sum_{{j \\ne i,\\eta_{j,n} = 1}} \\frac{{\\omega_{ij} }}{{b_{i}
    }}S_{j} < S_{j}\\). This indicates that the social influence on IoT devices will
    not infinitely increase as the data offloading of other IoT devices increases.
    If Assumption 1 does not hold, IoT devices could unconditionally increase their
    data offloading size without considering the computation service pricing by the
    base station. Lemma 2: Under the condition of Assumption 1, the proposed Stackelberg
    game model has a unique Stackelberg equilibrium in the second stage. Proof: The
    second derivative of the utility function for IoT device i is: $$\\frac{{\\partial
    }^{2}{U}_{i}\\left({P}_{n},{D}_{i},{{\\varvec{D}}}_{-i}\\right)}{\\partial {D}_{i}^{2}}=-{b}_{i}<0$$
    (28) From Eq. (28), it is evident that the utility function of IoT device i is
    a concave function with respect to \\({D}_{i}\\), and thus a Stackelberg equilibrium
    exists in the second stage of the game. Next, we will prove the uniqueness of
    this Stackelberg equilibrium. Let''s denote matrices as \\(\\mathrm{B }=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}{b}_{1}&
    0& \\cdots & 0\\\\ 0& {b}_{2}& \\cdots & 0\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots
    \\\\ 0& 0& \\cdots & {b}_{I}\\end{array}\\right],{\\varvec{W}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}0&
    {\\omega }_{12}& \\cdots & {\\omega }_{1I}\\\\ {\\omega }_{21}& 0& \\cdots & {\\omega
    }_{2I}\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ {\\omega }_{I1}& {\\omega
    }_{I2}& \\cdots & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\) The Jacobian matrix of the utility
    function for IoT devices can be expressed as:\" $$\\nabla U({\\varvec{D}})=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}-{b}_{1}&
    {\\omega }_{12}& \\cdots & {\\omega }_{1I}\\\\ {\\omega }_{21}& -{b}_{2}& \\cdots
    & {\\omega }_{2I}\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ {\\omega }_{I1}&
    {\\omega }_{I2}& \\cdots & -{b}_{I}\\end{array}\\right]=-[B-W]$$ (29) According
    to hypothesis 1, it can be deduced that: $$[{\\varvec{B}}-{\\varvec{W}}{]}_{ii}>\\sum_{j\\ne
    i,{\\eta }_{j,n}=1} \\left|[{\\varvec{B}}-{\\varvec{W}}{]}_{ij}\\right|$$ (30)
    \\([B-W{]}_{ij}\\) represents the element in the ith row and jth column of the
    [B − W] matrix. Therefore, [B − W] is a diagonally dominant matrix. Due to the
    equal influence among socially connected IoT devices, i.e., \\({\\omega }_{ij}={\\omega
    }_{ji}\\) it follows that \\([B-W{]}^{{\\text{T}}}\\) is also a diagonally dominant
    matrix. The matrix \\(\\nabla U(D)+\\nabla {U}^{{\\text{T}}}(D)=-[B-W]-[B-W{]}^{{\\text{T}}}\\)
    is symmetric and strictly diagonally dominant. A symmetric matrix that is both
    strictly diagonally dominant and has non-negative diagonal elements is positive
    definite. However, in the matrix \\(\\nabla U(D)+\\nabla {U}^{{\\text{T}}}(D)\\),
    the diagonal elements are negative, indicating that the matrix is negative definite.
    The Jacobian matrix \\(\\nabla U(D)\\) of the IoT device utility function is strictly
    diagonally concave. Therefore, the second-stage Stackelberg equilibrium is both
    existent and unique. This establishes the validity of Lemma 2. Lemma 3 In the
    presence of the optimal task offloading strategies of IoT devices, the first-stage
    Stackelberg game exhibits a unique Stackelberg equilibrium. Proof: According to
    Eq. (27), with the optimal task offloading strategies of IoT devices known, the
    profit function of the leader can be computed as follows $$\\begin{aligned}{U}_{n}\\left({P}_{n},{D}^{*}\\right)&=
    \\sum_{{\\eta }_{i,n}=1} \\left({P}_{n}{D}_{i}^{*}-{\\gamma }_{{\\alpha }_{n}}{Q}_{i}\\right)\\\\
    &= \\sum_{{\\eta }_{i,n}=1} {P}_{n}\\left(\\frac{{\\Gamma }_{i}-{P}_{n}}{{b}_{i}}+\\sum_{j\\ne
    i,{\\eta }_{j,n}=1} \\frac{{\\omega }_{ij}}{{b}_{i}}{D}_{j}^{*}\\right)\\\\ &\\quad
    -\\gamma \\sum_{{\\eta }_{i,n}=1} {\\alpha }_{n}{Q}_{i}\\end{aligned}$$ (31) The
    first derivative of the leader''s profit function with respect to \\({P}_{n}\\)
    is: $$\\frac{\\partial {U}_{n}\\left({P}_{n},{{\\varvec{D}}}^{*}\\right)}{\\partial
    {P}_{n}}=\\sum_{{\\eta }_{i,n}=1} \\left(\\frac{{\\Gamma }_{i}}{{b}_{i}}+\\sum_{j\\ne
    i,{\\eta }_{j,n}=1} \\frac{{\\omega }_{ij}}{{b}_{i}}{D}_{j}^{*}-\\frac{2{P}_{n}}{{b}_{i}}\\right)$$
    (32) The second order derivative of the leader''s profit function with respect
    to \\({P}_{n}\\) is: $$\\frac{{\\partial }^{2}\\left({P}_{n},{{\\varvec{D}}}^{*}\\right)}{\\partial
    {P}_{n}{}^{2}}=-\\frac{2}{{b}_{i}}<0$$ (33) From Eq. (33), it can be observed
    that the leader''s profit function is a strictly concave function with respect
    to \\({P}_{n}\\). Therefore, a unique Stackelberg equilibrium exists in the first
    stage of the Stackelberg game, and Lemma 3 is proven. When the leader obtains
    the optimal offloading strategies of the followers, it needs to adjust the computation
    service pricing to maximize its profit. To study the effect of pricing on the
    followers'' task offloading strategies, let''s assume that two IoT devices, MD1
    and MD2, simultaneously choose base station n for task offloading, where \\({\\Gamma
    }_{1}>{\\Gamma }_{2}.\\) The optimal task offloading strategies for IoT devices
    MD1 and MD2 are: $$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}{D}_{1}^{*}=\\frac{{\\Gamma }_{1}-{P}_{n}}{{b}_{1}}+\\frac{{\\omega
    }_{12}}{{b}_{1}}{D}_{2}^{*}\\\\ {D}_{2}^{*}=\\frac{{\\Gamma }_{2}-{P}_{n}}{{b}_{2}}+\\frac{{\\omega
    }_{21}}{{b}_{2}}{D}_{1}^{*}\\end{array}\\right.$$ (34) Since MD1 and MD2 have
    the same social impact on each other, D1* and D2* can be rewritten as $$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}{D}_{1}^{*}=\\frac{\\left({\\Gamma
    }_{1}-{P}_{n}\\right){b}_{2}+\\left({\\Gamma }_{2}-{P}_{n}\\right){\\omega }_{12}}{{b}_{1}{b}_{2}-
    {{\\omega }_{12}}^{2}}\\\\ {D}_{2}^{*}=\\frac{\\left({\\Gamma }_{2}-{P}_{n}\\right){b}_{2}+\\left({\\Gamma
    }_{1}-{P}_{n}\\right){\\omega }_{12}}{{b}_{1}{b}_{2}-{{\\omega }_{12}}^{2}}\\end{array}\\right.$$
    (35) From Eq. (35), it can be observed that as the computing service price \\({P}_{n}\\)
    increases, the amount of data unloaded by IoT devices gradually decreases. The
    computing service price \\({P}_{n}\\) satisfies \\(0<{P}_{n}<{P}_{n}{}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}},{P}_{n}{}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\in
    \\left(0,{\\Gamma }_{1}\\right)\\). In this case, the optimal task offloading
    decisions for both IoT devices can be calculated using Eq. (27). When \\({P}_{n}{}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\le
    {P}_{n}<{\\Gamma }_{1}\\), the task offloading decision for one of the IoT devices
    will decrease to 0. When \\({P}_{n}\\ge {\\Gamma }_{1}\\), the task offloading
    decisions for all IoT devices will become 0. The set In represents the collection
    of IoT devices that choose to offload tasks to base station n. The set H consists
    of IoT devices with task offloading strategies greater than 0, denoted as \\(H=\\left\\{i\\in
    {I}_{n}\\mid \\right.\\left.{D}_{i}^{*}>0\\right\\}\\). The θ in Eq. (27) can
    be expressed in matrix form as \\({B}_{H}{D}_{H}^{*}={\\Gamma }_{H}-{P}_{n}{1}_{H}+{W}_{H}{D}_{H}^{*}\\),
    where \\({D}_{H}^{*}={\\left({D}_{i}^{*}\\right)}_{i\\in H}\\), vector \\({\\Gamma
    }_{H}={\\left({\\Gamma }_{i}\\right)}_{i\\in H}\\), and \\({1}_{H}=(\\mathrm{1,1},\\cdots
    ,1{)}^{{\\text{T}}}\\). According to hypothesis 1, it can be deduced that \\({\\left[{B}_{H}-{W}_{H}\\right]}_{ii}>{\\sum
    }_{j\\ne i,{\\eta }_{j,n}=1} \\left|{\\left[{B}_{H}-{W}_{H}\\right]}_{ij}\\right|,\\left[{B}_{H}-{W}_{H}\\right]\\),
    indicating that the diagonal elements of the \\(\\left[{B}_{H}-{W}_{H}\\right]\\)
    matrix are non-negative and that it is a symmetric diagonally dominant matrix.
    Consequently, the \\(\\left[{B}_{H}-{W}_{H}\\right]\\) matrix is positive definite
    and invertible. In Eq. (27), the optimal task offloading strategy for IoT devices
    can be expressed in the following matrix form: $$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}{D}_{H}^{*}={\\left({B}_{H}-{W}_{H}\\right)}^{-1}\\left({\\Gamma
    }_{H}-{P}_{n}{1}_{H}\\right)\\\\ {D}_{{I}_{n}-H}^{*}={0}_{{I}_{n}-H}\\end{array}\\right.$$
    (36) In this case, vector \\({0}_{{I}_{n}-H}\\) is composed of 0 s, where In-H
    represents the number of 0 s. When the computation service pricing is set to 0,
    the task offloading decisions for IoT devices are all greater than 0. According
    to Eq. (36), it can be observed that as the computation service pricing by base
    station n increases to \\({P}_{n,i}\\), the task offloading strategy for IoT device
    i becomes 0. The computation service pricing \\({P}_{n,i}\\) is: $${P}_{n,i}\\left({B}_{H},{W}_{H},H\\right)=\\frac{{\\left({B}_{H}-{W}_{H}\\right)}_{i}^{-1}{\\Gamma
    }_{H}}{{\\left({B}_{H}-{W}_{H}\\right)}_{i}^{-1}{1}_{H}}$$ (37) When the set of
    IoT devices H1 equals to the set I, then: $${p}_{1}=\\underset{i\\in {H}_{1}}{{\\text{min}}}
    {P}_{n,i}\\left({B}_{{H}_{1}},{W}_{{H}_{1}},{H}_{1}\\right)$$ (38) $${n}_{1}={\\text{arg}}\\underset{i\\in
    {H}_{1}}{{\\text{min}}} {P}_{n,i}\\left({B}_{{H}_{1}},{W}_{{H}_{1}},{H}_{1}\\right)$$
    (39) The IoT device set \\({H}_{k+1}={H}_{k}-\\left\\{{n}_{k}\\right\\}\\) and
    as the set \\({B}_{{H}_{k+1}},{W}_{{H}_{k+1}}\\) is updated, the sets \\({H}_{k+1}\\)
    are also updated. Therefore, we have: $${p}_{k+1}=\\underset{i\\in {H}_{k+1}}{{\\text{min}}}
    {P}_{n,i}\\left({B}_{{H}_{k+1}},{W}_{{H}_{k+1}},{H}_{k+1}\\right)$$ (40) $${n}_{k+1}={\\text{arg}}\\underset{i\\in
    {H}_{k+1}}{{\\text{min}}} {P}_{n,i}\\left({B}_{{H}_{k+1}},{W}_{{H}_{k+1}},{H}_{{H}_{k+1}}\\right)$$
    (41) The impact of computation service pricing on IoT devices can be summarized
    as follows: When the computation service pricing \\({P}_{n}\\in \\left[0,{\\Gamma
    }_{1}\\right]\\), based on Eqs. (38) and (40), the computation service pricing
    can be represented as\\({p}_{0}=0<{p}_{1}<{p}_{2}<\\cdots {p}_{In}<{p}_{{I}_{n}+1}={{\\text{max}}}_{i\\in
    {I}_{n}} {\\Gamma }_{i}\\). The pricing of computation services can be divided
    into multiple intervals like:\\(\\left[0,{p}_{1}\\right)\\cup \\left[{p}_{1},{p}_{2}\\right)\\cup
    \\cdots \\cup \\left[{p}_{k},{p}_{k+1}\\right)\\cup \\cdots \\cup \\left[{p}_{In},{p}_{In+1}\\right)\\).
    For any pricing interval\\({(p}_{k},{p}_{k+1})\\), there exists a task offloading
    strategy for IoT device \\(\\left(i\\in {H}_{k}\\right)\\) given by\\({D}_{i}^{*}={\\left[{\\left({B}_{{H}_{k}}-{W}_{{H}_{k}}\\right)}^{-1}\\left({\\Gamma
    }_{{H}_{k}}-{P}_{n}{1}_{{H}_{k}}\\right)\\right]}_{i}\\), where \\({D}_{i}^{*}\\)
    is the indicator vector and the task offloading strategy for other IoT devices.
    When the base station''s computation service pricing \\({P}_{n}\\ge {{\\text{max}}}_{i\\in
    {I}_{n}} {\\Gamma }_{i}\\) all IoT devices… (The text seems to be cut off at this

    Algorithm design Lemma 2 establishes the existence of a singular Stackelberg equilibrium
    inside the second stage of Stackelberg games. A suggested task offloading technique,
    known as the Task Offloading technique based on Best Response (TOBR), is put forth
    as a means to attain the Stackelberg equilibrium. The primary methodology is defined
    in Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2: Task Offloading Algorithm based on Best Response
    Full size image 6 Simulation validation 6.1 Simulation experiment design In order
    to assess the efficacy of the suggested BSSM algorithm, TOBR algorithm, and OBGT
    algorithm, pertinent simulation experiments were devised. The effectiveness of
    the proposed TOBR, OBGT, and BSSM algorithms, relevant simulation experiments
    were developed. A Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system with five base stations and
    one hundred Internet of Things (IoT) devices is described in the article. The
    comparatively low complexity of the BSSM algorithm allows for steady matching.
    The article outlines a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system consisting of five base
    stations and a total of 100 Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Each base station
    has a service radius of 100 m, a communication bandwidth of 10 GHz, and receiving
    and transmitting antenna gains of \\({G}_{r}={G}_{t}=20{\\text{dBi}}\\). The value
    of the channel noise, denoted as σ2, is − 40 dB, while the absorption coefficient
    of the medium, represented as kabs, is equal to 0.0033. The carrier frequency,
    denoted as f, is configured to a value of 0.3 THz, as stated in references [23,
    24]. The coefficients \\({a}_{i}\\) and \\({b}_{i}\\) in the utility function
    of IoT devices follow normal distributions \\(N\\left({\\mu }_{a},1\\right)\\)
    and \\(N\\left({\\mu }_{b},1\\right)\\), respectively. To demonstrate the social
    effects brought about by the social connections among IoT devices, an Erdős–Rényi
    (ER) random graph model was used to generate a social relationship graph among
    IoT devices. An Erdős–Rényi (ER) random graph model was used to create a social
    relationship graph among IoT devices in order to examine the social consequences
    caused by the social relationships among IoT devices. The graph''s nodes stand
    in for Internet of Things devices, while the connecting edges that join two nodes
    show their social relationships. One of two roughly related models for creating
    random graphs or the evolution of a random network is known as the Erd\\s–Rényi
    model. Nodes in the graph represent IoT devices, and connecting edges between
    two nodes indicate social connections between them. The probability of an edge
    connecting two nodes, denoted as\\({\\text{N}}\\left({\\mu }_{\\omega }\\right.\\),
    0.01) R, represents the likelihood of social connections between IoT devices.
    If there is a social connection between IoT devices, it follows a normal distribution
    \\(N\\left({\\mu }_{a},1\\right)\\) and \\(N\\left({\\mu }_{b},1\\right)\\) Here,
    \\({\\mu }_{a}=30,{\\mu }_{b}=30,{\\mu }_{\\omega }={10}^{[6]}\\) were set [6].
    Unless otherwise specified, the default configuration assumes five base stations,
    100 IoT devices, and a probability of social connections among IoT devices \\(R=0.6\\)
    Key simulation parameters are listed in Table 1 [8, 24]. Table 1 Simulation parameter

    distribution function (CDF) of exchange operations for varying numbers of IoT
    devices. In this context,\\(I=\\{\\mathrm{30,50,100}\\}\\) corresponds to IoT
    device quantities of 30, 50, and 100, respectively. Fig. 2 Impact of different
    computing service prices on IoT device data offloading size Full size image From
    Fig. 2, it is evident that the frequency of exchange operations correlates positively
    with the number of IoT devices. With 100 IoT devices, for instance, convergence
    can be achieved within a maximum of 10 exchange operations in the overlapping
    region of the 6G zones. This observation underscores the ability of the BSSM algorithm
    to achieve stable matching with relatively low complexity. As shown in Fig. 3,
    computing service prices are set at 0.5, 1, and 1.5, respectively. It is evident
    that the total data offloading volume from IoT devices increases rapidly with
    the number of iterations and stabilizes after 30 iterations. This observation
    validates the ability of the TOBR algorithm to achieve a Stackelberg equilibrium.
    Fig. 3 Impact of service pricing on task offloading decisions Full size image
    Furthermore, the total data offloading volume from IoT devices decreases as the
    computing service prices rise. This phenomenon arises due to the increase in the
    cost function for IoT devices with higher computing service prices. Consequently,
    IoT devices are compelled to reduce the amount of data they offload in order to
    maintain their utility. Figure 4 depicts the variation of total base station profits
    over iterations using the OBGT algorithm for different numbers of IoT devices.
    It is evident that the total base station profits initially rise rapidly with
    increasing iterations and gradually converge. Convergence is achieved after 60
    iterations, indicating the convergence property of the OBGT algorithm. Fig. 4
    Changes in total base station profit Full size image More Internet of Things devices
    means more money for the base station. As the number of devices in use increases,
    so does the volume of computing work that needs to be offloaded. This allows base
    stations to do more jobs and increase their income. Figure 5 shows how the OBGT
    algorithm affects the rate of change in the overall utility of IoT devices. There
    is a clear upward trend in total utility for IoT devices as the number of iterations
    grows, reaching a plateau and convergence after 30 iterations. The convergence
    of the OBGT algorithm is highlighted by this discovery. Fig. 5 Change in total
    utility of IoT devices Full size image It is also worth noting that the overall
    value of IoT devices rises in tandem with their deployment rate. As the number
    of devices in use increases, so does the number of social links between them.
    Each individual IoT device will become more valuable as a result of increased
    connectivity between them. The influence of the likelihood of social connections
    among IoT devices on their usefulness is seen in Fig. 6. R = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,
    0.8, 1 determines the probabilities of social relationships between IoT devices.
    An Erdős–Rényi (ER) randomized graph model was utilized to create a social relationship
    graph among IoT devices in order to analyze the social relationships between them.
    The graph''s nodes stand in for Internet of Things devices, while the connecting
    edges that join two nodes show their social relationships. The chance of social
    links between IoT devices is determined by the impact of the relationships'' likelihood
    on the utility of IoT devices. IoT devices can be used more efficiently when communication
    between them is more likely. When there is a higher chance of communication between
    IoT devices, they can be used more effectively. This occurs because as R grows,
    social ties among IoT devices become more coherent, facilitating more information
    exchange and more benefits for everybody involved. As a result, the value of each
    connected object grows. The overall value of an IoT system grows in tandem with
    the number of connected devices. Fig. 6 Effect of social connection probability
    on the utility of IoT devices Full size image Figure 7 shows how the revenue of
    a base station changes when the likelihood of social interactions between devices
    varies. Profits for the base stations grow from zero to one as the likelihood
    of social interactions among IoT devices rises. Profits at the base station show
    a gradual upward trend even with as little as 30 IoT devices in the system. When
    the number of connected devices increases to 50 or 100, however, the profits of
    the base station grow exponentially. Fig. 7 Effect of social connection probability
    on base station profit Full size image This phenomenon arises due to the concurrent
    increase in the number of devices and the probability of social connections among
    them. As these factors grow, the social connections between devices become more
    intertwined, deepening their influence on each other. Consequently, the volume
    of tasks offloaded from IoT devices to the base stations increases, allowing the
    base stations to generate higher profits as they handle a larger workload. 6.3
    Comparative analysis In order to enhance the credibility of the OBGT algorithm’s
    performance, a comparison is conducted with the Random Offloading Algorithm (ROA)
    and the algorithm introduced in reference [1, 3, 25,26,27], which addresses optimal
    pricing and offloading decisions in the context of drones and terminal devices
    (referred to as DPOS). This study examines the efficacy of the OBGT algorithm
    through the lenses of IoT device utility and base station profitability. The Random
    Offloading Algorithm (ROA) entails the random selection of base stations by Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices for the purpose of task offloading. This algorithm operates
    under the assumption that the computing service costs offered by the base stations
    remain constant. The DPOS method, which has been specifically developed for drones
    and terminal devices, constructs preference lists for each entity based on the
    present system state. These preferences are subsequently utilized for the purpose
    of matching. The aforementioned association can be characterized as a Stackelberg
    game. The appropriate pricing is determined by drones using a gradient-based search
    method, while terminal devices obtain the offloading volume using a best response
    algorithm. The aforementioned iterative process persists until both strategies
    reach a state of stability. The graphical representation in Fig. 8 illustrates
    the fluctuation in the average usefulness of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    across several methods, as the quantity of IoT devices progressively increases
    from 10 to 100. The average utility of Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases
    as the number of devices in operation expands, as evidenced by several methods.
    It is worth noting that the OBGT algorithm consistently demonstrates superior
    performance compared to both the DPOS and ROA algorithms [28,29,30]. The OBGT
    algorithm demonstrates a significantly higher average utility compared to the
    ROA method, with a ratio of around four to one. When the number of Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices reaches 10, the OBGT algorithm demonstrates an average utility
    that is 9.4% greater than that of the DPOS method. The OBGT algorithm demonstrates
    a superior average utility compared to DPOS by a margin of 27.1% when considering
    a network of 50 IoT devices. As the quantity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    attains a count of 100, the discrepancy in mean usefulness expands to 35.5%. The
    aforementioned statement underscores the notable efficacy of the OBGT algorithm
    in comparison with DPOS, particularly as the quantity of IoT devices escalates,
    hence accentuating its inherent benefits. Fig. 8 Variation in IoT Device Utility
    with Different Algorithms Full size image Base station average profits obtained
    through different algorithms are depicted in Fig. 9. The OBGT algorithm consistently
    outperforms the ROA algorithm. When the number of IoT devices is 10, the profits
    from applying the OBGT and DPOS algorithms are nearly identical. As the number
    of IoT devices reaches 20, the OBGT algorithm begins to outperform DPOS. The change
    in overall base station earnings during the course of OBGT algorithm rounds for
    various IoT device counts. It is clear that the total base station revenues progressively
    converge after initially rising quickly with more iterations. After 60 iterations,
    convergent is reached, demonstrating the OBGT algorithm''s converging feature.
    With 50 devices in the system, the base station profits obtained using the OBGT
    algorithm are 17.9% higher than those obtained using DPOS, and they are twice
    as high as those obtained using the ROA algorithm. When the number of devices
    increases to 100, the profits achieved using the OBGT algorithm exceed those from
    the DPOS algorithm by 30.3%. Fig. 9 Base station profits with different algorithms
    Full size image Based on the analysis of Figs. 8 and 9, it is evident that the
    OBGT algorithm outperforms both the DPOS and ROA algorithms. Furthermore, the
    superiority of the OBGT method becomes increasingly evident when the quantity
    of IoT devices rises. The DPOS and ROA algorithms are surpassed by the OBGT algorithm.
    Moreover, as the number of IoT devices increases, the superiority of the OBGT
    technique becomes more apparent. This behavior can be attributed to the DPOS algorithm''s
    exclusive consideration of energy cost and distance during the matching phase,
    which results in the disregarded of some components within the utility function.
    As a result, both the general usability of terminal devices and the efficiency
    of optimizing drone profitability are reduced. As a consequence, there is a decrease
    in the efficiency of optimizing drone profitability and the overall usability
    of terminal devices [31,32,33]. The OBGT algorithm integrates matching games and
    Stackelberg games, wherein the matching game component is designed to enhance
    the profitability of base stations and the utility of IoT devices. The pricing
    of computing services at base stations and the offloading techniques of IoT devices
    are evaluated based on factors like as pricing, offloading volume, and latency
    energy cost. Furthermore, during the Stackelberg game phase, the analysis considers
    the social ramifications that arise among Internet of Things (IoT) devices [9,
    34]. 7 Conclusion This study used a MEC system integrated into a 6G network to
    address the workload offloading issue of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in overlapping
    regions. We handled the problem of choosing IoT device base stations in overlapping
    regions by considering a number of variables, including economic advantages, social
    repercussions, latency restrictions, and energy usage. Maximizing base station
    profitability while guaranteeing the best usefulness for IoT devices was the goal.
    A many-to-one matching game paradigm was developed to address this. The BSSM algorithm
    is designed to optimize methods for choosing base stations for Internet of Things
    devices. IoT device base station selection is addressed by a many-to-one matching
    game model, while pricing and task offloading interactions are handled by a two-stage
    model based on Stackelberg game theory. By achieving equilibrium strategies and
    showcasing quick convergence in simulations, the suggested Game Theory-based Optimal
    Pricing and Best Response Algorithm (OBGT) increases base station revenues and
    IoT device utility. The interaction between base station pricing strategies and
    offloading techniques was examined using a two-stage Stackelberg game, which led
    to the development of the TOBR and OBGT algorithms. The aforementioned algorithms
    have been created to optimize job offloading strategies, selection strategies
    for IoT device base stations, and pricing strategies for computing services offered
    by base stations. Comparing the OBGT algorithm to random offloading approaches
    and straightforward Stackelberg game algorithms, it was found that the OBGT algorithm
    performed better in attaining profitable compute task offloading in MEC systems.

    1. Introduction Knowledge about the distribution of tree species is essential
    for sustainable forest management and planning (Santopuoli et al., 2021, Barrio-Anta
    et al., 2021). One of the tree genera that is essential to monitor is Eucalyptus,
    since it plays a key role in the forest sector worldwide. Eucalyptus trees are
    planted all over the world, from the tropics (Messier et al., 2021) to temperate
    forests (Tomé et al., 2021), and they have multiple industrial usages, such as
    in the pulp and paper industry and in the bioenergy industries as well as for
    producing different engineered-wood products (Tomé et al., 2021). According to
    Harwood (2011), of the 700 different naturally-occurring Eucalyptus species (Coppen,
    2002), the most cultivated Eucalyptus species are E. camaldulensis, E. grandis,
    E. tereticornis, E. globulus, E. nitens, E. urophylla, E. saligna, E. dunnii,
    E. pellita and some of their hybrids. Different species lend themselves to different
    applications and industrial usages (Ramnath et al., 2018, Acuña et al., 2020,
    Domingues et al., 2011, Seng Hua et al., 2022, Pérez-Cruzado et al., 2011). Additionally,
    different species have different characteristics that condition their growth in
    different environments (Ngugi et al., 2015, Pérez-Cruzado et al., 2011). Furthermore,
    it has been observed that certain Eucalyptus species in specific environments
    and management conditions have the potential to become invasive and may have multiple
    impacts on the environment, thus compromising the conservation of natural forests
    (Forsyth et al., 2004, Calviño-Cancela and van Etten, 2018, MITECO, 2017, Tomé
    et al., 2021). Therefore, being able to effectively map different Eucalyptus species
    is essential for forest and nature conservation stakeholders. In Europe, Eucalyptus
    is most commonly cultivated in Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula (Brus et al.,
    2011). In Portugal around 26% of the continental forest area is covered by Eucalyptus
    (ICNF, 2015), and the most recent Spanish NFI (National Forest Inventory) reported
    that in Galicia (A region in northwestern Spain), approximately 20% of the total
    forested area is covered by Eucalyptus as well (MITECO, 2011a). Therefore, Eucalyptus
    plantations represent an important commodity for the forest industries in these
    regions (Xunta de Galicia, 2023). Additionally, concerns have arisen among nature
    conservation stakeholders about the distribution and abundance of these plantations
    (Pérez-Cruzado et al., 2011, MITECO, 2017, Calviño-Cancela and van Etten, 2018,
    Tomé et al., 2021). In these regions, the most commonly cultivated species are
    Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens (MITECO, 2011a). These two species present
    particularities that imply different growth strategies and lend themselves to
    different applications. For example, it has been reported that they present differences
    in their growth rates and frost tolerances (Pérez-Cruzado et al., 2011, Close
    et al., 2000, Davidson et al., 2004). Similarly, their responses to growth stress,
    wounds, pruning and pathogens are also different (Beadle et al., 2001, Deflorio
    et al., 2007, Wiseman et al., 2009, Gonçalves et al., 2019, Smith et al., 2007).
    Disparities have also been identified in the carbon litter accumulation of each
    species (Pérez-Cruzado et al., 2011). Regarding their applications, E. globulus
    has proven to be more relevant for the pulp industry (Antes and Joutsimo, 2015,
    Pérez et al., 2006, Pérez-Cruzado et al., 2011) because of its better pulp yield
    and quality (Kibblewhite et al 2000). Despite these differences, the distribution
    of the two species in Europe has hardly been assessed. In Spain, the most recent
    data available on the distribution of Eucalyptus species dates from 2011 (MITECO,
    2011a). Considering that the rotation cycles for both species are between 12 and
    15 years (Tolosana et al., 2017, Arenas et al., 2019), and the perceived recent
    trend in forest owners replacing E. globulus for E. nitens, this distribution
    data might be outdated. In the case of Portugal, the Portuguese NFI does not disaggregate
    the different Eucalyptus species (ICNF, 2015). An additional drawback is that
    this information is currently acquired through field work, making it difficult
    to update more frequently or increase the level of detail. It is therefore beneficial
    to develop new methods that yield updated information about the distribution of
    Eucalyptus species in these regions. Remote sensing has been widely used to monitor
    Eucalyptus distribution around the globe (Sibanda et al., 2021, da Costa et al.,
    2022, Deng et al., 2020) and also in the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula in
    particular (Forstmaier et al., 2020, Alonso et al., 2021a, Alonso et al., 2021b,
    Oliveira et al., 2021). The most commonly implemented remote sensing tool used
    to identify Eucalyptus plantations and forests is passive remote sensing (this
    is the case in the studies mentioned above), however some studies have also incorporated
    LiDAR data (Novo-Gomez et al., 2022, Wu and Zhang, 2020). Despite the great amount
    of research focused on identifying Eucalyptus stands, there has thus far been
    little research aimed at distinguishing between Eucalyptus species. In the case
    of passive remote sensing, the distribution of Eucalyptus species has been studied
    using hyperspectral images and very high-resolution multispectral images. For
    example, the Peerbhay et al. (2013) study compiles the results of several studies
    on the ability of hyperspectral imagery to distinguish between Eucalyptus species.
    Many of these studies highlighted the difficulty of this task, especially when
    dealing with certain combinations of species. However, the Shang and Chisholm
    (2014) study demonstrates the ability of hyperspectral data to differentiate between
    Eucalyptus species in an Australian native forest. Peerbhay et al. (2013) also
    assess the possibility of using hyperspectral imagery to distinguishing between
    the Eucalyptus species that commonly grow in South Africa, showing that the most
    important wavebands for this task are located in the visible spectrum, and providing
    evidence that attests to the capability of very-high resolution multispectral
    data. However, few studies have addressed the possibility of using very-high resolution
    multispectral images for distinguishing between Euclayptus species. One example
    is the subsequent study of Peerbhay et al. (2014) that obtained user’s and producer’s
    accuracies of between 80 and 100 percent for E. grandis, E. nitens and E. smithii
    using Worldview-2 in South Africa. In the same sense, Alonso et al. (2021b) have
    explored the capacity of Worldview-3 to distinguish between E. globulus and E.
    nitens in a pilot area in Spain, obtaining lower user’s and producer’s accuracies
    (of between 45% and 84%) for this particular combination of Eucalyptus species.
    They remark that further research in different locations and using different remote
    sensing data may be necessary to improve accuracy results. One option could be
    to incorporate LiDAR data, as was done by Verma et al. (2019), who explored the
    capacity of LiDAR data and multispectral images to classify five different species
    of Eucalyptus in a native forest and found that the most accurate results were
    obtained when using LiDAR and multispectral images combined. A similar conclusion
    was reached in the study of Yadav et al. (2021), which also highlight the advantages
    of including LiDAR data in the classification of Eucalyptus species in native
    forests. Given the importance of mapping the distribution of different Eucalyptus
    species, this study evaluates the utility of different remote sensing data sources
    for mapping E. globulus and E. nitens. The sensors analyzed were very high-resolution
    Worldview-3 images with spectral and textural metrics, open-access Sentinel-2
    images, and airborne LiDAR data. The study area is located on the Iberian Peninsula,
    in a region with one of the highest abundances of these two Eucalyptus species
    in all of Europe. 2. Case study 2.1. Study area The study was conducted in the
    region of Galicia, in the northwest of Spain. The study area, which can be seen
    in Fig. 1C on dark green, was an area where very high-resolution multispectral
    imagery and recent LiDAR data were available. It covers a total area of 3611 km2.
    Fig. 1C shows the distribution of Eucalyptus in Galicia according to the 2020
    Sentinel-2 forest-oriented land cover map of Galicia (Alonso et al., 2022). On
    Fig. 1B is possible to see that currently Eucalyptus is mostly present on coastal
    areas. According to the latest forest inventory E. globulus and E. nitens are
    present in Galicia (Miteco, 2011b). Download : Download high-res image (573KB)

    (2022). 2.2. Species studied Eucalyptus tree plantations began to appear in Galicia
    in the middle of the 19th century when an afforestation process began in the region.
    Eucalyptus globulus was the first species to be planted (Barrio-Anta et al., 2021).
    Eucalyptus nitens was not introduced in this afforestation process and has only
    appeared in the last two decades; plantations of this species started to appear
    due to its greater resistance to E. globulus pests and its greater frost tolerance
    (Neilan and Thompson, 2008, Aguín et al., 2013, Ayuga-Téllez et al., 2022, Tomé
    et al., 2021) Therefore, the most abundant species, according to the latest records,
    is E. globulus (Miteco, 2011b). Eucalyptus plantations in this region are mostly
    owned by small non-industrial private owners (Tomé et al., 2021). Therefore, few
    management practices are applied (Tomé et al., 2021, González-Gómez et al., 2011).
    There is also evidence, especially in the case of E. globulus, of unmanaged and
    abandoned plantations due to recurring wildfires or to the plantations being in
    unsuitable areas (Tomé et al., 2021). All of these factors may lead to greater
    heterogeneity in terms of age, height, diameter and structure of E. globulus stands
    in comparison with E. nitens stands. Plantation densities for both species in
    Galicia are the same, they are usually planted using a range of 1000–1600 trees
    per hectare (DOG, 2021). At a glance, the two species are similar. The main characteristics
    that help to differentiate between them are their flowers and fruit (Orwa et al.,
    2009, López, 2002). However, other characteristics have been described that can
    help to differentiate between the two when these elements are not present. E.
    globulus is prone to coppice regeneration while this hardly ever occurs in E.
    nitens stands (Gutiérrez, 1976, Neilan and Thompson, 2008). Additionally, persistence
    of dead branches is more typical of E. nitens stands (Pinkard, 2002, Pérez-Cruzado
    and Rodríguez-Soalleiro, 2011). In addition, field practice has identified different
    coloration during peak budding as a distinguishing characteristic. Thus, as stated
    by the BASOA Foundation (2017), spring shoots in E. globulus tend to exhibit a
    greenish coloration, while those of E. nitens tend to show reddish tones. Understory
    species that tend to be associated to both Eucalyptus species are the same. Images
    of typical stands of each of the two species are shown in Fig. 2, both images
    being captured in planted stands with a high-growth age and heights of greater
    than 15 m. Download : Download high-res image (425KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Examples of stands of the two Eucalyptus species present in the
    study area. Left E. nitens and right E. globulus. Both images were captured in
    planted stands with a high-growth age and heights greater than 15 m. Few studies
    about the phenological behaviors of the Eucalyptus species under study have been
    accomplished. Some studies on this topic have been accomplished in Tasmania and
    South America. According to Downes et al. (1999) study performed over Eucalyptus
    plantations in Tasmania, E. nitens tended to have longer increment phases in spring
    and autumn, and faster phase rates in autumn than E. globulus. Battaglia et al.
    (1996) developed their study over Tasmanian plantations and concluded that the
    photosynthetic temperature response curve of E. nitens may be wider compared to
    E. globulus. For a different geographic region (Chile) Watt et al. (2014) stated
    that the air temperature modifier for E. nitens for a process-based model exhibited
    dual peaks during late spring/early summer and then again in early autumn when
    air temperatures were closest to the optimum air temperature for growing. According
    to the own experience of the authors and their knowledge of the study area, the
    spring months (March to May) are associated with the main peak budding for both
    species in the study area, although buds can occur during the whole year. The
    flowering in Eucalyptus nitens is infrequent and light (Moncur and Hasan, 1994).
    The flowering of Eucalytpus globulus takes places in Galicia from autumn to early
    summer according to Calviño-Cancela and Rubido-Bará (2013). 3. Materials 3.1.
    Worldview-3 images Worldview-3 is a commercial satellite launched in 2014. One
    of the products acquired from this instrument is comprised of eight multispectral
    bands each with a spatial resolution of 1.2 m. Detailed information about the
    spectral ranges is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Spectral characteristics of
    Worldview-3 images. Band name Wavelength ranges (nm) Coastal Blue 400–450 Blue
    450–510 Green 510–580 Yellow 585–625 Red 630–690 Red Edge 705–745 NIR-1 770–895
    NIR-2 860–1040 The WorldView-3 images that were used in this study were gathered
    in two blocks acquired at different dates. The first block was acquired between
    May and June of 2021 and a second block was acquired between August and October
    of 2021. It was not possible to acquire all the study area at the same date due
    to the cloud cover, according to the image provider. The specific date of the
    images and the acquisition parameters are shown in Table 2. Varying dates involve
    different sun elevation angles, and consequently different projected shadows;
    but also they usually involve different phenological stages and subsequent variations
    in the digital values of land covers. The images of these two blocks also differ
    in the preprocessing procedure. The digital values of the images are the result
    of applying atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections to the original
    scenes. According to the image provider, the algorithms that were used to correct
    the images were different for the two blocks. As a result, the digital values
    of analogous land covers are significantly different in both blocks. Because of
    these differences the two blocks were processed separately. Table 2. Acquisition

    Sentinel-2 images Images of the constellation of satellites Sentinel-2 were used
    on this study. These images have information on 13 spectral bands with a spatial
    resolution ranging from 10 m to 60 m, depending on the band (ESA, 2015). The specifications
    of the spectral bands are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Sentinel-2 bands. Band name

    mission has a high revisit time: 10 days at the equator with one satellite, and
    5 days with 2 satellites under cloud-free conditions which results in 2–3 days
    at mid-latitudes. One image per month was used in this study to cover the different
    phenological stages of Eucalyptus. For the study area, the least cloudy image
    available from each month was selected. Images were downloaded from the Copernicus
    Open Hub (ESA, n.d.). The product downloaded was the Level 2A since it has geometric,
    radiometric, and atmospheric corrections (ESA, n.d.b). The Sentinel-2 bands used
    in this study were the 10 m and 20 m ones. Appendix A presents the dates of the
    images used for each month and Sentinel-2 tile. 3.3. LiDAR data LiDAR data for
    the whole study area was obtained using an airborne laser scanner (ALS). All the
    LiDAR data was acquired during November of 2019. The LiDAR acquisition density
    was >3 points/m2. This data was provided by the Administration of Rural Areas
    of the Government of Galicia. 4. Methodology 4.1. Reference data collection Reference
    data for the two species was obtained through field work in the year 2021. In
    order to define enough reference data for both Eucalyptus species, a first set
    of sample plots was established using the most recent Spanish Forest Map, MFE25
    (Miteco, 2011b), which contains species information. This step was aided by photointerpretation
    of the Worldview-3 images to discard any plots that clearly did not match the
    MFE25 map indications (i.e., due to land use changes or harvesting). The sample
    plots for each species encompassed different topographical orientations and slopes.
    The field plots must represent homogeneous monospecific stands with dense canopy
    closure. Within the provided sample plots, the center point of a circular plot,
    with a minimum radius of 10 m, was established and the main tree species was recorded.
    Considering that the forestry sector is quite active in the study area and that
    in several locations the tree species appearing on the MFE25 don’t correspond
    with the ground truth, field crews were permitted to move the position of the
    proposed sample points to different nearby positions. This was done so as to maintain
    a roughly equal balance between the numbers of plots corresponding to each of
    the two species. The central coordinates of each plot that was ultimately established
    were recorded using a GPS device with centimetric precision. Upon the collection
    of field data, polygons around the field plots were manually delineated using
    the Worldview-3 images as the reference. These polygons were used as reference
    data. A total of 395 polygons were defined: 215 for E. globulus and 180 for E.
    nitens. This reference dataset was randomly divided into two subsets: 70% for
    training and 30% for verification. Fig. 3 presents the distribution of the reference
    data, both training and test polygons. Download : Download high-res image (228KB)

    through fieldwork. It was divided randomly into training data (TRAIN, 70%) and
    verification data (TEST, 30%). 4.2. Data processing 4.2.1. Shadow removal in Worldview
    images The dataset of Worldview-3 images was visually reviewed to evaluate the
    influence of the heterogeneity of observation angles. It was observed that most
    of the images contained a great deal of projected shadows derived from the observation
    angle, which can greatly differ among the images. Therefore, the first step in
    data processing consisted of applying a shadow detection index (SDI) to every
    image that would allow for the removal of these shadows. The algorithm described
    by Shahi et al. (2014) was used. This index, which uses the blue band and the
    two NIR bands, was specifically designed for Worldview images. The following Eq.
    (1) is implemented to calculate the SDI. (1) where NIR2, Blue and NIR1 are Worldview-3
    bands. Once the SDI was calculated for each pixel and each image, a histogram
    of the SDI frequencies was obtained for each image. A specific SDI threshold value
    for each image was defined to identify areas that corresponded to shadows. After
    several tests, the 95th percentile value, of each image, was selected as the optimum
    shadow threshold. Any values above this percentile were considered shadows and
    changed to NULL values. 4.2.2. Worldview texture analysis A texture analysis was
    performed since, in very high-resolution images, textures can significantly differ
    between land covers (Feng et al., 2015). The first step consisted of defining
    the size of a moving window; all of the pixels within that window were used to
    obtain texture metrics. Several window sizes were tested. The results were visually
    inspected to select the appropriate window size. The final window size selected
    was 3x3 m. Afterwards, a histogram was computed for each window to determine the
    frequency of occurrence of each of the digital numbers (DN) present within the
    window and a vector with these occurrence values was created. The occurrence values
    were then normalized by dividing them by the total number of values in the defined
    moving window. These values were deemed probabilities, P(i). Finally, the following
    texture metrics were calculated from these probabilities by applying different
    equations: mean (2), variance (3), entropy (4), skewness (5). On this equations
    P(i) is the probability value of each pixel, Ng the number of distinct grey levels
    in the quantized image and M the mean. (2) (3) (4) (5) The resulting value of
    each equation was assigned to the central pixel of the moving window. This procedure
    was performed for all the bands present in the image. 4.2.3. Sentinel-2 images
    The Sentinel-2 images were pre-processed to remove any clouds that may be present.
    Clouds were masked using the cloud mask available from the Sentinel-2 Level 2A
    product. Since the bands used in this study were the 10 m and 20 m bands, the
    20 m bands were resampled at 10 m. This procedure was done using nearest neighborhood
    interpolation. Additionally several Sentinel-2 spectral indices were calculated
    since including them can improve the classification performance when mapping tree
    species using Sentinel-2 images (Immitzer et al. 2019). Some indices that are
    commonly used to analyze vegetation have been calculated. The Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Kogan, 1995, Tarpley et al., 1984) was selected since
    it is the most commonly used index in phenological research (Misra et al. 2020).
    The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) was used because according to
    previous studies it can track seasonal changes in vegetation moisture content
    (Gao, 1996, Sentinelhub, 2023a). Additionally, some indices that allow to optimize
    the Red-Edge bands of Sentinel-2 images were used. This band can be key to distinguish
    between vegetation species according to Misra et al. (2020). Particularly, the
    Normalized Difference Red Edge Index 1 (NDRE1) (Sentinelhub, 2023b) and the Sentinel-derived
    Red-Edge Spectral Indice RESI (Xiao et al. 2020) were used. Formulas to calculate
    them are presented below from (6)–(9) respectively. (6) (7) (8) (9) where NIR1,
    RED and SWIR correspond to the Sentinel-2 bands with equal names and RE1, RE2
    and RE3 to the Sentinel-2 bands named Red-Edge 1, Red-Edge 2 and Red-Edge 3 respectively.
    4.2.4. LiDAR data Since the species in question can present different distribution
    patterns in terms of branches, sprouts, and the mix of different aged individuals,
    statistics were obtained from the LiDAR point clouds to derive information about
    the geometric structure of the stands. The first step was the normalization of
    the point clouds. This consisted of transforming the z coordinate value for each
    point from its altitude with respect to the Earth’s surface to its height above
    the ground. To perform this transformation, ground points had to be identified.
    This step was performed with the lasground tool in the LAStools software (Rapidlasso,
    2023). Then, the height of the rest of the points was estimated with respect to
    these ground points; this algorithm was implemented using the lidR package in
    the R software (Roussel et al., 2020). The normalized LiDAR point cloud was used
    to estimate several statistical metrics representing the structure of the point
    clouds. The metrics computed are presented in Table 5; detailed mathematical information
    about each can be found in Roussel and Auty (2021). This step was performed using
    the cloud metrics function in the lidR package (Roussel et al., 2020). The set
    of metrics was calculated twice, once at a 1.2 m resolution (the Worldview-3 resolution)
    and once at a 10 m resolution (the Sentinel-2 resolution). The output of this
    process is nine raster layers, one layer per statistical metric. Table 5. LiDAR
    metrics obtained. Metric Description zmax Maximum height zmean Mean height zsd
    Standard deviation of height distribution zskew Skewness of height distribution

    diversity index (Pretzsch, 2008, Shannon, 1948) pzabovezmean Percentage of returns
    above mean height pzabove2 Percentage of returns above 2 m zqx xth percentile
    of height distribution zpcumx Cumulative percentage of returns in the xth layer.
    In order to obtain this layer, the maximum height of the LiDAR data in each cell
    was divided into 10 intervals. The cumulative percentage of the 9 layers was thus
    obtained. 4.3. Analysis of species separability In this section, the separability
    of the two considered Eucalyptus species is analyzed separately for the three
    data sources. Boxplots of values for each species were built for Worldview spectral
    bands, Worldview textures and LiDAR statistics. The boxplots represent the mean
    values and central quartiles; they were built using the digital values for each
    feature of the pixels inside the reference polygons. Worldview separability was
    studied separately for each block given their divergences in the digital values
    as a result of the implementation of different pre-processing algorithms. In the
    case of the Sentinel-2 data the separability between the species was analyzed
    through a temporal analysis of seasonal changes. This analysis was performed by
    analyzing the evolution of the monthly NDVI values along the considered year (2019)
    for both species; in particular the seasonal tendency was evaluated through the
    mean and standard deviation of the digital values in the reference polygons obtained
    for the monthly images. Additionally the Jeffries-Matusita distance (JM) between
    the two species was calculated for all the data sources and variables. JM has
    been proven to be useful for measuring the separability of thematic classes obtained
    through remote sensing data (Sen et al. 2019). JM takes values between 0 and 2.
    Higher values indicate a higher separability between classes. JM was calculated
    using the R function JMdist from the R package varSel (Dalponte and Oerka, 2021).
    4.4. Species classification The detection and mapping of E. globulus and E. nitens
    in the study area was accomplished through supervised classifications of the data
    from the different sources, which were treated both individually and combined.
    Since the dates of the different phenological stages differ from one target species
    to the other, the temporal resolution of the Sentinel-2 data was used to design
    the tests used to differentiate between the two species. One image per month was
    selected and classified individually using the Sentinel-2 spectral bands (this
    was deemed the single-date approach). A multitemporal approach was also evaluated;
    it consisted of using decision-criteria to aggregate all the maps resulting from
    the single-date approach. The decision-criteria used was plurality voting (Lewiński
    et al., 2017). Following this criterion, the most frequently occurring class for
    a pixel (the mode) throughout the time-series was the class that was ultimately
    assigned to that pixel in the multitemporal map. Regarding Worldview-3, three
    tests were performed: the classification of the images individually, the classification
    of textures, and the classification of the two together. In the first case, the
    classification was performed separately for the two blocks of images. This was
    because, due to differences in the corrections applied within the blocks, the
    blocks presented quite different radiometric ranges (see Section 3.1.). The separation
    of blocks was not necessary in the case of the textures since these were obtained
    from normalized values. Finally, the LiDAR metrics were analyzed individually
    and combined with the Sentinel-2 and Worldview-3 images. Table 6 is a description
    of all the different data combinations used. Table 6. Data sources and their combinations.

    using the training data described in Section 4.1. These were performed using a
    neural network architecture. The architecture used was implemented using the Keras
    interface (Team, 2022) from the TensorFlow library (Abadi et al., 2016) of the
    Python language (Van Rossum and Drake, 1995). Several neural network architectures
    were tested. The one that was ultimately used consisted of an input flatten layer,
    three dense hidden layers, and an output layer. The hidden layers were activated
    with the ReLU (Rectified Linear Units) activation function (Agarap, 2018). This
    activation function is one of the most efficient functions for this step (Ramachandran
    et al., 2017). The output function used was Softmax (Agarap, 2018) since it was
    a matter of multiclass classification (Wu et al., 2016). As a result of this process,
    a map with the geospatial distribution of Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens
    was obtained from each of the data sources evaluated. The final step was to evaluate
    all the obtained maps using the verification dataset. Confusion matrixes were
    built for each of the maps to estimate the following accuracy metrics: Overall
    Accuracy (OA), User’s Accuracy (UA), Producer’s Accuracy (PA) and F-Score. 5.
    Results 5.1. Analysis of species separability 5.1.1. Worldview images The boxplots
    showing the separability of the species according to the Worldview bands are shown
    in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, block 1 and 2 respectively. The Figures incorporate the JM
    values obtained for each band. According to these results, the digital values
    in the Worldview images overlap for the analyzed species whatever the spectral
    band or block is considered. Accordingly, JM values are always below 0.5. However
    JM values within blocks are completely different. The highest JM value obtained
    for these images corresponds to the NIR-2 band in block 1 (JM 0.41). Download

    The results are different in the block 2. In this case the skewness presented
    the best performance, corresponding the highest values to the Red and Coastal
    bands: 0.86 and 0.72 respectively. Download : Download high-res image (441KB)

    seasonal changes tendency is presented in Fig. 8. According to this Figure NDVI
    mean values of both species are very similar from January to March. From April
    to November the mean NDVI is higher for E. nitens. However, the standard deviation

    on Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. In all the cases, the JM value is below 0.8. The highest
    values correspond to the RGB bands; they overtake the value 0.6 at least once
    in the year. The months for which JM values are above 0.6 are May and November.
    Among the spectral indices used, the ones that presents higher JM values are NDVI,
    the NDRE1 and the RESI for September. Regarding the NDMI, generally it presents
    lower values than the other indices for all months except in February and March.

    the LiDAR metrics are shown in Fig. 11. According to this figure, there are several
    LiDAR metrics whose values differ noticeably between the two species: “zmax”,
    the higher height percentiles and “zsd”. For example, in the study area, according
    to “zmax”, E. globulus stands tend to be taller than E. nitens stands: for E.
    globulus, “zmax” has an average value of 21.3 m, with a standard deviation of
    6.20 m, while for E.nitens “zmax” has an average value of 15.2 m with a standard
    deviation of 4.87 m. The variables “zmax”, “p75” to “p95” and “zsd” have the highest
    JM values; they range between 0.49 and 0.55. Download : Download high-res image

    metrics of the maps obtained using the different data sources and the various
    combinations of them are shown in Fig. 12, Fig. 13. The Fig. 12 shows the Overall
    Accuracy obtained for each classification. The highest values, as in the previous
    case, were obtained with for the March Sentinel-2 image combined with LiDAR (with
    an OA of 94%) followed by Sentinel-2 multitemporal (with an OA of 92%). Furthermore,
    the OA index also revealed that Sentinel-2 images provided more accurate results
    when they were combined with LiDAR data. It should be highlighted that the months
    that allowed for the highest accuracy values were in the spring months of March
    and May. The accuracy was lower in summer and winter months. Finally, among the
    high-resolution combinations, Worldview-3 image with textures and LiDAR data provided
    the highest OA, with a value of 90%. Download : Download high-res image (325KB)

    data has a high OA, there is an imbalance between the F-Score of the two classes.
    It seems that the E. globulus class tends to be more accurately predicted than
    the E. nitens class. This disparity is observed in most of the combinations that
    include Worldview data or data at Worldview resolution. Producer’s and User’s
    accuracies are presented on Appendixes A and B respectively. Finally, Fig. 14

    6.1.1. Worldview images The separability of the analyzed species considering the
    Worldview-3 spectral bands seems to be low since most JM values are below 0.5.
    The most remarkable observation is that the JM values highly differed between
    blocks. This difference might be related to the phenology of the species, since
    the block with the best performance includes those months when the emergence of
    shoots occurs (spring). Considering this result, the training data collection
    for further classifications should not combine different dates since it might
    difficult the construction of the model. Regarding Worldview-3, it also might
    be pointed out that the radiometric inconsistency among blocks might difficult
    obtaining full conclusions regarding the application of Worldview-3 images to
    large areas.. Further studies to disentangle this problematic might be essential
    to fully address the potential of Worldview-3 images at large scales. 6.1.2. Textural
    analysis The best separability results for the analyzed species was obtained for
    the Worldview-3 texture metrics with JM values close to 1. The best performance
    corresponded to the skewness of the yellow band in block 1 (JM 0.98) and the skewness
    of the red band in block 2 (JM 0.86). Skewness is one of the texture metrics more
    sensitive to the presence of extreme values. Therefore, it will be a metric sensitive
    to small canopy gaps, brighter or darker pixels in the middle of the canopy. This
    might indicate that one species is more prone to have canopy gaps, due to its
    crown structure or plantation pattern, than the other. Nevertheless, it might
    be also considered that this metric is also really affected by the presence of
    outliers derived from, for example, edge pixels or unremoved shadows. Textural
    analysis results contrast with Chen et al. (2021); they obtained that the mean
    texture was the most valuable one to differentiate Eucalyptus plantations from
    other tree covers. This variation between studies might derive from the differences
    on structure of the specific species of each study, since different crown structures
    tend to lead to different key textural metrics (Ouma and Tateishi, 2007). For
    example, Franklin and Ahmed (2018) found relevant different textural features
    to classify each one of the four broadleaves species that composed their study.
    Considering this, results might highly differ among the species studied as well
    as between interspecific or intraspecific studies. 6.1.3. Sentinel-2 images The
    separability between E. globulus and E. nitens through the Sentinel-2 bands and
    indices can be considered low considering that JM distances are under 1 for them
    all whatever the month is analyzed. This value is the threshold to consider that
    a dataset show potential for classes differentiation according to Sen et al. (2019).
    It highlights that the highest JM values were obtained for the blue, green and
    red bands (RGB) in November. Analyzing this result in detail it was observed that
    RGB values on November present outliers which correspond to cloud shadows. Hence,
    to improve the results, the outliers might be filtered prior the JM distances
    calculation. It might be pointed that Sentinel-2 bands allow to obtain JM distances
    above 0.5, whereas spectral indices tend to be below 0.5. This result contrasts
    with other studies as Immitzer et al. (2019) or Xiao et al. (2020) which indicate
    that including spectral indices to species classification studies aggregates separability
    potential. The highest JM distances for spectral indices correspond to September
    while for spectral bands to May and November. The indices that present highest
    values in most months are the NDRE1 and the RESI, what agrees with previous studies
    as Misra et al. (2020) or Xiao et al. (2020) which highlights the potential of
    Red-Edge bands of Sentinel-2 images to distinguish among vegetation types. The
    NDMI only present high values in February and March which can indicate that in
    this period one of the two species maintains a higher water content than the other,
    since this index is focused on the moisture of the vegetation (Gao, 1996). Further
    studies should be done to better understand the winter-spring strategy of both
    species. The analysis of the evolution of the NDVI through time has shown that
    the mean values for both species mostly differ in May and June, but the confidence
    intervals are overlapped along the whole year. An important observation is that
    months with similar NDVI mean values presented high overall accuracy in the final
    classification. Considering these results this index seems not to be efficient
    to capture key spectral differences related to the phenology of the analyzed species;
    consequently future studies should be done to find another feature that reflect
    the seasonal changes of these species. Nevertheless, NDVI values decreases from
    January to April and they start to recover again from May onwards. This might
    be due to the appearance of new buds since spring months are associated with the
    peak budding for both species. Also, according to NDVI values it seems that E.
    globulus has lower photosynthetic activity than E. nitens (lower NDVI values in
    E. globulus). However, the current knowledge about the phenology of both species
    (i.e. response to temperature) is too scarce to allow the authors explaining conclusively
    this behavior. Field work should be done to better understand the relation of
    the monthly NDVI values with the phenology of both species on the study area.
    An improvement of the knowledge of the phenological behaviour of both species
    might help to improve their monitoring. 6.1.4. LiDAR data The LiDAR metrics that
    seem to have the greatest capability to discern between the analyzed species are
    “zmax”, “p75” and “p95”. It might be noted that they are clearly related to height
    of the trees, but not to their structure (i.e. natural pruning). Yadav et al.
    (2021) and Verma et al. (2019) have also pointed that tree height can help to
    distinguish between Eucalyptus species. However, as Verma et al. (2019) pointed
    out the importance of height related variables can be related to the maturity
    stage of the studied stands, which are circumstantial conditions. Consequently
    every site and stand might be evaluated specifically. In this specific study case,
    the height of the E. globulus stands could tend to be higher than the height of
    E. nitens stands considering that most plantations of E. nitens date from the
    last two decades (Pérez-Cruzado and Rodríguez-Soalleiro, 2011) while E. globulus
    was previously introduced, and that there are records in numerous locations that
    point that E. globulus stands fell in abandonment for decades (Tomé et al., 2021).
    Hence, the utility of LiDAR data in differentiation and mapping of this two Eucalyptus
    species may change in the upcoming years. Therefore, a study similar to this one
    might be done again selecting for the analysis stands with equal ages. 6.2. Species
    classification Despite the modest results of the separability analysis, according
    to the obtained results E. globulus and E. nitens can be satisfactorily differentiated
    in the study area through supervised classification. The data source that provided
    the highest accuracy metrics was Sentinel-2 combined with LiDAR data (OA 94%)
    followed by the multitemporal approach of Sentinel-2 (OA 92%). This is fortunate
    since Sentinel-2 is an open-access source, and its availability is guaranteed
    in the coming years (Toulemont et al., 2021). An important finding regarding this
    source is that the date of the image analyzed is a key parameter in determining
    the final accuracy of the map, and consequently, in the capability of Sentinel-2
    images to differentiate between Eucalyptus species. In the study area, the spring
    months, March and May in particular, provided the highest accuracy metrics (OA
    89% for both months). These months might correspond with a key phenologic stage
    of the species analyzed, emergence of spring shoots, since according to BASOA
    Foundation (2017), spring shoots in E. globulus tend to exhibit a greenish coloration,
    while those of E. nitens tend to show reddish tones. Having this in mind it would
    be of great interest to increase the knowledge of both species phenology in the
    region as well as to go deep on how to take advantage of this behavioral differences
    using remote sensing. It might also be remarked that the multitemporal approach
    provided better results than almost all the single-date images both when they
    were processed alone and combined with LiDAR. This is in accordance with the previous
    studies on tree species classification as for example Immitzer et al. 2019 or
    Persson et al. 2018 that indicate that multitemporal classifications provide higher
    accuracy than single dates ones. In fact, some previous studies had already analyzed
    the phenological behavior of Eucalyptus through remote sensing with the aim of
    classifying the genera (Qiao et al., 2016, Forstmaier et al., 2020). Future studies
    could explore the possibility of applying plurality voting using only the months
    with the highest accuracy values, for example by combining the results from only
    March, April, and May. This approach would strengthen the phenology-based differentiation,
    since phenology may vary within these months depending on the geographical area
    (i.e., they may be different in coastal areas versus inland areas) as it happens
    with other tree species in the study region (Rodríguez-Rajo et al. 2011). The
    low accuracy results obtained with Worldview-3 images when they were processed
    alone are similar to the results obtained in Alonso et al. (2022). They also reported
    disparities in accuracy metrics between species when using a Worldview-3 image
    dating from July. For example, in their study, the UA for E. nitens was 65% while
    it was 70% for E. globulus. They pointed out that this may be due to an imbalance
    in species distribution, and in training data in their study area. In the current
    study there is no imbalance between species in the training data, however the
    accuracy remains low: the UA for E. nitens and E. globulus in this study was 61%
    and 87% respectively and the PA was 62% and 86%.Hence E. nitens was more underestimated
    than E. globulus when using Worldview-3, as well as E. globulus was more commonly
    misclassified.. Some other studies were able to efficiently differentiate between
    Eucalyptus species. This is the case of Peerbhay et al. (2014), that focused in
    the differentiation and mapping of E. grandis, E. nitens and E. smithii in South
    Africa using Worldview images. Therefore, the efficiency of this data source could
    depend greatly on the species in question, since, as previously studied, some
    Eucalyptus species present very similar spectral reflectance (Kumar, 2007, Datt,
    1999). E. globulus and E. nitens are closer from a phylogenetic point of view
    than for example E. nitens and E. grandis (Bayly, 2016). It should be highlighted
    that the combination of Worldview-3 spectral information and LiDAR data with Worldview-3
    textural metrics yielded more accurate results. This result is in accordance with
    Verma et al. (2019), who observed that textural information helped to differentiate
    between some Eucalyptus species in their native environment. Enhancements observed
    when including Worldview-3 textural information were related, on other trees species
    classification studies, with the possibility that texture offer to capture species-specific
    differences in crown-structure (Pinheiro Ferreira et al., 2019). In view of this
    result, it might be possible that a slight difference on structures of both species
    not previously recorded exists. Other possible is that textural differences derive
    from different stand structures driven from the higher abandonment rate of E.
    globulus stands (Tomé et al., 2021). The comparison of Sentinel-2 and Worldview-3
    has brought to light certain issues regarding the efficiency of the two sources
    in the E. globulus and E. nitens mapping. In general, Sentinel-2 images provided
    higher accuracy metrics solely (OA 92% in the best case) than Worldview-3 (OA
    80% in the best case). This better performance could be due to that Sentinel-2
    images have higher radiometric and temporal resolutions. It should be noted that
    not all the Worldview-3 images date from months that correspond with the emergence
    of spring shoots. These results could be substantiated if the Worldview-3 images
    could be acquired for the whole study area during the optimum phenological period;
    it would also allow to decipher if the higher accuracy obtained with Sentinel-2
    is driven by the multitemporality or by the higher spectral resolution. However,
    nowadays the operational constraints of Worldview-3 satellite hinder its capacity
    to cover large areas in a narrow time frame, consequently the availability of
    Worldview-3 images in the required period with a low cloud threshold is currently
    difficult. Regarding the LiDAR data, it was observed that LiDAR data alone can
    be useful to distinguish between the two species when it is used at medium resolutions
    (a 10 m resolution yields more accurate results than a 1.2 m resolution). This
    may indicate that using LiDAR with low resolutions involve the inclusion in training
    and test areas of noisy pixels that correspond to areas not covered by the tree
    canopy. As a consequence, the LiDAR statistics of those pixels would correspond
    to shrubs instead of to Eucalyptus trees. This feature would greatly interfere
    with the results. The review on tree species classification of Fassnacht et al.
    (2016), indicates that low density discrete return LiDAR alone has a limited potential
    for tree species classification. This contrast with the result of this study.
    This discrepancy might be due to the values of height related parameters in both
    species in the study area. This reinforces the need of evaluating every site specifically.
    The combination of LiDAR data with multispectral data facilitated the differentiation
    between the two Eucalyptus species. This is in accordance with Verma et al. (2019)
    and Yadav et al. (2021) who found that LiDAR leveraged the potential of multispectral
    images to classify Eucalyptus species in their native environment. 7. Conclusion
    This study reveals that Sentinel-2 images have a great potential to efficiently
    differentiate between E. globulus and E. nitens and map their distribution. The
    date of the images analyzed is a key parameter in determining the final accuracy
    of the map; in particular, the emergence of spring shoots period is the best phenological
    stage to capture in Sentinel-2 images in order to differentiate between these
    two species. The classification following a multitemporal approach can optimize
    the accuracies obtained. LiDAR metrics can also be used to complement the models
    and improve results. However, the LiDAR derived metrics can be greatly influenced
    by the local and circumstantial conditions of the stands of both species in the
    study region. LiDAR data alone may have the potential to differentiate between
    the two species but when it is used at medium resolutions. Worldview-3 images
    alone have a low potential to differentiate between the two species. Including
    textural information leverages their potential but their prediction capabilities
    remain low. Furthermore, this study details the difficulties that working with
    Worldview-3 data at large scales might entail. This study represents a step forward
    in terms of obtaining updated Eucalyptus species distribution maps for Europe,
    a feat which will add to the current knowledge base and allow for forest and conservation
    stakeholders to plan better and make more informed decisions. In line with the
    results obtained in this study, and due to the easy accessibility of Sentinel-2
    images, future studies should focus on upscaling this study using Sentinel-2 images
    to obtain a definitive map for this region. Funding This project was funded by

  description: Evapotranspiration (ET) data is critical for monitoring the limited
    hydrological resources in arid areas. At present, the spatial resolution of ET
    derived by the thermal infrared images from satellite data is coarse (always more
    than 500 m). The low-resolution data cannot meet the needs of the high-precision
    mapping of ET. Therefore, it is important to undertake a downscaling procedure
    to improve the spatial resolution of ET. This paper selects the oasis region and
    surrounding deserts of Zhangye City of China as study area and compares with two
    downscaling procedures that include input and output downscaling procedure. The
    ET is estimated with the Remote Sensing-Non Parametric (RS-NP) model. The two
    downscaling procedures use Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance
    Fusion Model (ESTARFM) to improve the spatial resolution of ET from 1-km to 100
    m. Compared with the result derived from the output downscaling procedure, the
    high-resolution ET derived from the input downscaling procedure has a slightly
    better performance with R2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 41.8 W/m2, respectively. Neglecting
    the downscaling of land surface temperature and broadband reflectance (BBR) result
    in larger errors of ET estimation with bias values of 73.0 W/m2 and 23.7 W/m2,
    respectively. Those values account for almost 1/3 and 1/10 of ET values, respectively.
    In non-vegetated areas, those proportions increase further around 90.6 % and 21.3
    %, respectively. Furthermore, the influence of the neglect of the downscaling
    of the near-infrared reflectance on the ET estimation dominates that of BBR with
    a proportion of 42 %. The input downscaling procedure is suitable for generating
    the high-precision map of ET, especially in vegetated areas and during northern
    hemisphere summer months. Our study is helpful to obtain ET maps in fine spatial
    resolutions and contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the importance
    of the downscaling of each kind of input for reliable ET estimations.

    hydrology 1. Introduction As the sum of soil evaporation, surface evaporation
    and transpiration of plants, ET is essential to the energy balance and cycle of
    global water (Burman and Pochop, 1994, Schotanus et al., 1983). Especially in
    arid and semi-arid regions, high-precision mapping of ET is helpful to monitor
    drought and guide agricultural irrigation (Bellvert et al., 2018, Huang and Chen,
    2016, Huo et al., 2021, Li et al., 2016, Portela et al., 2019). The methods of
    traditionally hydrometeorology for calculating ET include PM (Penman-Monteith),
    and PT (Priestley-Taylor) equation (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Monteith, 1965,
    Penman, 1948). Based on these equations, the retrieved methods for ET including
    such as RS-PM (Remote Sensing-Penman Monteith), triangular method, SEBAL (Surface
    Energy Balance Algorithms for Land), and SEBS（Surface Energy Balance System）have
    been developed (Zheng and Wang, 2013, Tang et al., 2010, Kwast and Gieske, 2009,
    Singh et al., 2008, Mu et al., 2007, Jiang and Islam, 1999, Norman et al., 1995,
    Price, 1990, Goward et al., 1985). However, these remote-sensing models are limited
    by complex parameterization of resistances, empirical determination of wet/dry
    edges, and variation of empirical coefficients. To avoid those limitations, the
    NP (Non Parametric) approach has been proposed (Liu et al., 2012). The NP approach
    refers to taking the surface temperature as the generalized coordinates of the
    Hamiltonian to obtain ET (Pan et al., 2016, Pan et al., 2017). Based on NP approach,
    a retrieval model of ET namely the RS-NP (Remote Sensing-Non Parametric) model
    has been constructed, and showed a relatively satisfactory performance at a regional
    scale by comparing with measured ET (Pan et al., 2016). Producing ET maps of a
    high spatial resolution has been a challenge as only coarse resolution thermal
    bands from satellite sensors. So ET are retrieved by many remote sensing models
    (e.g. SEBS, RS-NP) which have a low spatial resolution. To improve the resolution,
    two main procedures of downscaling for ET are introduced: input downscaling (the
    ET calculated from the input data of downscaling) and output downscaling (ET can
    be directly downscaled). For the former one, using the input data of downscaling
    by various the approach of downscaling (e.g. STARFM, Collaborative Kriging method),
    ET is retrieved which has a high spatial resolution by some remote sensing retrieved
    models (e.g. SEBS, SEBEL) (Ali Shamsoddini, 2021, Ma et al., 2018, Mahour et al.,
    2017, Li et al., 2017). For the output downscaling, ET in a coarsely spatial resolution
    can also be downscaled by the downscaled approaches which are primarily applied
    to downscale reflectance and land surface temperature, such as ESTARFM, linear
    regression method based on Landsat and MODIS data (Mahour et al., 2017, Cui et
    al., 2021, Shen et al., 2016). For different remote sensing retrieved models of
    ET, those two downscaling procedures have different performances. In a previous
    study, the result of ET shows that output downscaling with regression between
    images is the most preferred scheme in a semi-arid region (Hong et al., 2011).
    A further estimate of ET shows that two downscaling procedures are similar, but
    the input downscaling procedure can better demonstrate the spatial heterogeneity
    of ET in a semi-arid region (Mahour et al., 2017). Obviously, the performance
    of the first procedure is related to the quality of the input data of downscaling
    (Tang et al., 2013, Mccabe and Wood, 2006). Furthermore, the spatial downscaling
    of different input data will differently affect ET estimation, especially for
    different models of ET (Zhang, 2022, Cascone et al., 2019, Guo et al., 2017).
    For the SEBS model, LST (Land Surface Temperature) with contribution of relative
    error of 20 % and 38 % for ET at the spatial scales of 240 and 960 m, respectively
    (Ershadi et al., 2013). For the SEBAL model, band reflectance with the contribution
    of relative error exceeds 60 % for ET at the spatial scales of 60 and 120 m (Hong
    et al., 2009).For the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) model,
    the surface albedo with contribution of relative error of 36.8 % for ET (Mattar
    et al., 2014). However, the current research has not explored the effect of spatial
    downscaling of input data on ET based on NP approach. Whilst the majority of previous
    studies about ET estimation have employed ET method with complex parameterization
    (Ali Shamsoddini, 2021, Li et al., 2017, Yi et al., 2019), NP approach is used
    here for retrieval of the ET because of its simple input data. Doing this provides
    an opportunity to directly quantify the effect of the input data on each of the
    contributing components of ET retrieval. Further, whilst ESTARFM has been examined
    previously, an evaluation of this approach based on NP approach has not been examined.
    Therefore, this paper compares two procedures including input downscaling and
    output downscaling, studies the influence of the spatial downscaling for input
    data on ET, and discusses the input downscaling procedure''s applicability in
    different underlying surfaces and seasons based on the ESTARFM and the RS-NP model
    to generate the medium resolution(The range is approximately 30–100 m) map of
    ET (Gao et al., 2012). 2. Study area and data 2.1. Study area This paper selects
    the oasis in Zhangye City and its surrounding deserts located in the middle reach
    of the Heihe River Basin (98° to 101°30′E and 38° to 42°N) as the study area (Fig.
    1) (Cui et al., 2021). Heihe River Basin is the second-largest inland river basin
    in northwest China with an area of 142900 km2. Heihe River Basin is divided into
    the upper, middle, and down reaches. The middle reach belongs to a typically arid
    climate with annual precipitation and temperature of 140 mm and 6–8 ℃ respectively.
    In the middle reach, there is mainly cropland, Gobi and desert. In the down reach,
    there is primarily desert (Liu et al., 2018). Limited by the rare sites in the
    middle reach, the sites located at the down reach with a similar climate and underlying
    surface are also used for validation. 8 sites in the middle and down reach are
    selected for analysis in the study area. These sites are Daman(Maize, Jan 2014-Dec
    2014), Shen Sha Wo(Sandy desert, June 2012–Apr. 2015), Hua Zhai Zi(Kalidium foliatum
    desert, June 2012–present), Gobi(Reaumuria desert, May 2012–Apr. 2015), Populus
    forest(Forest, July 2013–Apr. 2016), Mixed forest (Populus euphratica and Tamarix,
    July 2013–present),Si Dao Qiao station(Tamarix, July 2013–present) and Cropland
    station(Melon, July 2013–Nov. 2015), respectively. The data of sites are provided
    by the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER). The HiWATER
    is established in 2007. For long-term observations, a hydrometeorological observatory,
    ecohydrological wireless sensor network, and satellite remote sensing are now
    in operation (Liu et al., 2018). (Table 1). Download : Download high-res image

    In this paper, Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov)
    including composite surface reflectance of MOD09 (The spatial and temporal resolution
    is 1 km and instantaneous), daily land surface temperature and emissivity of MOD11A2
    (The spatial and temporal resolution is 1 km and instantaneous) are selected to
    retrieve low-resolution broadband reflectance, soil heat flux, net radiation (Pagano
    and Durham, 1993). In addition, the China Meteorological Administration Land Data
    Assimilation System (CLDAS) product(The spatial and temporal resolution: 0.0625°and
    1 h) from China National Meteorological Centre (https://data.cma.cn/) including
    surface pressure (PRS), specific humidity (RHU) and atmospheric temperature (TMP)
    are also used as the input data of the RS-NP model (Shi et al., 2014). Due to
    the study area has relatively flat terrain and similar land cover, there is little
    variation in PRS, RHU and TMP within a certain range (Prihodko and Goward, 1997).
    So PRS, RHU and TMP derived from CLDAS data is used for ET retrieval based on
    MODIS and Landsat8 data and to retrieve low-resolution downwelling longwave radiation
    and net radiation and high-resolution net radiation. To get the high-resolution
    ET, the data of reflectance from Landsat 8(The spatial and temporal resolution
    is 30 m and 16 days) (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) are selected to retrieve
    high-resolution land surface temperature, broadband reflectance, land surface
    emissivity, downwelling shortwave radiation, soil heat flux and net radiation.
    The band10 of Landsat 8 data is used for LST estimation. The dates of the selected
    Landsat 8 data are listed here: Spring: March 2, May 5; Summer: June 6, August
    9; Autumn: November 13; Winer: January 13, December 15, December 31. Accordingly,
    the dates of selected MODIS data are listed here: Spring: March 2, March 18, April
    3, May 5; Summer: June 6, July 8, July 24, July 31, August 9; Autumn: November

    data The data processing of HiWATER includes careful data processing and screening
    are performed, data quality self-examination, cross-check, and expert review are
    applied. Finally, the metadata for each dataset are written including station
    descriptions, processing steps, notices, references, and projects. An automated
    weather stations (AMS) and an eddy covariance (EC) system were installed at each
    observation site. Meteorological data, including air pressure, precipitation,
    wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, humidity, and the four components
    of radiation, were measured using AWSs at 10-min intervals. The ground heat flux
    was measured using a soil heat flux plate buried at a depth of 5 cm around each
    flux tower at a 10-min interval. The turbulent fluxes were measured using EC systems
    with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz. The raw, high-frequency data were processed
    using Edire software and finally average over 30 min. ET is calibrated by the
    residual energy term method to validate the ET of downscaling. Other meteorological
    measurements are used to quantify the contribution of error of input data of RS-NP
    model (Pan et al., 2017). 3. Methodology 3.1. ET retrieval methods This paper
    uses Landsat 8 and MODIS data to retrieve ET based on RS-NP model, respectively.
    Landsat 8 data is used to generate high-resolution ET, and MODIS data is used
    to generate low-resolution ET. High-resolution ET and the part of low-resolution
    ET data are used to establish the model of downscaling, and the remaining low-resolution
    ET data through the model of downscaling to obtain high-resolution ET data. In
    addition, the methods for retrieving some physical quantities (surface emissivity,
    shortwave downwelling radiation and broadband reflectance) in the RS-NP model
    using Landsat 8 and MODIS data are different. 3.1.1. ET retrieval based on MODIS
    data In NP method, the ET as a mechanical and thermodynamic process, follows Hamilton’s
    principle in macrostate systems. In a macrostate system, net radiation serves
    as potential energy, and soil heat flux, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux
    serve as kinetic energy. By virtue of the Hamiltonian system, the land surface
    temperature (LST) serves as a generalized coordinate of the dynamical system in
    phase space. So in RS-NP model (Pan et al., 2022), LE (latent heat flux, the consumed
    energy in the process of ET) can be calculated by Eq. (1): (1) where LE is latent
    heat flux, is the net radiation, is the soil heat flux, is LST, is the land surface
    emissivity, is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, is near-surface atmospheric temperature
    which is provided by CLDAS, is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure at the
    temperature , and is the psychometric constant.Δ,γ and ε can be estimated by Eqs.
    (2), (3), (4) (Pan Xin, 2022), respectively. (2) (3) where is the specific heat
    at constant pressure (1.013 × 10−3MJkg−1K−1), is the air pressure which is provided
    by CLDAS, is the ratio of water vapor to air molecular weight (about 0.622), is
    Latent heat of water vaporization (2.5 × 106J/kg). For derived from MODIS, it
    can be calculated by Eq. (4) (Pan Xin, 2022): (4) ε31 and ε32 are the surface
    emissivity of MODIS data is provided by the MOD11 product. For , it can be calculated
    by Eq. (5) (Bisht et al., 2005). (5) where is the broadband reflectance, is the
    downwelling shortwave radiation and is the downwelling longwave radiation. For
    , it can be calculated by Eq. (6) (Pan Xin, 2022). (6) where , , , , and are the
    surface reflectance of MODIS, provided by the MOD09 product. For , it can be calculated
    by Eq. (7) (Liu et al, 2023). (7) where is solar constant of the top atmosphere
    (about 1367 W/m2), is the earth-sun distance (astronomical unit), is the solar
    incident angle (rad). is the atmospheric transmissivity which can be evaluated
    by Eq. (8) (Allen et al., 2007): (8) where is the correction coefficient (0＜  ≤
    1.0), is 1.0 in clear air and 0.5 in dirty air. is the solar incidence angle for
    a ‘flat’ application. is the atmospheric water vapor content (mm) which can be
    calculated by Eq. (9) (Allen et al., 1998, Allen et al., 2003): (9) (10) For ,
    it can be estimated by Eq. (11) (Pan Xin, 2022). (11) where is the air emissivity
    which can be estimated by Eq. (12) (Prata, 2010). (12) where is the near-surface
    water vapor partial pressure (KPa) which can be estimated by Eq. (13) (Pan Xin,
    2022). (13) where is the specific humidity which is provided by CLDAS. For , it
    can be estimated by Eq. (14) (Moran et al., 1989): (14) where is the normalized
    difference vegetation index and is composed of the reflectance of red and near-infrared
    band. 3.1.2. ET retrieval based on Landsat 8 data Based on MODIS and Landsat 8
    data, the retrieval methods for other physical quantities including Rn, Gs, and
    is the same, except for emissivity and broadband reflectance (Liu et al, 2023).
    For derived from Landsat 8 (Ren et al., 2017), it can be calculated by Eq.(15)
    (Garrison, 1992): (15) where and are coefficients and constant transferring band
    reflectance to emissivity. The physical quantities and are the emissivity from
    vegetation and background, respectively. is the emissivity increment from the
    cavity effect caused by the multiple scattering in the pixel. is the fraction
    of vegetation cover (FVC) and can be estimated by the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) (Eq. (16)) (Kerr et al., 1992). (16) where and are the NDVI for the
    barren soil pixel and fully vegetated pixel, and they can be evaluated by the
    average value of NDVI in the study region of dense vegetation and bare soil, respectively.
    For , it can be calculated by Eq. (17) (Yinghai and Park, 2016). (17) where ,
    , and are the surface reflectance of Landsat 8 data. LST data of the Landsat 8
    product is used for retrieving ET. The spatial resolution of LST data is 100 m.
    For , it can be calculated by Eq. (18). (18) where is the value of band10; The
    unit of is Kelvin (K). 3.2. Downscaling procedure Rn, Gs, LST and Ta are needed
    to calculate ET based on the NP approach. Rn can be calculated by downwelling
    shortwave radiation, downwelling longwave radiation, upwelling shortwave radiation
    and upwelling longwave radiation (Z, H.,2008). For clear sky conditions, the downwelling
    shortwave radiation and downwelling longwave radiation do not change enormously
    (<1W/m2) within a specific range (Prata, 2010). Therefore, the changes in Rn are
    mainly caused by upwelling shortwave radiation (related to downwelling shortwave
    radiation and reflectance) and upwelling longwave radiation (related to surface
    emissivity and surface temperature) (Sheng, 2010). Gs can be represented as a
    function of Rn and NDVI, so the differentiation of Gs is mainly reflected in the
    differentiation of Rn and NDVI (Garrison, 1992). Some studies have shown that
    the does not change dramatically within 6 km, and the change in does not exceed
    0.6° (Prihodko and Goward, 1997). Therefore, through the above analysis, to obtain
    higher precision ET, broadband reflectance (BBR), NDVI, land surface emissivity
    (LSE) and LST are downscaled in this paper. The procedure of downscaling in this
    paper is divided into two procedures: input and output downscaling. Input downscaling
    procedure refers to downscaled BBR, NDVI, LSE and LST brought into the RS-NP model
    to get high-resolution ET in the spatial resolution of 100 m. Based on MODIS data
    and Landsat 8 data, low-resolution (1-km) and high-resolution (100 m) ET are obtained
    based on RS-NP model, respectively. Output downscaling procedure refers to directly
    downscaling the ET in the spatial resolution of 1-km to get ET in spatial resolution
    of 100 m by using ESTARFM based on at least two pairs of ET images in the spatial
    resolutions of 1-km and 100 m. The time of LST derived from MODIS data is normalized
    based on Duan''s description (Duan, 2014). In this study, LST of CLDAS data at
    10:00 and 12:00 are selected. The LST of CLDAS data at two different local solar
    times is linearly interpolated with the local solar time difference to obtain
    the slope of LST versus local solar time during the period 10:00–12:00. By using
    the slope, the LST of MODIS data is normalized to the same time as Landsat data.
    The input and output downscaling procedure is as follows (Fig. 2): Download :
    Download high-res image (358KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flow
    chart of two downscaling procedures. With reference to earlier work, the ESTARFM
    is used to obtain data on reflectance with high resolution (Zhu et al., 2010).
    Subsequently, it is applied to the mapping of the high-precision NDVI, LST and
    ET (Hazaymeh and Hassan, 2015, Rao, 1984). The principle of the ESTARFM is to
    obtain the high-resolution reflectance of the predicted date by introducing similar
    pixels, transformational and weighted coefficients. The ESTARFM should use the
    reflectance of at least two pairs of coarse-resolution and high-resolution image.
    Compared with other downscaled methods, the ESTARFM can improve the accuracy of
    the fusion in heterogeneous regions. 3.3. Assessment indicators The R2 (coefficient
    of determination), bias (mean error), RE (relative error), and RMSE (root mean
    square error) are used to evaluate the physical quantities of downscaling and
    the results of retrieved ET (Yang et al., 2022). R2 represents the consistency
    between the retrieved ET and the measured ET. Bias is used to evaluate the system
    error of the model. RE is used to evaluate the relative deviation between the
    retrieved value and measured value of ET. RMSE is used to reflect the sampling
    standard deviation between the retrieved value and the measured value of the ET.
    3.4. Evaluating the influence of the downscaling of input on ET estimation error
    To evaluate the influence of the downscaling (from 1-km to 100 m) of each main
    kind of input on ET estimation error, the error of ET estimation introduced by
    low-resolution input is quantified in the way of simulation that one of the main
    kinds of input is not downscaled and other inputs are downscaled. There are three
    procedures as follows that need to be done in this part. Firstly, all input data
    (LSTH, BBRH, LSEH, NDVIH) are high-resolution data in the spatial resolution of
    100 m, which are brought into the RS-NP model to obtain ET. The mean and relative
    error of this ET are denoted as biasH and REH. Secondly, all input data (LSTL,
    BBRL, LSEL, NDVIL) are low-resolution data in the spatial resolution of 1 km.
    The low-resolution input data are resampled to 100 m. Based on the above the way
    of simulation, the LSTH is replaced by resampled LSTL to obtain ET. The other
    three input data are also processed similarly. So the four values of ET are obtained,
    their mean error are denoted as biasL included biasL-LST, biasL-BBR, biasL-LSE
    and biasL-NDVI. The relate error of these ET are denoted as REL included REL-LST,
    REL-BBR, REL-LSE and REL-NDVI. Finally, the input data that needs to be downscaled
    is searched in the way of comparing with the differences between RE(bias)H and
    RE(bias)L. 3.5. Sensitivity analysis of LST for NP method In this paper, the followed
    method is used to perform sensitivity analysis on the LST of the NP method (Wang
    et al., 2019). (19) where is the error of ET caused by the error of , is the error
    of , and is the ET of and , respectively. This paper explores the percentage of
    changes in ET by changing by ± 5 %, ± 10 %, ± 15 %, and ± 20 %, respectively.
    4. Results 4.1 The performance of ESTARFM for input data To evaluate the performance
    of ESTARFM, the values of NDVI, BBR, LSE and LST calculated by Landsat8 are used
    as the reference to compare the results of the downscaling based on MODIS data
    in the study area and down reach. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the NDVI, BBR,
    LSE and LST by downscaling on July 24, 2014 in the study area and down reach.
    The spatial distribution of the four physical quantities by downscaling has a
    high spatial resolution and the trend of spatial distribution is similar with
    physical quantities calculated by Landsat 8. The value of NDVI in the vegetation
    area is higher while the value of NDVI in the surrounding bare land area is lower
    in the study area. In the down reach, the red box represents vegetated areas,
    while the black box represents desert areas. From the Fig. 3, the downscaled NDVI
    and NDVI derived from Landsat8 data has the higher value by comparing with NDVI
    derived from MODIS data. Meanwhile, downscaled LST and LST derived from Landsat8
    data has the better performance at the spatial distribution by comparing with
    LST derived from MODIS data in the desert area. The distribution of the NDVI,
    BBR, LSE and LST derived from MODIS data cannot express the distribution of values
    well, especially down reach. So overall, the spatial distribution of NDVI, BBR,
    LSE and LST by downscaling in study area and down reach accords with the spatial
    distribution of BBR, NDVI, LSE and LSA calculated by Landsat 8. However, the results
    of LST by downscaling are slightly worse in non-vegetated areas, which may be
    caused by the relatively poor accuracy of LST from MOD11 in non-vegetated areas
    (Li et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The spatial distribution of four physical quantities by
    downscaling and the four physical quantities are calculated by MODIS and Landsat
    8 data (a. Middle reach, b. Down reach). The spatial resolution of physical quantities
    calculated by MODIS data is aggregated to 30 m. Physical quantities by downscaling
    and physical quantities calculated by MODIS data compare with physical quantities
    calculated by Landsat 8 data by making the difference in the study area and down
    reach. The value of error of physical quantities by downscaling is smaller than
    that of the value of error of physical quantities calculated by MODIS data in
    the study area and down reach (Fig. 4). There are no large errors in NDVI and
    BBR by downscaling. The errors are concentrated in -0.1 ∼ 0.1 and -0.02 ∼ 0.02
    in NDVI and BBR by downscaling, respectively. Comparing with physical quantities
    derived from MODIS data, the statistical percentages of error for four downscaled
    physical quantities conform to a normal distribution. The error of LSE calculated
    by MODIS data is concentrated in 0.01 ∼ 0.02 accounting for 50 % of the whole,
    which is underestimated. The error of LSE by downscaling is concentrated in 0
    ∼ 0.01 accounting for 45.7 % of the whole. Compared with other physical quantities,
    the error from LST calculated by MODIS data and LST by downscaling is larger.
    LST calculated by MODIS data is underestimated, while LST by downscaling is overestimated.
    This is because the accuracy of LST from MODIS data is not high, which leads to
    errors in LST by downscaling (Yu et al., 2011). Overall, the performance of physical
    quantities by downscaling is better than physical quantities derived from MODIS
    data in the study area and down reach (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image

    spatial distribution of the four physical quantities by downscaling based on the
    ESTARFM is consistent with the results calculated by Landsat 8 data. The statistical
    percentage of the error of the physical quantities by downscaling is basically
    in line with normal distribution. It indicates the performance of ESTARFM is relatively
    stable. 4.2. Comparison of two downscaling procedures Two downscaling procedures,
    input and output downscaling, are investigated. The estimates of ET are compared
    with observed values of ET and are shown in Fig. 6. 8 sites (Daman superstation,
    Shen Sha Wo station, Hua Zhai Zi station, Gobi station, Populus forest station,
    Mixed forest station, Si Dao Qiao superstation and Cropland station) are used
    for validation. The results of the input downscaling procedure are closer to the
    observed values with R2, bias, RMSE, and RE are 0.92, 11.9 W/m2, 41.8 W/m2 and
    4.9 %, respectively. The R2, bias, RMSE, and RE of the output downscaling procedure
    are 0.91, 7.1 W/m2, 43.2 W/m2 and 2.9 %, respectively. Moreover, the results of
    the input and output downscaling procedure and the results derived from Landsat
    data is cross validated (Fig. 7). The R2, bias, RMSE, and RE of the input downscaling
    procedure are 0.96, -2.1 W/m2, 41.8 W/m2 and 4.0 %. The results of the output
    downscaling procedure overestimate the ET value by comparing with the results
    derived from Landsat data with the R2, bias, RMSE, and RE of 0.94, 24.8 W/m2,
    46.8 W/m2 and 9.0 %.Comparing with the output downscaling procedure, the result
    of input downscaling procedure is more consistent with Landsat''s result. Moreover,
    all time consumption of input parameter downscaling procedure of average per image
    is 115.9 s including the time of four parameter downscaling (114.9 s) and ET retrieval
    (0.1 s). All time consumption of output parameter downscaling procedure of average
    per image is 72.6 s including the time of low-resolution ET retrieval (3.1 s)
    and ET downscaling (69.5 s). It indicates that the input downscaling procedure
    is slightly superior to the output downscaling procedure except the time consumption.
    The image (July 24, 2014) is selected for comparing the spatial distribution of
    ET obtained by two kinds of downscaling procedures. The spatial distribution of
    ET obtained by the two downscaling procedures is similar in the study area and
    down reach (Fig. 8). The ET in the vegetated area is relatively high and reaches
    up to 600 W/m2 in the study area. In some non-vegetated areas, the ET is lower
    than 100 W/m2. In vegetated and non-vegetated areas, the ET obtained by the output
    downscaling procedure is higher than that obtained by the input downscaling procedure
    in the study area and down reach. In some places (such as the red and blue borders),

    of input on ET estimation error 4.3.1. The analysis of the influence of downscaling
    of the main kind of input data The main input data includes BBR, LST, LSE, and
    NDVI. Section 3.4 is used to evaluate the influence of the downscaling (from1-km
    to 100 m) of the main kind of input data. As seen in Table 3, in the whole area,
    the values of biasL and REL is 11.9 W/m2 and 4.9 %. In the whole area, the biasL-LST
    and REL-LST is 73.0 W/m2 and 30.0 %, respectively. Moreover, the biasL-BBR and
    REL-BBR is 23.7 W/m2 and 9.7 %, respectively. The sum of REL-LST and REL-BBR is
    approximately 40.0 % of the ET value. In the non-vegetated area, the values of
    biasL-LST and REL-LST are relatively large, with 99.7 W/m2 and 90.6 %, respectively.
    In the vegetated area, the values of biasL-BBR and REL-BBR is 23.9 W/m2 and 6.8
    %, respectively. In the whole area, the values of biasL-LSE and biasL-NDVI is
    9.6 W/m2 and 21.3 W/m2, respectively. As seen in Fig. 9, in the non-vegetated
    area, the difference between biasH and biasL-LST is -109.6 W/m2, and the difference
    between REH and REL-LST is -79.5 %. In the whole area, the difference between
    REH and REL-NDVI is -3.8 %. In addition, the difference between biasL and biasL-NDVI
    is -9.4 W/m2. In the vegetated area, the difference between biasH and biasL-BBR
    is -27.0 W/m2. The difference between biasH and biasL are sorted in order from
    largest to smallest: biasL-LST > biasL-BBR > biasL-NDVI > biasL-LSE. Overall,
    the downscaling (from1-km to 100 m) of LST and BBR has a significant impact on
    ET results. And in the RS-NP model, NDVI is not sensitive to ET results. In the
    future, to generate high-precision ET maps, LST and BBR are required to downscale.

    of narrowband reflectance to BBR Since BBR is composed of narrowband reflectance,
    it is important to analyze the impact of narrowband reflectance on BBR. Table
    4 shows that the band reflectance of the NIR has a greater influence on BBR from
    the whole area. In the whole area, the vegetated and the non-vegetated area, the
    percentages of error in the band reflectance of the NIR to BBR error are 42.0
    %, 31.1 % and 57.5 %, respectively. The SWIR-1(Short wave infrared-1) reflectance
    has also great influence on BBR estimation. The percentages of error on the SWIR-1
    reflectance in BBR error are 18.6 %, 21.3 % and 7.5 % from the whole, vegetated,
    and non-vegetated areas, respectively. But, the percentages of error on the SWIR-2
    (Short wave infrared-2) reflectance in BBR error are only 6.0 % in the whole area.
    It proves that the NIR reflectance has the greatest impact on BBR estimation.

    analysis of the input downscaling procedure 4.4.1. Different surface types To
    further analyze the applicability of the input downscaling procedure, Fig. 10
    shows the scatter plot of the results of ET by downscaling in the non-vegetated
    and vegetated areas. The horizontal coordinate represents the observed value of
    ET and the vertical coordinate represents the value of ET after downscaling. In
    Fig. 10(a), the R2, bias, RE, and RMSE are 0.44,-9.9 W/m2, 11.1 % and 32.5 W/m2
    in. non-vegetated areas, respectively. For the vegetated area (Fig. 10(b)), the
    downscaled results agree with the observed values with R2, bias, RE, and RMSE
    are 0.92, -3.1 W/m2, 1.6 % and 41.9 W/m2, respectively. In general, R2 and RE
    of results of ET by downscaling in the vegetated area are better than those in
    the non-vegetated area. It implies that the applicability of the input downscaling
    procedure is greater in the vegetated area than in the non-vegetated area. That
    agrees with the findings of Pan et al (2016) which the results of ET obtained
    by NP approach in vegetation areas are better than those in desert areas (Pan
    et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download : Download

    seasons Fig. 11, the input downscaling procedure has the best applicability in
    summer with the R2, bias, RE, and RMSE are 0.93, 9.9 W/m2, 4.1 % and 37.3 W/m2.
    Although there may be snow and ice in winter, the result of ET obtained by input
    downscaling procedure is relatively ideal. In the winter, the RMSE is 25.2 W/m2
    which is superior to the value of RMSE in summer. The results of ET in autumn
    with the RE of 9.2 % are slightly better than those in other seasons. In spring,
    the input downscaling procedure with the R2, bias, RE, and RMSE are 0.62, -21.1

    in the study area and down reach are analyzed to further verify the applicability
    of input downscaling procedures in the different seasons. As seen in Fig. 12,
    the value of ET is the highest in summer, followed by spring, autumn, and winter.
    In both reaches, the maximum ET in summer can reach 646W/m2 while the maximum
    ET in winter can reach 152 W/m2. The ET in the vegetated area is significantly
    higher than in the non-vegetated area. It indicates that the ET obtained by the
    input downscaling procedure has a satisfactory result. In conclusion, the input
    downscaling procedure based on NP approach has good applicability in different
    seasons. Download : Download high-res image (605KB) Download : Download full-size

    NP method LST is an important boundary condition for energy balance and has a
    significant impact on the LE results derived from NP method. Therefore, it is
    necessary to conduct sensitivity analysis on LST. Fig. 13, the averaged LE exceed
    to ±60 % by changing LST with ±10 %.When changing the LST ±20 %, the averaged
    LE is about ±80 %. This indicates that LST has a significant impact on LE results
    derived from NP method. In the future, the downscaling of LST should be carefully
    considered. Download : Download high-res image (147KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 13. Sensitivity analysis of the LST for ET. 5. Discussion High-resolution
    (30 m) ET data is generated by combining the ESTARFM with a Non-Parametric (NP)
    approach. Comparing with previous ET methods, including RS-PM, triangular method,
    SEBAL and SEBS, the NP approach has no complex parameterizations of resistances,
    subjectively determined wet/dry edges and determination of empirical coefficient
    (Pan and Liu, 2020). The ESTARFM enhances the accuracy of prediction for heterogeneous
    landscapes and improves the accuracy of selecting similar pixels (Zhu et al.,
    2010). However, the NP approach has some limitations and the accuracy of NP approach
    is not ideal in the non-vegetated area. The ESTARFM can only predict these images
    when their time is within the range of the trained time of images. Additionally,
    the ESTARFM may consume more time (Zhu et al., 2010). It is worth noting that
    spatial heterogeneity of underlying surfaces has influence on ET estimation (Ma
    et al., 2018). Therefore, the next step of research may consider mixed pixel decomposition
    to get better result of ET estimation. The impact of spatial downscaling for input
    data (LSE, BBR, LST and NDVI) on ET based on NP approach and quantified the error
    contribution of input data to ET is studied. This paper conducts that BBR and
    LST greatly affect ET estimation. Similar conclusions also have indicated that
    vegetation index, land surface albedo and land surface temperature greatly influence
    ET estimation (Moran et al., 2004). However, in this paper, NDVI is not the biggest
    factor affecting ET. Comparing with other retrieved methods of ET, the NP approach
    is not sensitive to complex surfaces of vegetation and has certain stability (Moran
    et al., 2004). Some studies have shown that based on the SBABL model, the input
    data of the model have different impacts on ET at different spatial scales (Wang,
    2012). Therefore, in the future, input data should be upscaled and downscaled
    based on the NP approach to further clarify the error contribution of input data
    to ET at different spatial scales. This is not only conducive to solving the problem
    of scale effect for ET, but also provides technical support for ET applications
    at different scales. Moreover, the accuracy of the LST data of MODIS products
    is relatively unsatisfactory, resulting in a large error of LST by downscaling.
    The LST will be obtained with high precision in the future based on the method
    which combines physical mechanisms and machine learning (Hu et al., 2022, Liu
    et al., 2006). ESA’s Sentinel and the Chinese Gao Fen data sets will be considered
    as data sources for downscaling of ET. 6. Conclusions The aim of this research
    is to generate medium-resolution maps of ET. Based on RS-NP model, the performance
    of ESTARFM is evaluated. This paper compares the input downscaling with the output
    downscaling procedure and analyze the influence of the downscaling (from 1-km
    to 100 m) of input on ET estimation error. In various underlying surfaces and
    seasons, the applicability of the input downscaling procedure is explored. The
    conclusions are as follows: (1) An input downscaling and an output downscaling
    procedure are compared. The R2, bias, RMSE, and RE of the input downscaling procedure
    are 0.92, 11.9 W/m2, 41.8 W/m2 and 4.9 %. Compared with the output downscaling
    procedure, the input downscaling procedure reduced absolute value of RMSE by 1.4
    W/m2. The input downscaling procedure is slightly better for obtaining the downscaled
    ET than the output downscaling procedure. (2) The influence of the downscaling
    (from 1-km to 100 m) of input on ET estimation error is analyzed. In the whole
    area, the neglect of the downscaling of LST and BBR bring in more error of ET
    estimation with the values of 73.0 W/m2 and 23.7 W/m2, which account for the 30.0
    % and 9.7 % of the ET value, respectively. In the non-vegetated area, these values
    are even greater, reaching 99.7 W/m2 and 23.4 W/m2, respectively. The neglect
    of the downscaling of NDVI and LSE has a relatively small impact on the estimation
    of ET errors. This shows that LST and BBR need to be downscaled to generate a
    high-precision map of ET based on RS-NP model. In detail, the error of the NIR
    reflectance has the greatest influence on the error BBR estimation, which account
    for 42 % of the error of BBR. (3) The applicability of the input downscaling procedure
    is explored. From the perspective of different underlying surfaces, the applicability
    in vegetated areas is better than that in non-vegetated areas. The result of ET
    with R2, bias, RE, and RMSE are 0.92, -3.1 W/m2,1.6 % and 41.9 W/m2 in the vegetated
    area. From the perspective of different seasons, the absolute value of bias of
    retrieving ET in each season is less than 22.0 W /m2.The procedure''s applicability
    in summer is the best with the R2, bias, RE, and RMSE of 0.93, 9.9 W/m2, 4.1 %
    and 37.3 W/m2, respectively. This paper compares different downscaling procedures
    and thinks LST and BBR need to be downscaled to generate high-resolution maps
    of ET based on the RS-NP model for the first time. At the same time, the result
    provides technical support for future downscaling work based on RS-NP model. But
    the retrieved algorithm of input data is required to improve based on the NP approach
    to make the ET results more accurate. Furthermore, it is necessary to further
    explore the impact of input data with different spatial scales for ET based on
    the NP approach. Author contributions Zi Yang wrote this paper and performed the

    by pushing storage and processing capabilities from centralized nodes to edge
    devices that are closer to where the data are gathered, resulting in reduced network
    delays [2], [3]. The most common machine learning approach used in cloud-based
    applications is Centralized Learning (Fig. 1a) where datasets from different clients
    are sent to a central cloud for storage and to train a machine learning model.
    A model trained in this centralized manner is potentially the most accurate model
    as it has been trained on all of the datasets. However, centralized training introduces
    challenges associated with transferring data to the cloud, such as data privacy
    and communication overheads. Conversely, Local Learning is an alternative where
    we train the machine learning models directly on the devices where the data are
    hosted using their own local computing resources (Fig. 1b), Since data are not
    shared among clients or with the server, local learning solves the privacy and
    communication overhead issues of centralized learning. However, local learning
    alone can struggle with machine learning bias. This is an emergent problem since
    data at these devices are often non-independent and identically distributed (iid).
    For instance, many data patterns sensors collect are geographically-related. Thus,
    sensors from different locations will likely collect different types of data.
    Learning independently can result in models that do not generalize well which
    can afflict the knowledge extraction across the entire system. A third alternative
    is to apply the recent Federated Learning (FL) paradigm for distributed learning
    (Fig. 1c). FL is a distributed machine learning technique that enables multiple
    clients (e.g., mobile devices, IoT devices) to collaboratively train a shared
    global model without needing their raw data transmitted to the cloud. Instead,
    local models are trained on each client using their own data, similar to local
    learning. Where FL diverges from local learning is that the server will periodically
    collect model updates from the client devices and “average” them to update the
    global model, which is then redistributed to the client devices for further training.
    FL has shown to work well in the face of non-iid data distributions which are
    common in sensor applications. Therefore, FL is a promising solution for several
    challenges associated with decentralized machine learning, such as data privacy,
    communication efficiency, scalability, data unavailability or heterogeneity, system
    heterogeneity in terms of computation power, storage, and energy availability,
    computation efficiency, and better model performance [4], [5]. Standard FL may
    incur high communication costs as the model updates need to be shared with the
    central server, creating an interesting trade-off when considering that centralized
    training requires that all data be shared with the central server (Fig. 2a). In
    cases where the communication between the sensors and the central server is very
    poor (i.e., low data transfer rate, unreliable connection), this can be a significant
    challenge. Such overhead can affect individual sensor life and the overall performance
    of the application, especially if the sensor application has power constraints
    and limited connectivity [6]. One possible solution is to expand the infrastructure
    and use hierarchical FL. Under hierarchical FL, there are additional aggregation
    nodes that may have stronger connections to the nearby sensors. These aggregation
    nodes also participate in additional levels of aggregation to make sure knowledge
    is learned throughout the entire system. Hierarchical FL overcomes some of these
    issues by allowing data to remain on the edge devices, such as sensors and smart
    devices. It enables optimization of computational and communication overheads
    that can be customized to suit the needs of specific applications and networks.
    Fig. 1. Comparison of (a) Centralized, (b) Local, and (c) Federated learning architectures.
    Federated learning enables collaborative learning among multiple edge devices
    without compromising data privacy. Centralized learning relies on a central server
    to train a global model on data from all devices, while local learning trains
    multiple local models on disjoint subsets of data. Show All Fig. 2. Illustration
    of (a) Standard federated learning (FL) and (b) Hierarchical federated learning
    and their interaction between lot devices, edge and cloud servers. The aggregation
    nodes are where the local model updates from the participating devices or intermediary
    nodes are combined to form a global model. Show All Different approaches of hierarchical
    FL can be employed by making use of available networking hubs and structures,
    such as a cloud server that is accessed over the internet and an edge server,
    which is a computer server that is located closer to the devices that it serves
    at the network edge (Fig. 2b). One option is to aggregate models within a cloud
    server, while other options can involve hierarchical aggregation at the edge server
    which sends the model updates to the cloud for further aggregation or storage.
    This allows local processing power and storage capacity to perform distributed
    learning without relying solely on a central server, resulting in improved scalability,
    reduced latency and privacy preservation of sensitive data. While hierarchical
    FL has shown potential in various domains, including precision agriculture and
    environmental monitoring, [4] points out that very few production FL applications
    have been reported, with most work being proof-of-concept prototypes. The paradigm
    itself is relatively new and its implementation requires careful consideration
    of various issues such as data inequality [7], [8] and malicious attacks [9]–[11].
    Another important challenge to overcome with FL is the cost of adoption and the
    incentives to incorporate FL into existing systems. In FL, devices must contribute
    their computational resources and data to train a model. However, some organizations
    may be reluctant to participate in a large FL endeavor due to the computational
    resources needed to participate and data transfer and communication costs. Furthermore,
    there may not be the right incentives to join if a benefit from the global model''s
    performance is not properly recognized. For example, an industry leader may be
    less incentivized to adopt multi-organizational FL if they are already the primary
    source of data as their marginal benefit would be significantly lower. To address
    these challenges, various methods have been proposed to incentivize participation
    in FL. These methods include providing monetary or non-monetary rewards for contributing
    data, ensuring that the global model''s performance benefits all participants,
    and providing greater control over the use of data by participants. For example,
    [12] proposed a reward-based mechanism that provides tokens to devices that contribute
    data to the FL model, which can then be used to purchase services or products.
    Authors in [13] propose a privacy-preserving FL model that allows participants
    to retain control over their data and provides incentives for contributing high-quality
    data. In this article, we present a case study of the feasibility and benefits
    of FL for precision agricultural spraying and extend it to a larger conceptual
    hierarchical FL architecture for smart farming. We also discuss ongoing efforts
    to improve hierarchical FL systems using standardized quality frameworks to systematically
    identify and prioritize the efforts. Finally, we cover open problems associated
    with this technology and highlight its potential to transform numerous domains
    such as precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, healthcare, and smart
    infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a roadmap for further development of hierarchical
    FL in instrumentation and measurement. Federated Learning for Precision Spraying
    In the previous section, we discussed the different types of learning architectures
    that can be applied to edge devices. In this section, we present a case study
    involving precision spraying in agriculture (Fig. 3) to highlight the benefits
    of FL. Traditional spraying methods often apply pesticides uniformly across an
    entire field, leading to waste and potential harm to crops. In contrast, precision
    spraying uses cameras, optical sensors, and GPS receivers to provide accurate
    location data, enabling robots to apply spray only where necessary. However, the
    advanced data processing and machine learning required for precision spraying
    can be resource-intensive, making it challenging to perform all operations on
    the sensor or robot alone. Data collected from sensors can be processed using
    cloud computing relying on connectivity, but this can be a challenge in remote
    environments. By relying on computational resources at the edge server, data can
    be processed in real-time or limited-time to accelerate the decision-making process.
    FL can further improve spray precision by enabling learning from different data
    sources (e.g., across different locations with different distributions of plant/weed
    species) while preserving data privacy and security. This is particularly important
    for farmers who are concerned about data privacy and potential cyberattacks. Furthermore,
    FL can be flexibly performed on a network of edge devices potentially of different
    types, which can scale up or down to meet the needs of different agricultural
    operations, making it a valuable tool for precision spraying. Fig. 3. Precision
    spraying prototype using edge federated learning. Show All In this feasibility
    study, we limit the discussion to a single source of information, which is a near-infrared
    hyperspectral imaging system that is used to guide the operations of a mobile
    precision pesticide spraying robot at each of the three pasture sites (Site A,
    B and C). Each robot processes the input information using a local machine learning
    model (e.g., an image classifier implemented by a Convolutional Neural Network).
    The intent is to have the robot apply spray to a plant only if the plant is classified
    as a weed, ensuring minimal impact on crops. Storing a machine learning model
    locally ensures that spray operations can continue in areas without network coverage.
    Although the local model is trained using local data (∼71 Megabytes), it periodically
    receives updates (∼0.04 Megabytes) from the server via FL to incorporate knowledge
    learned from other pasture sites. With FL, communication is significantly reduced
    from 71 Megabytes to 0.04 Megabytes. Different forms of computation resources
    reside in each pasture site, with the model potentially being trained on the robot
    using single-board computational devices such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.
    The locally-trained models from each pasture site are then aggregated using Federated
    Averaging [14], a popular aggregation algorithm in FL. The pasture sites are interconnected
    using communication infrastructure for sharing information and enabling FL. The
    dataset used during our evaluation consisted of four labelled classes: three species
    of pastoral weed and a background class of grass (Table 1). The evaluation results
    for our case study with different machine learning methods are shown in Fig. 4,
    whereby FL achieves 96% accuracy. This result is comparable to centralized learning
    where all the data are present, and a marked improvement compared to local learning
    where only local data are present. Our result confirms that FL is capable of addressing
    the dilemma between network latency, bandwidth limitations, data privacy and data
    sharing while providing comparable model performance. Table 1 Pasture Image dataset
    with imbalanced class distributions and disparate volumes of data across sites
    A Hierarchical Federated Learning Architecture for Smart Farrning We now consider
    broadening the precision spraying use case to a larger conceptual hierarchical
    FL architecture for smart farming. Precision agriculture often involves gathering
    heterogeneous data from various sensors within a farm. By leveraging FL, farmers
    can benefit from insights gained from other farms without compromising the privacy
    of their own raw data. This will enable them to enhance crop yields and minimize
    wastage. Fig. 5 illustrates the physical, cyber and networked (interconnected)
    view of a precision agriculture robot at work. Fig. 5a shows the “physical world”
    where the robot has sensors on board and navigates to perform tasks such as harvesting,
    weeding, and spraying. Fig. 5b represents the “cyber world” where the robot processes
    input information from its sensors using a local machine learning model to perform
    high priority tasks that must continue even when the communication fails (i.e.,
    navigation). The robot also monitors the quality of service for communication
    and decides whether to pass on further information or receive information from
    the cloud. Fig. 5c is the “interconnected world” where a group of robots is connected
    via a communication infrastructure for FL to share knowledge and improve their
    respective local machine learning models based on collective learned experiences.
    The types of sensor systems used for smart farming are heterogeneous. For example,
    a smart farm may rely heavily on IoT sensors and cameras to collect and process
    data related to soil quality and plant visual information. Additionally, smart
    farms may use multiple data sources to optimize farming operations. These data
    sources may include historical data, real-time sensor data, and publicly available
    data to predict soil water levels and future weather patterns with machine learning
    models. Fig. 6 illustrates an example of a hierarchical FL architecture for smart
    farming to train lightweight machine learning models on edge devices. Fig. 4.

    of a hierarchical federated learning architecture for smart farming. Show All
    In this example, the architecture uses Apache Kafka, a popular distributed event
    streaming platform. Kafka is used to collect data from IoT devices and sensors
    located at the edge of the network, enabling real-time processing and response
    to changing conditions. Instead of waiting for large amounts of data to be collected
    and sent to a remote, central server, data streaming enables the sensor devices
    to transmit the local models to the edge servers in real-time—thus reducing latency
    and facilitating more efficient use of available network bandwidth. Hierarchical
    FL allows for adaptive clustering of the edge devices involved in the FL process,
    whereby groups of devices can be divided into smaller clusters for the training
    depending on device availability, scalability and power requirements. By making
    use of Kafka clusters to facilitate communication between the edge devices and
    the FL framework, fault tolerance can be incorporated with multiple brokers running
    on different machines to ensure high availability and data replication. FuncX
    [15] is a federated function-as-a-service platform that enables computation, represented
    as programming functions, to be dispatched for execution on edge resources. FuncX
    is used here to manage the deployment of the machine learning models to the edge
    devices and to invoke the models for inference and training. FuncX uses the Parsl
    [16] parallel programming library to manage the parallel execution of the FL tasks
    on edge devices. It is worth noting that this simple architecture can be easily
    extended to include heterogeneous resources such as Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetsons
    with GPUs, which can be deployed near the sensors for more local data processing.
    This introduces interesting research questions on the implicit trade-offs related
    to such system heterogeneity. Overall, using a hierarchical FL architecture for
    edge devices has the potential to revolutionize smart farming by enabling more
    efficient and effective data sharing, processing and decision-making, resulting
    in improved crop yields and reduced water waste. It is also resilient against
    issues such as unreliable network connectivity, which is an important consideration
    as limited network coverage is commonly encountered in agricultural land. Similar
    architectures can be developed for other applications such as: Environmental monitoring:
    Hierarchical FL could enable better analysis of data collected from remote sensors
    and devices, leading to better understanding and management of natural resources.
    Healthcare: Medical sites can collaborate and share machine learning models to
    improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment without having to share sensitive
    patient information. Wearable monitoring devices: IoT devices are integrated into
    devices to monitor human biometric data such as heart rate, temperature and movement
    patterns aiming to identify potential safety hazards and improve worker safety
    in the hazardous work environment. Application Requirements for Hierarchical Federated
    Learning Hierarchical FL systems have great potential to realize new sensor-driven
    applications, as discussed in the previous section. However, the technology faces
    numerous challenges due to the diverse nature of these applications and the equally
    diverse performance requirements. Some of these requirements can conflict with
    one another. To address the needs of these systems systematically, we recommend
    using two widely recognized standards for software quality and data quality, which
    are the ISO/IEC 25012 [17] and ISO/IEC 25010 [18] frameworks, respectively. By
    applying these frameworks, we can identify and prioritize the requirements, design
    appropriate performance metrics, and develop techniques and algorithms that optimize
    the trade-offs between conflicting requirements. This will help ensure that hierarchical
    FL systems are reliable, efficient, and effective and can be deployed in a wide
    range of real-world applications. Functionality is a crucial metric that measures
    the system''s ability to perform consistently and accurately over time. This metric
    is closely related to data quality since poor-quality data can result in unreliable
    and inaccurate machine learning models. Optimizing hierarchical FL parameters,
    applying model personalization and transfer learning techniques, and adapting
    the models to the specific characteristics of each device can help improve functionality.
    Reliability is important for edge devices, which often operate under intermittent
    connectivity, mobility, and resource-constrained conditions [19]. These challenges
    can make it difficult to develop efficient and reliable FL systems. To overcome
    these challenges, researchers are exploring techniques such as task offloading
    [20], adaptive sampling [21], and reinforcement learning to optimize the system
    performance and adapt to changing edge computing environments [22]. Redundancy
    can be introduced by configuring the edge devices into different clusters, which
    may improve reliability in hierarchical FL. Performance efficiency can be evaluated
    by quantifying the computation and communication overheads. In hierarchical FL
    systems, the edge server acts as a coordinator, responsible for aggregating and
    processing the data from multiple edge devices [23]. This can create a huge computationaland
    communication burden on the edge server, which can result in high latency, reduced
    system performance, and increased communication costs. To mitigate these challenges,
    researchers are exploring techniques such as partitioning and scheduling to distribute
    the computation and communication load across multiple edge servers and among
    cloud and edge servers [6]. The use of data streaming techniques helps to further
    reduce communication overheads while also increasing the reliability of the edge
    systems. Furthermore, due to resource constraints, mobility, and varying edge
    computing environments, engineers should consider metrics like system scalability,
    cost/benefit balance, and application size on the edge device to evaluate resource
    utilization. Techniques like task offloading, adaptive sampling, and reinforcement
    learning can further optimize system performance and adapt to changing edge computing
    environments. The convergence rate of the learning process is also a critical
    consideration. Compatibility is essential in terms of device heterogeneity, where
    edge devices may not have the same type of sensors and may run on different operating
    systems and software. Edge devices used in FL systems may differ in terms of their
    hardware capabilities, such as CPU processing power, memory, and battery life,
    as well as their software configurations, such as operating systems and libraries.
    This heterogeneity can lead to statistical heterogeneity in the data collected
    from the devices, making it challenging to develop models that generalize well
    across all devices [24]. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring
    methods such as transfer learning [25] and model personalization [26] that can
    adapt the models to the specific characteristics of each device. Security is a
    significant concern for hierarchical FL systems. FL provides some level of privacy,
    but to protect data and models from malicious actors, techniques like secure aggregation,
    differential privacy, blockchain, and homomorphic encryption can be applied. Hierarchical
    FL systems may have edge servers from different sources, which makes the systems
    more vulnerable to security threats such as data leakage, model poisoning, and
    inference attacks [23]. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring
    techniques such as secure aggregation [27], differential privacy [28], and homomorphic
    encryption [29] to ensure that the data and models are protected from malicious
    actors. Metrics like confidentiality, currentness, and reliability can be used
    to evaluate the severity of security challenges, as defined by the ISO/IEC 25010
    standard for data security and accessibility. Dynamic infrastructure is a common
    problem in hierarchical FL systems. In these settings, the aggregation nodes are
    not necessarily static or fixed. It may be necessary for the aggregation node
    to change over time if a node is rendered offline due to low battery or a poor
    communication channel. This makes ensuring stable hierarchical FL difficult. Strategies
    to prevent this can be resource-aware real-time decision making where edge devices
    coordinate among themselves to decide how communication should be done among them.
    Software support: Currently, common FL frameworks (e.g., Flower, PySyft) do not
    natively support hierarchical FL, especially for highly dynamic systems where
    infrastructure may change over time. Opportunities and Open Problems The opportunities
    and future research directions for using FL for sensing and measurement can be
    organized into three key axes: resource management and coordination of devices
    that make up the FL system; data management and access; and application-specific
    considerations, such as the use of UAVs [30] and Internet of Medical Things [23].
    In this section, we elaborate on the first two axes, which have general applicability
    across different domains. The third is highly domain-specific and thus not included
    in this general roadmap. Resource Management and Coordination FL opens up new
    methods for supporting fault tolerance of IoT devices. The use of multiple IoT
    devices increases the completeness of data and facilitates the detection and correction
    of erroneous readings and faulty operations. An FL system capable of supporting
    multiple heterogeneous devices and able to recover from faults is reported in
    [31]. A hierarchical FLsystem able to account for the hierarchy of edge servers
    may result in multiple memberships for IoT devices requiring recovery and adaptation
    at several levels. Another exciting direction is the integration of self-adaptivity
    into IoT devices using hierarchical FL. IoT devices become self-adaptive by learning
    from their past behaviors and performance data, can detect changes in environmental
    conditions and predict equipment failure, and automatically adjust device parameters
    [32]. As IoT devices collect knowledge about their environment, they must share
    knowledge to better understand their environment and its dynamics. However, a
    collective system of self-aware devices does not have a centralized knowledge
    base. FL could facilitate sharing of knowledge between devices as a collective.
    Unlike context-aware systems, which typically assume a ground-truth-based environmental
    context that is true for all IoT devices, it is explicitly acknowledged that self-aware
    devices in the collective systems will have different experiences of a shared
    environment [33]. A federated system can be expanded to incorporate information
    for the edge servers at the membership level to provide self-adaptiveness for
    different branches of the edge computing infrastructure and provide context on
    how the information was gathered. Hierarchical FL architectures are inherently
    resilient against network latency and bandwidth limitations. They therefore open
    up new opportunities for network optimization due to the heterogeneity of edge
    environments. For example, network routing needs to be dynamically adapted and
    optimized to the traffic patterns and topologies to improve network throughput
    and latency. Meanwhile, new network designs and paradigms can be introduced, such
    as software-defined networking and blockchain. New algorithms and techniques that
    are specifically designed to optimize resource allocation in edge computing environments
    can dynamically allocate computational and communication resources to different
    tasks based on their priority and application-specific requirements. This allows
    for real-time balancing of multiple objectives. For example, a healthcare application
    that uses a large number of medical sensors to collect, adapt, and react to medical
    information in real time requires security robustness and resource optimization
    for computational and communication tasks [34]. The energy consumption of IoT
    devices and edge computing infrastructure can be optimized by dynamically adapting
    the computational workload and communication overhead to the available energy
    and power constraints. Exploring multi-objective optimization techniques such
    as evolutionary algorithms and Pareto optimization is another direction of research
    that is crucial due to the complexity of hierarchical FL systems. There is a need
    to balance multiple objectives and constraints, such as communication overhead,
    energy consumption, privacy preservation, and security, while creating a global
    machine learning model with limited and heterogeneous resources. This requires
    the coordination of multiple clients and servers at different layers of the system,
    creating a complex interaction network. Additionally, the underlying technologies
    used, such as wireless communication, data storage and processing, and machine
    learning algorithms, introduce their sets of constraints and trade-offs that need
    to be considered in the optimization process, where not only performance but scalability
    needs careful consideration when optimizing these conflicting objectives. Fig.
    7. Future directions for hierarchical federated learning in sensor applications.
    Show All Data Management and Access While FL adds a layer of privacy around user
    data by eliminating the need to share data with others, sharing model updates
    do not offer privacy guarantees as individual data points can be reconstructed
    [35]. To address this issue, privacy-preserving FL can be expanded using techniques
    such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, digital signature, and hash
    functions [23], [36]. These techniques enable FL in edge computing environments
    while preserving the privacy of data and participants. For instance, differential
    privacy provides privacy guarantees for medical image analysis. In unstable edge
    computing environments, such as smart healthcare, a privacy protection scheme
    is proposed that provides gradient privacy and resistance to collusion and replay
    attacks for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) [23]. A privacy protection technique
    for a hierarchical FL system needs to be computationally efficient and adaptable
    to the underlying learning algorithms, with an ability to effectively scale to
    a large number of clients and servers. Fig. 7 summarizes some of the opportunities
    presented by hierarchical FL that make it an exciting area of research for engineers
    and academicians in the field of instrumentation and measurement. Conclusion Electrical
    and Electronics Engineers have a critical role to play in driving technological
    advancements to address global challenges and advance the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations in 2015. Hierarchical federated
    learning is an emerging technology that enhances the intelligence of sensor systems
    in many applications such as environmental quality management, personalized health-care
    devices, and precision agriculture. Secure, resilient, and robust sensor systems
    that support real-time, data-driven decision-making are valuable infrastructure
    for helping us reduce carbon emissions (SDG 13–Climate Action), promote sustainable
    urbanization (SDG 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities), and improve healthcare
    outcomes (SDG 3–Health and Well-being). We urge researchers and practitioners
    to collaborate on the opportunities and open problems presented in this article
    to realize the full potential of this technology. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research

    Biological trait analysis (BTA) is a valuable tool for evaluating changes in community
    diversity and its link to ecosystem processes as well as environmental and anthropogenic

    Open access 13 March 2024 Background & Summary Traditionally, changes in species
    assemblages are examined to understand the response of communities to underlying
    environmental conditions1. However, biogeographical variation in species distributions
    causes regional variation in the species pool. Effects on species communities
    caused by environmental shifts can then be obscured when studying systems over
    large geographical gradients as the spatial shifts in species assemblages can
    form a major confounding factor2. These complications can be overcome by adopting
    functional traits in addition to the traditional species-based approach2,3,4.
    The functional trait approach is centred around the environmental filtering and
    habitat templet concepts2,5,6. Environmental conditions select for species with
    certain characteristics, creating species assemblages with similar functional
    traits6,7. Across large spatial scales, similar abiotic conditions can host diverse
    species communities which are still functionally similar. Thus, functional traits
    can help to understand why different taxonomic entities group together in specific
    habitats, whereas it is more complex to understand the ecological mechanism behind
    the relationship between species distributions and habitat characteristics purely
    based on taxonomy alone8,9,10. As such, a functional trait approach allows for
    the generalisation of community responses to the environment which makes it an
    ideal analytical approach in studies on ecosystem functioning as well as large
    scale human impact studies. Functional traits revolve around phenotypic characteristics
    of species that determine both their response to environmental stressors11 and
    their effects on ecological processes12. These functional traits synergistically
    determine a species’ fitness by affecting growth, survival, and reproduction13.
    Only species with a set type of traits can be successful under certain environmental
    conditions following the habitat templet concept14,15. With this knowledge, a
    functional trait approach can identify communities exposed to, and/or sensitive
    to, disturbances16. Additionally, the type of traits chosen to include in the
    analysis determines the functional aspects of the environment that can be evaluated.
    Changes in the occurrence of these traits can then be translated into changes
    or loss of ecosystem services2,17. For example, the potential for carbon sequestration
    in marine soft sediment systems is dependent on bioturbation activity of macrobenthic
    species which together with body size and mobility determines aeration of the
    soil among many other factors2. Multi-trait-based approaches then allow for more
    holistic assessments of ecosystem functioning. The assessment of ecosystem functioning
    rapidly improves in quality with the inclusion of more traits3. However, compiling
    information of many traits for numerous species is time consuming, especially
    when the aim is to assess species communities over large geographical extents
    where species numbers can quickly accumulate. Information on traits is lacking
    for many species or only accessible through grey literature often in languages
    other than English. Explicit selection of traits that are expected to be relevant
    to specific research questions, e.g. bioturbation, body size, and living depth
    for nutrient cycling18, may reduce the time required to compile comprehensive
    trait datasets. On the other hand, open access availability of already compiled
    datasets would accelerate the application of trait approaches to current questions19.
    The access to such datasets can then more rapidly give insights in the change
    of ecosystem functioning, especially in the face of biodiversity loss19. In addition,
    such datasets can continuously be expanded with new trait categories depending
    on the questions that need to be answered, as well as new species to expand the
    geographical boundaries for which the analysis can be performed. The availability
    of dynamic open access trait datasets can therefore facilitate the generalisation
    of species and community responses to changing conditions and anthropogenic influences20.
    The south-eastern range of the North Sea from the Netherlands to Denmark is characterised
    by a system of barrier islands that define a large intertidal soft-bottom ecosystem
    called the Wadden Sea. The macrozoobenthic community in the Wadden Sea is a pivotal
    part of many ecosystem functions and services21,22. For example, macrozoobenthos
    is involved in many biogeochemical pathways and nutrient fluxes23, but also provides
    important feeding grounds for commercially important fish species24. Thus, changes
    in macrozoobenthic communities due to environmental changes has implications for
    ecosystem functioning, which can also affect higher trophic levels such as predatory
    fish and bird species. The Wadden Sea is a key area for millions of migratory
    waders as well as an important area for many migratory fish species, that both
    depend on the productive macrobenthic communities as an important food source25,26,27.
    This emphasises the need to understand community dynamics and functioning of the
    macrozoobenthic community in this system. While several datasets on macrozoobenthic
    traits are available28,29,30, a comprehensive dataset on functional traits for
    the macrozoobenthic species found in the Dutch Wadden Sea is not available despite
    the large monitoring programmes focusing on the macrozoobenthic communities in
    the Dutch Wadden Sea30,31,32. The beginning of such a trait dataset was compiled
    by Gusmao et al.16, including many of the intertidal species found in the Dutch
    Wadden Sea30,31,32. This dataset contains mostly functional trait categories related
    to the resistance of species to perturbations, such as living depth and body size8,29,33.
    However, traits related to recovery, such as reproductive frequency and mobility,
    are equally important to understand the recovery of communities after a disturbance
    as well as the (re)colonisation potential of many species29. Therefore, we here
    present an expanded dataset adapted from Gusmao et al.16, containing 235 taxonomic
    units found in multiple sampling campaigns over the entire Dutch Wadden Sea30,31,32.
    This new comprehensive dataset complements the intertidal species list and also
    includes sublittoral species. In addition, it provides 10 new functional traits
    regarding the response of macrozoobenthic communities to disturbances taking into
    account both resistance and recovery related functional traits8,29,33. Of the
    235 taxa occurring in this dataset, only 33 taxa (14%) overlap with the dataset
    of Clare et al.28, and 94 taxa (40%) occur in the dataset of Beauchard et al.29
    that is included in the “Btrait” R package34. Of all our included taxa, the Marine
    Species Traits portal35 only contains information on body size for 185 (79%) taxa,
    on feeding mode for 31 (31%) taxa, and on larval development location for 2 (1%)
    taxa. It also adds six traits not included in the dataset of Clare et al.28, and
    six traits not included in the dataset of Beauchard et al.29,34. Given that many
    species included in this dataset are also present in adjacent areas such as the
    North Sea, it is applicable to a wider range of study systems. Applicability of
    this dataset is further greatly enhanced by publishing it in a dynamic form that
    can be periodically updated to include new species and trait categories. This
    is essential to ensure its long-term applicability as new information on biological
    traits and ecological functioning can be added as they are published as well as
    expand to other areas. Having such a comprehensive trait dataset readily available
    will reduce the time lag between data-collection and trait-based analyses to study
    impacts of environmental changes and human impacts. Ultimately, this can facilitate
    the translation of these findings into management actions. Methods Study area
    The Wadden Sea (Fig. 1) is one of the largest and most important intertidal ecosystems
    worldwide36,37. Its unique geomorphological and ecological processes as well as
    its characteristic biodiversity and sheer abundance of protected species has led
    to the designation as UNESCO World Heritage site for the Dutch and German areas
    of the Wadden Sea in 200938 and the Danish area in 2014. Large parts of its ecological
    functioning is determined by macrozoobenthic communities39. Likewise, these macrozoobenthic
    communities are of key importance for higher trophic levels38. Fig. 1 Map of study
    area. (a) Map showing north-west Europe, highlighting the Dutch Wadden Sea in
    red; (b) closeup of the Dutch Wadden Sea with underlying bathymetric map and tidal
    basins indicated by black lines. Full size image Dataset The trait dataset was
    constructed containing 16 life history traits (Table 1), adapted from Gusmao et
    al.16, and extended for all taxa found within a large subtidal sampling campaign
    in 201932. The initial dataset contained information on 71 taxonomic units for
    bioturbation, living depth, adult body size, feeding mode, longevity, and adult
    movement. The current dataset has been extended to include 235 taxonomic units,
    of which 187 on species level, and 10 new trait categories: age of sexual maturation,
    reproductive frequency, fecundity, living habitat, reproductive mode, larval development
    location, skeleton, reproductive season, offspring size, and offspring type. Each
    trait is divided into several modalities that reflect the range of possible attributes
    a taxa can display. Information for each taxonomic unit was collected from research
    articles23,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326,327,328,329,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,337,338,339,340,341,342,343,344,345,346,347,348,349,350,351,352,353,354,355,356,357,358,359,360,361,362,363,364,365,366,367,368,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,376,377,378,379,380,381,382,383,384,385,386,387,388,389,390,391,392,393,394,395,396,397,398,399,400,401,402,403,404,405,406,407,408,409,410,411,412,413,414,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,422,423,424,425,426,427,428,429,430,431,432,433,434,435,436,437,438,439,440,441,442,443,444,445,446,447,448,449,450,451,452,453,454,455,456,457,458,459,460,461,462,463,464,465,466,467,468,469,470,471,472,473,474,475,476,477,478,479,480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488,489,490,491,492,493,494,495,496,497,498,499,500,501,502,503,504,505,506,507,508,509,510,511,512,513,514,515,516,517,518,519,520,521,522,523,524,525,526,527,

    and existing datasets and species reviews29,598,599,600,601,602,603,604,605,606,607,608,609,610,611,612,613,614,615,616,617,618,619,620,621,622,623,624,625,626,627,628,629,630,631,632,633,634,635,636,637,638,639,640,641,642,643,644,645,646,647,648,649,650,651,652,653,654,655,656,657,658,659,660,661,662,663,664,665,666,667,668,669,670,671,672,673,674,675,676,677,678,679,680,681,682,683,684,685,686,687,688,689,690,691,692,693,694,695,696,697,698,699,700,701,702,703,704,705,706
    to compile a holistic trait dataset for macrozoobenthic taxa occurring in the
    Dutch Wadden Sea. Primary literature was given preference when available, and
    expert judgement was only used when no literature could be found. Taxa were scored
    for each modality using fuzzy coding707 with a score ranging from 0 to 3. Here,
    a score of 0 means no affinity with the scored modality, and 3 indicates absolute
    affinity with the modality. Hence, when given a score of 3 for a certain modality,
    the species in question has no known affinity for any of the other modalities
    within that category. Taxa expressing affinity for multiple modalities can be
    incorporated by scoring the modality with a 2 or a 1. Multiple scores of 2 would
    indicate equal affinity for multiple modalities whereas a 1 is a weaker affinity
    for a certain modality than for others. Fuzzy coding allows for the incorporation
    of interspecific variation in trait expression2 as well as uncertainty in trait
    expression708. In addition, fuzzy coding facilitates a common coding method for
    both binary classified traits (e.g. bioturbation types) and continuous classifications
    (e.g. life span)709. The 0–3 coding scheme used here is most commonly used across
    other studies3,709,710,711 and advocated as a standard coding scheme by Degen
    et al.709 In case no information on a trait was available for a certain taxa all
    modalities are scored as a 0. Ultimately, the species-trait combination for which
    no data was available is effectively not included in the analysis. The fuzzy scores
    can then be standardized to a score between 0–1 using a min-max normalization
    to assign individual weights to modalities within all traits and keeping the overall
    weight of all traits equal regardless of the number of modalities707,708. The
    predictive power of the trait dataset only increases with the inclusion of new
    information on species life history and functional traits. Table 1 Overview of
    missing data per class. Full size table The trait dataset was compiled by several
    contributors. To assure validity of the dataset, the entire dataset was thoroughly
    checked by two of the co-authors. Irregularities and debatable scores were then
    checked and discussed with specialists. A dynamic dataset was created in R-Studio,
    R-version 4.2.2712. using the ‘shiny’713, ‘shinydashboard’714, and ‘DT’715 packages.
    Definition of traits In the following section we provide a description and the
    rationale behind each functional trait category. For an overview of each category
    and a description of each of its modalities see Supplementary Table 1. Bioturbation
    mode Bioturbation is the reworking of soil and sediment through animal and plant
    activity716,717,718,719. Bioturbating activity has an important effect on many
    ecosystem functions, such as sediment stabilisation, nutrient cycling, and carbon
    sequestration2,39,720. Modalities within bioturbation have been adapted from Gusmao
    et al.16, and include epifauna, surficial modifier, upward conveyor, downward
    conveyor, biodiffuser, and regenerator (Supplementary Table 1). Adult living depth
    (cm) The living depth indicates the depth range within the sediment that different
    macrozoobenthic taxa reside in. Species with deeper depth ranges have a greater
    chance of survival as they are less vulnerable to bottom disturbances29. Additionally,
    bioturbation mode and living depth interact to determine the depth penetration
    of oxygenated water and thus have different effects on nutrient cycling18. Modalities
    within living depth have been adapted from Gusmao et al.16, and include surface,
    >0 and ≤3 cm, >3 and ≤8 cm, >8 and ≤15 cm, >15 and ≤25 cm, and >25 cm (Supplementary
    Table 1). Adult body size (mm) Body size correlates with many functional factors
    among which are food web structure, trophic level, and energy transfer721,722.
    In addition, adult body size is an indicator for the susceptibility of mechanical
    or physical disturbances. Smaller sized individuals can more easily escape bottom
    impact29,723 and larger sized species are generally more heavily impacted by bottom
    disturbance due to a higher mortality rate but also a slower recovery rate723.
    Modalities within body size have been adapted from Gusmao et al.16, and include
    ≤5 mm, >5 and ≤10 mm, >10 and ≤20 mm, >20 and ≤40 mm, >40 and ≤80 mm, >80 and
    ≤160 mm, and >160 mm (Supplementary Table 1) Feeding mode Feeding mode is an important
    indicator of the functional role of species within the food web as well as the
    trophic level of a species within the food web (e.g. detritivore, herbivore or
    predator)721. Modalities within feeding mode have been adapted from Gusmao et
    al.16, and include deposit-feeder, suspension-feeder, grazer, opportunist or scavenger,
    and predator (Supplementary Table 1). Longevity (y) Longevity is a good indicator
    of population stability over time but also the dispersal potential in combination
    with mobility as longer living species simply have more time to colonise new areas721.
    In addition, longevity is generally considered a good proxy for life-history strategy
    as longer living species are usually associated with long generation times and
    thus highly sensitive to disturbance724. Modalities within longevity have been
    adapted from Gusmao et al.16, and include the categories: ≤1 year, >1 and ≤3 years,
    >3 and ≤6 years, >6 and ≤10 years, and >10 years (Supplementary Table 1) Age of
    sexual maturation (y) The age of sexual maturation determines the generation time
    of a population and has implications for the recovery of populations after a disturbance721.
    Modalities within this functional trait have been categorised into ≤1 year, >1
    and ≤2 years, >2 and ≤5 years, >5 and ≤10 years, and >10 years (Supplementary
    Table 1) Reproductive frequency The frequency with which species reproduce in
    combination with the abundance of species is important in determining the speed
    with which a population can recover after a disturbance721. Reproductive frequency
    has been categorised into continuous / ≥ 2x per year, annual 1x,biennial, and
    semelparous (Supplementary Table 1). Fecundity The fecundity of taxa in combination
    with reproductive mode affect the recoverability of taxa after a disturbance.
    Higher fecundity implies higher probability of young individuals with each reproductive
    event, decreasing the time it takes to restore the population to a pre-disturbed
    state721. Here, fecundity is defined as the reproductive output per reproductive
    event in the unit of the type of offspring released. Modalities within fecundity
    have been categorised into ≥1 and ≤50, >50 and ≤500, >500 and ≤2.500, >2.500 and
    ≤10.000, >10.000 and ≤20.000, >20.000 and ≤100.000, and >100.000 offspring (Supplementary
    Table 1) Adult locomotion The locomotion of macrozoobenthic organisms is an indicator
    for the recolonisation potential of taxa after a disturbance29. Modalities within
    adult locomotion have been adapted from Gusmao et al.16, and include the categories:
    Sessile, swim/float, crawl/walk, and burrow/tube (Supplementary Table 1). Adult
    living habitat The living habitat of species is an indicator for the susceptibility
    of species to disturbances and their dependencies on other species. Species that
    are attached or live on other species are often more vulnerable to disturbances
    due to their protruding nature725. Free-living species are more easily able to
    escape disturbance or recolonise after disturbances. Tube living species have
    an extra layer of protection through the formation of external structures726.
    The modalities within living habitats are therefore categorised as tube, burrow,
    free-living, crevice, epi/endo-zoic/phytic, and attached (Supplementary Table
    1). Reproductive mode The mode of reproduction is an indicator for the recovery
    of populations after disturbance as well as the vulnerability of larva, eggs,
    or juveniles after release. Parental care through brooding generally increases
    the survival rate of new individuals whereas broadcasted eggs are generally more
    vulnerable727,728,729. On the other hand, egg sacs that are deposited on the sediment
    or attached to structures might be vulnerable to physical disturbances or predation730.
    Modalities within reproductive mode have been categorised as asexual, broadcast,
    brooder, and benthic (Supplementary Table 1). Larval development location Different
    larval development locations have different implications for the recolonisation
    capabilities of species. Planktonic stages can disperse over larger geographical
    ranges than larvae that directly develop within the sediment721. The modalities
    within this functional trait are categorised into planktonic, lecithotrophic and
    benthic/direct (Supplementary Table 1). Skeleton The presence and type of skeleton
    can have direct implications for the intensity of direct impact on species as
    it determines the fragility of species to physical disturbance29. Additionally,
    species with calcareous skeletons can be affected by ocean acidification721 which
    can have ramifications for resource use and energy transfer and physiological
    costs for these species may increase731,732. Skeleton has been categorised in
    the modalities soft, calcified and chitinous (Supplementary Table 1). Reproductive
    season Reproductive season can determine recovery potential after seasonal disturbances733
    and can have implications for management actions such as temporal closures. Reproductive
    season has been categorised into: Winter, spring, summer, and autumn (Supplementary
    Table 1). Offspring size (µm) Offspring size is an indicator of development speed
    and thus of recovery after disturbances29,727,728. Offspring size has been categorised
    into: ≤100 µm, >100 and ≤500 µm, >500 and ≤1500 µm, and >1500 µm (Supplementary
    Table 1). Offspring type The type of offspring released affects the vulnerability
    of the earliest life stage to environmental and biotic conditions as well as determines
    the development speed of new individuals29. Broadcasted eggs are more susceptible
    to planktotrophy than are individuals immediately released as larvae or juveniles727,728.
    Modalities within offspring type have been categorised into: Juvenile, larva,
    and egg (Supplementary Table 1). Statistical analysis All analyses were conducted
    in R-Studio, R-version 4.2.2712. First, the trait space for all taxa occurring
    in the dataset was investigated. Trait modality scores were standardised to a
    value between 0 and 1 where the row sum for each trait equals 1 for every taxa
    using the ‘ade4’ package734. We then evaluated the missingness of data per taxonomic
    class. The combination of different trait modalities and the trait space was then
    investigated to identify any impossible combinations. The number of occurrences
    of each possible combination was first summed. The relative occurrence of each
    trait modality combination was then determined by dividing the number of occurrences
    by the number of taxa included in the dataset. Data Records A static version of
    the dataset as used in the preparation of this paper can be found in the dataverseNL
    (DANS) repository through https://doi.org/10.34894/Z43J6I735. In addition, a dynamic
    version is hosted at the University of Groningen and can be accessed via marinetraits.web.rug.nl.
    Here, periodic updates will be uploaded as new traits and/or species are added,
    and older versions can be retrieved for reproducibility. The dataset can be easily
    downloaded from here as either a csv or excel file. The dataset consists out of
    three data sheets: Metadata, Traits, and References Metadata The metadata sheet
    contains information on the version of the dataset as well as a descriptor of
    all included trait categories as well as modalities (Supplementary Table 1). Traits
    The Traits data sheet contains all trait information on the different taxonomic
    groups. The first two columns give the latest scientific name (reference date:
    April 28th 2023), as well as the AphiaID of the taxa which can be linked back
    to the WoRMS database736 for the latest taxonomic information. Each subsequent
    column is a modality belonging to a functional trait (Supplementary Table 1).
    The modalities have values ranging between 0 and 3 based on fuzzy coding707 and
    the reference column contains numbers linking to the References sheet and is used
    to refer to literature or other existing datasets used to construct the scores.
    References The References data sheet contains three columns. The first column
    is the reference id which is the unique numeric identifier used in the Reference
    column of the Traits data sheet. The second column is the reference itself as
    well as certain choices made when compiling the dataset. For example, in some
    cases, information on species level was missing in which case genus level information
    was used, this is then indicated through a reference id. Reference id’s for these
    choices are indicated by letters, whereas other references are numbered. Letters
    referring to choices based on similar species are always followed by reference
    id’s relating to the literature on which decisions were made. For higher level
    taxonomic units, scores were based on species in the dataset belonging to that
    group and indicated with the letter “p”. Finally, the last column contains any
    permanent identifiers related to the reference. Technical Validation In total,
    there were 143 (4%) cases for which information on traits could not be compiled
    out of 3760 species-trait combinations. This was most often the case for reproductive
    frequency with 33 cases of missing information (Table 1). Reproductive season
    had 28 cases of missing information, fecundity had 23 cases of missing information,
    longevity had 17 cases of missing information, age of sexual maturation had 14
    cases of missing information, adult living depth and offspring size had 12 cases
    of missing information, and adult body size, adult living habitat, adult locomotion,
    and feeding mode had 1 case of missing information (Table 1). Bioturbation type,
    larval development location, offspring type, reproductive mode, and skeleton had
    no cases of missing information (Table 1). Relatively, the Gymnolaemata had the
    most cases of missing data, followed by Clitellata (Table 1). These classes are
    also indicated by Tyler et al.737 as two of the classes with the largest lack
    of knowledge on functional traits. Most taxa included in the dataset were included
    within the Polychaeta, Malacostraca, and Bivalvia (Table 1) which absolutely had
    the highest numbers of missing data (Table 1) but in relative terms only little
    (3%, 3%, and 2% respectively). Out of the 2849 possible modality pairings, 2757
    occur in the dataset (Fig. 2). The bioturbation type regenerator, and biennial
    reproductive frequency were found in the least number of pairings (49 and 46 out
    of 75 possible pairings respectively) (Fig. 2). Tube living taxa were never associated
    with high longevity or late sexual maturation (Fig. 2). Predators, chitinous,
    and epi/endo-zoic/phytic taxa never paired with either upward- or downward conveying
    bioturbation (Fig. 2). The highest number of occurrences was found for the pairing
    summer and spring seasonal reproduction (131 out of 235 taxa), followed by swim/float
    motility and burrowing living habitat (123 out of 235 taxa), and swim float motility
    and spring seasonal reproduction (114 out of 235 taxa) (Fig. 2). 129 out of 2849
    possible modality pairings occurred only in one taxa in the dataset, 176 out 2849
    possible pairings only occurred in 2 taxa, and 113 pairings in only 3 taxa. Several
    impossible combinations of modalities can be found in the dataset. For example,
    the few occurring combinations of longevity modalities that are lower than the
    sexual maturation (Fig. 2). This can be attributed to the high intraspecific variability
    within higher order taxa (e.g. Bivalvia). Fig. 2 Overview matrix of the trait
    space. The matrix indicates the presence (green) of combinations between modalities
    within taxa contained in the dataset. The colour and size represent the relative
    occurrence of each trait combination within the dataset, with 1 relating to the
    trait combination present in all taxa included in the dataset. A white square
    indicates that the specific combination of modalities was not found among the
    taxa in the dataset. Full size image Usage Notes To build onto this dataset, it
    is possible for updated versions to be published through the dynamic version of
    the dataset marinetraits.web.rug.nl. New information, new trait groups or new
    species can be added to the dataset by sending this information including references
    to the corresponding author. New information will then be included in the next
    periodic update of the dataset. Information on the dynamic version of the dataset
    is liable to change, though older versions of the dataset will remain available
    through the platform. Note that the data descriptor was peer reviewed in 2023
    based on the data available on the platform at the time. This data can be found
    on the static repository735. Trait based measures can be sensitive to the amount
    of missing data738. Recent advances have been made in methods to impute missing
    trait information combining phylogenetic information and structural equation modelling739.
    Other imputation methods have been used to fill out missing trait data and can
    be employed to completely fill out a dataset. Still, each method comes with its
    own biases and is dependent on the predictive power of the available data and
    do not always perform better than datasets with missing information740. Therefore,
    no imputation methods have been applied here to fill out missing data and leave
    this to the user to make sound decisions in the methods employed. For an overview
    of imputation methods and their performance in imputing missing trait data see740.
    For review of statistical methods using multiple functional traits see8 and741.
    Utilizing this dataset in combination with other published functional trait datasets28,34,35
    will greatly enhance the taxonomy covered, expanding the use of functional trait
    analyses to other regions. Many sources have been used in the compilation of this
    dataset, including secondary literature and compiled trait datasets or reviews.
    Interpretation of trait data may differ on dataset level depending on literature
    included and the region and can cause variation among datasets. Likewise, some
    trait information is only available through secondary literature and might not
    always be quality controlled. Nevertheless, when no primary literature is available,
    including secondary literature as source of information is preferably better than
    recording no data for a certain trait. Users are therefore encouraged to check
    the used literature for applicability of their own analysis and include individual
    references to acknowledge the original data. Code availability Code used to produce
    the graphs is available in the dataverseNL (DANS) repository alongside the static
    version of the dataset through https://doi.org/10.34894/Z43J6I. Figures and analysis
    were done using Rstudio version 2023.03.0742 and R version 4.2.2712. References

    • Woody encroachment in prairies reduces streamflow despite wetter climate. •
    Woody encroachment deepens water flow paths. • Woody encroachment increases groundwater
    flow fraction even as total flow declines. Abstract Grasslands, covering 40% of
    ice-free Earth surface, are experiencing woody encroachment globally. The hydrological
    impacts of woody encroachment are highly uncertain because they are compounded
    by the concurrent influence of climate change. Here we ask the questions 1) How
    water balance (evapotranspiration versus streamflow) and streamflow partitioning
    (into surface runoff and subsurface flows) evolve over time in woody-encroached
    grasslands? 2) What is the relative influence of climate change and woody encroachment?
    We used the hydrology model HBV-light and decades of hydrometeorological and streamflow
    data from two intermittent streams draining catchments with different degrees
    of woody encroachment at the Konza Prairie, Kansas, US. Results indicate that
    both streams have become drier and have experienced more hydrological droughts
    over time, more so in the substantially encroached site, with increasing evapotranspiration
    despite a wetter climate. In contrast, a modelled hypothetical “Climate Only”
    scenario without woody encroachment suggests streamflow would have increased under
    climate change alone. Moreover, results suggest that flow paths have deepened
    with increasing fractions of deeper groundwater flow in the substantially encroached
    site. These findings raise questions about mechanisms of these changes and commonality
    of drier streams in a wetter climate in woody-encroached areas and beyond. Answers
    to these questions can have far-reaching implications for the occurrence of droughts,

    streamsEcohydrologyWoody encroachmentGroundwater 1. Introduction Grasslands cover
    30 % of the Earth''s surface (40 % of ice-free land) and are responsible for ∼
    20 % of global runoff (Dodds, 1997). The hydrology of grasslands is heavily influenced
    by vegetation cover and climate. Woody encroachment, or the expansion of woody
    cover, is taking place in grasslands worldwide (Ratajczak et al., 2012, Stevens
    et al., 2017, Van Auken, 2009). North American grasslands, for example, are experiencing
    an annual increase in woody cover ranging from 0.1 % to 2.3 %, with the highest
    rates in the Central Great Plains (Barger et al., 2011). At the same time, temperatures
    and precipitation patterns in these grasslands have also been changing in a warming
    climate. The extent to which woody encroachment versus climate change is affecting
    water balance and flow paths in these grasslands however is highly uncertain.
    Different vegetation species vary in their water uptake strategies and rooting
    characteristics (Jackson et al., 1996, Vico et al., 2015), and therefore can alter
    water balance (evapotranspiration and streamflow) and flow paths differently.
    Woody species, for instance, tend to use more water than grasses and can access
    deeper water by growing deeper roots (Caterina et al., 2014, Jackson et al., 1996,
    Nippert and Knapp, 2007). Roots create 70 % of macropores (0.3 mm or greater in
    diameter) that are responsible for substantial soil water flow (Beven and Germann,
    2013, Wilson and Luxmoore, 1988). Most lateral flow from soil occurs at the depth
    of greatest root channel abundance (Whipkey, 1965). Grasses with more lateral
    roots in shallow soils than woody species can promote more shallow lateral flow
    (Jackson et al., 1996, Nippert et al., 2012). In contrast, deeper and coarser
    woody roots can create continuous macropore networks that extend deeper (Gaiser,
    1952, Hu et al., 2020, Li et al., 2013), possibly penetrating bedrock (Ghestem
    et al., 2011, Roering et al., 2010), thereby enhancing recharge (Wilcox and Huang,
    2010) and contributing to deeper lateral groundwater flow (Laine-Kaulio et al.,
    2015). At the catchment scale, woody encroachment has been observed to either
    increase or decrease streamflow (Hao et al., 2019, Kishawi et al., 2023, Schreiner-McGraw
    et al., 2020, Wilcox and Huang, 2010, Wine and Zou, 2012). These different responses
    possibly depend on the spatial arrangement of vegetation patches and bare soil
    patches above ground and the characteristics of subsurface flow paths (Huxman
    et al., 2005, Wilcox et al., 2022). In semi-arid or arid areas such as the Sonoran
    Desert, increased woody cover along with the development of bare soil patches
    (xerification) have been observed to reduce soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity,
    reduce streamflow during small rainfall events but increase streamflow during
    large events (Pierini et al., 2014). In the Great Plains, eastern redcedar (Juniperus
    virginiana) encroachment has been associated with elevated evapotranspiration
    and reduced streamflow from catchment to basin scales (Kishawi et al., 2022, Qiao
    et al., 2015, Starks and Moriasi, 2017). In addition, woody encroachment has been
    found to change streamflow generation mechanisms. Woody encroachment can change
    main overland flow generation mechanism from saturation excess to infiltration
    excess, thereby decreasing overland flow except during intense storms (Qiao et
    al., 2017). In South Concho catchments in Texas, base flow was observed to increase
    with woody encroachment, indicating enhanced groundwater recharge despite decreasing
    streamflow (Wilcox et al., 2008a). Concurrent to woody encroachment, a changing
    climate presents another disturbance that can alter hydrology. Increasing precipitation
    has elevated streamflow in the Missouri river basin (Ahiablame et al., 2017),
    Midwest, and high plains of the USA (Xu et al., 2013). Higher evapotranspiration
    due to warmer climate can reduce streamflow especially in summer (Das et al.,
    2011), exacerbate the severity of hydrological droughts (Overpeck and Udall, 2020),
    reduce groundwater recharge (Ayers et al., 2022, Meixner et al., 2016) and possibly
    decouple groundwater-surface water interactions. Climate change can additionally
    affect the relative importance of water flow paths contributing to streamflow
    (Niraula et al., 2017, Nyenje and Batelaan, 2009). For instance, overland flow
    has been projected to increase under more frequent extreme rainfall events expected
    in the future (Choi, 2008, Napoli et al., 2017, Price, 2011). Drier climate can
    promote macropore formation, magnifying saturated soil hydraulic conductivity
    (Hirmas et al., 2018) and promoting deeper flow paths (Sullivan et al., 2022).
    Most grasslands experience the convoluted impacts of woody encroachment and climate
    change, challenging the differentiation of their relative influence on hydrology.
    In an Oklahoma grassland, for example, woody encroachment in riparian area together
    with increasing precipitation challenge the detection of the cause of streamflow
    trend even with a 50-year long record (Wine and Zou, 2012). Vegetation-climate
    feedbacks further complicate our ability to disentangle the relative effects of
    land cover and climate change, as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)
    and temperatures can reduce plant transpiration, thereby increasing streamflow
    despite woody encroachment (Kishawi et al., 2022, Novick et al., 2016). Here we
    ask the questions: How water balance (evapotranspiration versus streamflow) and
    streamflow partitioning (into surface runoff, shallow soil water flow, and deeper
    groundwater flow) evolve in woody-encroached grasslands? and what is the relative
    influence of climate change and woody encroachment on streamflow generation? We
    hypothesize that 1) woody encroachment outweighs climate change in influencing
    catchment hydrology by reducing streamflow and increasing evapotranspiration;
    2) woody encroachment promotes deeper groundwater flow. We test these hypotheses
    using 35 years of hydrometeorology and streamflow data from two intermittent,
    woody-encroached streams (N01B and N04D) in a mesic tallgrass prairie in Konza
    Prairie Biological Station (KPBS, 35 km2, hereafter Konza Prairie), a Long-Term
    Ecological Research (LTER) site in Kansas, USA. We also leverage a data-informed
    hydrology model that can be run under various scenarios to differentiate the impacts
    of climate change versus woody encroachment. These streams have been subject to
    both woody encroachment and a changing climate in the Central Great Plains. Total
    annual precipitation in this area has been projected to have no change or slight
    increases but precipitation is expected to become more variable with larger rain
    events shifting toward winter and / or spring (IPCC, Arias, P., Bellouin, N.,
    Coppola, E., Jones, R., Krinner, G., Marotzke, J., Naik, V., Palmer, M., Plattner,
    G.-K., Rogelj, J., 2021, USGCRP, Reidmiller, D., Avery, C.W., Easterling, D.R.,
    Kunkel, K.E., Lewis, K., Maycock, T.K., Stewart, B.C., 2018). Intermittent streams
    are vulnerable but important ecosystems, and are highly sensitive to environmental
    disturbances (Jaeger et al., 2014). They are estimated to comprise more than 50
    % of global stream length (Datry et al., 2014, Shanafield et al., 2021), and have
    exhibited longer no-flow periods since 1980 (Zipper et al., 2021). 2. Methods
    2.1. Study site Konza Prairie, located in the Flint Hills region of Kansas (39°05′N,
    96°35′W), has a midwestern continental climate with warm, wet summers and cold,
    dry winters (Fig. 1). The mean annual precipitation is 811 mm (1983–2020), and
    the mean annual temperature is 11.7 °C (1983–2020). The precipitation is highly
    variable, with 75 % occurring during the growing season from April to October
    (Hayden, 1998). Konza Prairie is situated on a highly complex mero-karst bedrock
    with repeating layers of limestone (1–2 m) and mudstone (2–4 m) (Macpherson, 1996),
    highly heterogeneous as indicated by geophysical investigations (Sullivan et al.,
    2020). The soil is silty clay loam with traces of calcite. The soil is thin and
    rocky in uplands but can be as thick as 1–2 m near streams (Ransom et al., 1998).
    Tracer tests have indicated that Konza Prairie has deep groundwater flow and inter-basin
    flow, but their magnitudes have not been quantified (Barry, 2018). Download :

    n01b and n04d in Konza Prairie; b) Evolving woody cover percentages in N01B (burned
    annually) and N04D (burned every four years), where woody encroachment was roughly
    20% and 40% of the land cover in 2020, respectively (adapted from Ratajczak et
    al. (2014). Woody cover in N01B did not accelerate until the drought of 2012.
    The dotted lines show periods representing different stages of woody encroachment:
    1985 – 1994, 1995 – 2004, and 2005 – 2020, which we modelled separately to accommodate
    evolving catchment characteristics. The vegetation is primarily warm-season grasses,
    including big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium),
    Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). The riparian
    corridor has woody species such as American elm (Ulmus americana), honey locust
    (Gleditsia triacanthos), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), chinquapin oak (Quercus
    muehlenbergii), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) and redbud (Cercis canadensis)
    (Keen et al., 2022, Reisinger et al., 2013). The native woody vegetation historically
    confined to riparian corridors have been expanding in Konza Prairie. Clonal shrub
    species, including roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii), smooth sumac (Rhus glabra),
    and American plum (Prunus americana), occurring in riparian zone as well as interspersed
    across the grassland as shrub islands, have also been spreading rapidly. Since
    1977, Konza Prairie has been divided into sub-catchments and subjected to different
    management regimes in terms of fire frequency, fire season, and grazing. Konza
    Prairie has been experiencing woody encroachment, especially in sub-catchments
    with infrequent fires (Briggs et al., 2005, Ratajczak et al., 2014, Veach et al.,
    2014). The shrub cover has increased by up to 60 % in sub-catchments with 4-year
    and 20-year fire intervals (Ratajczak et al., 2014). While riparian zones are
    more resistant to fires than upland due to their wetter condition, an aerial study
    still showed that catchments with more frequent fires have experienced less riparian
    woody expansion. For example, percent woody cover in riparian zone (30 m around
    streams) increased from 40 % in 1985 to 57 % in 2010 in a catchment burnt annually
    but from 52 % to 90 % in a catchment burnt once every 20 years (Veach et al.,
    2014). While frequent fires control expansion of both upland and riparian woody
    cover, even annual burning does not stop or reverse woody encroachment (Heisler
    et al., 2003, Veach et al., 2014). This study focuses on two adjoining headwater
    sub-catchments, N01B (1-year burn frequency) and N04D (4-year burn frequency),
    with an area of 120.9 ha and 135.7 ha respectively. Stream gauges established
    on headwater streams in N01B and N04D drain 120.9 ha and 120.4 ha respectively.
    These streams flow into Kings Creek. As of 2020, N01B and N04D had approximately
    20 % and 40 % woody species cover respectively. These estimates may slightly underestimate
    the actual extent of woody encroachment, as the experimental plots monitored for
    woody cover lie only on uplands and lowlands but not in riparian zones (Keen et
    al., 2022). Aerial photographs however did show woody expansion in riparian zones
    (Dodds et al., 2023, Veach et al., 2014). We call these two catchments mildly
    and substantially encroached as they represent 1/3 and 2/3 of the maximum degree
    of encroachment observed at the Konza Prairie thus far. Catchment with 20-year
    burn frequency was not selected as it flows rarely and has a median of 15 flow
    days per year (calculated over 1987–2020). N01B and N04D are situated within similar
    limestone and shale units and have similar soil thickness. Subsurface geophysical
    investigations in N04D have revealed high vertical connectivity between limestone
    layers and locally permeable shale units (Sullivan et al., 2020). The catchments
    have never been cultivated but have been grazed by native American bison (Bison
    bison) since 1992. 2.2. Data Daily meteorological data are available from April
    1982 to December 2020, which include daily precipitation and air temperature (daily
    mean, maximum and minimum) from the weather station at the Konza Prairie headquarters
    (Nippert, 2021). This open access data is available at Konza LTER website (http://lter.konza.ksu.edu).
    In cases where daily data was missing, climate data from the Automated Surface
    Observing System network at the nearby Manhattan Regional Airport was used to
    fill the data gap (https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu). Potential evapotranspiration
    was calculated using the Hargreaves and Samani equation as implemented in the
    “Evapotranspiration” R package (Guo et al., 2016, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985).
    Stream levels have been measured at the triangular throated flumes located at
    the outlets of the N01B and N04D from 1987 and 1985 onwards respectively (Dodds,
    2021a, Dodds, 2021b). Daily streamflow, calculated using stream water level and
    rating curves, were downloaded from the Konza LTER website. 2.3. Model The extensively-used
    model HBV-light (Hydrologiska Bryåns Vattenbalansavdelning) was utilized to simulate
    the hydrological processes at N01B and N04D (Bergstrom, 1992, Seibert and Vis,
    2012). The model has been used to study land use and land cover changes including
    woodland to grassland conversion (Niemeyer et al., 2017), forest clear cutting
    (Seibert and McDonnell, 2010), afforestation (Cabrera-Balarezo et al., 2022),
    forest regeneration (Beck et al., 2013), and conversion of natural landcover to
    cultivated fields (Birhanu et al., 2019). However, the model has not been used
    to study impact of woody encroachment on streamflow previously to our knowledge.
    HBV-light partitions incoming precipitation (snow and rainfall) into evapotranspiration
    and streamflow (Q) based on temperature, precipitation, and vegetation cover.
    Streamflow occurs from two zones: the upper zone and lower zone that conceptually
    represent the shallow soil zone and deeper groundwater zone (Fig. 2). These zones
    are loosely defined and can be differentiated based on water transit times. The
    upper zone or shallow soil zone typically contains highly weathered materials
    rich in organic matter and contributes relatively fast-flowing water with short
    water transit time to stream at high flows (Li et al., 2021). The lower zone often
    represents deeper unweathered bedrock and contributes older water to stream consistently
    throughout a year as baseflow (Sullivan et al., 2016). The model simulates three
    water fluxes that contribute to streamflow Q via three flow paths. The quick flow
    Q0 conceptually represents overland or surface runoff that occurs when the water
    content of the shallow soil zone (upper zone) exceeds a threshold; Q1 represents
    shallow lateral flow from the shallow soil zone (upper zone); and Q2 represents
    deeper groundwater flow from the deeper groundwater zone (lower zone). The water
    flow from the upper to the lower zone represents groundwater recharge (or percolation
    in HBV language). HBV-light does not represent inter-basin water exchanges or
    loss to deeper regional aquifer. The geology of Konza Prairies contains repeating
    layers of shale/mudstone and limestone. Though traditionally considered as primarily
    horizontal flow systems, geophysical investigations showed presence of strong
    vertical connectivity across shale and limestone layers (Sullivan et al., 2020).
    The deep zone therefore can be considered as representing the bedrock (including
    both shale and limestone) units contributing groundwater to stream. Download :

    generation in HBV-light, a widely used hydrological model. The model calculates
    water balance by partitioning precipitation into evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow
    (Q). It includes upper and lower zones (representing shallow soil zone and deeper
    groundwater zone respectively). It simulates three streamflow components, including
    surface runoff QSF, shallow soil water flow QSW, and deeper groundwater flow QGW,
    corresponding to Q0, Q1, and Q2 in in HBV, respectively. All three flow components
    eventually enter the stream. 2.4. Model calibration and validation in three stages
    of woody encroachment The catchment characteristics change as woody encroachment
    progresses. The model was calibrated and validated separately in three periods
    (Fig. 1b) to represent different stages of woody encroachment in early (1985–94),
    transition (1995–04), and recent periods (2005–20). Parameter sets calibrated
    for each of the three periods reflect the average catchment characteristics, for
    example, average rooting depth and vegetation characteristics during that period,
    although it does not simulate these processes explicitly. The model does not explicitly
    differentiate the transpiration rates of woody plants versus grasses either. To
    calibrate the model in each period, we used roughly 80 % of the streamflow data
    in the earlier years in each period, and the remaining 20 % data for validation.
    The parameter ranges used for model calibration are in Table S-1. Monte Carlo
    simulation was carried out with 500,000 cases, among which 25 best-performing
    cases with the highest daily Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Kling Gupta Efficiency
    (KGE) values were selected for each period and catchment combination. These parameter
    sets were then tested for model performance during the validation period. Cases
    with daily NSE and KGE values of over 0.5 for both training and testing period
    data were selected to avoid overfitting. For N01B, few simulation cases met these
    criteria in 1995–04 and 2005–20, so a threshold of 0.45 (instead of 0.5) was used
    for both metrics for those two periods. 2.5. Temporal trend analysis High inter-annual
    variations in meteorological and hydrological variables can mask long-term trends.
    To circumvent this, we used moving average of a 5-year window following the methods
    in Keen et al. (2022). We calculated the 5-year moving average of total streamflow,
    different flow components, and their relative contribution to streamflow for temporal
    trend analysis. The fraction of daily flow component was calculated as the ratio
    of daily flow component to daily streamflow, both in 5-year moving averages. We
    also similarly quantified seasonal flow component fractions (Winter — January-February
    and December, Spring — March-May, Summer — June-August, and Fall — September-November).
    For temporal trend analysis, we used the “modifiedmk” R package (Patakamuri et
    al., 2020) that implements the Mann-Kendall test with trend-free pre-whitening
    (Kendall, 1948, Mann, 1945, Von Storch, 1999). 2.6. Drought analysis The Standardized
    Precipitation Index (SPI), a widely used meteorological drought index, was calculated
    based on precipitation data (Zargar et al., 2011). SPI can be calculated for different
    accumulation periods, ranging from 1 to 48 months, reflecting SPI patterns at
    different time scales. SPI-n represents SPI for “n” months accumulation period.
    To fit SPI-n, the accumulated precipitation series (total precipitation over n
    months) was fit to a statistical probability distribution, which was then transformed
    to a normal distribution with the mean centered at zero. SPI-n for any month is
    the number of standard deviations by which that month''s accumulated precipitation
    differs from the mean accumulated precipitation (McKee et al., 1993). The SPI
    value is 0 for mean accumulated precipitation. Positive SPI values indicate wet
    conditions (i.e., accumulated precipitation higher than mean accumulated precipitation),
    and negative values indicate dry conditions. The Standardized Streamflow Index
    (SSI) was used to quantify hydrological droughts (Nalbantis and Tsakiris, 2009,
    Vicente-Serrano et al., 2012). SSI was calculated in the same way as SPI, except
    using streamflow instead of precipitation. A zero value represents mean streamflow,
    while non-zero values represent the number of standard deviations by which the
    accumulated streamflow in that month differs from the mean. We tried six candidate
    distributions and chose the one that best fit the data based on L-moment ratio
    (Svensson et al., 2017, Vicente-Serrano et al., 2012). Both SPI and SSI were calculated
    using the “SCI” R package at 1-month and 12-month scales or accumulation periods
    (Gudmundsson and Stagge, 2016). 2.7. The hypothetical “Climate Only” scenario
    The historical streamflow data in N01B and N04D reflect the compounded effects
    of climate change and woody encroachment since 1985. The model parameter sets
    that best reproduce streamflow at each of the three stages therefore represent
    catchment properties with different extent of woody cover during the early, transition,
    and recent stages of woody encroachment. To differentiate the impacts of woody
    encroachment and climate change, we additionally simulated a hypothetical case
    using the parameter sets calibrated for 1985–94 when the woody encroachment was
    minimal (<1.5 % woody encroached area, Fig. 1b). Assuming that these parameters
    reflect catchment properties at that time and remain constant, the hypothetical
    climate scenario represents the water balance and flow partitioning that would
    have been observed if these catchments had been subjected to climate change (increasing
    precipitation and temperature) alone. This scenario however does not explicitly
    account for the physiological response of vegetation to increasing atmospheric
    CO2 levels as the model does not simulate plant processes. The average vegetation
    characteristics represented by the parameter sets used for hypothetical scenario
    therefore correspond to plant transpiration rates at lower CO2 levels of 1985–94.
    By comparing the hypothetical case (Climate Only) with the calibrated case under
    the convoluted influence of climate change and woody encroachment (Climate + WE),
    we attempted to differentiate the effect of woody encroachment. 3. Results 3.1.
    Changing climate and streamflow The long-term data (Fig. 3, red dots) in the Konza
    Prairies indicate that the streamflow is intermittent, characterized by long no-flow
    periods interspersed by large precipitation events with substantial interannual
    variability. The modeled line is the arithmetic mean of daily streamflow calculated
    from the 25 best-performing cases. The range of NSE and KGE values are 0.46 –
    0.81, and 0.49 – 0.90, respectively (details in Table S-2). Note that as encroachment
    increases, streamflow decreases and the system becomes drier. The model validation
    performance values are lower in transition and recent time periods compared to
    early period. This echoes literature that low streamflow is challenging to reproduce
    in hydrology models, whether physics-based (Seibert et al., 2018) or machine learning
    (Feng et al., 2020). Comparison between the observed and modelled streamflow shows
    that the model generally captured the temporal dynamics of the streamflow but
    also missed some peaks (Fig. 3a and c). The model output shows low values of streamflow
    at dry times that are below the detection limit (0.07 mm/day) (Fig. 3b and d in
    log scale). The logarithmic figures (Fig. 3b and d) allow viewing of more low
    flow dynamics. Download : Download high-res image (442KB) Download : Download

    line is the arithmetic mean of all 25 cases. The lower limit of streamflow was
    set at 0.07 mm/day, corresponding to the detection limit of streamflow. The streams
    are intermittent and have long periods with no flow (below detection limit). (For
    interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
    referred to the web version of this article.) The temporal dynamics of the observed
    and modeled streamflow in the two catchments are similar (Fig. 4), as they are
    subject to very similar weather and climate. In this karst landscape, the deeper
    groundwater flow Q2 predominates and overlaps with the total streamflow Q most
    of the time. The exception is during very wet periods or during large events such
    as the event in June 2005 with the largest streamflow peaks. During precipitation
    events, Q2 responds rapidly and increases considerably. Shallow lateral flow Q1
    occurs during precipitation events as transient, short pulses. The overland flow
    Q0 occurs rarely, usually following a large precipitation event or consecutive
    events. The streams are intermittent, with dry periods in the late summer and
    winter. These dynamics are similar to what was observed based on mixing calculations
    in Hatley et al. (2023). Download : Download high-res image (321KB) Download :

    streamflow) are Q0 (overland flow), Q1 (shallow lateral flow), and Q2 (deep groundwater
    flow). The modeled Q is the arithmetic mean of the 25 best performing cases. Grey
    shade is one standard deviation above and below the mean. Q0 occurs only during
    largest rainfall events or in already wet conditions; Q1 occurs in most rainfall
    events; Q2 is the dominant flow and overlaps with Q most of the time except during
    large rainfall events when Q1 also contributes substantially to the streamflow
    such as in June and in August 2005. The streams are dry in late summer and winter
    and thus data is limited in that period. Most streamflow occurred in relatively
    wet spring and summer. The lower limit of streamflow was set as 0.07 mm/day, corresponding
    to detection limit of streamflow. (For interpretation of the references to colour
    in this figure legend, readers are referred to the web version of this article.)
    The climate at Konza Prairie has become progressively wetter and warmer, as shown
    in the precipitation and temperature trends (Fig. 5a). However, both the streamflow
    Q and runoff ratio (Q/P) has declined in the two catchments, with a more rapidly
    declining trend in the substantially encroached N04D as indicated by its slightly
    greater rate compared to the mildly encroached N01B (1.4E-5 versus 1.2E-5 mm/day/day
    for Q, Fig. 5c and d). Evapotranspiration in both catchments has been increasing
    (Fig. 5b), with a more rapid increase in N04D, which is consistent with a greater
    streamflow decline in N04D than N01B. Evapotranspiration in N04D is however smaller
    than N01B despite experiencing higher woody encroachment rates, consistent with
    N04D’s higher runoff ratio. This difference is apparent even during early period
    when both catchments had relatively low woody cover. A potential reason could
    be the presence of inter-basin water transfers or groundwater loss to regional
    aquifers, which has been discussed in previous work (Sullivan et al., 2020) but
    not simulated in the model. The model assumes closed water balance such that ET
    = P – Q. If there is additional groundwater loss, the model could potentially
    be adding the groundwater losses to evapotranspiration losses. If this is the
    case, it would indicate that N04D loses less groundwater than N01B, which leads
    to higher “apparent” ET in N01B. However, lack of monitoring data makes it hard
    to test this hypothesis. Download : Download high-res image (427KB) Download :

    1985–2020 for ET, Q and Q/P. Precipitation, temperature and evapotranspiration
    have increased whereas streamflow has decreased from 1985 to 2020. 3.2. Changing
    flow paths Streamflow Q in both catchments is predominantly deeper groundwater
    flow Q2, followed by shallow lateral flow Q1, whereas surface overland flow Q0
    is negligible (Fig. 6). In early years, the mildly encroached N01B had a greater
    groundwater fraction (Q2/Q) compared to the substantially encroached N04D. Over
    time, deep groundwater flow has increased more rapidly in N04D, leading to similar
    Q2/Q ratios in the two catchments (Fig. 6f). In N01B, rates of all flow components
    have decreased (Fig. 6a–c), similar to total streamflow; the groundwater flow
    fraction (Q2/Q) however still increased, although not as rapidly in N04D. Considering
    deep groundwater fraction as proxy for recharge, this indicates recharge has increased
    more in N04D than N01B. Download : Download high-res image (805KB) Download :

    fraction (Q2/Q) has increased in N01B and N04D, whereas flow fractions of other
    components have decreased. Although the groundwater fraction (Q2/Q) decreased
    during the transition period (1995–2004), it has been increasing overall, especially
    in the most recent period (2005–2020). The increasing trend is significant across
    all seasons for substantially encroached N04D (Fig. 7). Across different seasons,
    the groundwater fraction has increased faster in the summer and fall in N04D.

    across all seasons in both catchments except fall in N01B. The flow fractions
    increased most in summer and fall in N04D. 3.3. Increasing occurrence of hydrological
    droughts The standardized precipitation index SPI has increased, indicating a
    wetter climate over time (Fig. 8). However, the standardized streamflow index
    SSI, an indicator for hydrological droughts, has decreased in both catchments,
    indicating more droughts over time. Distributions selected to fit these indices
    are summarized in Table S-3. The steepest increase in the SPI occurred at the
    12-month timescale, indicating increasing precipitation at the annual scale. SSI
    in the substantially encroached N04D has declined at over twice the rate of the
    mildly encroached N01B. SSI-12 indicates sustained low stream flows over extended
    periods. SSI-12 at N01B has decreased at a faster rate than SSI-1, indicating
    more common, elongated periods of low stream flows instead of short periods of
    low flow. The substantially encroached site, on the other hand, has experienced
    almost similar rates of increase in drought severity across all timescales. Download

    climate The modeled streamflow and groundwater flow are compared under climate
    influence only with observed climate change (Climate Only) and under combined
    influence of climate change and differing degrees of woody encroachment (Climate
    + WE) (Fig. 9). In the “Climate Only” scenario, streamflow in both catchments
    increased over time while the runoff ratio Q/P decreased by 0.01 and 0.03 in the
    mildly and substantially encroached watersheds, respectively. This result indicates
    that higher ET in a warmer climate will inevitably change the water balance and
    reduce the proportion of streamflow. In addition, Q2 itself also increased over
    time, indicating more precipitation would lead to more recharge into the deeper
    groundwater. In the “Climate + WE” case, streamflow decreased in both catchments.
    The deeper flow Q2 increased slightly in N04D and decreased slightly in N01B,
    but the groundwater flow to total streamflow fraction Q2/Q increased in both catchments.

    flow rates (Q, Q2) and day−1 for runoff ratio and flow fraction (Q/P, Q2/Q). In
    the “Climate Only” scenario, streamflow would have increased in both catchments
    in a wetter climate with more precipitation, whereas in reality streamflow has
    decreased under compounded impacts of climate and woody encroachment (Climate
    + WE). The fractions of deeper flow (Q2/Q) show increasing trend in both “Climate
    Only” and “Climate + WE” scenarios but more so in the substantially encroached
    N04D. 4. Discussion The hydrology effects of climate change and woody encroachment
    are often intertwined, challenging our understanding of their relative influence
    on streamflow and flow path partitioning. Here we aim to differentiate their impacts
    using hydrology modeling and temporal trend analysis in two differentially-encroached
    catchments in the Konza Prairie. We hypothesize that 1) woody encroachment outweighs
    climate change in influencing catchment hydrology; 2) woody encroachment promotes
    deeper groundwater flow. Results confirm the hypotheses, showing that despite
    a wetter climate, evapotranspiration has increased whereas streamflow has decreased
    with higher fraction of deeper groundwater flow in woody-encroached grassland
    (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (252KB) Download : Download full-size

    (left) and substantially encorached (right) grasslands. In the substantially encroached
    grassland, ET is higher and streamflow is lower with higher fraction of deepening
    groundwater flow. 4.1. Drier streams in a wetter climate – The role of woody encroachment
    Woody cover in N01B and N04D has increased by about 20 % and 40 %, respectively,
    over the past four decades (Fig. 1b). Meanwhile, mean annual precipitation and
    temperature have increased by ∼ 125 mm and by 0.93◦C, respectively (Fig. 5a).
    These changes are expected in the midwestern region of the United States (IPCC,
    Arias, P., Bellouin, N., Coppola, E., Jones, R., Krinner, G., Marotzke, J., Naik,
    V., Palmer, M., Plattner, G.-K., Rogelj, J., 2021, USGCRP, Reidmiller, D., Avery,
    C.W., Easterling, D.R., Kunkel, K.E., Lewis, K., Maycock, T.K., Stewart, B.C.,
    2018). Data and modeling results indicate that, in response to increased woody
    cover and climate change, mean annual streamflow has declined from 1985 to 2020
    by 56.4 mm and 66.6 mm, in the mildly and substantially encroached sites. Correspondingly,
    the Q/P ratios have decreased by 0.08 and 0.1 respectively (Fig. 5c&d). Similar
    declines have been noticed in Kings Creek, the bigger stream that N01B and N04D
    drain to (Dodds et al., 2012). Both woody encroachment and increasing temperature
    can explain the declining streamflow as they alter evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration
    can increase during woody encroachment in mesic grasslands due to the generally
    higher transpiration rates of woody species compared to grasses (Huxman et al.,
    2005, Keen et al., 2022, O''Keefe et al., 2020, Wilcox et al., 2022). As an example,
    roughleaf dogwood, the dominant encroaching woody species in Konza Prairie, has
    a relatively high canopy transpiration rate of 2.01 mm/day compared to big bluestem,
    the dominant grass species, which transpires 0.91 mm/day during the growing season
    (O''Keefe et al., 2020). At the Konza Prairie, grass species preferentially use
    water from the shallow soil (top 30 cm), while shrubs often extract water from
    deeper soil under dry conditions (Keen et al., 2022, Nippert and Knapp, 2007,
    Ratajczak et al., 2011). Stable isotope analysis revealed that shallow soil water
    contributes about 78.3 % of water extracted by big bluestem while roughleaf dogwood
    utilizes similar amounts of soil water and groundwater, which gives dogwood competitive
    advantage over grass (Keen et al., 2022). At the catchment scale, evapotranspiration
    (based on eddy flux measurements) remained high in a more woody-encroached catchment
    during a drought year as woody species circumvented drought by extracting deeper
    water (Brunsell et al., 2014, Logan and Brunsell, 2015). Increasing temperatures
    can also independently increase evapotranspiration rates by escalating soil evaporation
    and plant transpiration rates, as atmospheric demand for water increases (Allen
    et al., 1998, Schreiber, 2001). The comparison between the hypothetical “Climate
    Only” and the real “Climate + WE” scenarios however indicates that without woody
    encroachment, annual streamflow would have increased by 12.4 mm and 42.2 mm in
    mildly and substantially encroached catchments, respectively, from 1985 to 2020
    (Fig. 9). The “Climate Only” scenario does not account for possible decrease in
    evapotranspiration due to plant physiological response to increasing CO2 levels
    and therefore may underestimate the modelled streamflow increase. This shows that
    the wetter and warmer climate would have enhanced streamflow. Streamflow in both
    catchments however declined under the combined impact of climate change and woody
    encroachment. In addition, the substantially encroached N04D has experienced greater
    declines in streamflow (Fig. 4). All these observations indicate that woody encroachment
    has been a stronger driver (compared to climate change) for declining streamflow
    in Konza. Streamflow changes due to woody encroachment and / or changing climate
    have been observed in other places. Decreasing streamflow has been well documented
    in encroached prairies of Canada and Great Plains of USA (Starks and Moriasi,
    2017, Zou et al., 2018). In North Concho catchments in Texas, streamflow declined
    as much as 70 % as woody cover increased following land degradation (Wilcox et
    al., 2008a). In minimally disturbed karst areas of Southern Italy, groundwater
    flow contribution to streams has declined despite increasing precipitation (Fiorillo
    et al., 2021). While declining streamflow has been more commonly reported, other
    responses have been observed as well. For instance, streamflow in karst catchments
    in Edwards Plateau increased with increasing woody cover from 1925 − 2010. Streamflow
    remained relatively constant but baseflow increased in an Oklahoma catchment from
    1938 − 1992 under the influence of both riparian woody expansion and slightly
    increasing precipitation (Wine and Zou, 2012). Similar to the Konza Prairie, many
    places experience both woody encroachment and climate change. Although it remains
    challenging to differentiate the relative importance of woody encroachment and
    a changing climate, woody encroachment has been highlighted to influence hydrology
    more than projected climate change scenarios in drylands such as the Chihuahuan
    desert (Schreiner-McGraw et al., 2020). Streamflow in the Konza Prairie has declined
    in the Central Great Plains where annual precipitation has been projected to slightly
    increase or have little to no change (IPCC, Arias, P., Bellouin, N., Coppola,
    E., Jones, R., Krinner, G., Marotzke, J., Naik, V., Palmer, M., Plattner, G.-K.,
    Rogelj, J., 2021, USGCRP, Reidmiller, D., Avery, C.W., Easterling, D.R., Kunkel,
    K.E., Lewis, K., Maycock, T.K., Stewart, B.C., 2018). This raises the question:
    how commonly do streams dry up even as climate becomes wetter? Is this phenomenon
    unique to the Konza Prairie, or is it occurring in other areas with woody-encroachment,
    both within and beyond the Central Great Plains? 4.2. Deepening flow paths Ample
    evidence has shown that the hydrology at Konza Prairie is groundwater dominated.
    Hatley et al. (2023) and Keen et al. (2022) have identified groundwater as the
    dominant source for the intermittent stream draining N04D. Shallow lateral flow
    through soils is negligible most of the time except during storm events, a common
    observation in karstic terrain (Wilcox and Huang, 2010, Wilcox et al., 2008b).
    Groundwater flow contribution to streamflow initially decreased at both catchments
    but rebounded later (Fig. 6) and became even higher in recent years than earlier
    periods. This increase is evident across almost all seasons (Fig. 7). Groundwater
    contribution to total streamflow (Q2/Q) similarly increased in the “Climate Only”
    scenario (Fig. 9). However, the “Climate + WE” scenario shows a much higher increasing
    rate (42.9 times, slope in Fig. 9) compared to Climate scenario in the substantially
    encroached site, and 3.6 times that of the “Climate Only” scenario in the mildly
    encroached site. This suggests that woody encroachment has contributed substantially
    to the deepening of flow paths, although it is not clear if this arises from deepening
    roots or more macropores. Similar observations have been reported in South Concho
    catchments with karst bedrock in Texas, where baseflow increased with woody encroachment
    despite decreasing annual streamflow (Wilcox et al., 2008a). Similarly, baseflow
    was observed to increase in karst catchments of Edwards Plateau with woody encroachment
    due to rapid groundwater recharge (Wilcox and Huang, 2010). One hypothesis is
    that such deepening flow paths may be driven by the unique rooting characteristics
    of encroaching shrubs. Shrub roots can form deep and connected macropores, channeling
    water through soil quickly (Laine-Kaulio et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2020). Macropores
    often contribute to up to 70 % of water flow despite only making up 1–2 % of soil
    volume (Beven and Germann, 2013). Soils beneath shrubs in woody-encroached grasslands
    have shown well-developed, convoluted and deeper macropores, leading to higher
    hydraulic conductivity (Hu et al., 2019, Hu et al., 2020, Li et al., 2013) and
    higher infiltration rates (Eldridge et al., 2015, Leite et al., 2020). Deepening
    woody roots could have easily reached the underlying bedrock, thereby enabling
    water flowing through macropore to recharge groundwater (Ghestem et al., 2011),
    promoting groundwater flow as observed at the Konza Prairie. The increased groundwater
    flow also suggests that the vertical conductivity between mudstone and limestone
    layers in localized areas is high enough to support the higher groundwater recharge
    facilitated by woody encroachment (Sullivan et al., 2020). More research however
    is warranted to fully test this hypothesis. An alternative hypothesis is that
    the decreasing streamflow but increasing groundwater flow may arise because some
    of the water that would have reached stream as shallow soil water has potentially
    shifted to deeper groundwater that enters regional groundwater table and bypasses
    the stream outlets. Shallow soil water flow mostly tends to contribute to streams
    and, therefore, is detected at the flume. For deeper groundwater, it is possible
    only a portion of the recharged groundwater is delivered to the stream, with the
    rest recharging deeper regional groundwater. In other words, it is possible some
    water is “lost” to deeper stratigraphical units below the flume, and may emerge
    in some other streams (i.e., inter-basin groundwater flow). Therefore, by shifting
    some of the runoff to deeper groundwater, a greater portion of the precipitation
    may be “lost” such that streamflow declines. Testing these hypotheses require
    consistent and comprehensive sets of data that document changes in streamflow,
    conductivity, ET, and recharge in woody-encroached grasslands, which are mostly
    lacking in literature. 4.3. Implications The decreasing flow in intermittent Konza
    Prairie streams means more zero-flow days and a loss in stream connectivity (Dodds
    et al., 2012, Lapides et al., 2021). In addition to affecting aquatic life, this
    can have implications on water quality as intermittency affects various processes
    within and beyond streams (Dodds et al., 2004, von Schiller et al., 2011, von
    Schiller et al., 2017). Hydrology plays a significant role in determining water
    quality (Li, 2019). Low streamflow has been linked to high concentrations of solutes
    in rivers and streams at the continental scale (Li et al., 2022). This indicates
    that mean solute concentrations in Konza Prairie can increase in the future. Increasing
    solute concentrations in fact have already been observed in N04D (Macpherson and
    Sullivan, 2019). Increasing connectivity and higher fractions of deeper groundwater
    can possibly accelerate carbonate dissolution and inorganic carbon export, especially
    if the percolating water transports more acidic, CO2-rich soil water to the depth
    (Stewart et al., 2022, Wen et al., 2022). Concentration of dissolved inorganic
    carbon in groundwater of N04D has been observed to be increasing faster than atmospheric
    CO2 (Macpherson et al., 2008). Enhanced carbonate dissolution can mobilize solutes
    including calcium, magnesium, and heavy metals. Moreover, it can further enhance
    deeper flow paths and form positive feedbacks. Deepening roots and flow paths
    in fact have been shown to double carbonate weathering rates compared to a subsurface
    with shallow roots (Wen et al., 2021). Given the different rates of soil respiration
    (including both root and microbial respiration) in woody plants and grasses (McKinley
    and Blair, 2008, Smith and Johnson, 2004), it raises the question of how much
    changing water fluxes and flow paths versus soil CO2 levels have been contributing
    towards these observed increases in geochemical solute concentrations at the Konza
    Prairie, and in woody-encroached grasslands in general. 5. Conclusion Woody plant
    expansion in grasslands can affect hydrology, but its impacts vary by location
    and time and are convoluted with the influence of climate change. We analyzed
    over three decades of data from two catchments with different degrees of woody
    encroachment at the Konza Prairie to understand the relative impacts of climate
    change and woody encroachment on streamflow. Our findings show that despite a
    wetter climate with increasing precipitation, streams draining both encroached
    catchments have become drier over time, especially in the substantially encroached
    site. Woody encroachment plays a crucial role in reducing streamflow, as demonstrated
    by increasing streamflow in the hypothetical “Climate Only” scenario without encroachment.
    Furthermore, flow pathways have deepened, with increasing fraction of deeper groundwater
    flow despite declining streamflow, particularly in the more encroached catchment.
    These findings raise the question about how common do streams become drier even
    as climate becomes wetter, and whether it occurs only in Konza, or it is a common
    phenomenon in woody-encroached grasslands in the Great Plains and beyond. These
    questions are important as drier streams not only reduce water availability and
    threaten aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity, but also affect water quality and
    carbon cycling in grasslands that cover 40 % of the ice-free Earth surface. CRediT

    preservationSmart Contract 1. Introduction Since its formal proposal in 1956 [1],
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been steadily and rapidly proliferating itself
    in everyday life. It comes to consolidate human efforts to face challenging issues
    and solve problems of humanity. As it is expanding its spheres into many different
    areas, AI is indeed a crucial support system for the development of society. Taking
    advantage of the vast amount of data produced across the world and the significant
    advancements in hardware technology, the field of Machine Learning (ML) has advanced
    to the point where a number of intelligent systems built on ML models are beginning
    to find their way into mainstream applications leveraged in performing day-to-day
    human tasks [2]. This progress is extremely beneficial and valuable since it enhances
    people achieve higher efficiency and productivity. There is a wide range of uses
    for machine learning, from simple applications like recommender systems [3] used
    by information-based companies like Google, Twitter, Netflix, and LinkedIn to
    sophisticated applications like self-driving cars [4], smart healthcare [5], earthquake
    prediction [6], and many more [7]. One sector that has greatly benefited from
    these technological advancements is the healthcare sector. Machine learning has
    shown remarkable applicability in the medical field, revolutionizing healthcare
    practices and patient outcomes [8], [9]. More importantly, smart healthcare systems
    have opened up virtually unbelievable prospects and novel possibilities for saving
    lives. Their potential lies in their ability to analyze vast amounts of patient
    data, identify patterns, and generate insights that aid in accurate diagnoses
    and treatment planning. HIoT enables a tremendous change in the field of digital
    health, as evidenced by the findings of the study by Habib Zadeh and colleagues
    from 2019 [10]. By deploying a wide range of intelligent systems, it aspires to
    offer consistent medical attention to patients. Thus, it is an essential part
    of keeping people alive. Research interest in the domain of HIoT is therefore
    growing at an exponential rate. However, being impressed by the humongous opportunities
    that AI offers for a smarter life should not lead to undermining the serious risks
    that it poses. The need to shed light and get insights into the associated risks
    with AI and ML is emerging. In fact, patient confidentiality is of utmost importance,
    and the aggregation of sensitive medical information raises concerns about data
    breaches, unauthorized access, and potential misuse. Medical data contains highly
    sensitive and personal information about patients, including their medical history,
    diagnoses, treatments, and genetic information. Any unauthorized access to or
    disclosure of this data can lead to severe consequences for the individuals involved,
    including identity theft, discrimination, or social stigmatization. The medical
    field could be a prime target for cyberattacks due to the value of medical data
    on the black market. Privacy breaches resulting from cyberattacks can lead to
    significant harm to individuals and organizations. Though ML models have been
    established to outperform well across a diverse range of tasks, they are also
    susceptible to adversarial attacks [11]. The latter category attempts to trick
    an ML model into failing in a variety of ways, leading to misclassified results.
    The attacker in a black-box attack does not have access to or knowledge of the
    model’s internal settings. A white-box exploit, on the other hand, allows the
    attacker complete access to all model parameters, allowing for significant alterations
    to the model’s architecture and, by extension, its outcomes. If the health-related
    ML model is tricked, it will lead to misclassified results that put lives at risk.
    Given the aforementioned reservations, academics, researchers, and stakeholders
    are battling with the difficult challenge of how to develop a trusted AI [12].
    While using IT solutions in healthcare saves lives, it also raises a number of
    concerns, particularly in the areas of privacy and security. The confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of information must be safeguarded to prevent unauthorized
    access, use, disclosure, interruption, alteration, or destruction, as defined
    by [13]. Nevertheless, privacy safeguards ensure that users’ information is handled
    in line with their preferences when it is collected, stored, utilized, and disseminated.
    Data privacy means being in charge of one’s own information. However, security
    is tied to safety. It is the process of protecting data against various vulnerabilities.
    Security is often compared to a game of chess, and as such, it is important to
    not only develop a successful strategy but also to anticipate potential threats
    from the adversary and their possible responses. Striking a balance between leveraging
    the power of machine learning while ensuring stringent privacy protection measures
    is crucial to foster trust and encourage further advancements in the medical domain.
    Therefore, researchers are always working on finding new approaches to reinforce
    ML’s robustness in the face of the ongoing conflict between ML and attack vectors.
    They take advantage of the state of the art and cutting-edge technologies to develop
    formidable defenses. Some of the most promising alternatives include federated
    learning (FL) and blockchain technology. FL, as an emerging shift in ML paradigms,
    comes with promises to preserve privacy. Instead of sending data to a model, this
    approach reverses the process and brings the model to the data. The blockchain
    is yet another effective new innovation. Its robust features, ensuring both content
    and operations security, make it a potential solution for combating malicious
    attacks. Driven by privacy and security concerns, this research tries to consolidate
    efforts for a more secure and efficient smart healthcare [14]. The primary goal
    is to construct a secure and private decentralized learning platform using blockchain
    technology-concisely, a blockchain-based federated learning system that ensures
    privacy preservation and data integrity. 1.1. Research contributions of this work
    In order to reach the main goal of this study, two main objectives have been set:
    1. To build an ML system based on FL in order to guarantee privacy preservation.
    2. To integrate blockchain technology into the FL system to ensure ML model integrity
    and immunize the system against attacks. This paper is organized as follows: Section
    2 provides the background of the study. Section 3 outlines an overview of the
    related work. The proposed framework to solve the addressed problem is presented
    in Section 4. The experiments and the results are presented in Section 5. The
    achieved results are discussed in Section 6. Section 7 presents the threats to
    validity. The conclusion is given in the last section of the paper. 2. Background
    study This section is subdivided into three subsections. First, we present an
    overview on the HIoT, secondly the FL and finally the Blockchain technology. 2.1.
    Healthcare internet of things (HIoT) The World Human Organization (WHO) Constitution
    envisages “the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of
    every human being.”1 With an ageing global population, rising life expectancy,
    and the emergence of new diseases, it is imperative that healthcare evolve to
    be more proactive rather than reactive – that is – preventive than curative. Health
    has a significant impact on a country’s economic development. People who live
    longer and healthier lives tend to contribute more to society as a whole. As a
    result, the healthcare sector is consistently innovating in order to fulfill this
    fundamental human right. The healthcare sector has always benefited from technological
    advancements. This helped bring forward a novel outlook to medical care. Now,
    instead of patients going to get care, it is the healthcare providers that go
    to the patients. Currently, we talk of electronic health (e-Health) [15]. Internet
    of Things (IoT) is one of the main technologies enabling sustainable healthcare
    delivery, which is important since putting healthcare services out of reach of
    regular people puts their lives at risk. IoT has slowly proliferated itself in
    healthcare. However, pre-Pandemic conditions have altered a lot of situations
    following the COVID-19 pandemic. The need for continuously available (always-on)
    healthcare services and the social distancing led to a dramatic transition in
    IoT deployment in healthcare. The technology was hugely applicable to tackle the
    pandemic. Combating the epidemic would benefit greatly from this technology. In
    many health systems, for instance, the global number of online consults has increased
    by a factor of 50 to 100 due to the usage of telehealth and telemedicine to improve
    healthcare solutions and to remotely treat patients [16], [17]. In light of the
    recent coronavirus outbreak, Dr. Peter Gocke, Chief Digital Officer at Charite
    University Medical Center in Berlin, has stated that “we need more open and transparent
    communication to change structures and processes that are no longer working”.
    In the following three subsections, we will discuss typical uses for HIoT, security
    and privacy concerns with HIoT deployment, and security architecture to solve
    these issues. 2.1.1. HIoT applications IoT devices help in patients’ surveillance
    [18]. In nursing homes and hospitals, they help keep tabs on residents’ health.
    They help disabled persons who live alone by keeping an eye on vitals like heart
    rate and blood pressure, among other things. Medical Fridges, Fall Detection,
    Dental are other applications of IoT based healthcare systems [19]. In 2019, 86%
    of healthcare providers used IoT in some capacity. Forbes predicts that by 2020,
    646 million IoT devices will be in use in healthcare facilities such as hospitals,
    clinics, and doctors’ offices [20]. HIoT can be used in a variety of contexts.
    Here we highlight some of the most popular uses of HIoT [10], [19]: • Blood Glucose
    Monitoring: A diabetic patient needs to keep a close eye on their blood glucose
    levels. It provides advice on how to cope with the illness. Warnings and useful
    recommendations can be issued by IoT devices in potentially harmful Warnings and
    useful recommendations can be issued by IoT devices in potentially harmful • Cardiac
    Monitoring: The mortality rate from cardiovascular disease can be reduced with
    the use of continuous cardiac monitoring, according to a recent study cited in
    the journal Zagan 2017 Healthcare [21]. IoT devices aid in monitoring of hypertension
    and hypotension [22]. • Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Monitoring: An AD patient needs
    round-the-clock care. Using IoT devices, caregivers can perform things like track
    a patient’s whereabouts and receive alerts about unusual behavior [23]. • Medical
    Fridges: IoT systems are used to control internal conditions in freezers where
    medicines, vaccines and organic elements are stored [24]. • Fall Detection: Detecting
    falls is a major concern for the elderly and the crippled who live alone, and
    here is where IoT solutions shine [25]. • Dentistry: Internet of Things is also
    used in dentistry. Bluetooth connected toothbrush analyzes the brushing uses and
    gives information on the brushing habits for personal use or for dentists [26].
    2.1.2. Security and privacy challenges HIoT has greatly simplified our daily life.
    However, widespread adoption is unlikely because of concerns over the security
    and privacy of user data. In fact, people almost feel uncomfortable with sharing
    personal medical data. These concerns are raised with HIoT devices’ susceptibility
    to attacks. Some of these security issues are as follows [27]: • Unauthorized
    Access to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID): Unauthorized RFID access is a
    key problem in the Internet of Things. If someone has access to the user’s identification
    tag, it could compromise their privacy. The tag can be read, changed, and possibly
    even broken [27]. • Sensor-Nodes Security Breach: A sensor node’s primary function
    is to act as a data collector and transmitter. As part of a two-way sensor network,
    it can sometimes collect and relay information. It is also possible to get data.
    That could make the node vulnerable to outside attackers. Intruders can either
    steal or tamper with node data. The attacks of jamming, tampering, Sybil, and
    flooding, among others, are summarized by [28]. • Cloud Computing Abuse: The cloud-centric
    architecture exposes IoT systems to several threats. For example, if an attacker
    gets access to the server, it can upload any malicious software and get control
    on the connected devices. Table 1 summarizes some of these serious threats [27],
    [29], [30]. Table 1. Cloud threats and their descriptions. Threat Description
    Malicious Insider Someone from the inside having access to user’s data may manipulate
    it. Data Loss A malicious user with an unauthorized access may alter or delete
    the existing data. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) A kind of Account Hijacking threat.
    The attacker can alter or intercept messages in the communication between two
    parties. Cloud Storage Data Exfiltration Sensitive data is viewed, used or stolen
    by someone outside of the organization’s environment. GANs-based Inference Attacks
    Generative Adversarial Network-based attacks launch inference and poisoning attacks.
    Communication bottlenecks The communication bandwidth gets weaker and drastically
    disrupts the FL process. Backdoor attack Injecting malicious task into the current
    model without affecting its actual accuracy. Organized crime and hackers Advanced
    persistent threat (APT) groups target thieving to data acquisition. 2.1.3. Security
    architecture Regarding the previously mentioned challenges, establishing a security
    architecture becomes an increasing need to ensure HIoT efficiency. Several actions
    could be taken in different levels to face such challenges. In general, security
    architecture contains three levels [20] as presents Fig. 1: • Device security
    (perception layer): At this level, the threat is physical. It attacks the physical
    devices. The protection should then target the device itself. • Communication
    securities (Network and transport layer): It aims to protect network and communication.
    • Cloud security (Application layer): It aims to protect the data itself against
    threats of different natures. 2.2. Federated learning Coined by Google in 2016
    and referred to as Vanilla FL, the FL aims to generate ML models from distributed
    datasets on various devices. It came with promises to protect data privacy. And
    since, it is experiencing a great growth in both academia and industry. Privacy
    and security are among the essential objectives of FL. FL allows private data
    to remain under the control of its owner. It is built on the idea of bringing
    the model to the data, but it goes beyond that. It allows benefiting from peers’
    experiences. In a FL system, there are two principal actors [31], [32] as below:
    • Server: it orchestrates the training process and updates the learning model
    without getting access to the client data. • Client: each client holds its own
    data, trains the model locally and shares the updates with the others via server.
    The number of clients participating in the learning process is variable. However,
    there is usually only one server. The following parts present the FL life cycle
    and the challenges it faces. 2.2.1. Federated learning life cycle From the baseline
    model to the final model, the FL life cycle goes through several steps. According
    to [33], a FL process is composed of continuous communication rounds between the
    server and the end devices. It is completed once the desired accuracy or the fixed
    number of rounds are reached. First, the server generates a generic model then
    each round follows these steps as presented in Fig. 2: 1. The server selects a
    subset of clients and sends them the generic model. 2. The selected clients download
    the current model parameters and initialize the local model with such parameters.
    3. Each client trains the model on its own local data. At the end of the training,
    it updates and optimizes the model parameters. 4. The clients send the optimized
    new parameters to the server. 5. Based on an aggregation algorithm, the server
    aggregates the clients’ updates. The global model is updated with the new aggregated
    parameters. The updated model is sent back to the selected clients. A new round
    takes place until getting the final model [34]. Download : Download high-res image

    rounds. 2.2.2. Challenges FL’s primary guarantee is the protection of user privacy.
    Consequently, impressive results are being shown in that setting. On the other
    hand, it has a number of problems that need addressing [33]. • Non-Independent
    and Non-Identically Distributed (Non-IID) Data: Each customer base is unique,
    and as such, each client has its own experience. The generated dataset is, therefore,
    dependent on its personal behavior. The same device may be used by different people.
    That makes the dataset not representative and even non-identically distributed
    from one device to another [35]. • Unbalanced Data: Dataset sizes might vary widely
    from one device to another because of the diverse range of ways in which devices
    are put to use. The effectiveness of the outcomes is reliant on the quality of
    the training dataset [28]. Thus, it is important to consider the size of each
    client’s dataset when performing an efficient aggregate. • Massively Distributed
    Data: Smartphones, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, automobiles, institutions,
    and many others are all examples of the kinds of clients that can take part in
    a FL process. Due to this, there is a great deal of variation in the statistics,
    leading to highly distributed data [33]. • Unreliable Device Connection: A client’s
    accessibility is tied to its network connectivity. If a client has a poor or slow
    connection, they may be unable to take part in the communication round. There
    could be a drop in the performance of the model as a result of that, affecting
    the model’s efficiency [33]. • Limited Device Memory: Devices differ in their
    computational capacities and amounts of available memory. It is likely that a
    smartphone or IoT device has less storage space than other gadgets [33]. • Single
    point failure: FL depends on a centralized server to aggregate model updates.
    This aggregator could be the target of an attack. In addition, a volume of data
    transmitted to the server simultaneously may overwhelm its capabilities [36].
    • Privacy leakage:. Substantial information may be gleaned from intermediate updates
    via inference attacks. It is also possible for a hostile server to use a Generative
    Adversarial Network (GAN) to steal private information [37]. • Lack of motivation:In
    order for FL to work, it is assumed that all nearby devices are willing to take
    part in the training process and share their experience. Unfortunately, that cannot
    be accomplished. Some nodes may choose not to take part in the poll for various
    reasons, such as a preference for privacy, a dearth of computing resources, or
    even just plain selfishness etc [33]. • Poisoning Attacks: FL guarantees the safety,
    security, preservation, and integrity of your data. However, attacks involving
    poison are always a concern. They pose a risk to system security and can originate
    either from the server or the client side [38]. Different techniques were associated
    to FL to deal with privacy issues: – Homomorphic encryption: it is an encryption
    technique that allows computing encrypted data, without the need to decrypt it.
    Data could be used without revealing its content, and even the results of its
    manipulation remain encrypted [39], [40]. – Secure aggregate (SecAgg): it consists
    to encrypt the model updates from each participating device before sending them
    to the central server. The server then uses a “secure multiparty computation”
    technique to aggregate the encrypted updates without decrypting them [30], [39],
    [41]. – Differential Privacy: it consists of injecting a carefully chosen amount
    of noise into the data without loosing its utility. That makes it hard to infer
    and, at the same time, ensures getting significant results [39]. One other candidate
    solution to address these privacy concerns and other FL issues such as single
    point failure is Blockchain technology [42], which can help users maximize the
    advantages of FL. In the next section, we will dive deeper into blockchain. 2.3.
    Blockchain There is no single, comprehensive description of what blockchain actually
    is. There are other comparable definitions in the literature. Thus, the literature
    provides various but similar definitions. The term “Blockchain” is self-explanatory.
    It consists of blocks connected to each other. Blockchain allows data storage
    using consensus algorithms to generate and update the distributed ledger, and
    encryption to ensure security during transmission [43]. Blockchain, as defined
    by [44], is a decentralized ledger that records transactions between users independently.
    It is a distributed database without a central authority. It manages the flow
    of information between nodes in a peer-to-peer network. It is impossible to delete
    information once it has been transferred. Data transfer is irreversible. The following
    subsections outline the Blockchain characteristics, the components leading to
    these firm characteristics, and two vital technologies that Blockchain relies
    on and owes its growth to. 2.3.1. Blockchain characteristics Blockchain robust
    features make it an attractive option for protecting the integrity and privacy
    of sensitive information [45]: • Decentralization: Blockchain operates as a distributed
    ledger system. There is no central authority to control transactions. Unlike a
    centralized architecture, a transaction can be conducted between any two nodes
    without the intervention of a third, trusted party. That helps to avoid the single
    point failure problem typical of server-based architecture [45]. • Transparency:
    Blockchain transactions are broadcast to all participating nodes. Thus, all participating
    nodes can freely access them. Any node can have an overview on the recorded transactions
    [45]. • Immutability and Traceability: Once a transaction is validated and stored
    in the ledger, it cannot be modified unless a node has control on over 51% of
    the nodes. To trace previous records, it just needs to access any node in the
    network and consult the associated ledger [45]. • De-Trusting: In Blockchain,
    a user’s identity need not be revealed in order to connect with other nodes. The
    nodes in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network are not required to trust each other to
    validate transactions. Instead, the trust comes from the adopted consensus algorithms.
    The latter control the communication between nodes and ensure that the distributed
    ledgers are the same [45]. • Anonymity: A user can interact with other nodes in
    Blockchain without revealing its identity. It is identified by a randomly generated
    address [45]. 2.3.2. Blockchain components Blockchain owes its firm characteristics
    to its different components which interact to ensure a secure data sharing as
    Fig. 3 shows. • Transactions: Blockchain enables sharing information between the
    different nodes among a P2P network. The source node generates a file containing
    the exchange information. Then, it broadcasts it to the entire network for validation.
    A set of validated transactions is congregated in blocks. The first generated
    block is called Genesis Block. Each transaction changes the Blockchain state.
    Each node holds a log containing the history of previous transactions. • Secured
    Distributed Ledger: The history of validated transactions is recorded in a Ledger.
    A block generated is broadcasted for validation. Once a block is validated, it
    is queued to the precedent blocks forming, then, a chain [46]. • Asymmetric key
    Cryptography: To achieve security, Blockchain relies on two types of cryptography
    and Hash Function: Hash Function: A hash function is a cryptographic implementation
    of a hash algorithm. It is a way to apply a hash algorithm to an input. Its result
    is known as a message digest. It has a unique fixed-size. Blockchain uses the
    Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Its size is 256 bits (SHA-256). This is a one-way
    hashing function. In most cases, the digest message cannot be used to reconstruct
    the original message. Finding an input that provides a certain message digest
    is similarly challenging. Two distinct inputs will never provide the same hash
    value [47], [48]. Asymmetric Encryption: Public-key encryption is another name
    for asymmetric encryption. There are two keys needed to encrypt and decrypt any
    message. It has two main applications: addresses and electronic signatures. A
    node must have a wallet inside the P2P network to conduct any transaction. This
    wallet is protected by the private key, while its address uses the public key
    [47], [49]. • Consensus Mechanism: Unreliable nodes in a P2P network require a
    consensus method. Thus, the P2P distributed network necessitates a mechanism to
    reach consensus between the untrustworthy nodes. Several consensus algorithms
    are used to control communication and ensure that ledgers in different nodes are
    consistent: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Practical Byzantine Fault
    Tolerance (PBFT), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) etc [45], [50]. Table 2 summarizes
    the characteristics of each algorithm. Download : Download high-res image (167KB)

    Fabric Hyperledger 2.3.3. Blockchain technologies The Blockchain growth is mainly
    due to the advanced technologies it deploys. Smart Contracts and Hyperledger are
    two vital technologies adopted by Blockchain. • Smart Contract : The term “smart
    contract”, or “SC”, was coined by Nich Szabo in 1994. A SC is a code block that
    executes itself when certain conditions are satisfied [51]. Launched in 2015,
    it is the first of its kind to be used in the Ethereum Blockchain. It is difficult
    to make adjustments to a SC after it has been put into production. SCs are crucial
    for establishing connections — basically setting and getting data to and from
    the distributed ledger [43]. In spite of their promising appearance in the future,
    SCs are not yet capable of functioning independently as a decentralized server.
    • Hyper Ledger : Hyperledger is an umbrella term for a collection of Linux Foundation-sponsored
    open-source initiatives. These projects are used for Blockchain development. Hyperledger
    differs from permissionless Blockchain systems like Ethereum since it is generally
    private and permissionless. It serves as a “greenhouse” that promotes collaboration
    between businesses and developers [52]. 3. Related work Blockchain-based federated
    learning (BCFL) has been employed in several fields. Industrial IoT, medicine,
    Internet of vehicles are some of BCFL applications. The different applications
    of BCFL in medicine are presented as follows. To face covid-19 crisis, the work
    of [53] used a Blockchain managed FL approach. It allows detecting the Corona
    virus from symptoms. The proposed approach relies on two modules: An immunization
    model based on Deep Learning algorithms [54], [55]. It detects covid-19 from symptoms
    data such as loss of smell and taste, fever, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath.
    A biometric module using neural network architecture is used for face recognition.
    A set of HIoT sensors are used to collect data [56]. The two modules coupled with
    an AI-based QR code generator produce a Blockchain mapped health immunization
    certificate. The system that allows a dynamic health QR code visualization has
    applications for three actors: the patient, the health authority and the stakeholders
    wherever health status must be checked for safety. The transactions through the
    whole system are stored in Blockchain. The private raw data is stored off-chain
    in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) repository. The training data hash is
    then stored in the Blockchain. Two types of Blockchain were deployed. Ethereum
    and Hyperledger were used to manage the distributed ledger system. The system
    added security and privacy algorithm to FL ecosystem. It aims to find a balance
    between the model accuracy and the privacy budget. The authors of [57] proposed
    a method to help medical practitioners to detect Covid-19 using lung Computed
    Tomography (CT) scans. The architecture relied on a Modified Capsule Network for
    Covid-19 subjects’ classification. The dataset contained 34,006 CT images belonging
    to 89 persons, 68 among them were diagnosed as positive and the other 21 were
    diagnosed as negative cases. In [58], the authors proposed a BCFL approach to
    predict diabetes. An Artificial Neural Network model was trained on Pima Indians
    Diabetes Database provided by the American National Institute of Diabetes and
    Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset was distributed among 15 participants
    in a randomized way to simulate a federation scenario. SCs in an Ethereum Blockchain
    were used instead of a centralized aggregator. They collect model updates (weights
    and biases) from the nodes participating in the training and send them the aggregated
    parameters to update their models. The model was trained in different circumstances.
    The average accuracy of the model is 73% (against 76% in a centralized architecture).
    The developed model is partially secure. Inference attacks are still possible.
    Privacy preserving protocols can be used to improve the model performance. The
    work of [59] proposed a BCFL approach for smart healthcare based on Medical Internet
    of Things (MIoT). It aims to resist to the single point failure problem, to protect
    data privacy and detect poisoning attacks. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    was trained on Pima Indians Diabetes Database to generate a diabetic prediction
    model. A small Blockchain prototype based on Ethereum was used to store, verify
    and share the model updates. Inference attacks are still possible, an extra layer
    of security was added to the system architecture. Privacy preserving methods were
    used to guarantee data privacy: Adaptive Differential Privacy and an efficient
    consensus protocol based on gradient verification. Differential privacy technology
    consists of adding a suitable noise to the updated model parameters to prohibit
    inference attacks. Gradient verification detects and filters malicious gradients
    injected into aggregation process. The model accuracy reaches 84%. It helps to
    reduce the privacy budget consumption and to resist to poisoning attacks. However,
    an unsuitable added noise may increase computing resources consumption to extract
    the original data. [60] presented a FL method that uses Blockchain for a decentralized
    data management. The model purpose is to detect tuberculosis infection in a privacy
    preserving environment. A CNN model was trained on respectively 50, 70, 90, 110
    X-ray images coming from MIoT devices. Blockchain was used to share model updates.
    The results showed that classifier effectiveness depends on the number of samples
    used for the training. The accuracy increased with an important number of samples
    and reached 75%. However, privacy preserving measures are still needed to be taken
    to ameliorate the classifier performance. The work of [61] used a blockchain-based
    federated learning approach to remotely monitor patients’ health using medical
    internet of things (MIOT). The model used a source data called Fitbit. The blockchain
    provided a secure sharing of patient health records. However, running a blockchain
    transaction network on a small device is challenging due to its high processing
    and bandwidth requirements. Table 3 provides a summary of BCFL applications in
    medical field. Table 3. Blockchain-based federated learning applications in medical

    to its high processing and bandwidth requirements. 4. Proposed approach To fulfill
    the previously announced objectives, the research’s framework is divided into
    three main phases. As shown in Fig. 4 each phase’s output is the input of the
    next phase. Download : Download high-res image (231KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Overview of overall framework. 4.1. Phase one: Dataset selection
    Security and privacy are main objectives of this research. Medical field is one
    of the domains necessitating privacy preservation and high security. Therefore,
    Pima Indians Diabetes, a medical dataset, was used to implement the study. Pima
    dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
    Kidney Diseases. Based on diagnostic measurements, it is used to predict whether
    a patient is diabetic or not. It holds 768 labeled records of 21 or older females.
    It is composed of several medical predictor variables and one target variable,
    Outcome. Predictor variables consist of the number of pregnancies the patient
    has had, her Body Mass Index (BMI), Insulin level, age, and so on. A dataset summary
    description is provided in Table 4. The selected dataset is then replicated into
    two copies for the next framework execution phase. 4.2. Phase two: ML and blockchain
    integration At this stage, three processes take place: centralized ML, FL and
    Blockchain integration. 4.2.1. Centralized ML The dataset is a labeled dataset
    that traits a classification problem. Therefore, the ML model used in this study
    is a classifier model: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. MLP is a deep learning
    model. It is a feedforward Neural Network type [62]. It is composed of nodes organized
    into numerous layers to make prediction conclusions [63]. 4.2.2. Federated learning
    In a FL process, each client trains the model locally with its own data. The data
    is gathered by IoT sensors to monitor medical variables measurements such as Insulin
    level, blood pressure, Glucose level and so on. Based on these variables, the
    model predicts whether the person is diabetic or not. To simulate HIoT data, we
    divided the initial dataset into two partial datasets. Each dataset is associated
    to a client. The two datasets are, consequently, homogeneous and have the same
    features. The MLP training is, then, federated across two clients over the selected
    datasets and takes two rounds. Despite the fact that FL protects privacy, it could
    be subject to attacks at different levels: at the server side, between client
    and server, and at the client side. In order to secure the FL against attacks,
    Blockchain is used to protect it. 4.2.3. Blockchain integration Instead of using
    a centralized server to manage the FL process, the study deploys Blockchain technology.
    A malicious server could alter model parameters and falsify the aggregation .
    Thus, Blockchain is used to immunize model parameters against attacks. The aggregation
    process is implemented in a SC. The SC receives the parameters of the model from
    the distributed ledgers, aggregates them and sends them back to the clients’ associated
    ledgers. The Blockchain-based Federated Learning implementation steps are presented
    in Fig. 5 4.3. Phase three: Evaluation At the end of previous steps, the results
    of all experiments are collected and analyzed. Different performance measurements
    are used to evaluate the model. At this final phase of the research framework,
    the performances of the different processes are evaluated based on Accuracy, Precision
    and Recall. • TP = True Positive • TN = True Negative • FP = False Positive •
    FN = False Negative Accuracy: It describes the ratio of correctly predicted results
    among all results. It tells how good the model was overall. (1) Precision: It
    is the ratio of true positive results among total positive results. It tells how
    performance the model was in detecting a specific class . (2) Recall: Called also
    Sensitivity, it describes the ratio of correctly predicted positive results among
    true positive results. Recall is most important in medical field. In fact, not
    only we need to treat the correctly positive results, but also cover the incorrectly
    predicted negative results. Therefore, the Recall must be of high value to classify
    the model as efficient. (3) Table 5 shows the specifications of the development
    tools and the development computer system. Table 4. Summary description of pima

    ROC curve for MLP performance. 5.1. Experiment This subsection describes the selected
    dataset and the ML model used in this research. It also provides a description
    of the FL process and the Blockchain integration. • Dataset Selection and Preparation:
    Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is used to implement the study; it is available
    at https://kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database The selected
    dataset is replicated into two copies: Copy1, Copy2. Copy1 is dedicated for centralized
    learning where Copy2 is dedicated for federated learning. • Centralized ML: The
    MLP used in this research is composed of a 8-dimensions input layer, 9 hidden
    layers and a 1-dimension output layer. It relies on “adam” optimiser and on two
    activation functions: Rectifier Linear Unit (reLU) and Sigmoid. It uses K-fold
    cross-validation technique, the data is partitioned into 10 subsets. The model
    is trained on the first copy of the dataset (Copy1) for 20 times, each time using
    a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training
    set. Fig. 6 describes the used MLP model. • Federated Learning: To simulate IoT
    datasets for FL, the second copy of the dataset Copy2 is divided into two datasets:
    Pima1, Pima2. The original dataset holds 768 records. If it gets divided into
    two equal datasets, the model would be trained on insufficient data. Therefore,
    to get effective results, the dataset was not equally divided because it is not
    voluminous. Pima 1 has a dataset size of 520, while Pima 2 has a dataset size
    of 550. The FL process involves two clients. It is conducted in two rounds. Each
    client trains the model on its own data. By the end of the round, it sends the
    model parameters back to the server for aggregation. It sends the weights and
    the biases of the model. The parameters are aggregated and sent back to clients.
    The model is set with the new parameters. Then, another round takes place until
    reaching the determined number of rounds. • Blockchain Integration: Instead of
    using a centralized server to control the FL process, the study deploys Blockchain
    technology. SCs are used to store and aggregate the global and the local updates.
    The SC receives the parameters of the model from the distributed ledgers, aggregates
    them and sends them back to the clients’ associated ledgers. Solidity programming
    language is used to develop SCs. Two main procedures are implemented: one for
    biases aggregation and the other for weights aggregation. 5.2. Results This subsection
    presents the results of the research. First, it presents the results of the centralized
    ML execution on the first copy of the dataset. Then it provides the results of
    the FL execution on the partial datasets. These results are then compared to evaluate
    their performances . Finally, it presents the results of Blockchain integration.
    • Centralized ML Results: The first copy of the dataset was used to train a Multi-Layer
    Perceptron in a centralized way. The performance of the model was measured using
    the standard measurements of accuracy, precision and recall. Table 6 summarizes
    the results of the model. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is another
    way to measure the performance of the model. Fig. 7 depicts the ROC curve of the
    model. • Federated Learning Results: Pima dataset was split into two datasets:
    Pima1, Pima2 . The FL process involved two clients. It took two rounds. The results
    of the model during the first round on each of the two datasets are represented
    in Table 7. By the end of the first round, the model is set with the new values.
    A new round took place and so on. The results of the last round are presented
    in Table 8. The ROC curves of the final round on both datasets are depicted in
    Fig. 8, Fig. 9. Both ROC curves show satisfying performances. The model performs
    better on the dataset “Pima2” than “Pima1”. This difference is due to the fact
    that “Pima2” is more voluminous than Pima1”. Moreover, there is a class imbalance
    in the datasets; the model tends to focus more on the majority class to optimize
    the overall accuracy. Consequently, it achieves high recall for the positive class
    but compromises on correctly predicting the negative class, leading to low accuracy
    and precision. • Blockchain Integration Results: The cryptocurrency used on Ethereum
    is Ether (ETH). Wei is the smallest denomination of Ether. To occur through Ethereum
    network, a transaction needs to be powered by some “gas”. The gas price of a transaction
    costs Gwei. Gwei (a blend of giga and wei) is a denomination of ETH. One ETH is
    equal to one billion gwei. Table 9 shows the cost of the SC in gwei as computed
    by MetaMask during implementation. Table 5. Ecosystem Specifications. Item Specifications

    of the research are discussed in this section. It examines the differences between
    the outcomes of centralized ML and FL. These findings are represented by three
    figures. The accuracy of the centralized ML and FL on both datasets is depicted
    in Fig. 10. The precision of the centralized ML and FL is depicted in Fig. 11.
    The recall of the centralized ML and FL can be seen in Fig. 12. Comparing the
    results of centralized Learning and FL, it can be noticed that there is not a
    big difference between the two. When compared to the accuracy of the centralized
    ML, the average accuracy of the FL reduced by 3.16%. The slight decrease of model
    performances in FL is compensated by privacy preservation. Download : Download

    for MLP performance on heart disease dataset. To evaluate the scalability of the
    proposed mechanism to large datasets, we applied it on Heart Disease Dataset,
    available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset?resource=download&select=heart.csv
    The used dataset contains 1025 records. It is composed of 14 features. The experiments
    show very encouraging results as the ROC curve in Fig. 13 shows. The model achieves
    a centralized accuracy of 99% and an average federated accuracy exceeding 95%.
    These results make the proposed approach transferable to various medical classification
    problems. It can be applied to additional classification tasks where accurate
    and efficient diagnosis and privacy preservation are a concern. Clients are encouraged
    to employ a secured FL model that has good performance and a guarantee of privacy
    if they want their prediction requests to be fulfilled by that model. The protection
    of users’ privacy in FL causes a moderate drop in model’s performances but they
    are still efficient. In addition to that, the implementation of Blockchain technology
    brought an increased level of safety to the proposed system. It is essential that
    blockchain technology be integrated into intelligent healthcare systems in order
    to boost patients’ trust. In the sphere of medicine, the application of such technologies
    would significantly improve the linkage of Blockchain and FL. Additional intelligent
    healthcare applications may stand to gain from Blockchain’s potentially significant
    contribution and see their services improved as a result. Therefore, Clients would
    use the applications provided by The HIoT without worrying about their privacy
    or the effectiveness of the services provided. That would be a big help in terms
    of saving more human lives and providing new prospects for a better future in
    terms of e-health. Our proposed solution is reliable enough to allow the sharing
    of private medical data and the exploitation of opportunities presented by smart
    healthcare. Applications for the IoT built on top of such intelligent systems
    would significantly improve the quality of life for those living in those areas.
    As a consequence of this, the Blockchain-based federated learning system appears
    to be an ambitious solution for the problem that has been investigated, given
    that it preserves users’ privacy and guarantees their safety. The work of [58]
    developed and built a Blockchain-based federated learning system to predict diabetes.
    It trained an ANN on the same dataset . The FL average accuracy that it attained
    was 73%, which contrasts with the FL average accuracy that our approach achieved,
    which was 93.95 (see Fig. 14). Download : Download high-res image (84KB) Download

    ANN approach and our approach performances. 7. Threats to validity Some challenges
    and obstacles were encountered during the conduction of this study. They can be
    outlined as follows: 1. The technology of Blockchain and the FL are relatively
    new. Applying these technologies in the medical field is still limited. That is
    why finding sufficient literature was a challenge. 2. The dataset used in this
    study is not an IoT dataset. To simulate IoT datasets, we needed to divide the
    initial dataset into smaller datasets. 3. The functionalities of SC programming
    languages are limited. 8. Conclusion Some noteworthy achievements have been endorsed
    by this study. In this paper, we systematically analyzed previous research on
    the subject of using FL and Blockchain in healthcare. The study revealed that
    there is an increasing need for privacy and security measures in the healthcare
    sector. The second goal of the study was leveraging MLP classifier for predicting
    diabetes. It is essential that a medical model have excellent performance. The
    proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy
    and privacy preservation, according to experimental results on a public diabetes
    dataset. The accuracy, precision, and recall of the deployed model are all outstanding.
    The implemented model has a satisfying accuracy that is near the centralized model’s
    accuracy. In addition to that, by using Blockchain, the aggregation process implemented
    in a SC was secured against attacks and falsification. Future research could include
    more ML algorithms and unsupervised learning techniques. In addition, the addition
    of a sizable number of IoT datasets has the potential to significantly boost the
    model’s accuracy. A more robust model can be built with more and different types
    of data. Further, the FL process may use a security approach that consists of
    promoting safe clients and rejecting harmful clients from the training process
    in order to improve security. Further, while it is important to point out Blockchain’s
    role in keeping the system secure, the latter may be vulnerable to attacks. Moreover,
    we tend to work on reducing the Blockchain high latency. Declaration of competing
    interest We have no conflicts of interest to disclose. Data availability The data
    selected for the experiment is freely available at https://kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.

    The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized how we live and work by connecting
    everyday devices to the Internet. As the demand for IoT devices grows, a reliable
    and efficient communication infrastructure to support these devices has become
    crucial. Cellular IoT (CIoT) has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge,
    offering a low-cost, low-power, and scalable communication network for IoT devices.
    This paper presents a comprehensive overview of CIoT technology in response to
    the growing demand for IoT applications with low latency, high coverage, low power
    consumption, high device connection, and low cost. The four major CIoT technologies
    standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization are
    investigated, including extended coverage global system for mobile communications
    IoT (EC-GSM-IoT), long-term evolution for machine-type communications (LTE-M),
    narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), and recently, new radio reduced capability (NR-RedCap).
    These technologies are analyzed regarding their fundamental focuses, features,
    use cases, requirements, and future work. In addition, we provide a comparative
    study of these types of IoT technology to assist researchers in understanding
    the available options and their potential limitations. Finally, open challenges
    are discussed to direct future research in the field. Previous article in issue

    communicationsMobile networks 1. Introduction The cellular Internet of Things
    (CIoT) refers to using cellular networks, such as fourth and fifth-generation
    (4G and 5G) networks, to connect IoT devices to the Internet. These devices can
    range from simple to complex, from smart thermostats and surveillance cameras
    to agricultural monitoring systems. The concept of CIoT is derived from an interest
    in a wide coverage area, massive connectivity, security, trustworthiness, ultralow
    latency, throughput, and ultra-reliability. One of the main benefits of using
    cellular networks for the IoT is their wide coverage area and ability to connect
    to the Internet, even in remote or hard-to-reach locations. Compared to other
    types of wireless networks, cellular networks typically offer greater reliability
    and lower latency, making them ideal for applications that require real-time data
    transfers or remote control [1]. Moreover, because many IoT applications are mission
    critical and demand more than 99.99% reliability with less than 1 ms end-to-end
    latency, cellular connectivity is considered the most appropriate option because
    it has access to the licensed spectrum, ensuring the security and reliability
    of the communication service [2]. Due to their global and standardized nature,
    cellular technology is required for the connection of billions of devices in IoT
    applications. The cellular network offers a variety of attributes that makes it
    a good choice for various IoT applications, including good quality of service
    (QoS) and experience (QoE), the ability to support mobility and service-level
    agreements, fast data rates, and worldwide coverage [1]. To support massive connectivity,
    the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization has standardized
    three new types of technology: the extended coverage (EC) global system for mobile
    communications (GSM) IoT (EC-GSM-IoT), long-term evolution (LTE) for machine-type
    communications (LTE-M), and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), known as the CIoT, since
    Release (Rel.) 13. Additionally, Rel. 17 introduced the fourth category of CIoT
    technology, called reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR), which is specifically
    designed to offer cellular services to a vast number of IoT devices planned for
    use in the 5G licensed spectrum [3]. The improvements made by 3GPP from Rel. 13
    [4] to 15 [5] are on their baseline deployment; however, since Rel. 16, LTE-M
    and the NB-IoT can share the 5G NR channels with 5G devices. 3GPP is working on
    a technology that assures better coverage for a large number of inexpensive, low-throughput
    devices with low power consumption in applications that can tolerate delays. The
    CIoT is being applied as a new approach to global connectivity and remote device
    management. Moreover, given the enhanced data rate and capacity, 5G networks are
    expected to drive numerous IoT connections. Thus, cellular networks should be
    optimized to support low-power and low-data-rate use cases to satisfy IoT demands
    [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Machine-type communication (MTC) applications can be
    delay-tolerant (tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g., utility meters)
    or delay-sensitive (cannot tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g.,
    remote robotics surgery), certain applications, such as smart cities, fall in
    the middle of these two opposite ends. Considering these categories, as per Ericsson’s
    mobility report [11], by 2023, 3.5 billion CIoT connections are expected to be
    deployed, and by 2026 [12], the NB-IoT and LTE-M are expected to comprise 45%
    of all CIoT connections. Consequently, research has been conducted to provide
    a review of the CIoT with various scopes and themes, as detailed in the subsequent
    section (Section 2). However, the existing studies have covered only a subset
    of the CIoT technology or were limited to a specific focus area. Table 1. Definitions

    Fig. 1. Paper organization. 2. Related work Since the introduction of the CIoT,
    various research has been conducted from different perspectives to provide an
    overview of the related use cases, key enablers, and challenges. A comparative
    study [13] evaluated the NB-IoT against other technology regarding latency, QoS,
    battery lifetime, capacity, and cost, applying some application scenarios. In
    other studies [14], [15], authors have analyzed the indoor coverage, low power
    consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection support of NB-IoT-targeted
    technical features, such as resource allocation, energy-efficiency techniques,
    and latency-energy performance evaluations. In addition, some applications, such
    as smart agriculture and smart health, have been analyzed with future research
    directions. In [16], the authors detailed and analyzed possible security attacks
    on NB-IoT-enabled devices and proposed various approaches and techniques for smart
    home and smart healthcare applications. Standardization efforts employed on the
    security aspects of the NB-IoT and security requirements of IoT applications with
    an extensible combination of the NB-IoT to the 5G are addressed in [17]. In [18],
    basic factors, such as the modulation scheme selection and channel coding that
    affect the energy consumption of the NB-IoT from the perspective of resource management,
    were analyzed and synthesized, and future work suggestions were offered. In [19],
    the physical layer, specifically the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE)
    of the NB-IoT system, was presented in detail, exploring the radio resource control
    (RRC) and medium access control (MAC) layers in the physical design of channels
    as well. In [20], the power consumption and communication range of self-powered
    NB-IoT in remote monitoring applications were evaluated. However, these studies
    [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] considered only the NB-IoT technology
    in the CIoT. The authors of [21] focused on integrating low-power wide-area network
    (LPWA) technology to preserve an affordable low-battery device and a wide geographical
    area while enhancing power consumption and providing future research directions.
    In [22], channel control procedures and massive MTC (mMTC) standard guidelines
    with NB-IoT and LTE-M features, including wide coverage, low power consumption,
    and massive connectivity, were explored along with future challenges and innovative
    ideas. A comparative study on the performance of CIoT technology was conducted
    in [23], focusing primarily on the NB-IoT and LTE-M. Coverage (i.e., coverage
    enhancements (CEs)), power consumption, module cost, connection count (i.e., number
    of connections per cell), supported features (i.e., voice support), and service
    modes have been compared. In [24], the authors provided comprehensive guidance
    on the IoT localization methods of NB-IoT and LTE-M devices, which is vital for
    ultra-dense devices that result in IoT positioning problems. Power consumption
    is the primary concern in IoT applications. Hence, improving battery life and
    message latency is essential, especially in rare data transmission cases, because
    it has a large signaling overhead in LTE-M and the NB-IoT due to the process of
    establishing a connection. In [25], the authors clarified early data transmission
    (EDT) mechanisms introduced by 3GPP to transmit data during the random-access
    procedure (triggers the connection to a cell) to enhance the power efficiency
    of the device and minimize message delay, which is vital in a wide coverage scenario.
    The authors of [26] evaluated mMTC features and QoS provisioning issues with critical
    enablers for mMTC in cellular networks. A detailed overview is presented on the
    channel access mechanisms and radio access network (RAN) congestion problems in
    the NB-IoT and LTE-M with machine learning (Q-learning approach) solutions for
    congestion relief, including future research directions. However, these surveys
    [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] reviewed only the NB-IoT and LTE-M. In [7],
    the authors investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M as licensed LPWA technologies,
    focusing on their low power consumption, low data rate, and broad coverage area
    features. Their study had a limited scope and aimed to facilitate LPWAN-5G integration
    to support a more extensive range of industrial applications, including process
    control and high data-rate multimedia applications. The authors of [27] compared
    the cost of EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT in urban and rural deployments and key
    cost factors from the perspective of profitability in employing the CIoT in firms.
    A broad survey on energy-saving solutions in EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT was
    conducted, including analyzing critical factors that affect power usage, such
    as data reporting frequency, discontinuous reception cycles (DRX), and RRC timers,
    [28], directing future energy consumption reduction techniques. However, these
    studies [7], [27], [28] investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M within limited
    key enablers. Table 2. Summary of recent surveys on the CIoT. Reference Year CIoT

    In [29], the authors provided the primary features of the RedCap device standardized
    by 3GPP to support mid-range IoT applications with complexity reduction, coverage

    assessment of coverage for RedCap UE in various settings, including rural, urban,
    and indoor scenarios. In [30], a comprehensive overview of 3GPP Rel. 17 RedCap
    regarding cost reduction, and power-saving results were presented with design
    guidelines with future expected 3GPP RedCap release specifications. These surveys
    [9], [29], [30] focused on RedCap with some feature components based on the 3GPP
    standard specifications. In [31], the authors analyzed EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap and verified that they are proven as 5G IoT standards employed in various
    real-time applications when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI). However,
    the research focuses on AI and IoT integration in the CIoT with future research
    directions. Hence, considering the various surveys conducted, the surveys and
    studies address various aspects with limited focus. However, this survey provides
    comprehensive all-in-one information on coverage, power consumption, cost, device
    complexity, and device connection analysis. Furthermore, this review covers the
    general architecture, applications, release enhancement, development analysis,
    focus area explorations, and future challenges based on previous studies and on-hand
    survey results. Table 2 summarizes related studies to illustrate the difference
    from this survey. 3. General network architecture of the CIoT This section discusses
    the general network architecture of the CIoT. The cellular network standards organizations,
    such as 3GPP and its member companies: Ericsson, Huawei, Qualcomm, and Vodafone
    endorse the cellular-network-based architecture of CIoT. Cellular-network-based
    architectures connect IoT devices to the cellular network’s IoT infrastructure
    and allow them to access the Internet through middleware provided by the operators.
    Various requirements, such as bandwidth, energy efficiency, coverage, mobility,
    and reliability, are considered when network architecture is developed and deployed.
    The network architecture of the CIoT is designed to be scalable and flexible to
    support a wide range of devices and applications. Its ultimate goal is to transition
    from inflexible network structures, where all devices communicate directly with
    a network access point, to a more flexible architecture. This new approach allows
    devices and the network to dynamically form interconnected sub-networks, resembling
    a mesh, as and when needed [32]. It can support low-power, low-bandwidth, and
    high-power, high-bandwidth devices and can be easily integrated with existing
    networks and systems. Integration with existing networks and systems allows organizations
    to leverage the advantages offered by IoT without having to completely overhaul
    the existing infrastructure. Fig. 2 presents the general network architecture
    of CIoT, facilitating communication between IoT devices and the Internet. A CIoT
    network architecture focuses on increasing network robustness against dynamic
    resource availability and providing ubiquitous connectivity. For instance, to
    meet the requirements of CIoT, existing legacy network architectures need to undergo
    substantial changes, such as enabling non-orthogonal access to increase the number
    of connected devices, implementing grant-free UL communication for fast and reliable
    communication, and adopting a multihop mesh network to support low-power devices
    in challenging locations [33]. As CIoT operates within existing cellular infrastructure,
    it facilitates interoperability between devices and harvests communication and
    computing resources across the network [34]. As depicted in the figure, the architecture
    comprises four main components: the IoT devices, BS, network stack (user plane
    and control plane), and Internet (CIoT applications). The first layer, the IoT
    devices include sensors, actuators, and other connected devices that collect and
    transmit data. Using these nodes, sensor data will be collected and transmitted
    to the access point, or they will receive data from it, to perform the response
    associated with the actuators. These devices communicate with the next layer,
    the BS, using CIoT technology (EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap), which connects
    the IoT devices to the network. Download : Download high-res image (761KB) Download

    layer is the network stack, comprising the user and control planes responsible
    for the efficient and effective data delivery between IoT devices and applications
    which are the two optimizations for the CIoT. The user and control planes form
    two distinct layers of the network stack and serve distinct functions, with the
    user plane carrying the data and the control plane managing the network resources
    [35]. Specifically, the user plane manages the data transmission and chooses the
    best path for control data packets for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) [36], and
    the control plane manages the overall network. In addition, the user and control
    planes work together to ensure an efficient and reliable exchange of information
    among IoT devices and the Internet. Finally, CIoT applications are at the top
    layer, which includes the applications and services that use the data collected
    by IoT devices. These applications can include everything from smart home systems
    to industrial automation systems [37]. The CIoT network architecture allows for
    the seamless integration of IoT devices and applications, making it an essential
    part of the IoT and plays a significant role to enable massive CIoT applications.
    Some of the CIoT technology (e.g., LTE-M and the NB-IoT) operates over a shared
    spectrum of LTE architecture with certain optimization techniques [38]. Some features
    were removed to reduce the complexity, equipment cost, and battery consumption
    in the shared LTE architecture, including handover for fast connection, carrier
    aggregation, and channel quality measurements [39]. In the CIoT network, two dedicated
    machines are used for communication: the MTC device and the MTC gateway. An MTC
    device is an endpoint that can communicate directly with a BS or connect via two
    hops to MTC gateways, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In this way, MTC gateways help
    increase data transmission efficiency by relaying data to the BS [40]. In fact,
    gateway utilization is feasible in numerous instances, but certain regions and
    circumstances lack such infrastructure. Consequently, in such scenarios, it becomes
    imperative to establish direct communication. 4. CIoT application use-case classifications
    The development of CIoT results from collaboration and innovation from multiple
    companies and researchers [11], [41], [42]. It has emerged as a way to extend
    the capabilities of cellular networks to establish connectivity for a diverse
    range of devices to enable a broad range of new use cases and applications, such
    as smart cities, industrial automation, and remote monitoring, to mention a few,
    by offering low-cost, low-power, and reliable connectivity. Globally, the standards
    of the CIoT have been developed by 3GPP and Ericsson, among others, which have
    different methods of classifying CIoT application use cases, as presented in Fig.
    3. Accordingly, this section discusses the application use classification by 3GPP
    and Ericsson. 4.1. 3GPP classification 3GPP is a collaboration between telecommunications
    standard organizations to develop global standards for cellular communication
    technologies [43]. Specifically, 3GPP is working on the development of 5G technology
    and standardization of IoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices [44]. They also work on developing new features and functionalities
    for cellular networks, such as network slicing, improved security, and reduced
    latency, to support the growing demands of IoT and other emerging technologies.
    This section focuses on their classifications from the application perspectives
    that 3GPP defines three usage scenarios of 5G: mMTC, ultra-reliable and low-latency
    communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) [45], [46]. 4.1.1.
    mMTC Specifically, mMTC is designed to enable numerous low-power, low-cost IoT
    devices to connect to cellular networks where many devices infrequently transmit
    small volumes of data. It is designed to connect numerous low-cost devices (e.g.,
    about 1,000,0000 devices/km ) with sporadic, low-throughput data transmissions
    within a 10-s latency [47]. The focus is on low power consumption with up to 10
    years of battery life and high reliability to efficiently use the network resources.
    It is intended for use cases requiring high device density, such as smart cities,
    industrial automation, smart homes, smart metering, and asset tracking, where
    many devices must connect to the network simultaneously. In Rel. 13, 3GPP proposed
    LPWA cellular technology that specified long-range coverage of 164 dB, inexpensive
    and extremely energy-efficient devices that necessitate intermittent and periodic
    connectivity, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT [45]. 4.1.2. URLLC Higher
    reliability and lower latency are the most important design standards in wireless
    communications. From Rel. 14 to the present, reliability and latency have been
    the focus requirements, such as new data center interconnect formats, enhanced
    physical DL control channel (PDCCH) monitoring capability, hybrid automatic repeat
    request acknowledgment (HARQ ACK) feedback based on sub slots, enhanced inter-UE
    transmitter (Tx) multiplexing, physical UL shared channel (PUSCH) enhancements,
    and a variety of active configuration grants [48]. It is intended for IoT applications
    that are mission-critical, such as emergency services, which demand high availability
    and coverage with a low response time of fewer than 1 ms. It is intended for use
    cases, such as factory automation, autonomous driving, and remote surgery [46]
    for which NR-RedCap is a complement. 4.1.3. eMBB The eMBB is designed to provide
    high-bandwidth and low-latency media streaming applications [49], such as virtual
    and augmented reality, smart offices, and 4k and 8k video streaming with ultra-high
    speed Internet access. The eMBB is intended for use cases, such as smart cities
    and entertainment. Although eMBB and CIoT differ, they can work together to offer
    more comprehensive and reliable connectivity solutions. The purpose of organizations
    in the CIoT regarding eMBB is to work to integrate them to share the capabilities
    of the trending wireless development in 5G. These categories are not mutually
    exclusive and can overlap. For example, an IoT application may require both mMTC
    and URLLC capabilities (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart grids, industrial automation),
    or an IoT device may require mMTC and eMBB capabilities (smart cities, healthcare,
    and smart agriculture). 3GPP aims to establish a framework that can cater to the
    varied needs of IoT applications and devices and ensure seamless interoperability
    among devices and networks. 4.2. Ericsson classification Ericsson [50], a leading
    information communication technology network provider, working on developing solutions
    for connecting a large number of devices to the network, improving network coverage,
    and increasing the efficiency and security of IoT applications. Involved in the
    standardization and development of CIoT technology and refined the IoT applications
    incorporated into the CIoT into four divisions: massive IoT, broadband IoT, critical
    IoT, and industrial automation IoT [32], [51]. Download : Download high-res image
    (580KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. 3GPP and Ericsson’s CIoT use-case
    classifications. 4.2.1. Massive IoT Massive IoT is focused on low-cost devices,
    small data volumes, and extreme coverage. It is intended to enable increased network
    coverage, longer device lifespan, and high connection density, which is known
    as mMTC. Ericsson identified the massive IoT as LPWA technology, as classified
    by 3GPP, employed on licensed spectrum bands. Massive IoT is employed when low-complexity
    devices, long battery life, extensive coverage, and massive deployments are necessary.
    Massive IoT applications (i.e., smart building, retail, shopping, and manufacturing;
    smart home systems; personal IoT devices; etc.) tend to tolerate delays at various
    levels in operation [52], [53], [54]. Hence, LTE-M, EC-GSM-IoT, and NB-IoT were
    developed by 3GPP to support the massive IoT [55] in which according to Ericsson’s
    projection massive IoT will make up 51 percent of CIoT connections by 2027 [56].
    4.2.2. Broadband IoT The broadband IoT provides significantly faster data transfer
    speeds and reduced latency compared to the massive IoT, which was released based
    on mobile broadband [50]. The broadband IoT is evolving due to the requirements
    of accessing multimedia information with high throughput, low latency, and large
    data volumes for communication purposes. The broadband IoT is designed for high-bandwidth
    applications, such as video surveillance and remote health monitoring. Due to
    its capability of supporting high-speed data transfer, it enables devices to transmit
    numerous data quickly and efficiently, which is relevant in healthcare applications
    (e.g., where high-resolution images and data-intensive information is transmitted
    in real-time). 4.2.3. Critical IoT The critical IoT is necessary when the industrial
    IoT (IIoT) and mission-critical applications that require ultrahigh performance,
    very high availability (99.999%), ultra-reliability, and ultralow latency are
    in demand [57]. Unlike the massive IoT, applications of the critical IoT that
    require a minimal delay, such as smart healthcare (e.g., remote surgery), industrial
    automation in smart manufacturing [22], autonomous driving, asset tracking, traffic
    safety and control, and remote control of the sensitive components of a smart
    grid automation [58], are particularly sensitive to delays. Critical IoT applications
    are technically known as URLLC, comprising industrial control, robotic machines,
    and autonomous vehicles [32] that require real-time data transmission. Ultra-reliable,
    very low latency, and very high availability are the key performance indicators
    of the critical IoT [54]. 4.2.4. Industrial automation IoT The IIoT targets improving
    the operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability of industrial processes
    and systems that require unique network deployments. The IIoT is designed for
    applications in manufacturing and industrial process automation [46], achieving
    increased reliability, reduced latency, higher data transfer rates, greater flexibility,
    and secure communication. The IIoT is the focus and enabler of Industry 4.0 [32],
    [59], [60], enhancing the controlling capability with remote monitoring applications,
    such as smart factories, agricultural monitoring, and industrial assets [61].
    The IIoT is primarily applied in IoT applications that demand Ethernet protocol
    integration, time-sensitive networking, clock synchronization services, and other
    requirements. Furthermore, in these industrial real time applications proper implementation
    and effective design of deep learning algorithms are necessary aiming for high
    performance in terms of reliability, speed, and security. Deep learning provides
    a dynamic optimization of the warehouse facilities, enhances assembly line performance,
    improves the generative design, predicts future demands, and reduces errors [62].
    Moreover, low cost and complexity are the most important factors in the IIoT [63].
    5. CIoT technologies This section discusses CIoT technology from various perspectives.
    Initially, 3GPP collated cellular network technology for the IoT in Rel. 13 included
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and in Rel. 17 the NR-RedCap. As illustrated in Table
    3, we summarize the fundamental parameters of the first Rel. 13 for the three
    types of CIoT technology and the first NR-RedCap Rel. 17 technology. 3GPP worked
    on the EC-GSM-IoT (a complete backward-compatible solution for CIoT that builds
    upon the existing GSM or enhanced-GPRS (eGPRS) deployments) under the 850–900
    MHz and 1800–1900 MHz frequency bandwidth with the aim of achieving extended battery
    life and lower device costs compared to general packet radio service (GPRS) or
    GSM devices. It also has extended coverage of up to 164 dB maximum coupling loss
    (MCL) for 33 dBm UE and 154 dB MCL for 23 dBm UE, with variable rates using Gaussian
    minimum shift keying (GMSK) ranging from approximately 350 bps to 70 kbps, and
    eight-phase shift keying (8PSK) up to 240 kbps. The technology can handle a large
    number of devices, with around 50,000 per cell, and provides enhanced security
    compared to GSM orEDGE. It can be installed through a software update to the GSM
    infrastructure [66]. Table 3. First release parameter values of the CIoT (LTE-M,

    Moreover, as shown in the table, the first release of LTE-M, Cat-0, was out on
    Rel. 12 in March 2015 to be configured as a UE Cat-0 (Cat-0 MTC) IoT version.
    In Rel. 13 in March 2016, LTE enhanced MTC or Cat-M1 (Cat-1 MTC) IoT, and the
    NB-IoT was released to afford IoT applications. In the combined Cat-0 and Cat-M1,
    LTE-M was introduced to contribute a 1 Mbps data-rate capacity, supporting full
    mobility features with a battery life exceeding a duration of 10 years, which
    can be configured easily with a software update to the LTE infrastructure. In
    the multiple access techniques, both Cat-0 and Cat-M1 in the UL transmission scenario
    support the single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) methods,
    and in the downlink scenario, they both employ orthogonal frequency-division multiple
    access (OFDMA). However, Cat-0 and Cat-M1 have differences in terms of the UL
    and DL bandwidth coverage. The former has a 20 MHz bandwidth, and the latter has
    a 1.4 MHz bandwidth derived from the legacy LTE. The coverage or link budget of
    Cat-0 is around 141 and is 156 dB for Cat-M1 [43]. In contrast, the NB-IoT was
    developed from an LTE or GSM network with 200 kHz of physical resource blocks
    (PRBs) and a clean sheet format of 180 kHz that can be compatible with a software
    update to the existing legacy LTE or GSM systems under the 700, 800 and 900 MHz
    frequency bandwidth. Because the NB-IoT utilizes many of the same design aspects
    as LTE, including channel modulation, coding schemes, and higher-layer protocols,
    it provides deployment flexibility and is primarily designed to address ultralow-end
    IoT applications [65], [68]. The NB-IoT introduces two modes of operation types,
    different from the LTE, where the whole PRB is assigned to a single piece of UE
    in the UL and DL. In the single-tone mode, the NB-IoT utilizes one PRB that has
    a bandwidth of 180 kHz in both the DL and UL of the LTE spectrum. However, in
    the multitone mode, the resource units are allocated to multiple pieces of UE
    to attain the massive device deployment objective of the CIoT, specifically for
    the NB-IoT. The NB-IoT system assigns each tone a transmission bandwidth of either
    3.75 or 15 kHz for UL transmission using the SC-FDMA scheme. For DL transmission,
    15 kHz transmission bandwidth is used with the OFDMA scheme similar to LTE. Using
    15 kHz spacing, NB-IoT can allocate either one or multiple tones (three, six,
    or twelve) to different UE with durations of 4, 2, and 1 ms, respectively. However,
    with 3.75 kHz spacing, only a single-tone allocation is supported for various
    users, with 48 sub-carriers of 32 ms duration [69], which allows the NB-IoT for
    increased deployment flexibility and higher system capacity. From the Rel. 13
    specifications, the data rate in the single-tone allocation is 48 kbps for the
    UL, 64 kbps for the multitone mode, and 128 kbps in the single- and multitone
    modes in the DL, with a 20 dB link budget from the legacy LTE of 144 dB supporting
    more than 10 years of battery life but without mobility support [70]. In addition,
    3GPP introduced RedCap on 5G device specifications with reduced features in Rel.
    17, designed objectively to simplify the standard NR technology. In the 5G technology,
    it is insufficient to reuse traditional existing frequency bands for high-end
    5G requirements, so another new and varied frequency band is needed. For 5G NR,
    frequency band 1 (FR1) is below 6 GHz or 4.10 to 7.125 GHz, and frequency band
    2 (FR2) is above 6 GHz or 24.250 to 52.600 GHz [71]. Hence, RedCap is supposed
    to use 20 MHz for FR1 and 50 and 100 MHz for FR2 in the UL and DL bandwidths,
    respectively [67]. The multiple access method is FDMA or time division multiple
    access (TDMA), where frequency or time slot is employed. The peak data rate varies
    based on the use cases (e.g., 2 Mbps is expected for wireless industry sensors,
    25 Mbps for wearables, and 150 Mbps (DL and UL) for surveillance applications).
    Moreover, after Rel. 13, 3GPP added subsequent enhancements to the current releases.
    The subsequent sections discuss these CIoT technologies in detail, considering
    their focuses, features, and applications. Following is a detailed explanation
    of each CIoT technology, including their unique features, applications, focuses,
    and review state of the art. In this section, we will explore the different CIoT
    technologies available, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, and discuss
    how they are being used in various industries and sectors. Download : Download

    5.1. EC-GSM-IoT 3GPP standardized it to support IoT applications in Rel. 13 using
    the Technical Specifications Group GSM RAN using LTE-advanced pro [7], [75], [76].
    Its development can be considered a great success because it only requires design
    reuse and software upgrades to deploy EC-GSM-IoT in the existing 2G GSM or eGPRS
    network without needing new network infrastructure. It plays a pivotal service
    in M2M or IoT communications in the form of voice, data, and SMS. Moreover, most
    sub-Saharan African subscriptions are still GSM or EDGE, which is vital for MTC
    and global IoT deployment [77]. In particular, the EC-GSM-IoT technology is intended
    to facilitate the use of IoT devices in areas with difficult radio coverage and
    can operate in frequency deployments as narrow as 600 kHz. Operators and companies,
    such as Broadcom Corporation, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Gemalto NV, Intel Corporation,
    KDDI Corporation, LG Electronics, MediaTek, Nokia, Oberthur Technologies, Ooredoo,
    Orange, Samsung Electronics, Saudi Telecom Company, Sierra Wireless, Telit Communications,
    and VimpelCom, are also trying to use it with 3G and 4G mobile networks [78].
    As shown in Table 4, the maximum UL-DL instantaneous peak data rates from the
    Rel. 14 to Rel. 17, in the 8PSK modulation, is 489.6 kbps both in DL and UL, 153.6
    kbps in GMSK modulation in the UL [45], [72]. The channel bandwidth is 200 kHz,
    and the device capacity (i.e., devices/km ) is around 60,000. Additionally, the
    technology uses CE through message repetitions [31], [73]. Indeed, the GSM technology
    is well-established, and it still plays an important role in the deployment of
    IoT. With the upgrades implemented by 3GPP in Rel. 13, GSM offers advantages in
    terms of time, coverage footprint, and cost that are crucial for IoT development.
    In addition, spectrum availability is an essential controlling factor of the CIoT
    and its innovation capability, growth rate, and development paths. Backward compatibility
    has been applied to use the existing devices and network in the EC-GSM-IoT deployment.
    As illustrated in [79], only new synchronization, the broadcast control channel,
    and common control channels on time slot 1 of the broadcast control channel carrier
    are required for EC-GSM-IoT functioning. The extended Discontinuous Reception
    (eDRX) with radio control level enhancements provides several advantages, including
    extended battery life, lower device cost in comparison to GPRS or GSM devices,
    improved coverage, and variable rates. The technology can accommodate a large
    number of devices while offering improved security features. As shown in Fig.
    4, the 3GPP did efforts to enhance the EC-GSM-IoT service levels to cope with
    the requirements of IoT application requirements. Enhancements on EC-GSM-IoT have
    been done including achieving reduced complexity, low device power consumption,
    ensuring support of a massive number of CIoT devices and backward compatibility
    with GSM, securing low-device cost, improving end-user security, and so on. In
    the consequent release, Rel.14, fundamentally, they developed three enhancement
    requirement objectives including improving the positioning of devices, coverage
    for 23 dBm devices, and new time slots (TSs) mapping in extended coverage for
    improved resource handling [45]. In EC-GSM-IoT, there are four coverage classes,
    namely CC1, CC2, CC3, and CC4, that are assigned to different channels. Each coverage
    class determines the number of blind repetitions in the DL channel, which are
    1, 8, 16, and 32 respectively. Similarly, in the UL channel, the coverage classes
    determine the number of blind repetitions as 1, 4, 16, and 48 respectively that
    can help to attain the MCL [28]. In Rel.15, feature enhancements such as supporting
    multicast to operate in extended coverage in both UL and DL, incorporating coverage
    class CC5 and CC6 to attain 33 dBm, mobility support, and power consumption reduction
    techniques (e.g., eDRX, paging) were employed. In Rel.16, enhancements in localization,
    power consumption reduction (eDRX, WUS, paging, Preconfigured UL Resources (PUR)),
    and improved multicarrier operation. The PUR is employed to allocate radio resources
    to a UE in advance, enabling the transmission of UL data without requiring a connection
    setup process. In Rel.17, enhancements have been incorporated into EC-GSM-IoT
    to better meet the requirements of application scenarios. These enhancements focus
    on improving the battery lifecycle, device density, and link budget. Download

    countries, after Rel.15, since the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. They are shifting to
    5G and confirmed the LTE-M and NB-IoT are a candidate for CIoT technology in addition
    to RedCap. Instead of EC-GSM-IoT, they are focused on LTE improvements and 5G
    NR so that no further EC-GSM-IoT feature enhancement is applied. However, in the
    Middle East, South-East Asia, and Africa, 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile networks are still
    applicable, know that it can co-exist with 3G, and 4G mobile networks, EC-GSM-IoT
    is serving well even though demand for 5G is getting high. In spite of the relatively
    lesser attention the EC-GSM-IoT network receives than the LTE-M and NB-IoT networks,
    EC-GSM-IoT still offers some promising applications. In fact, it is a good solution
    for IoT deployment in developing countries, where cellular networks are primarily
    used for voice and other locations where GSM coverage exceeds LTE coverage. 5.2.
    LTE-M Under the 3GPP feasibility study titled “Study on Provision of Low-Cost
    MTC UEs Based on LTE”, LTE-M started in September 2011, earlier than the EC-GSM-IoT
    and NB-IoT [84]. The main objective was to enhance the LTE device capabilities
    in the low-end MTC domain, present an option for the GPRS and EGPRS devices, and
    roam GSM networks to LTE. At the time, eGPRS was incompatible with supporting
    more devices and was not cost-effective for MTC devices. They aimed to provide
    a solution with device complexity and cost to facilitate better requirement satisfaction
    regarding data rates, spectrum efficiency, and power consumption than the eGPRS.
    In 2012, in addition to the mentioned requirements, the group extended coverage
    improvement over the normal LTE coverage capacity by at least 20 dB to support
    deep indoor coverage, as summarized in as shown in Table 5. Furthermore, LTE devices
    were more expensive than GSM or eGPRS, so it was worth reducing the device cost
    to address the low-end mMTC use cases. The LTE-M release feature enhancements
    increased the number of supported devices per cell, from 361,000 to 1,000,000
    devices/km allowing for more IoT devices to connect to a single BS, enabling better
    use of the available spectrum and improved scalability. New CE techniques (i.e.,
    Mode A, a moderate number of retransmissions with 32 repetitions, and Mode B,
    a high number of repetitions with 2,048 repetitions, from Rel. 14 forward) are
    introduced to improve the QoS for IoT devices operating in remote or challenging
    environments [85]. Through shorter transmission time intervals, the latency is
    reduced from 50 to 100 ms in Rel. 12 to 10 to 15 ms in recent releases [82]. The
    LTE-M release enhancements increased the maximum number of HARQ processes from
    eight to 10 to improve the reliability of data transmissions, reducing the number
    of retransmissions needed to deliver data to IoT devices, improving overall system
    efficiency and reliability, and reducing latency. The HARQ allows for more flexibility
    in determining the type and amount of retransmitted data, as explained by [86].
    Compared with other CIoT components, LTE-M has important features (see Fig. 5).
    LTE-M is considered the most suitable LPWA technology for IoT applications that
    need high data rates, low latency, and full mobility, including voice, under standard
    coverage conditions. It is also an ideal choice for IoT applications that require
    deep coverage, where the demands for latency, mobility, and data speed are less
    rigorous. Indeed, LTE-M is a highly adaptable LPWA technology that can cater to
    both lower and higher data rates, with its system bandwidth being flexible and
    capable of accommodating 1.4 MHz or more. It can handle real-time traffic, full
    mobility, and voice features. In general, in the form of low-cost devices and
    coverage improvements, Rel. 14 and Rel. 15 further developed the standard, as
    shown in Table 5. In addition, MTC was further enhanced for LTE [82], commonly
    referred to as the “feMTC” work item in Rel. 14, which brought further enhanced
    improvements for supporting higher data speeds, improved voice over long-term
    evolution (VoLTE) support, improved positioning, multicast support, and the new
    LTE device, Cat-M2. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat-M2, unlike the normal LTE UE for
    IoT applications that require a higher data rate (e.g., wearables, such as smartwatches)
    but lower device cost. The UE Cat-M2 has a UE bandwidth of 5 MHz and can achieve
    peak rates of around 4 Mbps for the DL and 7 Mbps for the UL, assuming it supports
    FD-FDD operations [87]. For UE that supports HD-FDD, these peak rates are roughly
    half of the aforementioned figures, and for UE that supports time division duplex,
    the peak rates depend on the DL/UL subframe configuration, as stated in [82].
    The Cat-M2 UE supports larger maximum TBSs for unicast transmission than Cat-M1
    UE. Valuable enhancements have been provided in each release, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. Rel. 13 enhanced by employing coverage enhancement modes (CE mode A and
    B), improved device type having lower complexity and cost, enabled VoLTE in HD
    mode and introduced additional power saving features (eDRX) than Rel. 12 that
    was featured as lower complexity (a single receive antenna) and low-cost devices
    (Cat-0), HD operation, supports a lower data rate requirement (Max: 1 Mbps) and
    PSM enhancements for the UE. Rel. 14 further enhanced LTE-M, offering further
    developments than Rel. 13 regarding mobility, data rate, HARQ processing, new
    Cat-2 specifications, supporting positioning features, and additional power consumption
    management techniques [82]. The other power-saving mechanism developed in Rel.
    14, the Release Assistance Indication (RAI) feature is employed to conserve power
    by permitting the network to terminate a connection that is no longer required.
    By turning off the device radio and freeing network resources sooner, RAI can
    help to minimize battery consumption. A Rel. 15 work item that added use cases,
    increased spectrum efficiency, and additional benefits even further enhanced MTC
    (efeMTC) for LTE [88] while reducing latency and power consumption. Particularly,
    LTE-M is suited for industry operations with mobility features that must be tracked
    and monitored while moving. In Rel. 15, the central objective was to improve latency,
    spectral efficiency, and power consumption further. Potential enhancements to
    enhance latency include reducing the system acquisition time (e.g., improving
    the BS search or system information acquisition performance) and supporting EDT.
    To increase system capacity, spectral efficiency was improved in the DL by introducing
    higher-order modulation (64 QAM), and in the UL by enabling more precise resource
    allocation using sub-PRB granularity, as stated in [89]. To reduce power consumption,
    several possible enhancements could help including the implementation of EDT,
    sub-PRB resource allocation, WUSs, novel synchronization signals, improved HARQ
    feedback, and less stringent measurements for cell reselection [81], [88], [90].
    Rel. 15 offered even further enhancements of increased spectral efficiency, latency
    improvement, and lower power class. In Rel. 16, 5G integration has been realized
    to share 5G capabilities, CE for non-bandwidth reduced low complexity, standalone
    development, and mobility improvements. Rel. 17 [91], [92] introduced a maximum
    DL TBS of 1736 bits, 14 HARQ processes, and traffic management capabilities. In
    each release, enhancements in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient
    solutions have been integrated. Download : Download high-res image (465KB) Download

    [44] 5.3. NB-IoT The NB-IoT is a promising technology for the massive IoT specifically
    designed for low data-rate applications [14]. Improving the design of the UL/DL
    Rx to function effectively in situations where the signal-to-noise ratio is extremely
    low is pivotal [96]. The latency is enhanced between 1.6 and 10 s [97] with a
    maximum of one or two HARQ techniques. The maximum TBS in Rel. 14 was enhanced
    to 2536 b in the DL and UL by applying the HARQ process [65]. The NB-IoT has three
    deployment options and can be deployed inside an LTE carrier (in-band in 3, 5,
    10, 15, and 20 MHz LTE bandwidths), in its guard-band (in 10 MHz LTE carriers),
    or its own designated spectrum (standalone, 200 kHz in the GSM band) [65], [98],
    [99], [100]. When a guardband is applied, NB-IoT devices transmit data with great
    performance and efficiency while avoiding interfering with regular voice or data
    traffic on cellular networks. It can be considered a new radio access technology
    that is different from EC-GSM-IoT and LTE-M with no backward compatibility [101].
    In Rel. 14, it was intended to optimize the battery efficiency for up to 35 years
    with extended coverage of 164 dB [27] with transmission repetitions, power boosting,
    software modifications enhancing transport layer protocols [102], low complexity,
    support for a massive number of devices, improved power efficiency, and 10 s or
    less latency with positioning and multicast features [103]. The ITU and 3GPP’s
    mMTC performance criteria are further met by NB-IoT Rel. 15 (2018), which can
    fulfill 5G IoT requirements. It provides IoT connectivity with high data rates
    and reliable communication, boosting the 5G capacity while increasing IoT connectivity
    [104]. These requirements comprise high-performance and low-complexity features
    with an improved spectral efficiency and data rate [8]. Recently, 6G IoT has been
    studied extensively regarding the convergence of the 6G and IoT on five key domains:
    healthcare IoT, vehicular IoT and autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), satellite IoT, and IIoT [105] in which 3GPP must work on the CIoT to support
    these stringent requirements. CIoT is also envisioned to support monitoring real-time
    applications in UAVs under the circumstances of Age of Information (AoI) handling
    status. As shown in Table 6, the same way as LTE-M, in each release; enhancements
    in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient solutions are recorded.
    As shown in Fig. 6, enhancements made available in each release including low
    device power consumption, higher density, improved indoor coverage, reduced complexity,
    ultra-low device cost, optimized network architecture, cell reselection in the
    idle state, and Cat-NB1; power consumption and latency reduction (DL and UL for
    2 HARQ processes and larger maximum TBS), new power class of 14 dBm, Cat-NB2,
    multicast, higher data rate, location and positioning protocol OTDOA, non-anchor
    PRB enhancements, mobility, and service continuity enhancements; improved latency,
    improved power consumption(WUS, EDT), improved cell range, support TDD, higher
    spectral efficiency, improved load control, enhance cell acquisition, D2D communication;
    reduced control-signaling overhead, coexistence with NR, better UE energy efficiency,
    scheduling enhancement, better UL or DL transmission efficiency, improved multi-carrier
    operation, 2-step PRACH; enabling data transmission in RRC inactive mode, intra-UE
    multiplexing, positioning enhancement targeting factory automation, extend peak
    data rate, time synchronization enhancements, 2-HARQ process enhancement, CSI
    enhancements in the subsequent releases. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat. NB2 has developed
    with lower device cost and supports a massive number of IoT devices 8̃0,000 in
    an urban environment. In resolving energy-consumption problems, they employed
    solutions including PSM, I-eDRX, C-DRX, and cell reselection in addition to the
    eDRX. In Rel. 15 [95], 3GPP introduced the RRC-connected inactive state, which
    can benefit low data transmission optimization for devices operating for a short
    period. It is because of the substantial battery consumption, high demand for
    specialized resources, and high measurement reports and handovers, keeping the
    device in the RRC-connected state without active data transfer is not financially
    advantageous. The NB-IoT shortens the network monitoring duration for UE in idle
    mode, reduces the unnecessary startup of receiving cells, and reduces power consumption.
    Furthermore, Rel. 15 introduced the following energy efficiency solutions, as
    illustrated in Table 6. Wake-up signaling for IDLE mode (FDD) is served in an
    energy efficiency solution, reducing energy consumption. In communications, UE
    must frequently determine whether a paging message is from the core network when
    in DRX or eDRX. When paging is available, the UE mostly does not receive a message,
    and power is saved. With this capability, the BS can advise the UE to watch the
    narrowband physical DL control channel for paging by sending it an NB-IoT WUS
    (NWUS) introduced in Rel. 15 [106] to enhance the device energy efficiency, but
    otherwise, the UE is free to ignore the paging operations. NWUS enables the UE
    to potentially keep some of its hardware off for longer periods while saving the
    energy required to decode the narrowband physical DL control channel and shared
    channel for paging. The time the network allows the UE to “wake up” after receiving
    an NWUS determines whether the UE can maintain only one Rx switched on for WUS
    detection, leaving most of the UE conventional hardware in a very low-power state.
    The other viable solution is scheduling requests, included in the Rel. 13 and
    Rel. 14 NB-IoT as a higher-layer procedure that causes a random-access process
    to request enough UL resources to send a buffer status report. In addition, Rel.
    15 has provided new, more resource and power-effective methods to accomplish this
    goal that the BS can configure, the EDT. The EDT is an idle mode with a bitrate
    of 328 to 1000 bits. For example, UE can send data in msg 3 of the random-access
    procedure [107]. The random-access operation ends if a BS successfully receives
    a signal and the UE does not switch to connected mode. If the UE waiting data
    are less than the maximum permissible size established by the BS, the UE requests
    a grant for EDT by transmitting its preamble using a preconfigured set of narrowband
    physical random-access channel resources. To save energy on transmitting padding
    bits, the BS can authorize the UE to transmit fewer data than the maximum allowed
    size [106]. Due to minimizing the signaling overhead and message latency, the
    battery life is prolonged [19]. 5.4. RedCap The RedCap approach was created to
    address use cases (IIoT, video surveillance, and wearables) in IoT requirements
    that cannot be met using the EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, or LTE-M [44], [108] operating
    at a higher data rate and reliability with lower latency than LTE-M and the NB-IoT.
    It offers a lower cost, lower complexity, and longer battery life than NR eMBB
    and wider coverage than URLLC. Some requirements often necessitate higher reliability
    and quicker response time than those offered by LTE-M and the NB-IoT, while still
    maintaining lower complexity and expenses, as well as longer battery life compared
    to eMBB and URLLC services. The RedCap interface is designed to bridge the gap
    between the intricate and expensive 5G-NR interface that caters to eMBB and URLLC
    services and the lower data rates and increased latency of NB-IoT and LTE-M interfaces
    that support mMTC services. Under the study item “Low complexity NR devices” [67],
    in June 2019, 3GPP introduced RedCap NR devices in Rel. 17 with lower cost, lower
    complexity, and longer battery life compared to regular NR devices. In addition,
    RedCap was introduced to meet the low-cost, large-bandwidth, medium data rate,
    and no latency no delay tolerance IoT service requirements [31]. Hence, RedCap
    inherits the majority of the key advantages of NR. These include the ability to
    connect to the 5G core network, which is a cloud-based platform with a service-based
    architecture, support for a very broad range of frequency bands (FR1 and FR2 and
    millimeter-wave bands), network energy efficiency due to the ultra-flexible design,
    forward-compatible and beam-based air interfaces, and support for millimeter-wave
    bands [30]. As depicted in Fig. 7, enhancements have been incorporated in each
    release of RedCap. The applications use cases that are targeted include wearables,
    medical sensors, remote surgery, industrial sensors, surveillance cameras, and
    others. Rel. 17 of RedCap offers a multitude of enhancements that make it a cutting-edge
    solution for IoT applications. One of the most notable features is its ability
    to provide slicing capabilities, creating virtual networks within a single physical
    network, increasing network efficiency, and ensuring optimal resource utilization
    [67]. The positioning component of Rel. 17 has also been improved, providing more
    accurate location-based services and enabling new location-based applications.
    Furthermore, this release boasts a large capacity for storing and processing data,
    making it ideal for handling large volumes of IoT data. The UE energy-efficient
    operation component ensures that the end-user experience is optimized for energy
    efficiency, reducing the overall carbon footprint of IoT devices [30]. In addition,
    Rel. 17 is highly cost-effective and offers low latency, making it an attractive
    solution for a wide range of IoT applications and budgets [109]. In Fig. 7, one
    of the key advancements in Rel. 18 is supporting higher transmission rates, providing
    faster data transfer, and enabling new applications that require higher bandwidth.
    Another major improvement is the support for the unlicensed spectrum, which expands
    the available spectrum for IoT devices and enables new use cases. Advanced positioning
    technology has also been incorporated, further improving location-based services
    and enabling new location-based applications [29]. Integrating side-link near-field
    communications allows for direct communication between devices, providing a new
    level of convenience and enabling new use cases. In addition, it takes steps to
    reduce the complexity of RedCap UE further, making it even more user-friendly
    and accessible. Finally, the addition of device-to-device (D2D) communication
    expands the communication options for IoT devices, making it easier to connect
    and communicate with other devices in a local network. These enhancements and
    new features make Rel. 18 of RedCap CIoT necessary for anyone aiming to remain
    at the forefront of IoT technology. RedCap has unique features incorporated with
    5G NR services and was objectively designed to maintain lower complexity devices
    with 20 or 100 MHz maximum bandwidth in sub-7 or millimeter-wave with one or two
    Rx antennae. Additionally, 3GPP introduced this standard [61] due to RedCap’s
    ability to coexist with URLLC features, use higher frequency bands, and apply
    other 5G features, such as network slicing. For instance, RedCap is designed to
    provide significantly faster data rates than previous CIoT technology compared
    to the data rate specified in Rel. 17 using a higher frequency band, multiple-input
    multiple-output technology, advanced modulation techniques, advanced beamforming
    features, and network slicing. Use cases for RedCap are less battery-life-intensive
    than mMTC use cases, but they are more demanding for throughput and latency. However,
    a higher data rate of up to 100 Mbps is required to accommodate live video feed,
    visual production, and process automation [30]. This approach enables new use
    cases and applications that were previously impossible [9]. In addition to the
    transmission rate, in machine-to-machine collaboration and real-time remote control,
    ultra-low communication latency is expected at around 1 ms. Communication latency
    can be raised from the physical layer latency and scheduling latency problems
    [112]. However, for the time being, in the higher requirement scenario, it is
    possible to achieve a latency of 10 to 30 ms to support applications like remote
    drone operation, cooperative farm machinery, time-critical sensing and feedback,
    and remote vehicle operations. Higher communication reliability in mission and
    time-critical applications, for example, autonomous vehicles, remote surgery,
    and smart factories, is not an option to compromise but should be kept stable
    [9]. In IIoT, data transmission security is the top demand to make sensitive information
    extremely secure and highly available on demand. For Rel. 17 RedCap features [111],
    3GPP also added extra features in future Rel. 18 work, depicted in Fig. 7. Download

    [31], [109], [110], [111] Furthermore, localization or positioning increases network
    complexity, potential overhead, and accuracy degradation and can include power,
    time, and space domain localization [66]. Positioning or localization in the MTC
    has become difficult due to the complication of environments, sensor errors, and
    device motions, as Le et al. [24] investigated. Supporting location-based service
    applications is crucial for some IoT applications, such as tracking items. Although
    a smaller BS density has an advantage in the IoT scenario, a higher BS density
    is an important factor in localization with small BSs. In addition to environment
    complexity, other problems in positioning are end device-related errors, environment-related
    errors, BS-related errors, and data-related errors [24]. Hence, positioning accuracy
    can be supported by different mechanisms, including received signal strength (RSS),
    time difference of arrival [24], and channel-state information [113]. Regarding
    the D2D Protocol, communication between devices, such as wearables, that can directly
    communicate with nearby smartphones or connected vehicles is supported by RedCap
    [114]. It is enabled via sideline communication over a shared RF channel in which
    the cellular BS provides a synchronization signal that enables direct D2D communication,
    which can also improve communication efficiency, reduce latency, and extend network
    coverage and capacity. Most importantly, RedCap supports the Unlicensed Spectrum.
    In 3GPP’s EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, there is no support for sub-GHz license-free
    frequency bands (unlicensed spectrum). There have been efforts, such as MulteFire
    Alliance [115] that have been working on expanding IoT services with LPWAN support
    in the 800/900 MHz band (902 to 928 MHz band in the United States and 863 to 870
    MHz band in the European Union) with NB-IoT unlicensed and 2.4 GHz with extended
    MTC unlicensed. RedCap uses unlicensed spectrum bands under both licensed and
    unlicensed standards and regulatory requirements to address spectrum scarcity
    issues. Due to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming
    manifested in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require
    low latency, ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. RedCap
    contributes to services that require more capabilities than the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    and NB-IoT but are lower than URLLC and eMBB machines including process monitoring
    (pressure sensors, humidity sensors, and thermometers), self-diagnosis and maintenance
    (motion sensors, accelerometers, and actuators), and video-assisted applications
    (asset monitoring and augmented reality) [108]. According to TR 22.832, TS 22.104,
    and TR 22.804, [110] as summarized in Table 7, reference use cases and requirements
    are as follows. End-to-end latency is less than 100 ms, and communication services
    are 99.99% available. For all usage situations, the reference bit rate is less
    than 2 Mbps, and the device is immobile. This reference bit rate may be asymmetric,
    such as in high UL traffic [111]. At least a couple of years should pass between
    charges. Safety-related sensors, such as smart factories, require less delay (5
    to 10 ms). Generally, time-critical sensing and feedback, augmented reality, safety-related
    sensors, and remote drone operations are applications in industrial sensors. For
    instance, the goal of the smart grid is to create a more sustainable and efficient-energy
    infrastructure that can meet the needs of an increasingly connected and energy-intensive
    world. In IIoT, a specific application known as the power IoT focuses on smart
    grids to attain automatic optimized data collection and exchange of information,
    as well as smart energy management [116]. 6. Focuses of CIoT technologies One
    of the focuses of the CIoT is to provide extended coverage in areas where traditional
    cellular networks may not reach, including indoor and underground locations and
    remote or rural areas. This reach is achieved using a narrowband frequency for
    better signal penetration and greater range. Another key role of the CIoT is to
    offer efficient and cost-effective connectivity for a broad scope of IoT applications,
    from smart cities and homes to agriculture, transportation, and healthcare. With
    its low-power consumption and ability to facilitate numerous connected devices,
    the CIoT enables a broad range of use cases, including asset tracking, remote
    monitoring, and sensor networks [38]. For instance, international roaming can
    be considered one important focus of the EC-GSM-IoT, minimizing device complexity
    and cost. Because the EC-GSM-IoT has coexisted with 2G mobile networks, it has
    benefited significantly from all the security and privacy features provided by
    mobile networks including various measures to ensure user confidentiality and
    privacy, such as the protection of user identity, authentication protocols, data
    encryption to ensure confidentiality, measures to maintain data integrity, and
    identification of mobile equipment [73]. LTE-M, on the other hand, targets medium-sized
    IoT applications supporting voice and video services. Therefore, it is a better
    candidate technology for over-the-air firmware updates during the life span of
    IoT devices [26]. Unlike the NB-IoT, LTE-M is better suited for mobile devices
    to avoid connection and data loss and provides higher data rates that would enable
    more use cases, such as VoLTE vehicles, fleet management, tracking devices, and
    related use cases [117]. Moreover, LTE-M can be used in video surveillance systems
    because it supports higher data rates and can transmit real-time video data. In
    addition, the NB-IoT is primarily designed for ultralow-end and latency insensitive
    or delay tolerant IoT applications [68]. It focuses on fixed indoor coverage in
    areas where signal loss and multitiered layers have posed problems. NB1 UE, for
    example, operates only in the 200 kHz bandwidth with IoT devices imposing ultralow
    complexity for services without strict data rate, latency, or mobility requirements
    but that requires a massive deployment of low-cost devices [65]. Lastly, according
    to 3GPP and Ericsson [44], [51], RedCap has many use cases and is highly necessary
    to work in extremely harsh environments. RedCap was introduced with lower hardware
    complexity at more affordable prices. It aims for terrestrial coverage and targets
    exchanging data over the satellite with the aim of ubiquitous coverage area (referred
    to as NTN communication) [109]. It is possible to run a RedCap device on an NR
    carrier optimized for eMBB or time-critical communications. The objective of the
    study group on the NR-RedCap has been emphasizing reduced UE complexity, such
    as a reduced number of antennae, reduced UE bandwidth, HD-FDD, and other aspects.
    Compared to high-end eMBB and URLLC devices of Rel. 15/16, the primary driving
    force of the new device type is to reduce device cost and complexity, which is
    true for industrial sensors [109]. The standard must allow for a device design
    with a compact form factor to support most use cases, and all FR1/FR2 bands for
    FDD and time division duplex should be supported by the system [110]. As shown
    in Table 7, video cameras, for instance, lead to higher data-rate requirements
    than can be satisfied by the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT. Smart cities, smart
    farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly installed
    surveillance cameras. According to TR 22.804, a reference economic video bitrate
    would be 2 to 4 Mbps with a latency of 500 ms or less and a reliability of 99%
    to 99.9% [110]. High-quality video, for example, for farming, would require 7.5
    to 25 Mbps [30]. As explained in [3], reference bitrates for smart wearable applications
    can range from 5 to 50 Mbps in the DL and 2 to 5 Mbps in the UL. The device’s
    peak bit rates can reach 150 Mbps in the DL and 50 Mbps in the UL [30]. The battery
    should last one to two weeks for wearables, as reviewed in Fig. 7. Rel. 17 for
    RedCap devices introduced power-saving techniques to extend battery life and enable
    longer usage times. These are; eDRX for RRC idle and inactive states and RRM relaxation
    for stationary devices. In eDRX, when DRX cycles are utilized, it can achieve
    up to 10 485.76 s, almost 3 h when the RRC is idle, and up to 10.24 s when the
    RRC is inactive. In demanding RedCap use cases, such as industrial wireless sensors,
    eDRX proves to be a valuable solution in meeting the battery lifetime requirements.
    Regarding the RRM relaxation, in RRC idle and inactive states, the device is required
    to regularly conduct RRM measurements. These measurements are necessary to determine
    and select the best available cell for the device to establish a connection. In
    spite of this, the battery will be depleted even if there is no active data transmission.
    Thus, skip performing RRM measurements under certain thresholds of reference signal
    received power (RSRP) and reference signal received quality (RSRQ) values are
    employed [30]. In addition, the other optional power-saving features, standardized
    in Rel 15 and Rel. 16, are also made available for RedCap devices which offer
    power-saving capabilities to enhance the battery performance. Because of the fast-growing
    need for personal care devices and diagnostics, such as sports, healthcare, and
    fitness devices, wearables have garnered more attention. Devices that are too
    small in size, such as smartwatches, rings, e-health-related devices, and medical
    monitoring devices, are supported by RedCap, which can collect and relay health
    information. The CIoT plays an immense role in healthcare, and healthcare IoT
    (HIoT) is developed and supported by AI, big data, software-defined networks,
    and blockchains [118] with the driving technology; the Internet of Nano Things
    and tactile Internet. The HIoT is implemented in the form of wrist-worn smart
    wearables [119]. As with other IoT application requirements, HIoT prompts low
    latency that can be obtained through edge computing implementation using a large
    volume of data through cloud and edge computing. As most medical applications
    are private, the blockchain has been a solution to secure patient data from third-party
    access risks [120]. In healthcare-based medical operations, it is highly recommended
    to securely transmit sensitive healthcare data to the fog and cloud for processing.
    Ullah et al. [121] recommended fog and cloud-assisted computing as the appropriate
    candidate solutions for these issues. RedCap has an immense role in remote surgery
    applications by integrating wearables, medical sensors, industrial sensors incorporating
    surveillance cameras, and more. For more, we briefly present their detailed features
    in the following sections. 7. Features of CIoT technologies To guarantee that
    CIoT technologies can efficiently provide connectivity solutions for various use
    cases ranging from Massive IoT to Critical IoT, this section outlines essential
    requirements that must be met for the large-scale deployment of these services.
    These include extended coverage areas, low deployment costs, extended battery
    life, affordable device costs, support for a vast number of connected devices
    (scalability), and robust security and privacy measures, we discuss in detail
    as follows. Wide Coverage: Delivering a wider and more extended coverage area
    is one of the main aims of the CIoT. In a wide coverage area, the path range is
    an important parameter that varies inversely with frequency, offering tens of
    kilometers of coverage. Carrier frequency has a significant effect on CE. Although
    the path loss is directly dependent on the size of the carrier frequency, if the
    carrier frequency is high, the propagation loss becomes high. Maintaining a lower
    carrier frequency is important to maximize the coverage in the CIoT to lessen
    propagation loss. For instance, the EC-GSM-IoT is based on the GSM; thus, the
    frequency band of the GSM is highly globally deployed with the four known global
    frequency bands 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz, where coverage is ultimately enhanced
    [73]. Ericsson, Orange, and Intel have tried extending coverage on smart agriculture
    use cases using the EC-GSM-IoT, confirming that it is possible to enhance indoor
    coverage by deploying new software on the existing cellular networks [122]. Moreover,
    CE techniques should be implemented to achieve a wide or deep coverage area (it
    is primarily accomplished by sacrificing the data rate for coverage), which is
    required for two reasons. Implementing reduction techniques in device complexity
    (e.g., minimizing to a single-antenna Rx and lower maximum transmission power)
    may result in performance degradation that directly produces coverage loss. The
    loss of coverage can be maintained by scaling transport block size (TBS), HARQ
    re-transmissions for the physical DL shared channel (PDSCH), PUSCH, physical UL
    control channel (PUCCH), and PDCCH [9], [67]. Second, some CIoT devices could
    encounter extremely difficult coverage circumstances. Hence, transmission time
    interval bundling, sending a limited, predefined number of transmissions without
    feedback instead of sending a block of transmissions once, and narrowband retuning
    are key feature techniques to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. In widening
    the coverage, the objective is to attain a CE of 15 dB compared to GSM and LTE
    [123]. The 3GPP measures CE using the MCL standard, which is the discrepancy between
    the power levels transmitted and received before the signal is lost. Coverage
    can be measured as “kilometers of coverage” but according to the analysis presented
    in [124], it is not adequate since it heavily relies on the carrier frequency
    and environmental factors such as the type of location, whether it is indoors,
    outdoors, urban, suburban, or rural. In contrast, MCL is an appropriate measure
    because it is not influenced by the frequency and environmental aspects. At extreme
    coverage, it is expected to attain 20 dB from the normal LTE or GSM coverage,
    and it is very important to determine exactly how much coverage the CIoTs can
    provide. Apparently, for evaluation, Ericsson, AT and T, KT, SK Telecom by Korea,
    Nokia, Verizon, Altair, Docomo, Sony, SoftBank, TELKOMSEL by Telecom Indonesia,
    Virtuosys, Sequans Communications, KDDI, and Orange conducted a thorough link-level
    simulation inspection to assess the actual coverage performance of 3GPP’s LTE-M
    technology. Their findings discovered that LTE-M is capable of achieving a coverage
    gain of 21 dB compared to older LTE devices, which is higher than the 3GPP target
    of 18 dB. This increase of 21 dB corresponds to a data rate of 1400 bps in the
    DL and 250 bps in the UL. If IoT applications can tolerate slower data rates and
    longer acquisition times, it is possible to achieve a coverage gain beyond 21
    dB without using the BS power spectral density (PSD) boosting [124]. With a 21-dB
    gain with 23 dBm UE (the maximum coverage) and less conservative noise figures,
    LTE-M is a strong competitor for IoT applications that require extensive coverage,
    with a maximum MCL of 164 dB, and where the demands for low latency, high mobility,
    and fast data transfer are less stringent. Moreover, LTE-M has two specifications
    in its CE strategy: Modes A and B. The former mode is mandatory and supports only
    moderate CE, whereas the latter mode, B, supports deep and extended coverage that
    can be considered optional. Common coverage techniques are employed to provide
    CE for the LTE-M specification. The Tx power (e.g., Class 3 power amplifier 23
    dBm and Class 5 power amplifier 20 dBm) is increased by considering the increasing
    cost management, repetition by optimizing accurate channel estimations, and frequency
    tracking to manage the downside of repetition in linearly increasing the latency.
    In addition, PSD boosting improves the DL coverage and reduces the power by employing
    a maximum amount of PSD boosting to 4 dB. These methods are the most feasible
    in CE, as illustrated in [124]. In B5G CIoT [125], a programmable metasurface
    can significantly improve coverage with an intelligent reflecting surface. Through
    the IoT non terrestrial network (NTN) work item in Rel. 17 [91], 3GPP has already
    addressed NTN support for LTE-M and the NB-IoT [114]. Overall, LTE-M can support
    extensive IoT deployments, covering the maximum distance and beyond with the approved
    QoS and minimum maintenance provisions. From the 3GPP standard specification,
    the range of the NB-IoT covers urban and rural areas, outlined as 1 to 2 and 10
    to 15 km, respectively [126], enabling better signal propagation in basements
    (aiming for 20 dB improvement over legacy cellular systems) [127]. A transmission
    time interval bundling, repetition (retransmission, such as 128 and 2,048 times
    in the UL and DL, respectively [89]), and narrowband retuning are employed as
    key features to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. The number of repetitions
    of a transmission is determined by the desired CE level (CEL) for a given set
    of devices. The CEL is the signal strength at a particular location and can be
    influenced by the distance between the Tx and Rx, the transmit power, the Rx sensitivity,
    and interference. The number of tones and sub-carrier spacing, which are the number
    of different frequency components used to transmit data and the distance in frequency
    between adjacent sub-carriers, respectively, also affect the CEL and spectral
    efficiency of a wireless communication system [22]. The increased number of retransmissions
    lowers the spectral efficiency [128], which requires reducing the number of retransmissions.
    However, three CELs are supported by NB-IoT devices: CEL-0 for 0 dB with an MCL
    of 144 dB with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, CEL-1 for 10 dB with an MCL of
    154 dB with 15 kHz spacing, and CEL-2 for 20 dB with an MCL of 164 dB with 3.75
    kHz carrier spacing [79]. In the CE of the NB-IoT, the objective is to attain
    a coverage capacity of 164 dB [123], [129] and guarantee that it can enhance the
    164-dB coverage achieved through repetitions in time, with power amplification
    in in-band and guard-band operation modes [65]. In general, this is preserved
    by implementing repetition, boosting the PSD, reducing the system acquisition
    time, and random-access range enhancement. Based on the findings in [21], the
    coverage of NB-IoT [882 MHz] can be boosted by up to 398% with a mere 10% enhancement
    in Rx sensitivity. Enhancing the coverage by implementing machine learning methods
    using reinforcement learning-based dynamic spectrum access [130] is also feasible.
    The NB-IoT increases the link budget by over 20 dB, significantly enhancing penetration.
    Although reducing the device capabilities can lower the device cost and reduce
    the device size, it has an adverse influence on coverage. For instance, in RedCap,
    reducing the number of antennae and limiting the number of spectrum bands can
    affect device coverage. It is vital to secure the device cost and lower complexity
    simultaneously to enhance the coverage. In RedCap, it is expected to extend 10
    to 15 dB compared to URLLC. Low Power Consumption: Most IoT devices are powered
    by batteries. Therefore, conserving energy to extend their lifespan is vital.
    It is exceptionally demanding to reserve the main power supply by implementing
    longevity in the battery life of the device before recharging is mandated. Devices
    that support lower power consumption have a longer device battery life. In many
    use cases, the CIoTs are supposed to achieve a battery life of up to 10 years.
    The battery usage directly relates to how long the device spends sending and receiving
    data. As research [58] has noted, to maintain a battery life of 5 years, for example,
    a device with a 5000 mAh battery capacity should use no more than 2.74 mAh per
    day. This limit can be achieved by restricting daily battery consumption to below
    5000 mAh/5/365 [58]. Achieving long battery life and reducing maintenance costs
    are critical in applications and equipment with limited battery capacity, which
    makes low energy consumption essential. However, the battery life depends on coverage
    [131]. The objective of 3GPP standards for battery life in the CIoT is to achieve
    10 years of service life in most extreme coverage situations at 164 dB MCL [47]
    (11.9 years is achievable) and 35.7 years at normal coverage (144 dB MCL) [84].
    This feature can also save costs in areas where replacing batteries can be a challenging
    task, such as basements or subterranean tunnels. In minimizing power consumption,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT utilize techniques including the power-saving mode
    (PSM) [132], [133], [134], long periodic tracking area updates (TAU), and eDRX
    which are developed by the 3GPP standards to reduce energy consumption and enable
    an extended life for these devices [80]. The PSM allows modules to enter a sleep
    mode that consumes very little energy (only a few microamps) while sending TAU
    messages at long intervals to remain registered on the network. This approach
    eliminates the need for reregistration when the module wakes. The eDRX feature
    allows devices to enter a low-power paging mode for an extended period of time,
    during which they can receive data from the server but do not need to send data,
    saving power when the device does not need to transmit. In eDRX, an extension
    of 52 min is possible. The PSM can use paging in the DRX or jointly use paging
    and routing area updates (via incoming SMS, voice call, or data) to reach the
    CIoT devices on the network. For devices that prefer a lower periodicity of reachability,
    using eDRX is more advantageous; however, for devices that can tolerate longer
    intervals of inaccessibility, the PSM emerges as an appealing alternative. Furthermore,
    implementing GMSK modulation in the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, influences power
    and energy efficiency. The enhanced coverage common control channel (eCCCH)can
    also contribute to energy efficiency, providing long battery life. Other energy-saving
    techniques besides PSM and eDRX have been developed and employed, such as energy-efficient
    TAU, user and control plane optimizations, energy-efficient paging reception,
    wake-up signal (WUS) calls, and techniques for monitoring cells less frequently.
    Furthermore, RedCap power consumption is anticipated to be significantly (2 to
    4 times) lower than that of Rel. 16 eMBB, resulting in minimized power usage.
    The battery life is expected to span 1 to 3 years. In Rel. 17, 3GPP suggested
    improvements for UE power conservation in the idle or inactive mode while considering
    system performance factors to address the power consumption problem. They studied
    and specified improvements to power-saving methods for connected UE, with the
    least possible influence on system performance [3]. Based on power-saving techniques
    proposed in Rel. 17 for RedCap devices, in the idle and inactive state, eDRX cycles
    are almost 3 h and 10.24 s, respectively. This approach better extends the battery
    life [67] in the stringent use case of industrial wireless sensors, for example.
    In addition to eDRX, the relaxation of frequent radio resource management (RRM)
    to secure the exact camping in its idle and inactive state can avoid the drainage
    of batteries, primarily in stationary devices. In general, potential power consumption-saving
    techniques include reducing the duration the device spends checking the control
    channel for scheduling, lengthening the device sleep time by extending the DRX
    period, and allowing for less frequent measurements for stationary devices. In
    the long run, a very high energy-efficiency technology is expected, supporting
    battery-free IoT devices, such as self-driving cars, drones, and auto-robots [135].
    The most important area of research in the IoT is energy efficiency, especially
    in IIoT, to preserve moderate power consumption [136]. According to [28], energy-saving
    methods can be maintained in three ways: configurations (including traffic models,
    connectivity periods, and DRX cycles), software modification (comprising improved
    radio layer protocols, changes have been made to the scheduling request procedures
    for accessing radio channel resources, as well as the introduction of new software
    entities in the core network to improve communication in both the UL and DL directions),
    and hardware integration (embedding a low-power Rx by deactivating the main Rx).
    In [137], energy efficiency or low power consumption can be achieved by eliminating
    transmission between nodes using the star topology, maintaining a straightforward
    node design, and using narrowband channels for reduced noise and an extended transmission
    range. Based on [138], the joint optimization of user selection, power allocation,
    and antenna selection while fulfilling the QoS requirements has a prior role in
    maximizing energy efficiency under imperfect channel state information. In most
    IoT devices, the channel state information is imperfect due to the functional
    limitations and mobility, as stated in [139]. In addition, an advanced energy-harvesting
    technique called simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is another
    promising solution to achieve energy-efficient green communication. Chen et al.
    developed a two-layer iterative algorithm to manage inter- and intra-beam interferences
    by leveraging the Dinkelbach method [140] for energy maximizing by allocating
    power at the base station and splitting power at each IoT node. The other promising
    solution is HARQ feedback. Transmitting a positive HARQ-ACK over MPDCCH in a UL
    data center interconnect is now possible [141]. This approach enables early termination
    of the UL (PUSCH) transmission or early termination of the DL (MPDCCH) monitoring
    (for FD-FDD or time division duplex but not HD-FDD). It allows the BS to notify
    the UE that UL data have been successfully received using two HARQ processes and
    10 HARQ processes with a beneficial effect. In addition, cell reselection with
    relaxed monitoring is a good option. When enabled, the UE can reduce neighbor
    cell measurements to once every 24 h [25]. This approach can significantly lower
    power usage, especially for fixed UE in difficult coverage situations. Moreover,
    resynchronization signal (RSS) better improves energy economy when a device needs
    to regain synchronization with a cell’s time and frequency [5]. Researchers from
    academics and industry have been studying solutions and techniques to address
    power consumption issues, including energy harvesting [142], [143], [144], sporadic
    transmission, resource allocation, clustering, zonal thermal pattern analysis
    for smart agriculture, and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring system
    for smart health applications [14]. In [145], RF energy harvesting on the strength
    of RF signals was cheaper to implement and available in difficult-to-reach places
    where other popular sources, such as solar or wind, may not be accessible. Moreover,
    accurate computation and efficient communication are critical for numerous devices
    to reduce power usage. Developing communication systems that are energy-efficient,
    both in terms of system design and hardware is vital to mitigate power problems
    [146]. Over-the-air computation was proposed as a promising solution [147]. In
    [148], energy-harvesting strategies for operating low-power network devices using
    long-lasting IoT devices and sensors were studied, enabling them to be self-powered
    and providing devices with long standby intervals. Network parameter settings
    affect energy consumption and network performance, and [149] found that the paging
    interval set by the BS has the greatest effect on energy consumption when the
    device is connected. Low Cost: In the CIoT, installing or maintaining local networks
    or gateways is unnecessary. The sensor can connect directly to the desired system
    or network, which maintains the cost [27]. Maintaining low power consumption facilitates
    low device costs, which can be achieved by reducing Tx and Rx bandwidths. Current
    costs run between $10 and $15 per module, with a long-term goal of reaching $5.
    The GSM, for instance, is the main player in machine-to-machine communications
    because of its reduced cost compared to other technology. As a result of the expiration
    of the device module patents in GSM networks, compared to other 3GPP-defined technology,
    the cost of the EC-GSM-IoT module is the most economical in developing countries
    [27], [52], less than $10, where 2G, 3G are deployed. The EC-GSM-IoT module cost
    is $5.5 and $2.9 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151], respectively. It is because of
    the overall cost of deployment, network coverage (which can balance the economy
    of vendors, particularly in the Asian and African continents), maturity (the presence
    of a more mature ecosystem comprising a wide range of compatible devices, and
    applications), lower complexity, and lower frequency band specificity. The other
    player in achieving ultralow-cost devices is the implementation of a GMSK-only
    modulation. Moreover, for cost reduction, according to the analysis of [152],
    the trend reveals a 10-times reduction in 1G and 2G, respectively, and a 1000-times
    reduction from 3G to 6G. In contrast, the NB-IoT has many design trade-offs to
    achieve low-cost goals, resulting in a simplified, low-complexity system with
    a lower data rate. One of these trade-offs is the lack of carrier aggregation,
    a technique that combines multiple carriers (or frequency bands) to increase the
    available data rate. Carrier aggregation requires additional hardware and processing
    resources, increasing the cost and complexity of NB-IoT devices. Similarly, NB-IoT
    does not support voice services or multi-stream transmissions in the DL/UL direction.
    These features would also require additional hardware and processing resources,
    which would be incompatible with the low-power and low-cost requirements of the
    NB-IoT. Instead, the NB-IoT provides simple, low-data-rate communication for IoT
    applications that do not require high-bandwidth or real-time services [80]. However,
    the NB-IoT can operate alongside the existing GSM and LTE networks, which can
    help lower deployment costs. The device cost is related to the complexity of baseband
    processing, memory consumption, and RF requirements. Valuable cost reductions
    can be achieved from various modifications associated with narrowband operations,
    power reduction mechanisms, and the simplification of a physical layer [14]. The
    NB-IoT module cost is achieved $4 and $2-3 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151] per module,
    respectively which is more effective in urban environments where 5G requirements
    are in hand. Regarding LTE-M devices, they could achieve a similar cost to GSM
    devices by simplifying the design of the end devices. Due to its compatibility
    with existing LTE radio systems, LTE-M can be easily deployed through a simple
    software upgrade to meet the cost optimization needs of IoT applications, building
    upon the foundation of LTE technology. Taking into consideration the market scale,
    the module cost for LTE-M is less than $10, making it an affordable option [153]
    by incorporating various optimizations to enhance efficiency and reduce complexity.
    These optimizations include incorporating half-duplex operations (i.e., less complex
    and less costly), reduced transmission mode (TM) support, minimizing the number
    of blind decodings required for control channel reception, and eliminating simultaneous
    reception. As elaborated in [150], [151], the LTE-M module cost achieved $5 in
    2016 and $3.3 in 2020. On the other hand, compared to standard NR UE, RedCap UE
    is substantially simpler due to the half-duplex operation, which means that the
    UE is not required to transmit and receive simultaneously, a smaller number of
    radio RX antenna branches (reducing the antenna configuration, can reduce the
    device size), and a smaller radio Tx bandwidth. As a result of the projected decreased
    complexity, devices are expected to be more affordable, enabling the use of NR
    in novel applications, such as industrial sensor networks [44]. In conclusion,
    these requirements are achieved through careful configurations, properly adjusting
    the traffic profile (the frequency and number of data transmitted and received
    by the UE), coverage situation (under normal, robust, and extreme coverage scenarios),
    and network settings [154]. Low Complexity: Simplified network topology and deployment
    is one component of the CIoT that the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, highly fulfills.
    It only requires software upgrades in the existing GSM networks [122]. In addition,
    by simplifying the modulation scheme used for transmitting data over the air instead
    of using more complex modulation schemes, such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation
    (QAM) or 64 QAM used in traditional GSM networks, the low-complexity mode of EC-GSM-IoT
    employs a simpler modulation scheme called GMSK. This approach reduces the complexity
    of the transceiver hardware required to implement the technology. Keeping the
    device complexity ultralow to secure a low-cost device is expected to support
    the large-scale deployment of millions of devices. Indeed, the EC-GSM-IoT technology,
    for example, is an advanced version of the EGPRS technology, which already satisfies
    the necessary requirements without any need for further complexity reduction [73].
    The goal of LTE-M, for example, was to drastically reduce the complexity and cost
    compared to the preceding LTE device categories. In addition to reducing complexity,
    LTE-M aims to handle a broad range of mMTC use cases, including demanding high-throughput
    and low-latency applications. Under the 3GPP cost reduction analysis and techniques
    [155], employing the following methods can provide remarkable complexity reductions
    in LTE-M: reduction of the maximum bandwidth (from 20 to 1.4 MHz), a single-receive
    radio frequency (RF) chain (from 2 to 1), a reduction of the peak rate (from 10
    to 1 Mbps), a reduction of transmit power (from 23 to 20, or 14 dBm), half-duplex
    instead of a full-duplex operation, and a reduction of supported DL transmission
    modes. Furthermore, securing low device complexity is required to boost the QoE
    and QoS in IoT applications. The device complexity is related to the complexity
    of baseband processing, memory consumption, and transmit-and-receive antenna (RF
    requirements). In NB-IoT, for instance, low complexity can be secured by reducing
    the TBS, accommodating only single-stream transmissions, supporting only a single
    HARQ process for both the DL and UL, adapting only one redundancy version in the
    DL, applying a low sampling rate due to lower UE bandwidth NB-IoT support, and
    allowing only HD-FDD operation [68]. Additionally, synchronization in the modulation
    and demodulation process requires higher computation. However, the NB-IoT has
    been specifically designed to facilitate low-complexity Rx processing in such
    operations. The RedCap, in addition, is also developed to be lower in complexity
    compared to the standard NR via narrowing the bandwidth, reducing the number of
    DL MIMO layers, the transmit antennas, the receive antennas, and so on. Mass Device
    Connection and Global Deployment: Massive connectivity is the key component in
    IoT applications to provide and offer the intended services to society. Mass device
    connectivity pertains to the number of devices that meet a specific QoS within
    a given area, typically measured in terms of square kilometers. As a result of
    the CIoT’s low complexity features and high demands and expectations, deploying
    a massive number of IoT devices is demanded. As concluded in [147], the present
    CIoT technology is efficient, and developing 6G CIoT is essential. Massive numbers
    of device connections are vital when expanding coverage is needed. According to
    [101], low-orbit satellites have been identified as an efficient option for delivering
    long-range IoT services with good coverage and latency by supporting numerous
    connections. Furthermore, the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication
    Sector (ITU-R) [41] has established a firm requirement for International Mobile
    Telecommunications (IMT) 2020 systems that mandates a connection density of one
    million devices per square kilometer. For instance, the GSM has been deployed
    for over 30 years. A round 50% and 25% of subscriptions are made in developing
    countries in Africa and the Middle East, respectively, according to Ericsson’s
    November 2022 report [156]. The GSM networks are widely covered and deployed worldwide,
    making connecting devices feasible, which means that the EC-GSM-IoT can be deployed
    in most regions without significant additional infrastructure. Hence, the deployment
    of the EC-GSM-IoT is feasible worldwide. It can also accommodate massive device
    connections with at least 50,000 nodes per cell [66]. 3GPP has been developed
    enhancements to support more devices per cell. For instance, optimizing resource
    allocation in IoT communication systems is critical in supporting many IoT devices.
    In [157], the authors devised a two-step optimization technique for UL transmission
    using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on deep learning. This approach
    is capable of optimizing the assignment of sub-bands and controlling transmit
    power with outcomes of low complexity, and it can accommodate a large number of
    devices. Moreover, regarding enabling numerous IoT device connections, [158] introduced
    leveraging the unlicensed spectrum in addition to exploiting the licensed spectrum.
    From the Technical Specifications Group RAN work group of TR-45.820 [32], [43],
    [159], for only one PRB (12 × 15 kHz), the NB-IoT, for example, can hold more
    than 52,500 pieces of UE per cell, in some scenarios, it also supports 72,000
    devices [160]. NB-IoT enables the connection of up to 100,000 end devices at the
    expense of complexity and cost [28], [75], [134] within single-cell, and its capacity
    can be obtained by incorporating multiple NB-IoT carriers of 200 kHz. In this
    configuration, one anchor carrier is dedicated to carrying the always-on broadcast
    signaling, while additional carriers (non-anchor carriers) are utilized for offloading
    data traffic and enhancing capacity. Moreover, enhancement objectives include
    designing positioning support (horizontal) targeting at least 50-m accuracy; extending
    the single cell point to multi-point network to support the CIoT for multicast
    DL transmissions (namely firmware or software updates and group message delivery);
    specifying new UE power classes (e.g., 14 dBm) to enable lower maximum transmit
    power suitable for small form-factor batteries, mobility, and service continuity
    enhancements; UL enhancements to reduce device power consumption further; and
    enhancements to support voice [93]. Improved Security: Given the growing importance
    of IoT devices in various industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation,
    ensuring the security of things is critical to protecting sensitive data and ensuring
    the safe operation of these devices. Every CIoT technology option necessitates
    that both the network and the mobile station employ an enhanced and strong security
    framework. They have got a significant benefit from all the security and privacy
    mobile network features comprising user identity confidentiality, authentication,
    confidentiality, data integrity, and mobile equipment identification since it
    is operating in the licensed spectrum sharing all the advantages of standards-based
    technologies. For instance, EC-GSM-IoT has an LTE-grade security to improve end
    user security for the sake of removing any security concerns. The security measures
    currently in place for GSM technology have significantly contributed to enhancing
    security in EC-GSM-IoT. These procedures involve mutual authentication of both
    the device and the network during connection establishment, employment of 64-bit
    long encryption and 128-bit ciphering algorithms for better encryption, rejection
    of incompatible networks, and protection of control plane integrity [75]. Most
    importantly, the integration of existing CIoT technologies with 5G is done. This
    integration allows for enhanced security mechanisms across the network, addressing
    issues of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for a wide range
    of interconnected IoT devices. In general, in CIoT, extending coverage, reducing
    power consumption, lowering device complexity, reducing device cost, enhancing
    massive connectivity, and enhancing positioning are the foremost required features
    to maintain during CIoT communication by all mobile network operators, organizations,
    and companies. As shown in Fig. 8, coverage extension techniques can be incorporated,
    such as repetition and bundling, direct interface side-links or relays, and reducing
    the subcarrier spacing. For example, asset tracking, fleet management, and smart
    cities all rely on accurate positioning data to function effectively and maintain
    position enhancement. Hence, observed time-difference-of-arrival positioning,
    enhanced cell-ID positioning, UL time difference of arrival positioning, location
    positioning protocol, assisted global navigation satellite systems, and centimeter-level
    positioning techniques have been integrated. Solutions for reducing power consumption
    include lowering the transmit power by introducing new classes of UE, enhancing
    power-saving modes (PSM, eDRX, and WUS), and limiting mobility and handovers.
    Narrowing the bandwidth and reducing the number of DLs, multiple-input multiple-output
    layers, and Tx or Rx antennae minimize device complexity. Moreover, reducing signaling
    overhead, simplifying the core network architecture (network elements, interfaces,
    and protocols), and employing better resource management techniques can enhance
    network efficiency. Further, reducing device costs and Tx and Rx bandwidths, minimizing
    the device complexity, reusing the available spectrum and technology, and lowering
    order modulations can play a vital role in using the devices and removing marketing
    barriers. Download : Download high-res image (678KB) Download : Download full-size

    CIoT technologies CIoT technologies have a wide range of applications and can
    be used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of life in
    various industries and sectors. Table 8 presents applications better suited for
    the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap. The EC-GSM-IoT is fundamentally designed
    to offer coverage for machine-to-machine communications (direct communication
    with each other without the need for human involvement) in areas with challenging
    radio coverage conditions. However, the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. The EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap can be employed in areas of applications including; smart cities (waste
    and traffic management), smart environments (building automation; urban safety;
    and intelligent environment monitoring), smart metering (electricity, water, gas,
    and parking spot meters), asset tracking and smart logistics [154], localization,
    farming (monitoring livestock), forestry, industry pallets and pipelines [18],
    [161], and intelligent transportation (e.g., logistics services, and traveling
    time estimation) [23]. Moreover, the LTE and NB-IoT can work with the low and
    geostationary earth orbit satellites to support NTN, studied in Rel. 17 on the
    NB-IoT and LTE-M for NTN [31]. Under the IoT over NTN projects [91], for instance,
    UAVs [162] can use LTE-M to develop low-latency energy-efficient communication
    techniques and power-efficient computing modules [163] in military applications
    to track enemy locations. The feasibility of integrating the NB-IoT into the NTN
    [70] was investigated to extend the coverage in challenging environments like
    mountains, deserts, and oceans [164]. In the same objective, NR-RedCap is designed
    based on the 5G NR requirements, so its application is vital. The 5G is becoming
    prominent in the healthcare industry, automotive industry, smart cars, manufacturing
    sector, smart factories, smart grids, and smart cities [53], which substantially
    affects the IoT but has high costs and complexity issues compared to RedCap. Due
    to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming manifested
    in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require low latency,
    ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. Hence,
    these envisioned use cases have specific requirements regarding data rate, latency,
    battery life, reliability, and other factors. As of today, CIoTs are being applied
    in the following application areas. Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture is one
    of the key application scenarios in the IoT industry [165]. Via CIoTs connectivity,
    farmers and cities can capture data from environmental sensors for management.
    The reason is that they can access places that are hard to reach, such as remote
    areas where agriculture or infrastructure sensors are installed. Due to this,
    monitoring the soil temperature and humidity and tracking the existing land features,
    rain, and pollution are some of the activities farmers can perform using EC-GSM-IoT,
    LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap [24], [166]. In Africa, specifically, farmers are utilizing
    multiple interconnected sensors in their fields to identify the optimal planting
    and harvesting periods for specific crops by leveraging EC-GSM-IoT technology
    [76], [167]. LTE-M and NB-IoT have a role in smart agriculture. Moreover, RedCap
    is expected to be used in cooperative farm machinery in the near future. Minimizing
    water waste will be vital to advancing agricultural processes based on real-time
    monitoring and predictive data analytics via remote sensing [13]. Smart Grid and
    Meter: CIoT technologies play a significant role in application areas, such as
    smart metering, smart grid management with strong coverage requirements, and low
    power use scenarios (e.g., water and gas) since they can access places that are
    hard to reach, such as deep basements where smart meters are installed. They are
    well-suited for connecting many remote smart meters to a central data collection
    point, allowing utility companies to remotely monitor energy consumption and manage
    their networks more efficiently, leading to cost savings and improved customer
    service [168]. Through the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, in smart grid
    applications; electricity is efficiently transmitted and distributed, power is
    recovered rapidly after a fault occurs, maintenance costs are reduced, and security
    and protection. They can remotely control and monitor energy-consuming devices,
    such as air-conditioning and heating systems, to reduce energy consumption during
    peak demand periods [37], [169], [170], [171] with the support of numerous (more
    than 10,000 devices in a cell) smart grid devices. Indeed, a smart grid management
    system is the main operational demand for power control, enabling two-way communication
    between providers and consumers. For instance, according to the investigation
    in [171], demand–response techniques are pivotal to addressing power outage problems,
    reducing cost, and increasing reliability. Intelligent Transportation: Tracking
    and monitoring vehicles intelligently is crucial for transportation companies
    and vehicle owners. Hence, 3GPP identified the vehicle-to-everything communication
    types [33]: vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure, vehicle to pedestrian,
    and vehicle to network. In intelligent transportation, vehicle-to-vehicle communication,
    vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, autonomous/semi autonomous driving, and
    in-car infotainment systems emerged [57]. The CIoT technologies can also assist
    drivers in various ways, such as providing real-time traffic and weather information,
    route planning, and parking assistance; improving the driving experience; and
    reducing the risk of accidents. In intelligent transportation, fleet management
    applications are most in demand [172] including; monitoring fuel consumption and
    scheduling maintenance and repairs. Moreover, LTE-M is well-suited for applications
    requiring voice and data communications, such as telemetry and remote control
    systems. Hence, LTE-M is well-suited for fleet management applications because
    it supports voice and data communication and can track the location and status
    of vehicles in real-time. For transportation systems to be effective, they need
    to be quick, dependable, and adaptable. By implementing the CIoT-based Internet
    of Vehicles, drivers can receive real-time traffic updates, monitor speed limits,
    and subsequently reduce traffic congestion and accidents. In smart parking, for
    instance, data can be transmitted and received in real-time, enabling immediate
    updates to park availability and other information. The available CIoTs can improve
    efficiency, reduce parking costs, and improve the overall user experience [173].
    For some IoT use cases with stationary mobility in intelligent transportation,
    for instance, all CIoT technologies are applicable. NB-IoT, despite its limited
    mobility characteristics, can be considered applicable for smart transportation.
    The devices are often deployed in fixed locations, such as road sensors, infrastructure
    components, or stationary objects along roadways. These devices collect and transmit
    various transportation-related data including real-time tracking, traffic analysis
    (traffic conditions, environmental factors), parking space reservation (often
    involves parking in the basement), location navigation, vehicle management, and
    enable communication between vehicles [174]. Overall, using EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    NB-IoT, and RedCap for intelligent transportation systems helps reduce travel
    time, fuel consumption, and environmental effects and can improve the overall
    travel experience for passengers and drivers. Smart City: Smart cities have a
    high level of technology integration and are distinguished by the extensive use
    of information and communication methods [175]. Due to the current urbanization
    demands worldwide, the smart city concept has been extended from smart offices
    and smart homes to smart buildings. In the framework of smart cities, applications,
    such as environmental sensors, smart grids, predictive maintenance, utility meters,
    high-definition security cameras, smart parking, smart traffic management, smart
    city sensors system for irrigation, and smart street lighting are included, and
    supported by CIoT systems [153], [176], [177]. A smart city cuts costs, increases
    resource consumption efficiency, engages with inhabitants more actively during
    emergencies, and greatly reduces labor costs. Controlling street lights, assessing
    free parking spaces, monitoring environmental conditions, and inspecting road
    conditions are some of the daily administrative tasks performed by city bodies.
    Furthermore, in each layer of IoT applications (i.e., in smart cities), security
    and privacy are daily concerns for safety [178]. Noteworthy to know a smart city
    can be considered a package comprising applications, including intelligent environmental
    monitoring, intelligent transportation, smart street lighting, smart grid, smart
    metering, smart homes, and the like. These applications are demanding the use
    of deep learning-based techniques, for example, in smart lighting [24], [179]
    of smart garbage detection systems that can recognize garbage more accurately,
    reducing the necessary deployment costs and material resources. Smart Homes and
    Buildings: One of CIoT’s rapidly expanding markets is smart homes. The primary
    focus behind the smart home philosophy is preserving energy [79]. Recently, the
    CIoT has offered a powerful and flexible way to control and monitor various aspects
    of the home, providing convenience, energy reduction, and enhanced security [180].
    Various ECG-SM-IoT, LTE-m, NB-IoT, and RedCap devices can be deployed in the living
    room, kitchen, bathrooms, and other rooms. In addition, the devices can be used
    for video surveillance monitoring [177]. For example, homeowners can access remote
    lighting controls, monitor their children, and turn devices on and off while commuting
    to and from work. In emergencies, such as smoke and hazard incidents, installing
    CIoT devices in a smart home is beneficial. Examples of applications that can
    utilize these CIoT’s building penetration capability include monitoring utility
    usage (e.g., smart heat), enhancing security in residential properties, smoke
    detectors, and managing energy consumption in household appliances [24]. Smart
    Environmental Monitoring: Environmental monitoring is a wider concept comprising
    both natural and human environmental phenomena involving rural-agricultural and
    urban-city-oriented monitoring. It includes monitoring air, soil, water, traffic
    volumes, city infrastructure, and other aspects. The existing CIoT cellular network
    can provide intelligent services [181] by incorporating a wireless sensor network
    to automate data acquisition for easy data analysis. These intelligent services
    optimize resource usage, reduce waste, and increase energy efficiency by providing
    real-time data on environmental conditions [182], [183]. It can also be used for
    monitoring the location of wild animals, observing their habitats, and recognizing
    their behaviors. Furthermore, the role of the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    in intelligent environment monitoring involves public health and safety in identifying
    and mitigating possible environmental hazards and extreme weather conditions.
    Smart Tracking: Vertical industries, including transportation, logistics, and
    manufacturing, have a high demand for tracking and monitoring the location and
    movement of physical assets, such as vehicles, equipment, and inventory. Installing
    or attaching global positioning system trackers or RF identification tags onto
    assets and communicating their location and status to the central system optimizes
    operations (e.g., routes in logistics companies) by delivering real-time updates
    on the location, movement, and condition of the assets (e.g., temperature). Hence,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap are useful in tracking shipping, monitoring
    drivers and goods, and obtaining diagnostics and reports across moving operations
    in industry [153], [184], contributing to efficiency improvement, cost reduction,
    and customer service enhancement. Note that when continuous tracking is not required
    NB-IoT can be taken as a good method. In addition to enabling real-time tracking
    and monitoring, they can also provide other benefits in asset tracking systems,
    such as the ability to monitor the condition of the assets and alert maintenance
    personnel when repairs are needed, reducing downtime and improving the overall
    efficiency of the tracking system. Smart Hospitals: Healthcare is the most important
    concern in the era of smart life projects, with a high priority [177]. Wearable
    devices, such as fitness trackers or sports wearables, smartwatches, and smart
    clothing, can track and monitor location and movements and provide identification,
    authentication, data collection, and sensing, including patient vital signs, such
    as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Moreover, implantable devices,
    such as pacemakers and defibrillators, can monitor the heart, or sensors can monitor
    a segment of an organ (i.e., the lungs or kidneys). A periodic update of training
    data and message reception is possible with the NB-IoT and LTE-M in normal conditions
    [190]. Similar to LTE-M and NB-IoT, EC-GSM-IoT is also suitable for low data rate
    healthcare applications. To enhance patient outcomes and lower healthcare expenses
    through the implementation of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring systems,
    EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap are suggested for healthcare applications.
    These technologies offer swift data transfer, energy efficiency, broad communication
    coverage, dependable performance, the ability to handle large data volumes, and
    human tissue safety. Their accurate localization capabilities enable them to address
    clinical care in the hospital and remote patient care. Furthermore, they can be
    utilized to acquire medical reports at regular intervals and receive alerts triggered
    by specific events. Additionally, it enables real-time, two-way medical control
    and monitoring of health conditions through live video feeds. General applications
    in health care systems, including remote patient monitoring, medical asset tracking,
    wellness-tracking wearables, and secure data collection protecting patient data
    privacy [16], can be supported by the current CIoT technologies. Table 8. CIoT

    as well. Smart city [24], [76], [117], [167], [168], [175] ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ The EC-GSM-IoT,
    LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap can be utilized for broad smart city applications including

    play a pivotal role in tracking and monitoring assets and their states in industries
    (transportation, logistics, and manufacturing). Smart hospitals [61], [66], [167],
    [188] ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Because of their fast data transfer, optimized energy consumption,
    rapid data transfer, wide-ranging communication reach, high reliability, capacity
    to handle significant data loads, and safety for human tissue, the EC-GSM-IoT,
    NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap are recommended for healthcare applications to improve
    patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by implementing telemedicine and
    remote patient monitoring systems. Video surveillance cameras [110], [153] ✓ ✓
    LTE-M and RedCap are used for remote monitoring and surveillance applications
    in various industries, in cooperative farm machinery for example, to assist in
    monitoring crops, livestock, and so on. Industry IoT [8], [66], [111] ✓ ✓ ✓ NB-IoT,
    LTE-M, and RedCap are used in monitoring equipment status, controlling processes,
    and ensuring factory safety. Wearables [1], [189] ✓ ✓ ✓ LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    have the ability to provide assistance for wearable devices, such as smartwatches,
    which typically necessitate voice functionality, portability, and fast data transfer
    rates for connectivity to the Internet. Wearables: Devices equipped with NB-IoT
    technology enable real-time monitoring of energy consumption, enabling utilities
    to enhance energy management and improve the efficiency of health monitoring.
    Moreover, in the context of wearables, the ability to support mobility and high
    data rates is critical, as is the ability to support VoLTE. For this reason, LTE-M
    and RedCap are emerging as strong candidates for powering the next generation
    of wearable devices. In applications such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and
    medical wearables, crucial data can be extracted based on various metrics, including
    heart rate, sleep patterns, and activity levels. These real-time data are sent
    over LTE-M and RedCap networks to be analyzed by the responsible authorized individuals
    (e.g., doctors and caregivers) or organizations [118]. Importantly, LTE-M and
    RedCap support movement so that it is possible to monitor users anywhere in motion,
    such as runners, to track their well-being [189]. The utilization of wearable
    devices potentially simplifies self-care for elderly individuals, for instance.
    Hence, wearable devices equipped with NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap technology have
    the capability to track and record an individual’s physical activity, heart rate,
    body temperature, and other health-related data. Video Surveillance Cameras: Due
    to their support of high data rate and video capturing, LTE-M and RedCap are the
    candidate CIoT technologies in video surveillance camera services. Smart cities,
    smart farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly
    installed surveillance cameras. In LTE-M, for example, the Cat-M2 UE category
    supports multimedia IoT applications such as voice and video which have a maximum
    TBS of 4008 bits in the DL and 6968 bits in the UL good for video surveillance
    applications. Moreover, for high-quality video, RedCap plays a significant role.
    Industry IoT: The LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap sensors can be used in the prediction
    of machine failure in the factory. Note that the NB-IoT is not suitable for moving
    objects, so the device is assumed to be battery-powered in a fixed location in
    the factory, requiring two-way communication to upgrade the firmware and software
    [191]. It has a significant role in real-time applications and is more suitable
    for industrial systems that require real-time communication without mobility requirements.
    Even though the NB-IoT supports only up to QPSK modulation that limits its data
    rate, spectral efficient frequency division multiplexing has been proposed, which
    uses higher modulation formats; however, it has drawbacks in energy consumption.
    The authors of [192] developed a two-dimensional channel-aware adaptive modulation
    scheme that improves network performance while maintaining energy efficiency to
    solve this problem. On the other hand, LTE-M and RedCap are the prominent technologies
    for IIoTs since they support mobility and high data rates. Moreover, RedCap is
    objectively developed for such use cases including wearables and video surveillance
    cameras, which we discuss under the RedCap section in detail. 9. Future challenges
    The proposed solutions are explicitly explored as part of the CIoT use-case specifications
    by the 3GPP working group. Most requirements set by the study groups in various
    release versions have been met as promised and planned. Indeed, CIoT has gained
    attention globally due to its cost-effective, ubiquitous coverage with ease of
    deployment of massive MTC and URLLC and several feasible reasons. However, there
    are further challenges that need to be resolved. Congestion Problems: Overcrowding
    or congestion is a significant challenge in the CIoT with a very high concentration
    of devices, as there are limited resources available to handle the numerous sporadic
    access attempts made by a diverse range of MTC devices [26]. With a massive number
    of devices, an enormous number of simultaneous access requests occurs, causing
    congestion in the physical random-access channel, resulting in network access
    delays [193]. For instance, if multiple machine-type devices transmit the same
    preamble simultaneously, they cause the access requests to fail so that access
    efficiency decreases and the number of supported devices reduces. Hence, optimized
    node clustering and data aggregation have been employed as candidate solutions
    to address congestion [194]. Kim and Bang [195] proposed a random-access parallelization
    technique to support multiple preambles, enabling each IoT device to attempt multiple
    instances of random access in parallel to mitigate collisions. In addition, the
    preamble (re)transmission limit [196] is adopted in the UE MAC layer. In contrast,
    network slicing is another promising method to improve the efficiency of resource
    utilization [57], [197] by allocating resources dynamically between slices, providing
    QoS in congestion situations and end-to-end communication. Furthermore, a study
    [198] introduced a recursive access class barring technique to use the available
    resources optimally, obtaining an optimized service time and average access delay
    compared to the conventional access class barring schemes. Despite these solutions,
    as the massive number of devices expands, the reliability of access, data transmission,
    and energy consumption are inevitably questioned. Very High Signaling Overhead
    per Data Packet: In the CIoT, signaling overhead becomes a significant issue when
    considerable signaling is required for each data packet a device sends. Very high
    signaling overhead per data packet can occur when frequent updates or small amounts
    of data are sent from the device. Cellular networks are optimized for larger data
    packets, and when small data packets are sent frequently, the overhead required
    to establish and maintain the connection becomes a significant proportion of the
    overall communication. However, it is particularly problematic in scenarios where
    devices are battery-powered and have limited energy resources, such as IoT devices
    where a device sends small data packets infrequently. The signaling required to
    establish and maintain the connection can become a bottleneck. It can significantly
    increase network traffic, causing issues, such as network congestion, increased
    latency, and energy consumption [52] on the device and network sides, and reduced
    overall performance. Although data packets transmitted by IoT devices are typically
    small, the high signaling overhead required per packet can always become a significant
    issue for IoT devices [199]. Various signaling reduction techniques can address
    these issues, such as message queuing, efficient protocols, and optimized network
    coverage [200]. Studying more appropriate methods is crucial for scheduling transmissions
    and reducing signaling overhead in extremely dense environments using advanced
    techniques, such as machine learning to overcome these challenges in the ultra-dense
    CIoT to meet service requirements, such as latency, battery life, and accuracy.
    Scalability/Massive Connection: There has been a surge in demand for CIoT connectivity,
    especially in the healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing industries, according
    to the future market insight projections [201]. Hence, numerous connected devices,
    sensors, and machines must be handled simultaneously. The main challenge facing
    the CIoT is the need to support numerous devices with a broad range of capabilities
    and requirements to mitigate problems, such as network congestion, power consumption,
    security, and cost. This challenge requires significant investments in network
    infrastructure and management systems to ensure that the network can scale to
    meet the demands of the IoT. Providing connectivity for many devices can be a
    challenge for CIoT networks, where the system scalability [112] comprises the
    network capacity, processing power, data storage, and security. In [202], mobile
    edge computing (MEC) based CIoT (MECIoT) is taken as one of the promising solutions
    for scalability. Thus, techniques including developing low-power devices, designing
    and implementing smart system architecture involving leveraging distributed computing,
    cloud-based infrastructure, and other advanced technology, such as edge computing
    and AI might help and should be further investigated. Privacy and Security: Security
    cameras, biometric sensors, and authentication devices, electronic door locks
    and access control systems, fire alarm and detection systems, intrusion detection
    and prevention systems, industrial control systems used in critical infrastructure
    such as energy, water, and transportation systems, medical devices such as pacemakers
    and insulin pumps are security-sensitive devices that could harm owners if their
    security is threatened by intruders [118]. It is because, the limited resources
    of CIoT devices can make it challenging to implement robust security measures,
    leaving them vulnerable to attacks [203]. CIoT devices are often deployed in physically
    vulnerable locations, making them susceptible to tampering. In addition, the low
    power and low data rates of CIoT devices can make it difficult to implement strong
    security protocols, leaving them open to network-based attacks. Moreover, the
    lack of uniform standards for security in CIoT can lead to inconsistencies in
    security measures across different devices and networks, potentially exposing
    vulnerabilities. To address these risks, it is essential to implement strong security
    measures such as encryption, secure authentication, and access control, while
    also establishing industry standards for securing the devices [204]. Moreover,
    Ni et al. [205] proposed a security authentication system to protect device security
    during network slicing by isolating IoT applications. Savic et al. [206] proposed
    a deep learning-based anomaly detection, the anomaly detection module (ADM) for
    IoT devices (ADM-EDGE) and the ADM at the mobile core network (ADM-FOG), to enhance
    the CIoT security and the mobile core network, respectively, by demonstrating
    it on smart logistics use cases. However, the trial is on small-scale real-world
    use cases that should be examined on a large scale. In [161], quantum resistance
    access authentication is developed to achieve privacy protection and anti-quantum
    attacks. However, numerous IoT devices with high-speed mobility still have security
    issues relating to moving from one cell to another. Interoperability and Integration
    Issues: Enabling different IoT devices and applications to communicate with each
    other and with the CIoT networks seamlessly is another barrier facing the CIoT.
    Due to the requirements for the device, network, standardization, and security
    and the heterogeneity of the protocols, there are a variety of interoperability
    types, including infrastructure (device interoperability), architecture (network
    interoperability), design (syntactical and semantic interoperability), and platform
    interoperability [207], in which intelligent algorithms should be implemented.
    However, ensuring seamless and interoperable communication among numerous devices
    is challenging because of its various data formats, protocol interfaces and application,
    and the complexity increases if two or more devices communicate simultaneously
    [208]. It is necessary to create a multifaceted technology approach to handle
    the interoperability concerns. This approach requires the development of standards,
    protocols, software tools and interfaces, data formats, and more that can be used
    across networks and devices. Energy Efficiency/Power Consumption: One of the most
    critical constraints for CIoT devices is battery life. Most CIoT devices are battery-powered
    require constant sources of power and need low power consumption with many years
    of deployment lifecycle in remote locations where supplying power is spectacularly
    difficult. The reason why many years of deployment are employed is that activities
    include charging batteries regularly, devices that are hard-wired to maintain
    electricity, and a complete device replacement which causes human interaction
    too costly for the business case. For battery-powered IoT devices, energy efficiency
    is a highly critical factor [154]. Often, IoT devices are designed to be low-power
    and energy-efficient, but this is not easy to achieve with cellular networks,
    which requires new approaches to network design and management to ensure the network
    can support low-power devices while providing the necessary performance and coverage.
    However, there are still compromising power consumption issues in the CIoT. One
    method of saving energy in the age of AI is applying the recommended deep neural
    network techniques. However, due to frequent memory access, executing power-intensive
    deep neural networks on low-resource IoT devices increases power consumption.
    To address these problems, a study [209] suggested that reducing the number of
    MAC operations and data precision saves energy. In addition, the recursive access
    class barring technique provides resource-efficiency and energy-efficiency solutions
    [198]. However, a trade-off occurs between energy efficiency and other performance
    factors, such as high data transfer rates, poor network coverage, and complex
    data processing (to mention a few that could be balanced), and further investigation
    is required. Cost: As the deployment of numerous IoT devices increases exponentially,
    it can result in high costs for network providers and end users. Network providers
    and IoT device manufacturers explore partnerships and collaborations to reduce
    costs, share resources, and leverage each other’s expertise and capabilities.
    Among other solutions, significant factors of the CIoT to make IoT devices more
    accessible and affordable for a wider range of applications and use cases are
    using low-cost devices and employing technology that stabilizes the costs for
    the device, network, maintenance, data management, and others [27], [30], [155].
    Often, IoT devices are designed to be low cost, which requires new approaches
    to network design and management to ensure that the network can be deployed and
    maintained at a low cost. However, a low-cost design negatively affects CIoT performance,
    spectral efficiency, and energy consumption. In [210], the authors proposed a
    time allocation algorithm to avoid the problem. Nonetheless, the support for a
    massive number of devices can become limited. Spectrum Efficiency: As IoT devices
    use a small amount of bandwidth, the spectrum is a limited resource that must
    be shared among a massive number of connecting devices. Efficient spectrum allocation
    is vital for connecting many IoT devices and preventing network disruptions. The
    author [211] investigated power-domain nonorthogonal multiple access as the best
    multiple access technique for efficiently utilizing the existing spectrum resources
    in IoT networks from the multiple-user scenario by assigning different power levels.
    However, the number of frequency blocks in the IoT network in the framework is
    limited. Al-Dweik et al. [212] mentioned that power-domain nonorthogonal multiple
    access could be a prominent solution for spectral efficiency from the same user
    perspective in which nonidentical power values can be assigned. However, in large-scale
    IoT networks, spectral efficiency requires new robust approaches to spectrum management
    to ensure that the network can support numerous low-power devices. Quality of
    Service: The level of services and performance of a network provider guarantees
    its customers to make the IoT devices reliable is a highly important factor in
    the CIoT. The technical challenges in the CIoT regarding the bandwidth, power,
    delay, and error rate should be optimized to attain the various QoS requirements,
    including reliability, low latency, high throughput, low power consumption, security,
    scalability, cost-effectiveness, and more. Indeed, IoT devices require low-latency
    and high reliability communication, which is challenging to provide in cellular
    networks. Network optimization, traffic management, and service-level agreement
    strategies are good for preserving QoS [199]. Furthermore, deploying fixed and
    mobile small cells due to the reduced Tx-to-Rx distance is expected to improve
    the QoS with the ever-increasing data demands [213]. However, challenges still
    exist, such as interference and resource management. Hence, new and robust approaches
    to network design and management are required to ensure the network can support
    low-latency, high-reliability communication to achieve QoS. 10. Conclusion In
    recent years, the CIoT has emerged as a promising solution for providing a scalable,
    reliable, and secure infrastructure connecting a broad range of devices and applications.
    The CIoT enables billions of devices to connect and share information, creating
    new services and applications. With the ongoing full deployment and integration
    of 5G networks, CIoT is poised to gain further significance. The fact that 5G
    offers higher data rates, lower latency, and massive device connectivity, which
    unlock new possibilities for CIoT applications, 3GPP and Ericsson have been working
    on standardization of CIoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices. The LTE-M and NB-IoT have confirmed that they can efficiently
    be integrated into the 5G and share its ultimate benefits. The URLLC capabilities
    of 5G enable mission-critical CIoT use cases, such as autonomous vehicles, remote
    surgery, and industrial automation, that require real-time, reliable connectivity
    is now achieved. Moreover, the CIoT is valuable because it reduces the cost and
    complexity of deploying and maintaining IoT networks, provides a global and standardized
    solution for connecting IoT devices, and enables interoperability while ensuring
    the security and privacy of data transmitted over the CIoT network. To this end,
    in this paper, we have compared the existing literature on CIoT technologies and
    discussed their general network architecture. Moreover, we have elaborated on
    the existing CIoT technologies with a complete overview from the perspectives
    of their features and current state-of-the-art including release enhancements,
    focuses, and applications. Finally, we have identified the major challenges in
    CIoT technology that researchers, academics, and industry operators might find
    interesting for further studies and efforts. Declaration of competing interest

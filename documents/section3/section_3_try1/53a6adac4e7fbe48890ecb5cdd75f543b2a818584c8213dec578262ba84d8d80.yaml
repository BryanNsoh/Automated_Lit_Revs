  description: There has been significant innovation in the domain of Internet of
    Things (IoT) as nowadays wireless data transmission is playing an essential role
    in various organizations like agriculture, defence, transportation, etc. Batteries
    are the most common option to power wireless devices. However, using batteries
    to power IoT devices has drawbacks including the cost and disruption of frequent
    battery replacement, and environmental concerns about battery disposal. Solar
    energy harvesting is a promising solution for long-term operation applications.
    However, solar energy harvesting varies drastically over location and time. Due
    to fluctuating weather conditions and the environmental effects on PV surface
    condition, output could be reduced and become insufficient. Environmental conditions
    including temperature, wind, solar irradiance, humidity, tilt angle and the dust
    accumulated over time on the photovoltaic (PV) module surface affects the amount
    of energy harvested. To address this issue, a novel solution is required to autonomously
    predict the harvested energy and plan the IoT device tasks accordingly, to enhance
    its performance and lifetime. Using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms could make
    it possible to predict how much energy can be harvested using weather forecast
    data. This research is ongoing, and aims to apply ML algorithms on historical
    weather data including environmental factors to generate solar energy predictions
    for IoT device energy budget planning.

  description: Plant protection is a generic term that refers to a myriad of integrated
    practices used to prevent yield loss caused by environmental stress and pests
    (such as pathogens, nematodes, insects, rodents, weeds, etc.), which has been
    of critical importance in elevating agricultural productivity, food quality, and
    economic benefit. Along with the modern agricultural intensification, the plant
    growth is affected by harsh environmental conditions and frequently occurred pests,
    which urges reliable approaches for on-site monitoring to ensure the effectiveness
    of applied plant protection practices. Compared to those conventional instrument-centered
    methods, the recent progress in (bio)sensing techniques has provided novel concepts
    and feasible platforms to monitor plant status and agrochemical residual levels
    with attractive strengths such as low cost, high accuracy, miniaturized instrumental
    configuration, noninvasive treatment, simple operation and wireless data transmission.
    In particular, the rapid development of wearable sensing devices further improves
    the field applicability and operational simplicity of (bio)sensors, holding considerable
    promise to be the next-generation monitoring approaches urgently needed in the
    emerging trend of agricultural mechanization and intellectualization. This chapter
    reviews the principles, fabrication, and application of recent wearable devices
    in monitoring plant statues and detecting agrochemicals (especially, pesticides),
    aiming to inspire more creative thoughts and methods to enhance plant protection
    and to facilitate the sustainable development of modern agriculture.

  description: In recent years there has been a growing interest in the application
    of geographic information systems (GIS) for the development of spatial decision
    support systems (SDSS). The current paper presents the development of a GIS-based
    SDSS for precision management of tree crops. The SDSS is being developed within
    the framework of the '3D-Mosaic' project which aims at optimizing water consumption
    in orchards by employing precision agriculture methods through the application
    of information and communication technology (ICT). Orchards in Turkey and in Germany
    are monitored for plant and fruit growth under different environmental conditions
    and irrigation regimes. An autonomous platform is employed for the acquisition
    of plant data using vision systems and laser scanners for yield and leaf area
    prediction, and stationary crop quality sensors with wireless data transmission
    to the platform. Data collected by these systems on fruit development, fruit quality
    and tree condition, combined with acquisition of abiotic data regarding soil,
    terrain and climatic conditions, are used to construct a 3D GIS database. The
    database is currently analyzed using spatial statistical methods to assess the
    spatial variability of the orchard and of its environmental conditions, to determine
    correlations between the two and to develop management zones. These will be used
    for building an SDSS for site-specific orchard irrigation to support farmers in
    efficient and sustainable management of orchards.

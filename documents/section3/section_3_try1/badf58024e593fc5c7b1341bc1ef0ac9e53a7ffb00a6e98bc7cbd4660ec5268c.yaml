  description: Accurate estimation of irrigation-induced evapotranspiration (ET) is
    critical for understanding the terrestrial water cycle. However, current estimation
    has large uncertainties due to the model limitations and the lack of accurate
    water use data. In this study, a water-energy balanced irrigation scheme is incorporated
    into the Conjunctive Surface-Subsurface Process version 2 (CSSPv2) model to improve
    the hydrological simulations over the Yellow River basin (YRB) where irrigation
    is extensive. The coupled model (CSSPv2-IRR) is calibrated against long-term water
    use data from provincial survey, and it is used to perform a 6-km resolution simulation
    over the YRB during 1991–2017. The results show that the coupled model can well
    reproduce hydrological processes within the basin, and the simulated irrigation
    amount, ET and surface soil moisture largely agree with the validation datasets.
    Specifically, the annual irrigation amount and irrigation-induced ET changes from
    the CSSPv2-IRR are more reasonable than ISIMIP2a and reanalysis products, with
    a reduction in bias by 79.5–97.3 % and 81.2–98.8 % respectively. The CSSPv2-IRR
    model simulation suggests that irrigation-induced annual ET change is 26.4 mm/year
    during 1991–2017, contributing to an 8.9 % increase in annual ET over the YRB,
    and the increase can reach 44.3 % over major irrigation districts. In addition,
    the contribution of irrigation to long-term increasing trend in ET over the irrigation
    districts in the upper reach is greater than the contribution of climate change.
    This study suggests a growing control of irrigation on the ET over the YRB, which
    has implications for regional water cycle and water resources management.

    (ET) is critical for understanding the terrestrial water cycle. However, current

    Introduction Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of the global water
    cycle, linking the water, energy, and carbon cycle at all scales, and being affected
    by both climate change and human interventions. With the rapidly growing population
    and food demand, and increasing aridity from climate warming, there is an exacerbated
    human water demand, resulting in a hydrological system that is closely intertwined
    with water management practices (Wada et al., 2013, Leng et al., 2015). Irrigation,
    which accounts for approximately 70 % of water withdrawals globally (Döll, 2009,
    Meier et al., 2018, Siebert and Döll, 2010), has directly and substantially altered
    the terrestrial water and energy cycle by increasing ET (Hao et al., 2015, Zeng
    et al., 2016, Huang and Ullrich, 2016, Leng et al., 2017, Thiery et al., 2017,
    Zhang and Yuan, 2020). In water-shortage areas, the effect of irrigation on increasing
    ET may be substantially greater than the effect of climate changes over agricultural
    regions (Scanlon et al., 2012, Chen et al., 2018). Therefore, a quantitative estimation
    of the irrigation effects on ET is beneficial for managing the risk of water resources.
    ET remains particularly difficult to measure and simulate, especially at large
    spatial scales. Although various studies have used multiple methods including
    paired-watershed experiments (Van Loon et al., 2019), water balance method (Liu
    et al., 2022, Pan et al., 2017, Zhang and Yuan, 2020), numerical modeling (Döll
    and Siebert, 2002, Hanasaki et al., 2008, Wada et al., 2011, Wada et al., 2013,
    Leng et al., 2014, Leng et al., 2017, Ma and Zhang, 2022, Jha et al., 2022) to
    study the irrigation impacts on ET, there are large uncertainties due to the lack
    of accurate water use data and the constraint of energy balance. Land surface
    modeling has been regarded as an efficient tool to unravel irrigation influences
    in recent years (Fisher and Koven, 2020, McDermid et al., 2023). Some studies
    have separated the impacts of irrigation by comparing land surface model (LSM)
    simulations with or without an irrigation scheme. (Leng et al., 2014, Nie et al.,
    2018, Thiery et al., 2017, Xia et al., 2022). For instance, Xia et al. (2022)
    have attempted to represent irrigation processes in the Noah-MP model and found
    that the ET is intensified by 7.5 % from May to September in the Yangtze River
    basin, China. However, previous studies are applied at coarse resolutions (i.e.,
    0.5–1° globally and 0.1–0.25° regionally) which cannot fully utilize the information
    of high-resolution forcings and lead to uncertainty in simulating terrestrial
    water and energy cycles (Ji et al., 2017, Singh et al., 2015). With the development
    of high-resolution meteorological forcings and land surface data, land surface
    modeling at high resolution would be helpful to unravel irrigation effects on
    ET in the context of climate change. The Yellow River basin is a typical arid
    and semi-arid area in China, including the south temperate zone, the mid-temperate
    zone, and the plateau climate zone. The annual average precipitation gradually
    decreases in a spatial gradient from more than 700 mm in the southeastern regions
    to usually less than 250 mm in the northwestern regions of the basin, both the
    surface water and groundwater are withdrawn for regional agriculture. The irrigation
    water in the basin accounts for around 70.4 % of the total water consumption according
    to the Yellow River Water Resources Commission (YRCC). Therefore, the effects
    of irrigation on ET cannot be neglected with long-term irrigation activities over
    the Yellow River basin (YRB). In this study, we incorporated an irrigation scheme
    into the Conjunctive Surface–Subsurface Process version 2 (CSSPv2) model that
    has advanced hydrological and land surface parameterizations and wide applications
    in terrestrial hydrological and thermal simulations (Ji and Yuan, 2018, Ji et
    al., 2023), evaluated the performance of the newly coupled model and investigated
    the irrigation influence over the Yellow River basin in Northern China. 2. Study
    area and model description 2.1. Study area In this study, the Yellow River basin
    was chosen as the study region (Fig. 1, the major irrigation districts were defined
    as the annual averaged ratio of irrigated crop areas greater than 10 %), which
    is the second longest river in China with a drainage area of 795,000 km2 (including
    the inner flow area of about 43,000 km2). Recently, the basin has attracted substantial
    attention due to its crucial water supply function for northern China which provides
    water to 12 % of the country''s population. The basin is influenced by intensive
    irrigation with an effective irrigated cropland area being 5.177 million hectares,
    and it has several large irrigation districts with arid or semi-arid climates.
    In addition, water-saving irrigation is gradually being implemented in the YRB
    in recent years. The irrigation methods in the basin are complex and varied, showing
    the coexistence of drip, sprinkler, and flood irrigation. Download : Download

    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) 2.2. The Conjunctive Surface-Subsurface Process version 2 (CSSPv2)
    model In this study, we chose the CSSPv2 model as the baseline model for irrigation
    scheme coupling. CSSPv2 is a distributed, grid-based LSM (Yuan and Liang, 2011),
    which has a reasonable representation of the lateral flow and surface–subsurface
    interactions (Ji et al., 2017), a complete set of parameterizations for high-resolution
    simulation (Yuan et al., 2018), and a detailed description of urban energy and
    water cycle (Ji et al., 2021). It has been applied for high-resolution land surface
    simulations over China and sub-regions (Ji et al., 2023), showing its advantages
    in representing evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture (SM), land surface temperature
    (LST), and other water and energy fluxes (Ji et al., 2020a, Ji et al., 2020b,
    Ji et al., 2020c, Zeng et al., 2021). Typically, CSSPv2 separates the soil column
    (up to a total depth of 5.67 m) into eleven layers (0–1.75 cm, 1.75–4.51 cm, 4.51–9.06
    cm, 9.06–16.55 cm, 16.55–28.91 cm, 28.91–49.29 cm, 49.29–82.89 cm, 82.89–138.28
    cm, 138.28–229.61 cm, 229.61–380.19 cm, and 389.19–567.64 cm), and simulates the
    vertical subsurface water flow based on numerical solution of Richards equation
    as follows: (1) where is soil moisture, t is time, and z is the vertical axis,
    is the diffusivity, is the suction head, is the hydraulic conductivity and is
    the local terrain surface slopes. The source-sink term Q includes transpiration
    loss, subsurface runoff and so on (Choi et al., 2007). In addition, the unconfined
    aquifer is defined as the part below the model soil column. The tendency of total
    soil water below the water table (mm) is calculated by (2) where is the recharge
    rate (mm s−1) representing the exchanges between soil water and groundwater, and
    is the base flow or groundwater discharge (mm s−1). 2.3. Irrigation parameterization
    We designed an irrigation scheme containing three major components, i.e., irrigation
    amount estimation based on soil moisture deficit, irrigation water withdrawal
    from the surface and subsurface water storages, and a specific method of irrigating
    cropland. This scheme was then coupled with CSSPv2, and the newly coupled model
    was named CSSPv2-IRR (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (503KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The schematic diagram of the CSSPv2-IRR. 2.3.1.
    Irrigation amount We first calculated the monthly irrigated cropland area ratio
    for each grid as follows: (3) where is the irrigated cropland area (km2) of crop
    type p for a specific month m obtained from MIRCA data in this study, and is the
    total grid area (km2). The ratio is also used to separate irrigated croplands
    from the rainfed area (Fig. S1), so the irrigation water would be only applied
    to the soil beneath the irrigated crops. Say by analogy, we can also calculate
    the monthly cropland area ratio of different crops for each grid to further calculate
    their irrigation amount respectively. We then employed a soil-moisture-deficit-based
    method to calculate the total irrigation amount. Here we referred to soil moisture
    deficit as the difference between the current soil moisture ( ) and a target soil
    moisture ( ) predetermined as the threshold, and calculated the target soil moisture
    content for each soil layer as follows: (4) where and are the field capacity (m3/m3)
    and wilting point (m3/m3) for a specific soil layer i, respectively, and α is
    the weighting factor which can be determined according to census data, so that
    the simulated annual irrigation amounts can approximately match the observed irrigation
    water withdrawal at the province-level. Instead of using the same α value (e.g.,  =
    0.5) for the entire study area, we figured out its spatial pattern based on the
    census irrigation amount of each administrative region, and found it more suitable
    for high-resolution modeling. Specifically, the α value controls the irrigation
    target and amount, which was varied between [0,1] at a regular interval of 0.001.
    The optimal parameter value for each administrative area was selected based on
    the value that produced the lowest average bias in irrigation amount within the
    calibration period (Table S1). The total irrigation amount is then estimated by
    summing the soil moisture deficit for each soil layer in the root zone as follows:
    (5) where is the total irrigation amount (mm), is the soil layer depth (mm) for
    a specific soil layer i. Total irrigation amount was estimated at a daily interval
    (at 8 a.m. local time) based on soil moisture deficit at the last time step, and
    equally distributed to each time step during irrigation time. Meanwhile, considering
    wheat, maize, soybeans, and rice are the major crops in the YRB, so the surface
    50 cm soil layers (top 6 layers in CSSPv2) are considered as the root zone in
    this study. Considering dryland rice is the main type of rice and the irrigation
    for paddy is relatively diligent with small amount in the YRB according to the
    YRCC, so we assumed that the same value of can be used for paddy as other irrigated
    crops. 2.3.2. Water withdrawal From a water balance perspective, the irrigation
    water demand is satisfied by the water withdrawn from both surface and subsurface
    water storages. We first allocated the irrigation amount to the surface water
    supply as follows: (6) where refers to the scheduled surface water withdrawal
    (mm), and is the proportion of area equipped for irrigation with surface water
    to the total irrigated cropland area. It is obtained from FAO data in this study.
    However, surface water withdrawal is constrained by available surface water storage
    (i.e., water in river channels and lakes, etc.), so we assumed that the deficiency
    of irrigation amount is compensated by groundwater, which is fully abstracted
    from aquifers. Therefore, the actual irrigation is adjusted as follows: (7) (8)
    where is the available surface water amount in the grid (mm), and and are the
    actual surface water withdrawal (mm) and groundwater withdrawal (mm) for irrigation,
    respectively. The surface water withdrawal was then directly removed from surface
    water storages, while the groundwater withdrawal was fully abstracted from aquifers.
    Specifically, if water table is above 5.67 m (the bottom of the soil column),
    the groundwater withdrawal in soil column was treated as the source-sink term
    of the soil layers under water table in Richards equation (see Eq. (1)). Water
    withdrawal processes were also solved at each time step, which is the same as
    other land surface processes in the model. 2.3.3. Irrigation process We applied
    a compromise method as the default irrigation scheme for non-paddy fields, which
    can be generally considered as the one between sprinkler, flood, and drip irrigation
    due to the lack of a realistic irrigation method distribution map. Irrigation
    water was pumped from different sources and then directly dropped to the ground
    below the crop without being intercepted, and treated as extra rainfall in the
    module as follows: (9) where is the original throughfall (i.e., rainfall after
    removal of canopy interception, mm), in the revised throughfall considering irrigation
    (mm), and is the actual irrigation time (4 h by default). was then used as the
    net rainfall to the ground for evaporation, runoff, and infiltration calculation,
    which was acted as the upper boundary condition of Richards equation. Considering
    that the rice is grown in May-September in several irrigation districts of the
    YRB, we added a specific ponding scheme for rice paddies (Yao et al., 2022, Devanand
    et al., 2019). The scheme assumes that the surface water in paddy fields is lost
    through evaporation or infiltration when the surface water depth is below a certain
    threshold (100 mm). In contrast, when the surface water depth exceeds the threshold,
    which may harm rice growth, the excess water will be removed quickly during a
    time step as runoff: (10) where is the surface water runoff (mm/s), is the depth
    of the surface water (mm), and is the threshold of the surface water depth in
    paddy fields. In addition, the paddy fields are usually irrigated by flood irrigation
    which water is poured directly and quickly to the ground surface during a time
    step ( ) as: (11) 3. Data and methods 3.1. Model input data We collected long-term
    historical climate forcings, e.g., historical surface pressure, wind speed, humidity,
    shortwave/longwave radiation fluxes, and near-surface air temperature, from multiple
    observation datasets such as China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD, He et
    al., 2020) at 0.1-degree-resolution, China Meteorological Administration (CMA)
    Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, Shi et al., 2011, Sun et al., 2020) precipitation
    dataset at 0.0625-degree-resolution, and the CN05.1 precipitation dataset at 0.25-degree-resolution
    (Wu and Gao, 2013). These multi-source multi-resolution hydrometeorological data
    were then bilinearly interpolated to a spatial resolution of 6 km for land surface
    modeling. More details can be found in Ji et al. (2023). This suite of newly generated
    hourly meteorological data at 6 km resolution was used to drive the model. We
    chose the monthly irrigated cropland area data for 26 crops from MIRCA2000 at
    1/12- degree-resolution (Portmann et al., 2010) to estimate the irrigation amount,
    and chose the Global Map of Irrigation Areas data from Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO, Siebert et al., 2013) to better represent irrigation water supply from different
    sources. To summarize, they were all used to drive the irrigation module. Other
    state-of-the-art land surface datasets were also used to generate high-resolution
    surface parameters, including the hydrologically conditioned Shuttle Radar Topography
    Mission (SRTM) elevation dataset at 3-arc resolution (Lehner et al., 2008), the
    global land cover dataset at 300 m resolution from ESA-CCI, the GLASS monthly
    LAI product at 0.05° resolution during 1988–1999 retrieved from AVHRR (Liang et
    al., 2021), the reprocessed MODIS version 6 monthly LAI dataset at 0.05° resolution
    during 2000–17 (Yuan et al., 2011), the global soil texture dataset at 1 km resolution
    (Shangguan et al., 2014). These data were subsequently bilinearly interpolated
    to 6 km as the surface data to drive the model. 3.2. Evaluation data 3.2.1. Data
    list We collected a set of satellite products, reanalysis datasets, global hydrological
    model (GHM) simulations, and observed records from yearbooks, bulletins, and other
    publications as evaluation or comparison data for our high-resolution irrigation
    modeling (Table 1). Table 1. Summary of the model calibration and validation datasets

    the census irrigation water withdrawal (detailed in Table S7) was used to evaluate
    the simulated irrigation amount. ISIMIP2a-GHMs include PCR-GLOBWB, WATERGAP, LPJML,
    and H08, which are only available up to 2010, these results were used to make
    a comparison with the CSSPv2-IRR simulation. In order to assess ET estimates,
    we compared the simulated ET to the commonly used ET products (FLUXCOM and GLEAMv3.6a).
    The census for irrigation water consumption is defined as the amount of water
    that does not return to the rivers or aquifers, which can be approximated as the
    irrigation-induced ET after deducting the part of diversion from a water balance
    perspective, and then used to evaluate the irrigation-induced ET. The human-induced
    ET was inversed from five reanalysis datasets (including ERA5, ERA5-Land, GLDAS2.1-CLSM,
    GLDAS2.1-Noah, GLDAS2.2.) and GRACE/GRACE-FO data by Liu et al. (2022), we obtain
    these results and further handled as irrigation-induced ET through deducting the
    part of non-irrigation human-induced ET in this study (see Section 3.4.1 for details),
    these results were used to make a comparison with the CSSPv2′s irrigation-induced
    ET. Finally, the ESI-CCI was used to evaluate the surface SM performed by CSSPv2-IRR.
    The metrics used for model evaluation include the coefficient of determination
    (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias, and percent bias (PB). 3.3. Experimental
    design We conducted two numerical experiments, CTL and IRR, to investigate irrigation
    effects on ET over the YRB. Both IRR (with irrigation) and CTL (without irrigation)
    experiments were conducted at a 6-km resolution (335x195 grids) over the YRB.
    A 30-year spin-up was completed by using the baseline model CSSPv2 to get the
    same initial conditions for both experiments, and two long-term simulations during
    1988–2017 at a half-hourly time interval w/o irrigation effects were conducted
    for two cycles, respectively. Because of continuous growth in China’s economy
    since the 1990s, we chose simulations during 1991–2017 in the second cycle from
    both experiments for further evaluation and comparison. Meanwhile, considering
    that the ISIMIPA2a''s results are only available up to 2010, we selected 2011–2017
    as the calibration period and 2003–2010 as the validation period for the irrigation
    model. 3.4. Estimation of irrigation-induced ET 3.4.1. Estimation of irrigation-induced
    ET by reanalysis datasets In this study, the human-induced ET change dataset is
    obtained from Liu et al. (2022), which is the difference between natural and observed
    ET: (12) where is considered as the ET induced by human activities such as reservoir
    regulation, and land cover change, etc. is the natural ET estimated by five reanalysis
    datasets, ETOBS is the actual ET at the basin level which is estimated by water
    balance method based on observed precipitation (P), runoff (ROBS), terrestrial
    water storage change (TWSC), and net water diversion (WD) at annual scales as
    follows: (13) To detect irrigation-induced ET ( ), we used census data to remove
    evapotranspiration caused by the other human activities as follows: (14) (15)
    where and are the census human and irrigation water consumption inside the YRB
    (without diversion part). 3.4.2. Estimation of irrigation-induced ET by CSSPv2
    model We assessed the effect of irrigation on ET by comparing differences in ET
    from IRR ( , refer to climate change and irrigation scenario) and CTL ( , refer
    to climate change scenario) during the study period. (16) where denote ET changes
    induced by irrigation (refer to irrigation scenario). In addition, the long-term
    trend of the ET in different scenarios is calculated by one-way linear regression.
    4. Results 4.1. Model evaluation 4.1.1. Irrigation water amount To accurately
    quantify the irrigation-induced effects in the Yellow River Basin, we first calibrated
    and evaluated the model performance of CSSPv2-IRR in representing irrigation processes
    by comparing the simulated irrigation amount with records reported in the Water
    Resources Bulletin (see Fig. 3). The simulated annual irrigation amount matches
    well with the records observed from 2003 to 2017 (Fig. 3a). When comparing with
    four ISIMIPA2a-GHMs (Fig. 3b, Table 2), the result shows that the irrigation amount
    provided by ISIMIPA2a-GHMs has larger biases than CSSPv2-IRR simulation during
    the validation periods (2003–2010), especially for H08 and LPJML which significantly
    overestimate the irrigation amount relative to observation, the annual irrigation
    amount simulated by CSSPv2-IRR was generally improved relative to the ISIMIPA2a-GHMs
    simulations, with a reduction in bias by 79.53–97.32 %. To evaluate the model
    performance in each province over the study area, a comparison between CSSPv2-IRR
    simulation and observation shows pretty good consistency in capturing the spatial
    distribution in irrigation amount during the validation periods (2003–2010) (Fig.
    3c), with R2 being 0.985, RMSE being 0.627 km3/yr, and bias being −0.055 km3/yr,

    As CSSPv2-IRR performs well (Fig. 3), the seasonal variations of the simulated
    irrigation amount in the Yellow River Basin are shown in Fig. 4. The peak irrigation
    value in the Yellow River Basin is mainly concentrated in April-September, consistent
    with the plucking and tasselling periods of major crops when intensive evapotranspiration
    takes place The irrigation amount has larger values in Inner Mongolia and Ningxia,
    reaching 400 mm/year (Fig. S3), followed by Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, and other
    provinces. In addition, it can be seen from Table 3 that wheat and maize used
    the highest quantity of water, both exceeding 7 km3/year (∼29 %), followed by

    in the monthly variation of simulated ET over the YRB with considering irrigation
    effect. In addition, IRR also provides a smaller RMSE (a 47.81 % to 109.68 % reduction
    in RMSE) and bias (a 32.37 % to 46.34 % reduction in bias) than CTL in each reach

    (Fig. 8, Table 6). CSSPv2-IRR shows an irrigation-induced ET value (26.65 mm/year)
    approximated to the census data (25.02 mm/year) with a low uncertainty. However,
    other analysis data introduce significant biases with large uncertainties, where
    the data inversed from ERA5, ERA5-land, CLDAS2.1-VIC, and GLDAS2.2 generally overestimated
    irrigation-induced ET substantially. In general, CSSPv2 improved the simulation
    of irrigation-induced ET, with a smaller bias (an 81.22–98.77 % reduction in bias)
    than reanalysis datasets. Download : Download high-res image (104KB) Download

    budgets Fig. 9 presents the irrigation impacts on local water and energy budget.
    Irrigation leads to the wetting of surface SM (0.005 mm/mm, 3.33 %), enhances
    ET (26.37 mm/year, 8.86 %), and decreases land surface temperature (−0.04 K) averaged
    over the YRB during 1991–2017. Meanwhile, we also focus on the major irrigation
    districts to quantify irrigation influence on local water and energy budget, we
    find that surface SM, ET, and land surface temperature changes 16.91 %, 44.30
    %, −0.21 K for major irrigation districts averaged, respectively. In addition,
    in Qingtongxia and Hetao-Yangshui irrigation districts (Fig. 1) located in the
    upper reaches of the YRB, irrigation may lead to an increase of 0.05 mm/mm (∼30
    %) in surface SM, an increase of 300 mm/year (∼100 %) in ET, and a decrease of
    0.5 K in land surface temperature. Download : Download high-res image (284KB)

    of ET induced by irrigation and climate change In view of the good performance
    of CSSPv2-IRR to represent the trend of ET over the YRB (Fig. 6), the spatial
    distribution and the attribution of the trend of the simulated ET over the YRB
    during 1991–2017 is also shown in Fig. 10. With the consideration of the irrigation
    process, the trend of irrigation over the YRB has changed from 1.75 mm/year to
    1.93 mm/year due to the increasing trend of irrigation amount (0.18 mm/year, Fig.
    S4) in this period. Specifically, ET shows an increasing trend in considerable
    areas of the southeastern regions of the river and the major irrigation districts
    in the upper reaches (Fig. 10a). A similar spatial pattern (except for the Qingtongxia
    and Hetao-Yangshui irrigation districts) is shown in Fig. 10b, which indicates
    that climate impact dominates the ET changes trend. Compared with Fig. 10b, the
    opposite spatial distribution of the trend of ET caused by irrigation is shown
    in Fig. 10c, the increasing trend of ET in the Qingtongxia and Hetao-Yangshui
    irrigation districts in the upper reaches of the basin can reach 1.31 mm/year,
    which is larger than that induced by climate change. Irrigation impact dominates
    the increasing trend of ET in these irrigation districts (Fig. 10d) due to the
    large-scale agricultural water use. Download : Download high-res image (799KB)

    balanced irrigation module by determining irrigation amount and considering water
    withdrawal and irrigation processes and integrated it into the CSSPv2 land surface
    model (referred to as CSSPv2-IRR), and performed a high-resolution (6 km) simulation
    during 1991–2017 over the YRB. The validation according to the long-term observations
    indicated that CSSPv2-IRR can well reproduce hydrological processes over the YRB,
    and the simulated irrigation amount, ET and surface soil moisture largely agree
    with the validation datasets. The annual irrigation amount and irrigation-induced
    ET series from the coupled model were improved as compared with those from ISIMIP2a,
    irrigation-induced ET from reanalysis datasets, with a reduction in bias by 79.53–97.32
    %, and 81.22–98.77 %, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of irrigation
    on the terrestrial water and energy cycle. Averaged over the YRB during 1991–2017,
    irrigation increases surface SM by 3.33 %, increases ET by 8.86 %, and decreases
    land surface temperature by 0.04 K. For the major irrigation districts in the
    upper reach, the irrigation may increase ET by up to 44.30 %. Meanwhile, the increasing
    trend of ET in the Qingtongxia and Hetao-Yangshui irrigation districts in the
    upper reaches of the basin is dominated by irrigation impact during the 27-year
    period. The impact of human activities (mainly irrigation) on natural system has
    gained attention, especially in arid and semi-arid regions (Chen et al., 2018,
    Nie et al., 2019). For example, previous studies have detected human influence
    on ET based on reanalysis models by using the water budget analysis with GRACE
    terrestrial water storage data (Lv et al., 2019; Zhang and Yuan, 2020, Liu et
    al., 2022). Compared to model simulations, this approach may have uncertainties
    due to the uncertainty in modeling natural ET (Zhang and Yuan, 2020). In addition,
    ISIMIP2a-GHMs have been also widely used to evaluate the historical impacts of
    irrigation, but they were usually driven by global-scale meteorological data,
    with common irrigation rules/parameters. The irrigation amount is only validated
    at national scale (Veldkamp et al., 2018), so the simulation results at the basin/regional
    scale are uncertain. In contrast, CSSPv2-IRR is an efficient tool for simulating
    the irrigation process, and its impact on terrestrial hydrological and thermal
    processes over the YRB. There are also several limitations and uncertainties.
    Despite we have chosen to use the long-term observed irrigation amount to constrain
    the simulated irrigation water use, this scheme may still have uncertainty due
    to the lack of observations at higher spatial and temporal resolution and the
    uncertainties contained in the irrigation map. In addition, the irrigation amount
    data for different crops is still lacking, which may result in uncertainty in
    the modeling. However, parameters such as irrigation target and irrigation threshold
    are adjustable for different crops, so the performance of the model can be further
    improved if relevant high-resolution data is available. The reservoir operations
    are also not considered in this study, which may cause uncertainties during the
    allocation of irrigation water withdrawal and underestimate total ET (as shown
    in Fig. 5). However, the effect of reservoir on ET is negligible as compared with
    the effect of irrigation (Leng et al., 2017). A new version of the CSSP model
    is being developed, by considering reservoir operations, which is expected to
    further improve the model performance. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: AquaCrop, a water-driven model, has been developed to simulate the
    response of crops, including wheat, to the amount of irrigation water. To estimate
    crop yield using this model, the calibration stage is applied first, employing
    the available data. Calibration accuracy guarantees the validation accuracy of
    this model. For this reason, before the calibration stage, the response of the
    AquaCrop model to changes in input parameters is investigated using sensitivity
    analysis. Most researchers use additive-subtractive methods. However, these methods
    do not provide much information about model sensitivity. In this research, three
    methods were used to analyze the sensitivity of AquaCrop to simulate winter wheat
    grain yield under different irrigation requirements. The methods included (1)
    an increasing-decreasing method; (2) a limit method; and (3) a Gamma test that
    was based on the nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs. The irrigation
    treatments were 100%, 75%, 50%, and 0% of the irrigation requirement and were
    designated as I1, I2, I3, and I4. Six input parameters consisting of normalized
    water productivity (WP*), maximum crop coefficient for transpiration (KCTR), initial
    canopy cover (CCo), crop canopy growth coefficient (CGC), crop canopy decline
    coefficient (CDC) and harvest index (HI) were evaluated for sensitivity analysis.
    The results showed that the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model was extremely high
    to WP∗ changes and moderate to CCo changes. An inverse relationship between wheat
    grain yield and CDC and a direct relationship between wheat grain yield and other
    input parameters were observed. The sensitivity of the AquaCrop model to the CCo
    parameter was the same in all irrigation treatments. The increase in water stress
    decreased the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model to the input parameters. Therefore,
    in the case of large differences between simulated and observed grain yield, it
    is suggested to change WP∗ and Kctr values. In the condition of moderate difference,
    it is better to change two parameters, HI and CDC. To reduce the slight difference
    between the simulated and observed grain yield, it is suggested to change the
    two parameters, CGC and CCo. It should be noted that the results of the sensitivity
    analysis are specific to the experimental conditions, such as plant density, soil
    texture, and water supply, and may vary when applied to different regions. Therefore,
    it is recommended to obtain region-specific results and determine the sensitivity
    of the AquaCrop model to input parameters.

    developed to simulate the response of crops, including wheat, to the amount of
    irrigation water. To estimate crop yield using this model, the calibration stage
    is applied first, employing the available data. Calibration accuracy guarantees
    the validation accuracy of this model. For this reason, before the calibration
    stage, the response of the AquaCrop model to changes in input parameters is investigated
    using sensitivity analysis. Most researchers use additive-subtractive methods.
    However, these methods do not provide much information about model sensitivity.
    In this research, three methods were used to analyze the sensitivity of AquaCrop
    to simulate winter wheat grain yield under different irrigation requirements.
    The methods included (1) an increasing-decreasing method; (2) a limit method;
    and (3) a Gamma test that was based on the nonlinear relationship between inputs
    and outputs. The irrigation treatments were 100%, 75%, 50%, and 0% of the irrigation
    requirement and were designated as I1, I2, I3, and I4. Six input parameters consisting
    of normalized water productivity (WP*), maximum crop coefficient for transpiration
    ( K CTR ), initial canopy cover (CCo), crop canopy growth coefficient (CGC), crop
    canopy decline coefficient (CDC) and harvest index (HI) were evaluated for sensitivity
    analysis. The results showed that the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model was extremely
    high to WP* changes and moderate to CCo changes. An inverse relationship between
    wheat grain yield and CDC and a direct relationship between wheat grain yield
    and other input parameters were observed. The sensitivity of the AquaCrop model
    to the CCo parameter was the same in all irrigation treatments. The increase in
    water stress decreased the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model to the input parameters.
    Therefore, in the case of large differences between simulated and observed grain
    yield, it is suggested to change WP* and Kctr values. In the condition of moderate
    difference, it is better to change two parameters, HI and CDC. To reduce the slight
    difference between the simulated and observed grain yield, it is suggested to
    change the two parameters, CGC and CCo. It should be noted that the results of
    the sensitivity analysis are specific to the experimental conditions, such as
    plant density, soil texture, and water supply, and may vary when applied to different
    regions. Therefore, it is recommended to obtain region-specific results and determine
    the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model to input parameters. Introduction Wheat
    (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important food sources. It provides about
    18% of calories and 19% of the protein consumed by people (FAOSTAT 2017). In 2021,
    wheat shared 30% of the total farm area and 26% of production worldwide among
    cereals (FAOSTAT 2021). It is estimated that about a fifth of global farms cultivate
    wheat (Erenstein et al. 2021). The cultivated area of this crop in Iran is more
    than 6.5 Mha, and the annual production is 12.7 Mt, which has increased by 21%
    and 116% in 30 years (Statistical Center of Iran 2018). This amount is not enough
    for the 84.5 million people of Iran (Statistical Center of Iran 2022) because
    25% of the Iranian people’s typical diet depends on wheat (Haji Rahimi 2014; Mojaverian
    et al. 2021). Several plans for the self-sufficiency of wheat production have
    been carried out during the past decades. Still, the trend of population increase
    (Statistical Center of Iran 2022) along with the water resources limitations (Iran
    Water Resources Management 2022) has caused the full realization that with these
    current policies, wheat production in the coming years will become more fragile
    (Yaghoobzadeh et al. 2017a, b). For this reason, paying attention to increasing
    the cultivated area, especially winter wheat, and applying programs to reduce
    water consumption to produce this crop are on the agenda. However, despite meeting
    the water needs of winter wheat in the beginning and middle of the growth period,
    this crop faces water stress at the end of the growth period due to the end of
    rainfall in Iran, particularly in its western and southern provinces, which are
    arid and semiarid climates. For this reason, researchers estimate the amount of
    irrigation water and wheat yield using crop models to determine the appropriate
    irrigation timing and amount for each region (Ahmadee et al. 2021). The AquaCrop
    model, which was developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to
    identify the crop yield response to water (Steduto et al. 2009; Ebrahimipak et
    al. 2019), and is one of the most widely used crop models. The model has attracted
    the attention of researchers compared to other crop growth models (CGM) due to
    its user-friendly interface, the need for fewer data, its applicability, and acceptable
    accuracy (Raes et al. 2009). Wheat is one of the crops included in the database
    of AquaCrop. For this reason, various researchers have simulated the wheat yield
    under different climatic and field conditions using the AquaCrop (Salemi et al.
    2011; Mkhabela and Bullock 2012; Mebane et al. 2013; Soddu et al. 2013; Jin et
    al. 2014; Shabani et al. 2016; Ahmadee et al. 2021). In order to use the AquaCrop
    model, it is necessary to calibrate it first. At this stage, data collected from
    controlled experiments or field sampling must be used (Jin et al. 2014; Kim and
    Kaluarachchi 2015; Geng et al. 2017; Zeeshan Shirazi et al. 2021). The calibration
    method depends on the type and the number of available data. For this reason,
    one or several years of data are used for more accurate calibration of this CGM.
    Despite the reasonable results of the AquaCrop, many studies have reported that
    in water stress conditions, AquaCrop may not simulate acceptable results, and
    its error may increase. This condition is not only for wheat but has also been
    reported in other crops (Ebrahimipak et al. 2018). In order to improve the accuracy
    in the calibration stage, the sensitivity of the Aquacrop model to the changes
    in input parameters, especially crop parameters, should be checked. This method,
    called sensitivity analysis, helps researchers understand which input parameters
    have effects on AquaCrop output. The crop parameters of the AquaCrop are divided
    into two categories: conservative and nonconservative. As suggested by its developers,
    conservative parameters, such as normalized water productivity, initial canopy
    cover and maximum crop coefficient for transpiration, are not to be changed for
    calibration. Only nonconservative parameters, such as crop canopy growth coefficient,
    crop canopy decline coefficient and harvest index in each simulation defined by
    users or estimated by calibration (Raes et al. 2009). However, recent research
    has shown that all the parameters in this model are not constant for different
    environmental conditions, and all input parameters can, in different conditions,
    increase the accuracy of the Aquacrop model (Jin et al. 2018; Ebrahimipak et al.
    2018; Guo et al. 2019). Conversely, it is common to use the increase-decrease
    method to calibrate the AquaCrop Model. In this method, the value of each input
    parameter is increased and decreased by 25%. Then, changes in the output of the
    AquaCrop model, such as yield, are recorded for both values (Geerts et al. 2009;
    Ahmadee et al. 2021). This method, which researchers usually use, is static and
    does not give much information about the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model, especially
    in different irrigation requirements and input increments between acceptable lower
    and upper bounds. The literature review has shown that researchers have paid less
    attention to the investigation of nonstatic methods. Considering the importance
    of the sensitivity analysis stage calibration of the AquaCrop model, it is necessary
    to study the sensitivity analysis of this crop model with more capable methods.
    For this reason, two methods named McCuen and gamma test were used in this study
    for sensitivity analysis of winter wheat, owing to the importance of the crop
    in the food supply in Iran and the need for better modeling for different irrigation
    requirements because of different irrigation strategies. Material and Methods
    Study Area The data required for this research was collected from the research
    farm of the Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources of Lorestan University
    in 2018–2019 (Alizadeh 2020). This farm is located at latitude 33° 26′N, longitude
    48° 15′E, and elevation 1,147 m above sea level. The location of this area is
    shown in Fig. 1. Winter wheat was planted on November 12, 2018, with a density
    of 103 seeds per square meter and a depth of 5 cm. Winter wheat was cultivated
    as rainfed, and at the end of the growing season, supplementary irrigation was
    applied based on the amount of water available. Irrigation was applied from planting
    through 162 days after seeding (DAS). Four irrigation treatments were then applied,
    as shown in Table 1. The irrigation treatments were 100%, 75%, 50%, and 0% of
    irrigation requirement and designated as I1, I2, I3, and I4. Since there were
    no irrigation losses in the study plots, runoff and deep percolation, irrigation
    amounts were determined equal to net irrigation values. Evapotranspiration values,
    which were calculated using FAO Penman-Monteith, were set for irrigation amounts
    (Alizadeh 2020). Irrigation water was stored in a tank, and the amount of irrigation
    water for each plot was determined by a flowmeter. Treatments were replicated
    three times. Experimental plots were established with a length of 4 m and width
    of 2 m and arranged in a randomized block design. A border with a distance of
    2 m was established on all sides of each treatment plot. On May 20, 2019, grain
    yield for each treatment was harvested and measured. In order to harvest, a quadrat
    sampling frame with dimension 2 × 2 m 2 was used. Then, grain yields were weighted
    in a laboratory using a digital scale. Fig. 1. Location of study is in Khorramabad
    city, Lorestan province, Iran. Table 1. Irrigation amount during the study for

    evapotranspiration (ET) assuming its segregation [Eq. (1)]. Separation of this
    component into two components, evaporation (E) and transpiration (Tr), causes
    the nonproductive consumption of water to be removed from the equation [Eq. (2)]
    (Raes et al. 2009) ( Y x − Y a Y x ) = K y ( E T x − E T a E T x ) (1) T r = K
    s × CC × K CTrx × E T 0 (2) where Y x and Y a = respectively the maximum and actual
    crop yield; E T x and E T a = respectively the maximum and actual crop evapotranspiration;
    K y = proportionality factor between relative yield loss and relative reduction
    in evapotranspiration; K s and K CTrx = respectively the water and crop stress
    coefficients; and C C = canopy cover in the crop development stages which is calculated
    by following equations (Raes et al. 2009) CC = CC 0 × e t CGC (3) CC = CC x −
    0.25 CC x 2 CC 0 × e − t CGC (4) CC = CC x [ 1 − 0.05 ( e CDC CCx × t − 1 ) ]
    (5) where C C 0 = initial canopy cover; CGC = canopy growth coefficient; CDC =
    canopy decline coefficient; and t = time after cultivation. Eqs. (3)–(5) are respectively
    used to determine canopy cover from the beginning of the growth period to the
    middle of the development period, from the middle to the end of the development
    period, and from the beginning of the senescence to the end of the growth period.
    Biomass is calculated by Eq. (6) B = W P * [ T r i E T 0 , i ] (6) where T r i
    = total amount of daily crop transpiration during the crop season; W P * = normalized
    water productivity; E T o , i = daily reference crop evapotranspiration; and B
    = daily biomass. The crop yield is also calculated using the biomass and the harvest
    index according to Eq. (7) Y = B × H I (7) where Y = yield; H I = harvest index;
    and B = biomass. Input Data The AquaCrop input data includes four sections: climate,
    crop, management, and soil. The climatic data required by AquaCrop are maximum
    and minimum daily temperature, evapotranspiration of the reference crop, rainfall
    and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. The values of these parameters were
    taken from the meteorological station close to the study site, located at latitude
    33° 26′N and longitude 48° 15′E, during the growth period. Some of this information
    is shown in Fig. 2. To determine the reference crop evapotranspiration, the ET
    0 Calculator software and the FAO Penman-Monteith equation were used (FAO 2023;
    Ahmadee et al. 2021). The average atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was
    taken as the default (Global average) of the AquaCrop model. Fig. 2. Average meteorological
    parameters values during the study. In the crop section, data collected from the
    field study, such as cultivation data, plant density, type of planting method
    and day after sowing to emergence, senescence and maturity, were defined (Table
    2). The data were considered as default for the wheat crop. Table 2. Irrigation

    irrigation Groundwater No shallow groundwater table The management section is
    defined into two subgroups: irrigation and field. Irrigation includes tabs related
    to irrigation mode, irrigation method and irrigation events. The amount of irrigation
    water for each treatment and water quality are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
    In this section, the amount of irrigation water, irrigation method and irrigation
    water salinity were determined. The field includes different parts of farm management.
    Farm management was considered nonlimiting for soil fertility, soil cover with
    no mulch and does not affect surface runoff. The soil section includes soil profile
    and groundwater. The information in the soil profile section includes saturated
    hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), saturated moisture, field capacity and permanent
    wilting point in different soil layers. The data was measured in the soil laboratory
    (Table 3). Soil characteristics were determined based on the Iranian Guideline
    for Soil Survey (Anonymous 2009). Since the depth of underground water in the
    field was very deep (depth equal to 21 m), the option of a groundwater table absent
    was considered. Table 3. Soil characteristics Soil type Clay loam soil depth (0–30

    Analysis According to Eqs. (1)–(7), the parameters of normalized water productivity
    (WP*), maximum crop coefficient for transpiration ( K CTrx ), initial canopy cover
    (CCo), crop canopy growth coefficient (CGC), crop canopy decline coefficient (CDC),
    and harvest index (HI) are very important in yield simulation. Therefore, in the
    present study, the AquaCrop model’s sensitivity to change in these parameters
    was investigated using three methods. In general, the effect of change on wheat
    grain yield by each parameter was studied as parameters trends. The initial values
    and range of changes of each parameter are shown in Table 4. The increment of
    each parameter was determined based on its upper and lower bounds and the available
    growth rate in the AquaCrop database. Table 4. Initial value, lower and upper
    bound of AquaCrop input values Parameter Sign Unit Initial value Lower bound Upper

    are increased and decreased by 25%. Then, the crop yield was checked in both cases
    compared to the base condition (measured yield). Two Eqs. (8) and (9) have been
    proposed by Raes et al. (2009) and Kinton 1994 cited by Salemi et al. (2011),
    respectively S c = | P m − P b P b | × 100 (8) where S c = sensitivity coefficient;
    P m = estimated value of the desired parameter based on the adjusted input value;
    and P b = estimated value of the desired parameter based on the base input data.
    Based on S c values, the AquaCrop sensitivity was categorized into three classes:
    extremely sensitive ( S c > 15 ), moderate sensitive ( 15 < S c < 2 ), and insensitive
    ( S c < 2 ) S c = Δ W / W ¯ Δ P / P ¯ (9) where S c = sensitivity coefficient;
    Δ W = difference between simulated parameters assuming 25% of changes; Δ P = difference
    between input parameters assuming 25% of changes; W ¯ = average of the simulated
    parameter; and P ¯ = average of the input parameter. Based on this method, the
    sensitivity of the model was divided into four classes: extremely sensitive (
    S c > 1 ), highly sensitive ( 1 ≥ S c > 0.5), moderate sensitive ( 0.5 ≥ S c >
    0), and insensitive ( S c = 0 ) [Kinton 1994 cited by Salemi et al. (2011)]. McCuen
    Method This method, developed by McCuen (1974), uses the following equation for
    sensitivity analysis [Eq. (10)]: S p i = lim Δ P i → 0 Δ y y Δ P i P i = ∂ y ∂
    P i × P i y (10) In this regard, S p i = sensitivity index; P i = AquaCrop input
    parameter; and y = yield. S p i values can be positive or negative depending on
    the type of parameter. Positive values indicate an increase in yield by changing
    the desired parameter. Negative values also show a decrease in yield with an increase
    in the parameter. According to Table 5, the value of the sensitivity index is
    categorized into four classes: I1 (insensitive), II (moderate), III (highly),
    and IV (extremely). Table 5. Classification of sensitivity coefficient Sensitivity
    Sensitivity index Class Insensitive 0 ≤ | S p | < 0.05 I Moderate 0.05 ≤ | S p

    from Lenhart et al. (2002). Gamma Test In order to prepare gamma test data, the
    AquaCrop input parameters were selected as the input for the gamma test, and the
    wheat grain yield was selected as the output. In this method, if there is a set
    of data with input values x i , output y i and number the M being the observed
    series from the set [Eq. (11)], then assuming uncertainty and acceptance of error,
    it is shown as Eq. (12); where f is a smooth function for modeling and r is a
    random variable to show the error. The gamma test is based on assuming the nearest
    neighborhood of P ; the input and output values are determined according to Eqs.
    (13) and (14) (Remesan et al. 2008) { ( x i , y i ) , 1 ≤ i ≤ M } (11) y = f (

    ≤ p (14) By fitting the regression between P and ( γ M ( k ) , δ M ( k ) ) , the
    gamma value set is equal to the intercept of the regression line obtained [Eq.
    (15)]. The gamma value ( Γ ) represents a part of the variance of the output data
    that cannot be estimated by the model. The slope of the regression line also indicates
    the complexity of the model, and the higher value indicates greater complexity.
    V ratio is a parameter defined as Eq. (16), which σ 2 is the variance of the results.
    Its value is a number between zero and one; the closer to zero, the more accurate
    the model γ = A δ + Γ (15) V ratio = Γ σ 2 ( y ) (16) Results and Discussion Parameters
    Trends The changes of the AquaCrop model to different values of WP* are shown
    in Fig. 3. According to Table 4, WP* values were changed from 13 to 17 for each
    irrigation treatment. Then, the yield for each WP* was simulated by the Aquacrop
    model. A direct relationship between wheat grain yield and WP* values was observed,
    so wheat grain yield decreased with the decrease of WP*. In treatment I1, which
    was irrigated based on the full water requirement of wheat, the yield decreased
    from 7.7 t ha − 1 (at WP * = 17 g m − 2 ) to 5.9 t ha − 1 (at WP * = 13 g m −
    2 ). In this treatment, the difference between the maximum and minimum wheat grain
    yield for upper and lower bounds of WP* was equal to 1.8 t ha − 1 . By applying
    25% of water stress, treatment I2, wheat yield changed from 7.6 t ha − 1 (at WP
    * = 17 g m − 2 ) to 5.6 t ha − 1 (at WP * = 13 g m − 2 ). By increasing the water
    stress by 50% of the wheat water requirement, treatment I3, the grain yield of
    wheat was obtained in the range of 7.45 to 5.7 t ha − 1 . The aforementioned values
    for rainfed condition, treatment I4, were between 7.1 and 5.4 t ha − 1 . Therefore,
    the maximum and minimum yield changes in treatments I2, I3, and I4, for different
    values of WP*, were equal to 1.8, 1.75, and 1.7 t ha − 1 , respectively. These
    results showed that with increasing water stress, the sensitivity of the AquaCrop
    model to WP* changes decreased. By referring to changes in the slope of the line,
    assuming the intercept is zero, it is also possible to see a decrease in sensitivity
    by applying water stress conditions so that with the increase of water stress
    from I1 to I4, the slope of the line decreased from 0.45 to 0.41. Fig. 3. Changes
    in the wheat grain yield based on changes in the normalized water productivity
    (WP*) in different irrigation treatments. Wheat grain yield changes to K CTR values
    in I1 treatment were obtained with a slope of 6.17 (Fig. 4). The yields in the
    conditions of the K CTR upper and lower bound were 7.34 and 6.21 t ha − 1 , respectively,
    with a difference of 1.13 t ha − 1 . Comparing the values for the I1 treatment
    in Fig. 3 showed that the effect of the change in WP* was greater than the effect
    of the change in K CTR on the wheat grain yield. In the I2 treatment, the reduction
    of K CTR values reduced the wheat grain yield from 7.24 to 6.17 t ha − 1 . By
    decreasing K CTR for the I3 treatments, changes in wheat grain yield were calculated
    from 7.02 to 6.07 t ha − 1 . The mentioned results for the I4 treatment were from
    6.60 to 5.85 t ha − 1 . Water stress reduced the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model
    to K CTR changes. Fig. 4. Changes in the wheat grain yield based on changes in
    the maximum crop coefficient for transpiration ( K CTR ) in different irrigation
    treatments. Conversely, the sensitivity of AquaCrop to the changes in K CTR was
    lower than WP* in all four irrigation treatments. However, for K CTR , the decrease
    in sensitivity and the increase in water stress were more significant than the
    change in WP*. These results can also be obtained based on the changes in the
    slope of the regression line in Fig. 4. The changes in the regression line slope
    in treatments I2, I3, and I4 were 1.3%, 3.5%, and 8.4%, respectively, compared
    to I1. The slope of the regression line based on different HI values in treatments
    I1, I2, I3, and I4 was 0.142, 0.140, 0.136, and 0.130, respectively (Fig. 5).
    The decrease in the slope showed that the sensitivity of the AquaCrop to HI changes
    decreases with increasing water stress, which was similar to the two parameters
    WP* and K CTR . The sensitivity of the AquaCrop to the changes of this parameter
    was less than WP* and K CTR . For this reason, the sensitivity reduction changes
    from I1 to I4 for different HI values were lower than the two previously mentioned
    parameters. Fig. 5. Changes in the wheat grain yield based on changes in the harvest
    index (HI) in different irrigation treatments. Changes in wheat grain yield in
    different irrigation water treatments had a slight slope for the CCo parameter
    (Fig. 6). To increase the coefficient of determination values, the intercept in
    this parameter was not considered equal to zero. A slight direct relationship
    between CCo and wheat grain yield was observed. In the I1 treatment, grain yield
    changes ranged from 6.93 to 6.60 t ha − 1 . In fact, by determining the lower
    and upper bounds of CCo in this study (Table 6), only 0.33 t ha − 1 differences
    were observed for grain yield. If the amount of CCo approaches zero, the grain
    yield of wheat also approaches the value of 6.25 t ha − 1 , which is about 9.8%
    less than the maximum yield in Fig. 6. Increasing the amount of CCo to 10 cm 2
    plant − 1 , which is 14.2% more than the maximum CCo value in Table 6, increases
    the wheat grain yield to 7.0 t ha − 1 . This value is minimal, so in situations
    where the difference between observed and simulated yield is high, changing this
    parameter does not help to reduce the difference and bring the simulated result
    closer to the observed one. The increase in water stress in treatment I2 reduced
    the sensitivity of the AquaCrop to changes in this parameter by about 30% compared
    to treatment I1. The sensitivity of the AquaCrop model in two treatments, I3 and
    I4, was similar to I2. Therefore, the AquaCrop model was not sensitive to CCo
    under water stress conditions. The sensitivity of the AquaCrop to CGC changes
    was slightly higher than CCo, but the grain yield changes in this parameter were
    also minimal (Fig. 7). In treatment I1, changing the amount of CGC from 6.9% to
    2.9%/day caused the wheat grain yield to change from 6.98 to 6.30 t ha − 1 . By
    decreasing the CGC value close to zero, the wheat yield approaches 6.25 t ha −
    1 . Increasing CGC by 10%/day, the wheat grain yield approaches 7.0 t ha − 1 ,
    which shows a few changes. By increasing the water stress to treatment I2, the
    sensitivity of the AquaCrop decreases by 7.3% compared to the I1. In fact, for
    changing CGC, it could not be considered a big difference between irrigation treatments
    because the AquaCrop sensitivity was very close to each other. Indeed, the differences
    were insignificant. An inverse relationship between changes in CDC and wheat grain
    yield was observed, so the increase in CDC caused a decrease in grain yield (Fig.
    8). Although the grain yield changes were relative to the change in each CDC unit,
    it was observed that the AquaCrop’s sensitivity to this parameter’s changes was
    lower than WP*, K CTR and HI. The difference between the minimum and maximum grain
    yield in treatments I1, I2, I3, and I4 was 1.34, 1.27, 1.14, and 0.94 t ha − 1
    , respectively. Therefore, with the increase of water stress, the sensitivity
    of the AquaCrop to CDC decreased. Based on the results, the sensitivity of the
    AquaCrop model to the studied parameters can be considered as WP*, K CTR , HI,
    CDC, CGC, and CCo in order of priority. Therefore, changing two parameters, WP*
    and K CTR , in the calibration stage is preferable over other parameters. The
    two parameters, CGC and CCo, must be changed in the conditions where the results
    of simulation and observation are very close to each other. HI and CDC parameters
    need to be changed in situations where the observation and simulation yield are
    neither too close nor too far apart. In terms of priority, these are to be changed
    after changing parameters WP* and K CTR and before changing parameters CGC and
    CCo. Fig. 6. Changes in the wheat grain yield based on changes in the initial

    Fig. 8. Changes in the wheat grain yield based on changes in the canopy decline
    coefficient (CDC) in different irrigation treatments. Increasing-Decreasing Method
    The results of the increase-decreasing, based on the Raes et al. (2009) method
    (Eq. 8), were examined in two modes ( increasing : Sc + 0.25 % and decreasing:
    Sc-0.25%) for each input parameter. In decreasing mode, the AquaCrop was extremely
    sensitive to the three parameters WP*, K CTR , and HI (Table 7). These results
    are similar to Figs. 3–8. For WP*, Sc values were equal to 26, and there were
    no differences among irrigation treatments. In the increasing mode, the sensitivity
    value decreased only in treatment I1, although the value of Sc was also high in
    this treatment and was constant for other irrigation treatments. Therefore, in
    this method, the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model in all irrigation treatments
    was constant with increasing and decreasing WP* values. These results were in
    disagreement with Fig. 3 because the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model to WP*
    changes must decrease with increasing water stress. In the decreasing mode, the
    sensitivity of the AquaCrop to K CTR changes was extreme in all irrigation treatments.
    However, in the increasing mode, the sensitivity to K CTR decreased with increasing
    water stress. These results are similar to Fig. 4. Indeed, the sensitivity value
    changed from 18 (extreme class) to 13 (moderate class). The AquaCrop’s sensitivity
    to HI in both increasing and decreasing modes was in the extreme class and was
    almost equal for all irrigation treatments. These results are somewhat consistent
    with Fig. 5 because the sensitivity to HI was less affected by water stress compared
    to WP* and K CTR . Sensitivity values for CCo were lower than other parameters.
    In addition, the AquaCrop model was insensitive to CCo in water stress, which
    is highlighted in Fig. 6. In both increasing and decreasing modes, the sensitivity
    of the AquaCrop model to CGC was moderate in all irrigation treatments. However,
    the sensitivity values were lower in increasing mode. Sensitivity values for CDC
    were in the moderate class. The values for the increasing mode were higher than
    the decreasing one. In rainfed conditions, the AquaCrop model was not sensitive
    to the CDC changes. In general, AquaCrop’s sensitivity to CDC decreased by water
    stress. The results are obtained in Fig. 8. Table 7. AquaCrop parameters sensitivity

    the increasing-decreasing method by Kinton (1994), in irrigation treatment I1,
    in decreasing mode, the sensitivity of the AquaCrop was extreme to WP* and K CTR
    , highly to HI and moderate to other parameters. Water stress decreased the sensitivity
    of the AquaCrop model to CCo, CGC, and CDC. In all irrigation treatments, the
    sensitivity of the AquaCrop model to HI, WP*, and K CTR was moderate or extreme.
    This result was also observed in the increasing mode for these parameters. However,
    the sensitivity of this model to K CTR decreased in increasing mode. Only the
    CDC parameter followed a regular trend concerning the change in the amount of
    irrigation water, so the increase in water stress caused a decrease in the AquaCrop
    sensitivity. In Kinton’s (1994) method, sensitivity coefficient values of CCo
    and CGC were lower than the others. CGC sensitivity values were higher than CCo,
    which is in agreement with Raes et al. (2009) and Figs. 6 and 7. Therefore, the
    increasing-decreasing method by Raes et al. (2009) seems to be better than the
    method by Kinton (1994). Although the results were generally similar to the general
    sensitivity analysis in Figs. 3–8, the process of changes was not exactly the
    same as the results obtained in these figures. Therefore, the increasing-decreasing
    method is generally suitable but does not lead to accurate calibration. McCuen
    Method The sensitivity coefficient of WP*, Kc, CCo, CGC, CDC, and HI parameters
    for different amounts of irrigation water using the MacCuen method is shown in
    Fig. 9. The AquaCrop was the most sensitive to the change of the WP* parameter
    in all irrigation treatments. These results were also obtained in Fig. 3. The
    sensitivity index variation for this parameter was between 1.23 and 1.37. According
    to Table 5, the sensitivity to this parameter was extreme ( S p ≥ 1.0 ). The AquaCrop
    model had a sensitivity index in the range of 0.91–0.98 for the K CTR parameter,
    which was high and classified into III categories. The sensitivity of the AquaCrop
    model to the HI parameter was high ( S p ≥ 1.0 ), but its sensitivity value was
    about 16.3% lower than K CTR . These results can also be obtained by comparing
    the results in Figs. 4 and 5. Although the sensitivity of the AquaCrop to CGC
    was also high ( S p ≥ 1.0 ), the sensitivity index of this parameter was not significantly
    different for different irrigation treatments. The sensitivity index of AquaCrop
    for CGC was 67.4% and 60.9% lower than K CTR and HI parameters, respectively.
    The sensitivity of the AquaCrop to CDC changes was in the range of 0.22–0.36.
    In treatment I1, the sensitivity of the AquaCrop to changes in CDC was higher
    than CGC. However, with the increase of water stress, the sensitivity of the AquaCrop
    to CDC decreased and approached the sensitivity index for the CGC parameter. The
    sensitivity index of the CDC parameter was negative. The reason is that with these
    parameter changes, the grain yield simulated by the AquaCrop changes inversely.
    These results are also shown in Fig. 8. These results were similar to the trends
    in Figs. 3–8. For this reason, this method is accurate enough to show the sensitivity
    of the AquaCrop model to changes in input parameters, and its use leads to more
    accurate calibration. Fig. 9. AquaCrop sensitivity coefficient based on the McCuen
    method in different irrigation treatment. Gamma Test As described in the Materials
    and Methods section, the approach utilized in this study is a nonlinear modeling
    method, which was adapted from the methodology outlined in Remesan et al. (2008).
    For each treatment, three sets of results are shown in Table 8. The first category
    shows a rank between 1 and 7 among all 64 masks. This ranking shows which parameter
    removal had the least effect on the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model. In the
    second category, six masks are shown, which include the general mask (111111)
    and the mask with each parameter removed (e.g., 111110, which indicates the removal
    of the HI parameter). The rank of each mask shows how much the effect of removing
    each parameter had on the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model. An increase in the
    rank indicates a decrease in the sensitivity of the AquaCrop model to that parameter
    was removed. In the third category, six masks are shown, considering only one
    parameter. The lower value of each rank indicates the importance of the parameter
    in that mask. Table 8. Gamma test results for each irrigation treatment I1 I2

    0.3273 − 0.5945 19 1 − 0.1454 0.3313 − 0.5818 a The digit in each mask represents
    CCo, CGC, CDC, K CTR , WP*, and HI, respectively. Zero shows the parameter absent,
    and 1 indicates the parameter present. Due to the previous description, in the
    I1 treatment, the first rank among all masks was obtained by removing CCo (Table
    8). Therefore, this parameter had the least effect on the sensitivity analysis
    of the AquaCrop model. Removing CCO and CGC led to the second rank for mask 010111.
    The ranking of masks 111110 and 111101 showed that the sensitivity of the AquaCrop
    model to HI and WP* was higher than other parameters. In treatment I2, the 011111
    mask, obtained by removing CCo, had the first rank. Mask 000110, which included
    two parameters, K CTR and WP*, won the second rank. The highest sensitivity in
    the I2 treatment was assigned to WP* and HI. In the I2 treatment, the role of
    K CTR was greater than its role in the I1 treatment. These results were also observed
    in two treatments, I3 and I4. The results of this method were close to the general
    sensitivity analysis in Figs. 3–8. and the McCuen Method, but the priority between
    the two HI and K CTR parameters in I1 was different from them. In the condition
    of water stress, the gamma test results were similar to the two mentioned methods.
    Conclusion In the study, three methods were used for the sensitivity analysis
    of AquaCrop to six input parameters. The input parameters were WP*, K CTR , HI,
    CGC, CDC, and CCo. The general sensitivity analysis results showed that, except
    for CDC, there was a direct relationship with other parameters. For this reason,
    in the calibration stage, if the simulated wheat grain yield is greater than the
    observed one, the value of CDC must be increased, and the value of other parameters
    must be decreased. A comparison of the three studied methods revealed that only
    the McCuen method showed the relation between input parameters and wheat grain
    yield. Based on the McCuen method, AquaCrop’s sensitivity to the WP* parameter
    was higher than other parameters. The sensitivity index of the CCo parameter was
    high, and the sensitivity index of other parameters was moderate. Among the parameters
    with moderate sensitivity, the highest and lowest sensitivity were observed in
    the K CTR and CGC parameters, respectively. Based on the results of the gamma
    test, the sensitivity was extreme to HI and WP*, highly to K CTR , moderate to
    CGC and CDC and insensitive to CCo. The comparison of gamma test results with
    increasing-decreasing methods showed that the highest sensitivity of the AquaCrop
    model was assigned to the WP* parameter. The model had high sensitivity to K CTR
    and HI and moderate sensitivity to the other methods. In addition, it was observed
    that changing the CC O parameter had the least effect on the sensitivity of the
    AquaCrop model. The McCuen Method had closer results to results obtained from
    the simulated outputs of wheat grain from the AquaCrop model when input parameters
    were varied. As a result, the McCuen Method is suggested for sensitivity analysis
    compared to the other two methods (Table 9). However, the gamma test also provided
    good results and can be used to analyze more scenarios. Finally, by knowing the
    amount of difference between the simulated and observed wheat grain yield, it
    is easy to understand which parameter change could reduce this difference and
    increase the AquaCrop accuracy in the calibration stage. So, in the calibration
    stage, changing two parameters, WP* and K CTR , is preferable over other parameters.
    HI and CDC parameters need to be changed when the observation and simulation yield
    are neither too close nor too far apart. CGC and CCo must be changed in conditions
    where the results of simulation and observation are very close to each other.
    With the increase of water stress, the sensitivity of AquaCrop decreased to the
    change of the value of all parameters except CCo (Table 10). Therefore, knowing
    the amount of irrigation water is also important in the calibration stage. Since
    the validation stage is used after the calibration, the type of irrigation treatments
    in both calibration and validation stages must be the same. It helps to reduce
    the error of the AquaCrop in water stress conditions. Table 9. Comparison of the

    using machine learning tools Article 20 September 2021 Introduction Agriculture
    consumes about 70–90% of the world’s water resources (Bian et al., 2019). The
    availability of water for crops and their resistance to shortages during growth
    affect the overall yield, quality, and profitability of field produce. With global
    climate change and the growing imbalance between water supply and demand, farmers
    are dealing with increasing shortages in agricultural water resources (García-Tejero
    et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to develop tools to monitor crop water
    status on a large scale and at low cost (Khanal et al., 2017). Drip-irrigation
    systems were developed to increase water-use efficiency by directing the wetting
    front to the root zone; which can increase crop yield by 20–90% (Postel, 2001),
    use 30–50% less water than traditional surface-irrigation techniques and reach
    90–95% irrigation efficiency (World Bank, 2006). An additional step toward improving
    water-use efficiency is to bury the drip-irrigation line in the soil. Subsurface
    drip irrigation has been extensively investigated with many crops and has been
    shown to improve irrigation and nutrient management while maximizing yield and
    decreasing water consumption (Phene et al., 1987). However, due to improper maintenance
    or operation of the irrigation system (e.g., physical damage caused by vehicles
    and/or animals or use of low-quality water( (Dag et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2015c),
    malfunctions frequently occur, appearing as leaks or clogs in the irrigation lines.
    Leaks refer to water flow in excess of the designed drip discharge. Major incidents
    of leaks occur when the emitters or the laterals are broken and there is an uncontrolled
    flow of water to the soil. Less severe leaks would occur from malfunctioning emitters
    that emit significantly more water than the designed amount. Clogs refer to emitters
    that fail to provide the designed amount of water due to physical clogging of
    the emitting device. Severe clog incidents occur when the water flow is completely
    blocked, while less severe clogs would occur when there is a partial decrease
    in the designed discharge. These have both direct and indirect effects on within-field
    yield variability. Directly, water is lost by surface or subsurface flow to unwanted
    areas near the field or by infiltration into the groundwater; indirectly, they
    cause significant decreases in overall yield, and in the quality and profitability
    of field production (Ihuoma & Madramootoo, 2017). Therefore, frequent on-site
    monitoring of irrigation systems is an important task for farmers, but it is also
    tedious, costly, labor-intensive, and generally difficult to implement on a regular
    basis. Moreover, certain malfunctions in subsurface-irrigation systems may not
    be easily noticeable and can only be detected when the plant displays visible
    stress. Unfortunately, it is usually too late to prevent any harm to the plant’s
    growth and development. Water status in orchard crops can be estimated by physiological
    measurements, such as stem water potential (SWP), leaf water potential, and stomatal
    conductance (Ihuoma & Madramootoo, 2017). These effectively measure the water
    status but require measuring each plant separately. Furthermore, measuring a sample
    of plants from the entire field does not indicate the water status of the entire
    field (García-Tejero et al., 2018). To estimate the latter, many point measurements
    are required, resulting in high equipment and manpower costs due to the tedious
    work and intensive labor needed (Dag et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Ihuoma & Madramootoo,
    2017). Early detection of irrigation-pipe clogging or leaking in the field can
    enable targeting cleaning processes and avoiding the replacement of laterals (Dag
    et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). More recent modern techniques to estimate water-stress
    levels (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012) use the strong link between physiological measurements
    and water evaporation from the leaf through stomata, represented by temperature.
    One of the plant''s responses to water shortage is stomatal closing to control
    plant water loss (Fuchs & Stanghellini, 2018). Opening of the stomata results
    in an increase in transpiration rate. In this process, the water released from
    the leaf stomata consumes energy and reduces the leaf temperature (Han et al.,
    2016). Conversely, as stomata close under water deficit, leaf temperature rises.
    Thus, leaf or canopy temperature can be used as an indicator of stomatal closure
    and consequently, plant stress (Fuchs & Stanghellini, 2018; Jackson et al., 1981).
    Indicators derived from high-resolution airborne thermal imagery have accurately
    described the spatial heterogeneity of water status in orchards by targeting individual
    plant crowns (Bellvert et al., 2016; Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013), using both manned
    platforms and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) (Berni et al., 2009; Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2012, 2013; Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2006). Remote-sensing-derived indicators
    enable mapping water stress over large spaces, and studies have revealed that
    high-resolution airborne thermal imagery enables the assessment of discontinuous
    canopies because pure plant crowns can be targeted, thus eliminating background
    effects (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013). There are many previous studies on remote
    sensing and machine learning for crop water stress (Virnodkar et al., 2020), however,
    to the best of our knowledge there are no papers in the peer reviewed literature
    for detecting malfunctions in the irrigation lines. A preliminary study within
    our group that was presented in a conference (Kalo et al., 2021) showed the feasibility
    of identifying irrigation malfunctions in drip systems by thermal images using
    machine learning for a case study of olive plants. Data from 100 ha of olive groves
    were collected using an airborne thermal camera. Results were 89.5% and 87.5%
    accurate in detecting leaks and clogs, respectively, using random forest (RF)
    algorithms (Kalo et al., 2021). Accurate predictions can be challenging, and the
    situation is further complicated when the classifier is required to distinguish
    between several classes to make predictions. Thus, numerous efforts have been
    made to improve the performance of classifiers (Silva-Palacios et al., 2017).
    Basic classification approaches (multiclass, binary) give poor results, producing
    a high rate of missed malfunctions (false-negative rate [FNR]) and a high false
    alarm rate (false-positive rate [FPR]). In multiclass classification, Silva-Palacios
    et al. (2017) showed that classification performance can be improved by decomposing
    the multiclass problem into a hierarchy of smaller or less complex intermediate
    classification problems (Silva-Palacios et al., 2017). There are no known studies
    on fully automated georeferenced detection of small-scale irrigation malfunctions
    in subsurface drip irrigation systems. The objective of this study was to develop
    an automated method to detect malfunctions in drip irrigation systems using thermal
    remote sensing in commercial orchards in semiarid areas. In this study, different
    approaches were developed and evaluated to improve classification and to distinguish
    between malfunctions. They were developed and evaluated on a case study of almond
    plant (Prunus dulcis) orchards and tested in a jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) plantation.
    The specific objectives were to: (i) extract features for classification based
    on temperature and image-processing algorithms; (ii) develop a pipeline that classifies
    between plants under normal and malfunctioning conditions using classification
    models; (iii) evaluate the performance on different types of crops (almonds and
    jojoba). The study aimed to develop a system for detecting irrigation malfunctions.
    An effective system would be considered one that detects most of the malfunctions
    while minimizing false alarms. Materials and methods Plant material and field
    campaigns Three field campaigns were conducted, two in commercial almond plants
    orchards in two different geographical regions in July 2020, and another in a
    commercial jojoba plantation in July 2022 (Table 1). Based on the type of crop
    and their biological taxonomy, the nomenclature used throughout the paper will
    vary, referring to both almond and jojoba as plants. Table 1 Description of the
    fields tested in the field campaigns Full size table A manual scan for detecting
    malfunctions was performed at each site by scouting the almond and jojoba orchards.
    Plants in which evidence of excess water (increased growth, weed vegetation, increased
    soil moisture) or water shortage (signs of soil drought or plants exhibiting water-stress
    symptoms) was observed were marked with a marking tape with a unique ID number
    and their location was recorded using a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS (Fig. 1a,
    b and c). These plants were labeled as suspected for leaks or clogs, respectively.
    The location of the malfunctions was geotagged using a handheld RTK GPS receiver
    (Spectra Precision SP60 receiver, Trimble, Westminster, CO, USA) (accuracy of
    1 cm) with GIS software (ArcPad, Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). All other plants were
    considered normal (no malfunction detected). SWP, a direct measurement of water
    status in the stem, was measured in the suspected plants with an ARIMAD-7000 pressure
    chamber (MRC Ltd., Holon, Israel). Table 2 details the distribution of the scouted
    plants in each location (dataset). Fig. 1 Thermal mosaics for each dataset with
    locations of irrigation system malfunctions: a Lavi—almonds, b Kedma—almonds c

    of the country Full size image Table 2 Description of the labeled data for each
    location Full size table In Kedma and Lavi, SWP was measured on visually tagged
    plants, whereas in Sde David, SWP was measured on plants selected from the thermal
    image. In Kedma and Sde David, the SWP measurements were conducted on pre-wrapped,
    shaded leaves after an equilibration period of 2 h. In Lavi, SWP measurements
    were conducted on shaded leaves without pre-wrapping (a small branch was cut and
    immediately wrapped). In the jojoba orchard, following the image acquisition and
    the SWP measurements, eight plants were chosen from locations that were suspected
    for malfunctions (four labeled as leaks and four as clogs), and their irrigation
    pipes were unburied from the ground and were sent to the laboratory to test the
    drippers functionality. Thermal image acquisition Thermal images were acquired
    using a FLIR A655SC infrared camera (FLIR Systems, Melville, NY, USA) with a resolution
    of 640 × 480 pixels, sensitive in the spectral range of 7.5–13 μm, with an accuracy
    of ± 2 °C or ± 2% of the reading, and with a thermal sensitivity of < 0.05 °C
    @ + 30 °C/50 mK. The camera uses an uncooled microbolometer detector and is able
    to detect objects in a temperature range from − 20 to + 150 °C. The camera was
    equipped with a 13 mm focal length lens (field of view of 45o) and was mounted
    on a DJI Matrice 600 Pro UAV (Nanshan, Shenzhen, China). A single-board computer
    (Intel NUC, CPU i5) controlled the thermal camera and stored the image stream
    during the mission. The UAV flew at a height of 100 m above ground level (AGL)
    at a velocity of 5 m s−1. The acquisition path was planned with 80% overlap between
    neighboring legs and 80% overlap along the flight leg. The resulting ground spatial
    resolution was 0.13 m pixel-1 from the flight altitude AGL mentioned above. The
    images were acquired between 11:00 and 13:00 to ensure high solar radiation for
    plant photosynthesis and to avoid typical afternoon strong winds during the campaigns.
    Mosaics (Fig. 1) were created. ThermCam software (FLIR® Systems, Inc., Billerica,
    MA, USA) and Pix4D mapper software (Pix4D, Prilly, Switzerland) or Agisoft software
    package (Metashape professional 1.6.5). The thermal datasets were acquired along
    three years, and different orthomosaicing packages were available at each time.
    Six ground control points (GCP) were placed on the orchard edges and one GCP was
    placed inside the orchard. The GCPs consisted of 1 × 1 m “X” shaped objects, covered
    by aluminum, to be clearly seen in the thermal image (due to the low emissivity
    of aluminum). The coordinates of the GCP were measured using a real-time kinematic
    (RTK) GPS (Spectra Precision SP60 receiver) to increase the accuracy of the images’
    photogrammetric processing. In addition, meteorological data were measured during
    the air campaigns. A mobile meteorological station was placed in the field and
    recorded air temperature (°C), relative humidity, solar radiation (W m−2), wind
    speed (m s−1), and wind direction 2 m aboveground. The sampling rate was 0.1 Hz
    and 1-min averages were logged in a data-acquisition controller (CR10X, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). Datasets The almond plants dataset (denoted as “combined”)
    was composed of data from the campaigns at the two locations (Lavi and Kedma)
    and included 434 records (73 clogs, 202 leaks, and 159 normal). The jojoba plants
    dataset included data from the campaign at Sde David with 870 records (349 clogs,
    163 leaks, and 358 normal). The records included thermographic measurements from
    thermal imaging of the plants, meteorological measurements collected simultaneously,
    and calculated features from the raw data. Image processing The image-processing
    phase (Fig. 2) included three main stages: pre-processing, image segmentation,
    and plant detection. The workflow was implemented in MATLAB© version R2020a (MathWorks
    Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Fig. 2 Flow diagram of the image processing process. It
    includes three steps: a Pre-processing, b Image segmentation and c Plant detection
    Full size image Pre-processing (Fig. 2a) included splitting the thermal image
    mosaic into plots, to generate a separate georeferenced image for each plot. For
    each plot, a separate image and TFW file were created. This was performed to enable
    to perform image processing on each plot separately since many image processing
    methods are not suitable for segmenting thermal images with multiple objects whose
    temperatures differ greatly. Then, a pixel conversion was performed: pixels with
    extreme values (compared to the air temperature—such as negative values) were
    set to zero, and pixels with values higher than 60 °C were set to the maximum
    value. Finally, two parameters were extracted using the bi-modal behavior of the
    histogram of the thermal image: the peak with the lower values corresponds to
    canopy and the peak with the higher values corresponds to soil. These parameters
    were later used as input for the image segmentation algorithms. In the image segmentation
    stage (Fig. 2b), the thermal image of each plot was segmented into two classes,
    vegetation, and soil, using three segmentation techniques: Otsu (Otsu, 1979),
    continuous max-flow and min-cut (Yuan et al., 2010), and full-width-half-max (Rud
    et al., 2015). The temperature histogram of the field was used to create the two
    classes. The Otsu’s automatic thresholding method (Otsu, 1979) was used to overcome
    the inconsistency of the remote sensed images. The spatially continuous max-flow
    and min-cut (CMF) framework was used to overcome the binary labelling problems
    (Yuan et al., 2010). The Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) rule was used to distinguish
    the pixels with a high probability of being vegetation from pixels that were likely
    to be soil. Since FWHM is known as unsuitable for segmenting thermal images with
    multiple plants that differ greatly in their temperature, the rule was computed
    for each plot separately. A thermal image of the plot was used as input to all
    segmentation algorithms, and the CMF algorithm also used vegetation and soil class
    characteristics values which were determined by the two peaks of the Gaussian
    curve; the output was a binary mask of the thermal image. In the plant detection
    stage (Fig. 2c), plants were detected using different methods including morphological
    methods, the watershed algorithm, and a distance matrix (Image Segmentation, Image
    Processing Toolbox, MATLAB). Morphological methods included image opening, creation
    of an inverted mask, detection of regional minima in the distance matrix and modification
    of the image to preserve regional minima at non-zero pixels in a mask representing
    plant centroids. The watershed algorithm (Meyer, 1994) has been successfully applied
    to detect plant crowns in remote thermal images of palm plants (Cohen et al.,
    2012), almond plants (Camino et al., 2018) and mangrove plants in which a pre-processing
    using Otsu''s threshold method and morphological operations were also included
    (Biswas et al., 2020). Using the watershed method requires two critical steps
    for accurate identification of plant crowns: generating a binary grayscale image
    and delineating markers. The reason for using the watershed procedure to identify
    a canopy in thermal photographs is that canopy objects are colder than the ground
    around them and can be considered as depressions that fill up gradually until
    their threshold temperature is reached. The best result of the algorithm will
    be a single basin for each plant. Input to the watershed algorithm was the distance
    matrix of the initial mask, which contains the Euclidean distance between a pixel
    and its nearest nonzero pixel; the output was a final mask. Afterwards, the ‘bwconncomp’
    function (pixel connectivity set to 8) was used to find connected components in
    the final binary image (Region and Image Properties, Image Processing Toolbox,
    MATLAB). This function returns a variable (CC) containing the connected components
    found, which is used by the ‘regionprops’ function. The ‘regionprops’ function
    returns a table containing information about each object and its pixels which
    used to calculate the predictor variables of the model. Feature extraction In
    the image processing stage, a binary mask was automatically created for each plant.
    The mask consisted of zeros and ones. Pixels representing the plant''s pixels
    were assigned a value of one and all other pixels were assigned the value of zero.
    Features were extracted from the thermal ortho-mosaics. The values in the thermal
    image represent the absolute temperature of each pixel, as obtained from the camera.
    Using each plant''s binary mask, the plant''s pixels on the thermal image were
    selected and its characteristic features were calculated, e.g., the maximum temperature
    of the selected pixels was the ‘Max’ feature of the corresponding plant, the median
    temperature of the selected pixels was the ''Median'' feature of the plant, etc.
    Table 3 depicts the features extracted from each plant. Table 3 Features description
    Full size table In addition, average and median temperatures were calculated in
    four circular subregions of the plant: three ring-shaped regions were defined
    and one core region, as described in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Thermal images of a plant
    after applying one of the created masks and four circular subregions of the plant:
    three ring-shaped regions were defined and one core region Full size image Meteorological
    data There were significant temperature variations due to the large areas covered
    during the imaging flight times. Using data from the UAV flight log and the meteorological
    station placed in the field, an algorithm was developed to extract the air temperature
    at a specific acquisition time. Based on the assumption that the image was acquired
    when the UAV was closest to the plant, the exact time for each plant was extracted
    from the flight log. Based on the acquisition time of each image, the corresponding
    air temperature for each plant was derived from the data provided from the meteorological
    station. In order to account for the prevailing environmental conditions on the
    effect of plant''s water status on its canopy temperature, all of the features
    were normalized by the air temperature at the time of image acquisition. Analysis
    and feature selection Outliers were defined as data points that were 1.5 times
    the IQR above the upper quartile and below the lower quartile (Q1−1.5 * IQR or
    Q3 + 1.5 * IQR). Data points that were defined as outliers in more than one feature
    were removed. Outliers were removed for each individual dataset, rather than from
    the combined dataset. The correlation between the features was examined by Pearson’s
    correlation coefficient, p. In addition, the partial correlation coefficient controlling
    the confounding variable was also examined (Frank, 2000) by partial and non-partial
    Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. When features were highly correlated
    (p > 0.7), the ones with the lower correlation with the target variable were removed
    (Fig. 4). This is an iterative process that ends when all the remaining features
    are uncorrelated. Then, a feature-selection process was performed using recursive
    feature elimination with cross-validation. RF was used as an estimator and the
    Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) score was used to optimize the results
    in all four confusion matrix categories. Cross-validation was conducted by repeated
    stratified K-fold tests when splits = 5 and repeats = 5 (Scikit-learn: Machine
    Learning in Python, Pedregosa et al., JMLR 12, pp. 2825–2830, 2011). Fig. 4 Flow
    diagram of the process of removing highly correlated features Full size image
    Model selection Due to imbalance in the number of malfunction and normal samples,
    as well as multicollinearity between the features, it was necessary to examine
    the algorithms'' suitability for this type of data. Accordingly, the following
    supervised learning algorithms were examined: SVM, RF, decision tree, naïve Bayes
    and logistic regression—L1 (LR). The classification algorithms were compared according
    to their ability to accurately predict output values (malfunctions) given new
    input data. The datasets were divided into training and test sets. The test sets
    were used only for the evaluation of the final model, as depicted in Table 4.
    The same training and test sets were used for all the models. The evaluation of
    the combined dataset involved assessing two different sizes of training sets:
    one comprising 70% of the dataset and the other consisting of 80% of the dataset.
    Table 4 Description of the splits for the training and test sets Full size table
    The best classifier model from the five algorithms described above was selected
    after automatic hyperparameter tuning was conducted using K-fold cross-validation
    (K = 5) with n = 5 repetitions of the training set. The hyperparameter values
    for each algorithm were automatically tuned using grid search implemented in Python.
    All features were given equal weight quality and learning rate to improve the
    models'' accuracy. Standardization was performed for the LR and SVM algorithms
    because it effectively handles outliers. As for the naive Bayes model, minmax
    normalization was applied because it provides a uniform scale for all the features
    (Dhaka et al., 2021). Normalization and standardization were conducted with a
    Python script. Classification models The following supervised learning approaches
    were examined for classification (Fig. 5): binary (malfunction, normal), multiclass
    (clog, leak, normal), and hierarchical (clog, leak, normal). In the multiclass
    approach a categorical variable with three labels was defined as the target variable,
    in addition a separate feature selection process was conducted when considering
    the target variable as ordinal (0-clog, 1- normal, 2-leak). Fig. 5 Schematic description
    of the examined classification approaches Full size image After examining the
    properties for each class it was noticed that there is an overlap in the values
    of the clog and normal classes. The hierarchical approach aims to address this
    overlap and solves two simpler scenarios by using two stages and is illustrated
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Hierarchical classification approach flow diagram. TP true positive,
    FP false positive, TN true negative, FN false negative Full size image Stage 1
    (Classifier 1) Classification was performed between (clog) and (leak + normal),
    aimed to handle the overlap between the clog and normal classes in the almond
    datasets; therefore, the target variable labels were P for clog and N for normal
    and leak samples. After the prediction was made, leak samples that had been classified
    as P were considered as true positive (TP) as they had been identified as irrigation
    malfunctions. Normal samples that were classified as P were considered false positive
    (FP) (false alarm for malfunction) (Table 5). The samples which were classified
    as N (false negative [FN] + true negative [TN]) at this stage were sent to the
    second classification stage. Table 5 Confusion matrix of the first stage of the
    hierarchical classification model Full size table Stage 2 (Classifier 2) Classification
    was performed between [normal] and [leak], aimed to handle the overlap between
    normal and leak classes in the almond datasets; therefore, the target variable
    labels were P for leak and N for normal samples. However, there were some clog
    samples that were classified in the positive category and proceeded to stage 2.
    Training clog samples at stage 2 were handled and examined in three different
    ways. The first method was to label clog as leak—the positive class; the second
    was to label clog as normal—the negative class; and the last was to eliminate
    clog samples from the second stage of training. Performance measures The training
    set was used for feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and finally, model selection.
    Through cross-validation on the training set, training and validation sets were
    generated. The test set was used to evaluate the final model (algorithm + classification
    model); the final model was first trained on the training dataset (without cross-validation)
    and then evaluated on the test dataset. The class set contained three labels:
    leak and clog—which were considered irrigation malfunctions, and normal—which
    was considered a normal condition. Both cases of a leak classified as a clog or
    a clog classified as a leak were considered TP since it was regarded as a malfunction
    and was considered the least severe error. Given a classifier and an instance,
    the four possible outcomes were (Table 6): TP: there is an irrigation malfunction,
    and it is classified as a malfunction. FN: there is an irrigation malfunction,
    and it is classified as normal. TN: there is a normal condition, and it is classified
    as normal. FP: there is a normal condition, and it is classified as a malfunction.
    Table 6 Confusion matrix Full size table Table 6 presents the standard classification
    metrics that were used to evaluate the classification approaches. Results Ground
    truth In the almond datasets, measurement of SWP revealed an overlap between normal
    conditions and leak malfunctions, whereas the SWP range for clogs was quite different
    from them, with higher values. Most of the leaks were primarily caused by animals
    damaging the irrigation system due to the shallow depths at which the laterals
    were placed (0.1 m). In the jojoba plantation, the SWP for the clogged drippers
    was higher than that for the normal and leak conditions. Dripper clogging was
    caused by root penetration. Leaking in some drippers was caused by salt deposits
    on the diaphragm, which reduced its flexibility and caused an increase in flow
    (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Images from the laboratory tests. a Drippers labeled as leaky.
    b Drippers labeled as clogged Full size image Removing outliers Application of
    the rules described in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section for outlier detection
    resulted in the removal of 26 outliers in the Lavi dataset, 15 in the Kedma dataset
    and 107 in the Sde David dataset. This yielded a total of 395 and 763 records
    for the almond and jojoba orchards, respectively (See Table 7). Table 7 Calculation
    formulas and explanation for classification metrics Full size table Removal of
    highly correlated variables Using the iterative process described in the ‘Materials
    and Methods’ section, features that were highly correlated (p > 0.8) were excluded.
    Table 8 presents the iterations of the feature removal process for each dataset
    individually ([Kedma & Lavi], [Kedma], [Lavi] and [Sde David]). The Spearman correlation
    coefficients of the examined feature with the target variable in each step is
    depicted. Shaded cells indicate higher coefficients compared to the removed feature.
    The following ten features were excluded: Mean, Max, MAD, kurtosis, Diff_mean_of_plot,
    Diff_median_of_row, Mean_first_ring, Mean_second_ring, Mean_third_ring, Mean_core.
    Table 8 Summary of the feature removal iterations and Spearman correlation coefficients
    with the target variable Full size table Feature selection The most significant
    variables found were ‘CWSI_minus_CWSI_of_row’, which were selected in 16 out of
    18 selection events, followed by ‘Min’ (minimum temperature) which was chosen
    in 15 out of 18 combinations. This result is in line with Spearman''s partial
    rank correlation, which showed that ‘CWSI_minus_CWSI_of_row’ was the highest-ranking
    positive correlation variable (p = 0.42) and that ‘Min’ was the highest-ranking
    negative correlation variable (p = − 0.51). The ''CWSI_minus_CWSI_of_row’ variable
    represents the difference between the CWSI of the plant and the mean CWSI of the
    entire row. This metric is a crucial indicator of localized water stress in the
    crop. When this variable consistently appears as a significant feature, it suggests
    that the deviation between plant-level and row-level water stress is a critical
    factor in understanding the overall crop performance. Higher positive correlations
    indicate that as ‘CWSI_minus_CWSI_of_row’ increases, crop stress tends to be more
    localized to individual plants, which can be valuable information for targeted
    malfunction. Conversely, ‘Min’ refers to the minimum temperature within the plant’s
    canopy, subtracted from the air temperature measured simultaneously. A consistently
    high negative correlation suggests that lower canopy temperatures, compared to
    the surrounding air temperature, have a pronounced impact on crop performance.
    This might indicate that extreme temperature variability within the plant canopy
    can lead to increased stress or growth anomalies in the crop. Mixed datasets consisting
    of Kedma and Lavi required more features for the model (on average 16 features)
    than a single dataset (on average 9 features). This could be because plants with
    equal water stress have different temperatures under various meteorological conditions,
    causing a larger unexplained variability. Particularly, the need for more features
    in mixed datasets implies that plants under the same level of water stress respond
    differently to temperature variations based on the specific meteorological conditions
    in their surroundings. The selected features for each algorithm are shown in Table
    9 including each feature''s rank after implementing recursive feature elimination
    using RF. Table 9 Results of feature selection for each combination of classification
    approaches and the rank for each feature Full size table Classification analysis
    The accuracy, MCC, FNR, FPR, and F1 score revealed that SVM and RF produce the
    best classification results among all examined models. As already noted, two options
    for feature selection were considered: the first used a categorical target variable,
    and the second, a variable of an ordinal type. The features selected based on
    the categorical type variable did not improve classification performance (Table
    9). Multiclass classification The results of the multiclass classification are
    shown in Table 10. Table 10 Results of the multiclass classification approach
    applied with different datasets Full size table Almond datasets Comparing single-site
    datasets, Lavi showed better performance than Kedma, with a MCC value of 0.52
    vs. 0.28. The reason for this difference may be that Lavi contained only two classes
    (Leak, Normal), whereas Kedma contained three classes (Leak, Clog, Normal), making
    it harder to classify the data. This difference can also be seen when comparing
    the results of the combined dataset (MCC of 0.28). The FNR (error type 1—missing
    a malfunction) achieved by the combined dataset was higher than that of Kedma.
    This could be because plants with similar water stress have different temperatures
    under different meteorological conditions, resulting in larger unexplained variability
    between samples from different sites. The Kedma and the Combined (with three classes)
    datasets, performed poorly in terms of FPR (error type 2)—50% for Kedma and 39%
    for the combined set. Lavi dataset yielded better results, with a FPR of 19%,
    because the problem was less complex. Jojoba datasets The best performance was
    achieved for the Sde David dataset, with a MCC value of 0.63. The better results
    may be attributed to two factors: firstly, Sde David had a larger number of records
    in the training set, and secondly, it exhibited larger differences in the canopy
    temperature values between the malfunction types. Sde David resulted with the
    lowest FPR of 10%. Binary classification The results of the binary classification
    are shown in Table 11. Table 11 Results of the binary classification approach
    by datasets Full size table Almond datasets When comparing single-site datasets,
    Lavi showed better performance than Kedma, with a MCC value of 0.4 compared to
    0.2. This difference may be related to the fact that the positive class of Kedma
    was created by joining two types of malfunctions which were quite different in
    their range of predictor values. This merge caused the FNR to increase from 21%
    (in the multiclass approach) to 24%, and the FPR to increase from 51 to 56% in
    the Kedma dataset. However, performance improved slightly for the combined dataset.
    MCC was increased from 0.28 to 0.29 and FNR decreased by 4%, but FPR increased
    by 3%. In comparison with the multiclass approach, the binary approach achieved
    relatively poor results across the almond dataset algorithms. Jojoba datasets
    Sde David contained three classes. The fact that the positive class was created
    by joining two types of malfunctions, which were quite different in their range
    of predictor values, resulted in relatively poor results compared to the multiclass
    approach—MCC of 0.61, and FNR of leak and clog of 8% and 20%, respectively. Hierarchical
    classification Basic classification methods (multiclass, binary) produced a high
    rate of missed malfunctions (FNR) and false alarms (FPR), with a FNR of 33% and
    a FPR of 40% in the combined dataset. This is in line with the ground truth which
    revealed a significant overlap between the normal class and the leak and clog
    classes. A hierarchical classification approach was used to overcome this limitation.
    The implementation of this approach could not be examined in the Lavi dataset
    since it had only two classes. Stage 1—classification between [clog] and [leak + normal]
    The results of the first classification stage of the hierarchical classification
    approach are presented in Table 12. The SVM model showed lower FPR in the almond
    and jojoba datasets: for Kedma, a FPR of 13.2% with MCC of 0.65, for the combined
    dataset, FPR of 3.6% with MCC of 0.76, and for Sde David, FPR of 4.1% with MCC
    of 0.58. Table 12 Results of the first stage of the hierarchical classification
    approach by datasets Full size table Stage 2—classification between leak and normal
    The results of this stage (Table 13) contain the results of both stages, as they
    include the predictions for the two stages. Table 13 The results of the hierarchical
    classification approach Full size table For the almond plants, when clogs were
    removed from the training of the classifier at stage 2, the MCC was improved by
    0.01 for the combined dataset and by 0.02–0.1 for the Kedma dataset. The Balanced_ACC
    increased by 5%. The FPR of leaks decreased by 3–7% for Kedma and remained the
    same for the combined dataset. This improvement can be attributed to the fact
    that when clogs were relabeled as leaks (positive), the value range of features
    in the positive class increases and approaches that of the negative class, leading
    to a greater FPR (false alarm) for leaks. When clogs were relabeled as normal,
    the FPR of leaks decreased by 16% for the SVM using Kedma and by ~ 2% for the
    RF. However, the FNR of leaks increased by 4–13%, which may be because leaks and
    clogs have similar behavior under severe water-stress conditions (a similarity
    is found in the SWP values of leaks and clogs); therefore, when clogs were labeled
    as normal, they caused leaks which have similar features to clogs being classified
    incorrectly. When the training dataset size was increased from 70 to 80%, the
    classification results of the RF improved, with MCC increased from 0.27 to 0.35
    and the Balanced_ACC from 63.7% to 68%. For the SVM model, the results did not
    significantly improve: MCC by 0.01 and Balanced_ACC by 1%. This corresponds to
    the literature stating that SVM performance is not compromised when trained on
    small datasets (Virnodkar et al., 2020). For the Sde David jojoba dataset, the
    best results were obtained when clogs were relabeled as leaks in terms of FNR,
    probably because leaks and clogs were more similar to each other than the normal
    class, and they did not overlap with the normal class. The results for this dataset
    were relatively poor in comparison to the other approaches. This is probably because
    the hierarchical model was developed according to the properties of the almond
    datasets, which were quite different from the properties of the jojoba dataset.
    For the Kedma and combined datasets, hierarchical classification using SVM produced
    the best results. For Lavi and Sde David, multiclass classification using SVM
    gave the best performance. Table 14 summarizes the results for the training phase.
    Table 14 Summary of the best results obtained for each dataset in the validation
    sets Full size table Classification performance on the test set Each dataset was
    examined on the same test set that had never been used during the process (Table
    15). The performance of models that were trained on data from a single source
    was quite poor compared to the combined dataset. This implied that training a
    model with a dataset from one site and applying the model to a dataset from a
    different site performs poorly. A model selected based on the Lavi dataset achieved
    a MCC of 0.52 through cross-validation, whereas a model trained using the Lavi
    dataset and tested on the Kedma dataset achieved a MCC of 0.08. This is probably
    due to the addition of the clog class, which did not appear in the training set.
    A model trained on the Kedma dataset achieved a MCC of 0.3 through cross-validation,
    whereas a model trained using the Kedma dataset and tested on the Lavi dataset
    achieved a MCC of 0.15. Table 15 Results of the selected models for the test set
    Full size table When comparing Tables 14 and 15, a generalization error is evident
    as the results decrease when testing the model on different datasets. One possible
    explanation for this is the significant differences in feature selection during
    the training phase for each dataset, which can make classification challenging.
    However, this issue does not seem to affect the combined dataset and the Sde David
    dataset. The combined dataset incorporates data from two distinct orchards across
    both phases, while the Sde David dataset contains plantations from the same region.
    Consequently, the plantations within these datasets exhibit similarities in their
    features, contributing to more consistent results. Discussion Over the past few
    decades, machine learning techniques have been progressively used in diverse applications
    of remote sensing. SVM and RF classifiers show potential for crop water stress
    determination using remote sensing data but have not been fully explored (Virnodkar
    et al., 2020). The objective of previous models for crop water stress determination
    was to determine the water status of field crops and orchards to divide the field
    into management zones and manage irrigation. No attempts were found to determine
    abnormal water status conditions that may result from malfunctions in the irrigation
    system. In this study we contribute with an automated method to detect malfunctions
    in drip-irrigation systems using thermal remote sensing in commercial orchards
    in semiarid areas and evaluate it. The processing methodologies were developed
    and evaluated on a case study of almond plants and tested on different combinations
    of training and testing datasets. In addition, the developed method was also evaluated
    on a different type of crop, a jojoba plantation. The performance of the developed
    models was evaluated by a k-fold cross validation. This training process produced
    stable results as it is demonstrated on four performance measures of a RF model
    in Fig. 8. The boxplots of the 5 repetitions are presented, where the stability
    of the training process can be observed (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 An example of the stability
    of the performance measures for a random forest model on the combined dataset
    Full size image Training the model on samples from one site (single-site dataset)
    and testing it on samples from another site resulted in poor classification results.
    However, using the combined dataset, which contained samples from both sites for
    training, led to significantly improved results. This discrepancy in performance
    can be attributed to the fact that during training, the model was exposed to examples
    from two different locations, allowing it to learn a wider range of features.
    It''s important to note that feature selection was performed during the training
    process only. Analysis of Table 9 revealed differences in the selected features
    for each dataset and model, which could have contributed to generalization errors
    when training on one dataset and testing on another. For example, when the model
    was trained using the binary approach on the Lavi dataset, only the ''Min'' feature
    was included as input. In contrast, when training on the Kedma dataset, a larger
    number of features were selected, indicating their potential to better predict
    the target variable in that specific dataset. Consequently, when the model trained
    on the Lavi dataset was tested on the Kedma dataset, suboptimal performance was
    observed. The above results indicate that machine learning models trained on small
    datasets may effectively detect malfunctions for samples from the same location
    and type. However, their performance might degrade when applied to fields in different
    locations and crops. The reason for this limited generalization could be attributed
    to subtle variations in environmental conditions that differ between locations.
    This is a common result in machine learning as indicated in other research (e.g.,
    Ying, 2019). To enhance generalization, it is recommended to acquire data from
    different locations and use this data in the training. RF was found to be the
    best classification algorithm. Compared to the SVM, it was not adversely affected
    by different dataset splits/sizes. The hierarchical classification model achieved
    better results than the multiclass or binary models, resulting in a reduced FPR
    while the FNR did not increase. The jojoba study was characterized by a large
    number of clog samples and less leak samples, but due to the partial overlap in
    the temperature range between these two classes, it was difficult to differentiate
    between them. However, there was a large difference between these classes and
    the normal class, which led to a low rate of missed malfunctions (FNR). In the
    campaign that was conducted on almond orchards, leaks caused hypoxia in the soil,
    restricting roots function and thereby inducing to the plants water stress. This
    resulted in thermal behavior similar to that of clogs where shortage of water
    induced also water stress. Therefore, classification between leaks and clogs in
    this crop type was a limitation for this study. The model that succeeded to best
    overcome this ambiguity was the hierarchical model, which yielded the best performance.
    Future research could focus on a different type of crop with similar characteristics
    to the jojoba plantations that produced better classification. In order to increase
    the amount of data learned by the model, future studies can consider using deep
    learning models based on the original individual images taken by the drone for
    classification tasks. Conclusions This study developed and evaluated an automated
    method for detecting malfunctions in drip-irrigation systems using thermal remote
    sensing in commercial orchards. The models remained stable and performed well
    when trained with combined datasets. Random Forest was the preferred algorithm,
    and the hierarchical classification model achieved better results for the almond
    datasets. Differentiating between clogs and leaks was challenging in the jojoba
    study. Future research can explore similar crop types and utilize deep learning
    models for improved classification. Data availability The datasets generated and

  description: Accurately characterizing changes in irrigation water use (IWU) is
    crucial for formulating optimal water resource allocation policies, particularly
    in the context of climate change. However, existing IWU estimation methods suffer
    from uncertainties due to limited data availability and model constraints, restricting
    their applicability on a national scale and under future climate change scenarios.
    We present a robust framework leveraging machine learning and multiple data sets
    to estimate IWU across China. Forced with an ensemble of climate and socio-economic
    projections, we appraise future trends and additional costs of IWU. Our model
    shows high accuracy in reproducing IWU, with coefficient of determination (R2)
    ranging from 0.86 to 0.91 and root mean square error from 0.261 to 0.361 km3/yr
    when compared to reported values in Chinese prefectures. Independent validation
    at 11 cropland sites further confirms the model's predictive power (R2 = 0.67).
    Under different emissions scenarios, China's IWU is projected to increase by 8.5%–17.1%
    (6.8%–34.8%) by 2050s (2100s) compared to the historical period (1981–2010), with
    higher emissions leading to more significant increases. This rise in IWU by 2050s
    (2100s) comes with an estimated additional cost of US $1.65–3.91 ($2.28–6.5) billion/year,
    highlighting the urgency for sustainable water management. Our study provides
    an effective approach for estimating current and future IWU using machine learning
    techniques, transferable to other countries facing increasing irrigation demands.

    SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Accurately characterizing changes in irrigation
    water use (IWU) is crucial for formulating optimal water resource allocation policies,
    particularly in the context of climate change. However, existing IWU estimation
    methods suffer from uncertainties due to limited data availability and model constraints,
    restricting their applicability on a national scale and under future climate change
    scenarios. We present a robust framework leveraging machine learning and multiple
    data sets to estimate IWU across China. Forced with an ensemble of climate and
    socio-economic projections, we appraise future trends and additional costs of
    IWU. Our model shows high accuracy in reproducing IWU, with coefficient of determination
    (R2) ranging from 0.86 to 0.91 and root mean square error from 0.261 to 0.361
    km3/yr when compared to reported values in Chinese prefectures. Independent validation
    at 11 cropland sites further confirms the model''s predictive power (R2 = 0.67).
    Under different emissions scenarios, China''s IWU is projected to increase by
    8.5%–17.1% (6.8%–34.8%) by 2050s (2100s) compared to the historical period (1981–2010),
    with higher emissions leading to more significant increases. This rise in IWU
    by 2050s (2100s) comes with an estimated additional cost of US $1.65–3.91 ($2.28–6.5)
    billion/year, highlighting the urgency for sustainable water management. Our study
    provides an effective approach for estimating current and future IWU using machine
    learning techniques, transferable to other countries facing increasing irrigation
    demands. Key Points A framework is produced to reproduce irrigation water use
    (IWU) across China mainland by harnessing machine learning and multiple data set
    Proposed IWU estimation framework can uncover the current and future variations
    of irrigation water dynamics China''s IWU is projected to continuously increase
    by 2100s, with an additional cost of US $2.28–6.5 billion/year Plain Language
    Summary Understanding how much water is used for irrigation is crucial for managing
    water resources, especially with climate change. Current methods for estimating
    irrigation water use have limitations because of data and model constraints. These
    limitations make it hard to use these methods on a national scale and for predicting
    future water use. We developed a new method using machine learning and multiple
    data sets to estimate irrigation water use in China. We also looked at how water
    use might change in the future based on different climate and economic scenarios.
    Our model accurately predicts water use in comparison to what is reported on different
    scales. Our results suggest that irrigation water use in China is likely to increase,
    and higher emissions of greenhouse gases will lead to even more water use. This
    increase in water use also means higher costs. This highlights the need for better
    water management to make sure we use water sustainably. Our study provides a useful
    way to estimate current and future irrigation water use, and this method can be
    used in other countries dealing with increasing demands for irrigation. 1 Introduction
    Globally, ∼70% of freshwater withdrawals and ∼90% of anthropogenic freshwater
    consumptions are used for irrigated agriculture, which only accounts for ∼20%
    of arable land but provides more than 40% of food production (FAO, 2018; Siebert
    et al., 2010). Notably, China boasts the largest irritated area (∼34.27 billion
    hectares) worldwide, with irrigated farms covering more than 50% of the nation''s
    farmland, nourishing around 75% and 90% of its food and economic crops, respectively,
    and accounting for 63% of country''s total water usage (Portmann et al., 2010;
    Zhu et al., 2013). Irrigation water use (IWU) plays a critical role for crop growth
    and yield, especially in regions facing water scarcity, where recurrent droughts
    and extreme temperatures can exacerbate its impacts. Generally, IWU is specifically
    designed to represent the actual water amount entering the field, encompassing
    both surface irrigation water and groundwater irrigation water. Notably, the over-exploitation
    of groundwater induced by increased IWU pose a common challenge in critical zones
    with inadequate surface water resources, such as northern China, northern India,
    and central America (Calzadilla et al., 2010; Wada et al., 2013). The World Bank
    estimated that the global cost for IWU adaption were approximately US $30%20billion
    in 2017, ant it would be $150%20billion by 2030s (Group, 2021). Hence, reliable
    characterization of IWU assumes paramount importance, not only for optimizing
    cropping systems, irrigation planning, and water allocation to mitigate potential
    reductions in crop yields but also for facilitating the expansion of feasible
    cropland areas and supporting multiple cropping cycles (Rosa, 2022; Zhu, Burney,
    et al., 2022). Moreover, with global climate change threatening agricultural productivity
    and food security (Jägermeyr et al., 2021; Wheeler and von Braun, 2013), the expansion
    of irrigation to underperforming rainfed croplands has been proposed as a potential
    solution to meet future global food demand (Rosa et al., 2020; X. Wang et al.,
    2021). However, precise future IWU estimates are limited by model imperfections,
    thereby impeding policymakers'' ability to grasp the challenges and opportunities
    of sustainable water resources management under climate and socioeconomic change
    (Elliott et al., 2014; Flörke et al., 2018). IWU can be obtained in a number of
    ways. Traditionally, it can be collected from a standard survey of farmland''s
    irrigation practices or from water consumption statistics provided by irrigation
    districts. Nevertheless, the limited availability of in situ data, often due to
    its private nature, has restricted its broader applicability and utilization in
    scientific studies. To complement in situ data, hydrological and agricultural
    models have incorporated irrigation modules, such as PCRaster Global Water Balance
    (PCR-GLOBWB) (Wada et al., 2014) and Global Crop Water Model (GCWM) (Siebert &
    Döll, 2010). These models have offered valuable insights into irrigation activities.
    However, inconsistencies in the input data used in these models, such as varying
    data sets of evapotranspiration (ET) or soil moisture (SM), have led to discrepancies
    in IWU estimates, affecting water and energy budgets assessment and climate dynamics
    analyses. Furthermore, the diversity of cropland areas, irrigation infrastructure
    and schemes introduce challenges in obtaining spatially explicit IWU estimates
    (Rosa, 2022; Zhang & Long, 2021). Remote sensing has emerged as a promising tool
    for calculating IWU by employing statistical relationships with remotely sensed
    parameters or integrating data assimilation techniques within numerical or process
    models. These methodologies, based on principles such as energy balance, water
    balance, and water vapor diffusion methods have shown significant potential in
    recent research (Chen et al., 2019; Zaussinger et al., 2019; Zhang & Long, 2021;
    Zhang et al., 2022). A common approach to IWU estimation defines it as the residual
    of ET and SM dynamics minus precipitation. While this method is relatively straightforward,
    it has limitations in characterizing the dynamic process that evolve from each
    stage of growth and is more suitable for areas with high vegetation coverage (Foster
    et al., 2020; Zohaib & Choi, 2020). Researchers have explored the potential of
    incorporating additional climatic and hydrological information, such as air temperature
    and snowpack, to capture IWU variations in greater detail and achieve improved
    accuracy (Y. Liu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2021). However, the scarcity of long-term
    records and constraints in existing models have hindered more comprehensive IWU
    estimation efforts. A renaissance in machine learning (ML) technology has opened
    new possibilities for capturing nonlinear relationships between predictors and
    explanatory factors, surpassing the capabilities of conventional regression models
    (Reichstein et al., 2019). At this level, ML approaches are beginning to be considered
    (e.g., in the form of solely ML models or hybrid models that couple ML with process-based
    models) in estimating hydrological and biogeochemical parameters in agricultural
    ecosystems including nitrate concentrations (Knoll et al., 2020; Sadayappan et
    al., 2022), soil moisture (Ahmad et al., 2010), and streams (R. Wang et al., 2021).
    The integrating of ML into computational modeling holds great promise, as it enables
    the extraction of complex interactions and facilitates spatial generalization
    of process-based model outputs (Reichstein et al., 2019). Notably, ML has the
    potential to enhance the estimation of IWU by considering irrigated activities
    and crop growth patterns, since it can model intricate relationships among multiple
    variables, and leverage large data sets of environmental information. One of the
    primary challenges in utilizing ML for IWU estimation is the demand for substantial
    amounts of data. The success of ML models relies on the availability and reliability
    of input data, as well as the appropriateness of the model structure, all of which
    significantly influence model performance (Al-Jarrah et al., 2015). This study
    aims to fill the aforementioned knowledge gaps by developing a robust ML-based
    approach, which utilizes a combination of satellite remote sensing, meteorological
    drivers, economic statistics, and numerical model outputs to estimate IWU at a
    national level with a spatial resolution of 0.25°. To evaluate the efficacy of
    the model, the study examines 339 prefectures in China during the period 2011–2013,
    and the results are further validated against independent observations from 11
    cropland sites. We extend the application of the well-established ML-based model
    to project future IWU until the year 2100, under a range of climate and socio-economic
    scenarios. The outcomes of these projections provide the variations, trends, and
    associated costs of IWU across China in the coming decades. Our findings provide
    accurate IWU estimation for China and contribute to globally consistent IWU estimates.
    Additionally, they inform policy and decision-making, guiding sustainable water
    resources management amidst climate change and socioeconomic dynamics. 2 Materials
    and Methods The China mainland (Figure 1a) comprises 31 provinces. Precipitation
    in China is unevenly distributed, and dry regions are primarily located in the
    western and northern regions (Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1). The East
    Asian and South Asian monsoon occurring from April to October brings a pronounced
    precipitation increase. China has a dominant economy in agriculture, with an emphasis
    on irrigation. The principal crops in the country include rice, wheat, corn, and
    soybeans. The country''s diverse agricultural practices and vast geographical
    and climatic variations result in a considerable variety of crop types and crop
    rotations. The agricultural landscape in China can be categorized into main agro-ecological
    regions, including the northern grain belt, the southern rice-growing region,
    and the western arid and semi-arid areas. Each region possesses unique crop types
    and cropping systems adapted to local conditions and requirements (Text S1 in
    Supporting Information S1). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Study region
    and conceptual framework. (a) Map of irrigated area fraction across China (red
    to green shading), with province (solid gray) and prefecture (dashed gray) boundaries
    delineated. Locations of 11 croplands sites are flagged (in green). (b) Area of
    irrigation in China displayed over the period of 1981–2013. (c) Flowchart of the
    methodology. With the human population increasing and climatic warming, irrigation
    water use has been increasing in China, and the rising agricultural water scarcity
    has been adversely affecting food security (Figure 1b and Figure S2 in Supporting
    Information S1) (Qi et al., 2022). Groundwater is a crucial water resource for
    agricultural irrigation in the water supply-scarce regions in China, but groundwater
    depletion has been occurring due to extensive human activities, particularly in
    the Northern Plain and Haihe Plain (Feng et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2021). To accurately
    calculate the national IWU and investigate the variations and trends of IWU by
    the end of this century, we conducted the following three procedures (Figure 1c):
    (a) examining the feasibility of IWU calculation model based on field measurements
    and satellite observations (e.g., precipitation, ET and soil moisture) and IWU
    reported data set; (b) developing and evaluating the ML-based models; (c) extending
    the proposed model to future simulations and assessing the impacts of climate
    change and socioeconomic development on IWU. 2.1 Materials A variety of data sets
    were used during the study period, including gridded precipitation (P), ET and
    SM, meteorological data (i.e., maximum air temperature (Tmax), minimum air temperature
    (Tmin), and shortwave radiation (SRAD), snow water equivalent (SWE), phenology
    data, irrigated area fraction, and county-level irrigation area). All these data
    except irrigated area fraction and irrigation area were unified to a spatial resolution
    of 0.25°. We also obtained the annual reported prefecture-level IWU along with
    two previously generated IWU products to evaluate our work''s accuracy. Moreover,
    a set of field measurements at 11 crop sites across China was collected to confirm
    the proposed model. In addition, four earth system model-based simulations under
    three emission scenarios were used to extend the proposed model in the future.
    Details of the listed data set can be found in Tables S1 and S2 in Supporting
    Information S1. 2.1.1 Precipitation We used the precipitation data set during
    1981–2013 from ERA5 (the new fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis of ECMWF)
    for model establishment and evaluation. These reanalysis products can provide
    detailed information about the vertical atmospheric field derived from continuously
    optimized analysis systems and data assimilation activities (Kidd & Levizzani,
    2011; Xie et al., 2018). As the latest reanalysis product released by Copernicus
    Climate Change Service, ERA5 has a more advanced assimilation system and higher
    spatial-temporal resolution (Jiang et al., 2021). Although ERA5 grid precipitation
    has been widely utilized, we evaluated its applicability at the prefecture level
    based on 836 field precipitation measurements from the China Meteorological Administration
    and observed acceptable accuracy (Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1). Considering
    the uncertainty in the precipitation data set, two precipitation data sets from
    the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre
    (GPCC) were obtained for uncertainty analysis by comparing them with those from
    the ERA5 product. CRU data set, produced by the University of East Anglia, provides
    a number of variables, including monthly precipitation at 0.5 × 0.5° resolution
    since January 1901 (Asoka et al., 2017). The GPCC monthly precipitation product
    is derived from radiometric observations collected from satellites and rain gauges
    since 1951 (about 85,000 stations worldwide) with a spatial resolution of 0.25
    × 0.25° (Ajaaj et al., 2015). 2.1.2 Evapotranspiration ET data set during 1981–2013
    was derived from GLEAM (Global Land-surface Evaporation Amsterdam Methodology),
    which provides global daily ET estimates at 0.25° spatial resolution. Driven primarily
    by satellite data sets, GLEAM takes soil moisture as the constraint for simulating
    evaporation (Yang et al., 2017). Three other ET data sets from NTSG (Numerical
    Terradynamic Simulation Group) and TerraClimate and SYNET were used for further
    uncertainty analysis. The NTSG data set is primarily based on a modified Penman-Monteith
    approach that integrates parameters from eddy covariance flux towers and satellite
    observation (Zhang et al., 2010). The TerraClimate ET is derived from a modified
    Thornthwaite-Mather climatic water-balance model. Its input parameters include
    precipitation, reference ET, and soil water capacity obtained from satellite observations
    (Zhao et al., 2019). SYNET data set is a monthly ensemble synthesized from 12
    ET products, including MODIS and NTSG, by using a global high-quality flux eddy
    covariance, and the performance of this product over China has been proven to
    be superior to local ET products (Elnashar et al., 2021). 2.1.3 Soil Moisture
    We mainly used the surface soil moisture (SSM) from the European Space Agency
    Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) and the root zone soil moisture (RZSM) from
    ERA5 for model establishment. As part of the Climate Change Initiative, ESA CCI
    SSM data set is based on microwave satellite observations, which convert the observed
    land surface brightness temperature to soil water content (Kovačević et al., 2020).
    Because the penetration capability of current microwave sensors is not enough
    to obtain accurate soil moisture in the plant root zone, we have to introduce
    the ERA5 RZSM product, which incorporates an advanced land data assimilation system
    to make up for the lack of satellite observation (Reder & Rianna, 2021). Notably,
    although the ESA CCI SSM data set has comprehensive spatial coverage, some regions
    still have gaps. We used one machine learning approach to gap-fill this data set
    based on satellite observations, reanalysis model outputs, and climatic information.
    More details can be found in our previous study (Liu et al., 2023) and Text S2
    and Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1. We also used two SSM data sets from
    ERA5 and GLEAM for uncertainty analysis. Belonging to the same products as ERA
    RZSM, ERA SSM reflects the soil water content of the first layer (∼7 cm) (Fan
    et al., 2022). GLEAM estimates land evaporation and corresponding components globally
    through remote sensing observations as a process-based semi-empirical model. Currently,
    the global soil moisture data set based on GLEAM has been widely used (Martens
    et al., 2018). 2.1.4 Other Meteorological and Hydrometeorological Data We obtained
    a variety of meteorological variables, including maximum air temperature, minimum
    air temperature, and short-wave radiation, from the ERA5 data set. We used satellite-derived
    SWE during 1981–2013, which is generated based on satellite products and machine
    learning. For this SWE data set, a large number of in situ observations and five
    snow depth data sets are used to train and apply the machine learning algorithm,
    including Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System
    (AMSR snow depth from the Northern Hemisphere snow depth (NHSD)), ERA-Interim
    and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2
    (MERRA-2) (Hu et al., 2021). 2.1.5 Phenology Products The land surface phenology
    metrics used in our study were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) Version 6 products. These metrics are derived
    from the time series MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function-Adjusted
    Reflectance (Ganguly et al., 2010). These metrics enabled us to identify critical
    periods in the cropland growth cycle and irrigation activities, offering valuable
    insights into vegetation growth timing, irrigation duration, and crop-water dynamics.
    2.1.6 Irrigation Area, Irrigation Area Percentage, and Irrigation Water Use We
    used annual prefecture-level IWU data from the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources
    report. It crucial to note that this data set predominantly captures irrigation
    water withdrawal, which represents the total water diverted from a variety of
    water sources. Despite being recorded at the scale of the entire irrigated area
    or administrative division, this data set remains the most reliable sources for
    evaluating IWU calculation across China (Qi et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2020).
    Although the reported data primarily reflects irrigation water withdrawal rather
    than the exact IWU, this discrepancy does not impact the performance and evaluation
    of our model. This is because the consistent data set is used for both the establishment
    and validation of the model. Additional clarification on the meanings of different
    irrigation-related definitions can be found in Text S3 in Supporting Information
    S1. We obtained the grid fraction of irrigation area from the Global Map of Irrigated
    Area (GMIA) product over 2000. GMIA is mainly derived from the statistical reports
    of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the land use data
    set from the United Nations Ministries of Agriculture, and the land cover data
    set from the United States Geological Survey (Meier et al., 2018). To calculate
    the ET for different future scenarios, we also obtained the land cover fractional
    based on the combination of ESA GlobCover 2009 maps and GMIA irrigation area fraction.
    Two previously generated IWU products were also used for evaluating the accuracy
    of our work. One is the IWU data set from Zhang et al. (2022), another is from
    Chen et al. (2019). These two data sets are based on satellite data sets and process-based
    models. 2.1.7 Field Measurements A set of field measurements for IWU at 11 crop
    field stations across China was used during 2008–2014 to evaluate the proposed
    model. Details of the selected crop sites can be found in Table 1. The SSM and
    RZSM at these stations were collected from field measures, and the meteorological
    variables (i.e., precipitation, maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature,
    short wave radiation) were derived from the meteorology stations nearby. Table

    et al. (2014) Note. References are provided to describe the sites. The ET at each
    station was calculated using equations based on (Teo et al., 2022; Zhang et al.,
    2001), simplified as follows: ET = P × [ 1 + w × PET P ] ⁢ × [ 1 + w × PET P +
    P PET ] − 1 (1) where P is precipitation; w is the available water coefficient;
    PET is potential ET that was calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith method:
    PET = 0.408 ∆ ( R n − G ) + γ ⁢ 900 T + 273 ⁢ u 2 ⁢ ( e s − e a ) ∆ + γ ⁢ ( 1
    + 0.34 ⁢ u 2 ) (2) where ∆ represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure
    curve versus temperature; T is the mean air temperature; es and ea are the saturation
    and actual atmospheric water vapor, respectively; Rn and G are the surface net
    radiation and the all-wave ground heat flux, respectively; γ is the psychrometric
    constant; and u2 is the surface wind speed. 2.1.8 Future Scenario Simulations
    We used various simulations from earth system models within the Phase 6 of the
    Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which can provide a variety of
    future scenarios based on different assumptions regarding climate mitigation policies,
    socio-economic development, and global governance (Cook et al., 2020). We used
    SSP1-26 (low-end forcing pathway, warming target of less than 2°C), SSP3-70 (medium
    to high-end forcing pathway, warming target of 4°C), and SSP5-85 (high-end forcing
    pathway, warming target of around 5°C) for representing emission and land-use
    scenarios at radiative forcings stabilized of 2.6, 7.0, and 8.5 Wm−2, respectively.
    Considering possible future and model structure independence, we selected four
    extensively used earth system models, that is, CESM2, MIROC6, MIROC-ES2L, and
    TaiESM1 (Table S2 in Supporting Information S1). Four meteorological variables,
    that is, precipitation, maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, short
    wave radiation, and three other hydrological variables, that is, SWE, SSM, and
    RZSM, were used. We selected the historical period from 1981 to 2013 and the future
    period from 2031 to 2100 to remove model perturbation. Two phases in the future
    period will be critically focused on: the mid century (2031–2050) and the late
    century (2081–2100). Although earlier studies (Saha & Sateesh, 2022; Song et al.,
    2021) have used the observations or reanalysis outputs to calibrate the CMIP6
    data set, we did not conduct this calibrate procedure to avoid other uncertainties.
    This is acceptable because our analysis is focused primarily on comparing future
    periods to baseline ones. 2.2 Methods The proposed IWU calculation model is focused
    on efficiently establishing the intrinsic connection between IWU and explanatory
    variables: IWU = f ⁡ ( V 1 , V 2 , V 3 ⁢ · · · · · · V k ) + ε (3) where Vi is
    the corresponding explanatory vector. f is one function, and here we used one
    machine learning-based regression. ε represents the model residual. 2.2.1 Machine
    Learning (ML) Model Compared to the traditional regression models that insufficiently
    consider the probability density functions, machine learning approaches could
    be more flexible in handling nonlinear relationships and complex interactions.
    As an enhanced decision tree algorithm, random forest is a powerful means for
    interpreting earth variables. This model can train each tree on bootstrap resamples
    rather than relying on the whole data set (Tang et al., 2021). During the model
    training stage, the bootstrap method is used to randomly sample data (Hutengs
    & Vohland, 2016). After multiple rounds of sampling and generating a corresponding
    number of decision trees, the final output result is determined by the average
    value of all decision tree outputs (Figure S5 in Supporting Information S1). Y
    = 1 k ⁢ ∑ i = 1 k T i ⁡ ( X n ) (4) where Y represents the final output, k represents
    the number of training rounds and decision trees, Xn is the selected feature,
    Ti(Xn) is the output of decision tree i. The RF model was implemented with the
    help of Python packages for our study. In particular, a Bayesian strategy based
    on the “Bayesian Optimization” module (Liu et al., 2023; Martinez-Cantin, 2014)
    was used to select the optimal hyperparameters. 2.2.2 Model Feasibility IWU associates
    with a variety of explanatory variables relating to hydrological information (Chen
    et al., 2010). Our model is based on the widely recognized water balance formula,
    which defines IWU as the residual between actual ET, precipitation, and changes
    in soil moisture (Döll & Siebert, 2002; Puy et al., 2021). IWU = ET − P + ∆ SM
    + D (5) where D is the drainage that includes both deep percolation and lateral
    infiltration, and such variable closely related to soil moisture. We also consider
    climatic variables like maximum and minimum air temperatures, and shortwave radiation
    to further refine our IWU calculations. Temperature has long been recognized as
    a critical factor affecting water consumption and drought stress risk during crop
    growth. With rising temperatures, the corresponding increase in irrigation water
    needs becomes crucial to maintain an adequate water supply for crops facing elevated
    water stress (Schauberger et al., 2017). Another key climatic variable, shortwave
    radiation, exerts significant influence on crop irrigation requirements by directly
    impacting photosynthesis rates and plant transpiration rates, thereby affecting
    the physiological processes of plants. As radiation levels fluctuate, irrigation
    water needs adjust accordingly, as these changes directly influence the water
    uptake and transpiration rates in plants. We also acknowledge the importance of
    snowmelt covering specific regions and its potential implications for crop irrigation
    water. Snowmelt alters regional water availability and surface albedo, directly
    influencing irrigation needs in those affected areas (Barnett et al., 2005). We
    utilized essential explanatory factors, including precipitation, ET, soil moisture,
    irrigation area, maximum air temperatures, minimum air temperatures, shortwave
    radiation, and snowmelt, to drive our machine learning models. Calculating average
    values of these selected variables based on the irrigated area percentage, we
    focused on pixels with an irrigated area percentage greater than 1% to concentrate
    on regions significantly influencing irrigation water demand. Furthermore, our
    model is confined to specific phenological periods, capturing relevant variables
    that impact IWU during critical stages of crop growth, leading to a more accurate
    estimation of water requirements during key developmental phases. The correlations
    between selected explanatory variables and IWU can be further reflected at the
    field crop scale (Figure 2a). Results indicate that all selected explanatory variables
    exhibit significant correlations with IWU, or correlations that approach statistical
    significance. Specifically, IWU negatively correlated to precipitation but positively
    correlated to ET. Air temperature and shortwave radiation were positively related
    to IWU. These correlations are also supported at the prefecture level (Figure
    2b), which illustrates that the IWU is increased with increasing ET, air temperature,
    and shortwave radiation but decreased with increasing precipitation. Figure 2

    and its explanatory factors, including P (precipitation), ET (evapotranspiration),
    SSM (surface soil moisture), RZSM (root zone soil moisture), SRAD (shortwave radiation),
    Tmax (maximum air temperature), and Tmin (minimum air temperature). (a) Scatterplots
    of IWU against the explanatory variables at field scale. (b) Averaged IWU (blue
    bar) and the associated standard deviation (represented by error bar) corresponding
    to a range of percentiles for individual explanatory factors. (c) Averaged (blue
    bar) and standard deviation (error bar) of the permutation-based importance of
    explanatory factors to prefecture-level IWU. The relative importance of individual
    explanatory variables at field scale is also displayed (red circle). We also used
    the permutation-based importance score generated by RF (Mi et al., 2021) to examine
    the connection between IWU and the selected variables. To remove the influence
    of data set splitting, we ran the RF model 100 times by splitting the data set
    into resampled training data (80%) and testing data (20%). The importance scores
    produced at the prefecture level suggest that all the selected covariates are
    meaningful in describing IWU, as illustrated in Figure 2c. A similar pattern of
    high importance variables is observed at the field scale, further supporting the
    selected variables and the feasibility of the proposed models. 2.2.3 ML-Based
    Future Scenario Simulations ET during the historical period and future period
    was calculated using Equation 6 (Teo et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2001): ET = ∑
    i = k n ( l i × P × [ 1 + w i × PET P ] ⁢ [ 1 + w i × PET P + P PET ] − 1 ) (6)
    where li is the area percentage of land type i, and wi is the available water
    coefficient. The PET was calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith method described
    in Equation 2. While such a method allows for various land types, we exclusively
    focus on cropland. The calculated ET was evaluated for the historical period by
    comparing it against the GLEAM product during 1981–2013. Our ET is correlated
    with the GLEAM product with R2 between 0.61 and 0.70 (p < 0.01) (Figure S6 in
    Supporting Information S1), meaning the reliable data set of calculated ET. Since
    it is challenging to simulate SSM and RZSM, we used one machine learning-based
    calibration model (Callaghan et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) to estimate SSM and
    RZSM for scenario periods. The CMIP6 precipitation, maximum air temperature, minimum
    air temperature, short wave radiation, and SSM (and RZSM) are used as explanatory
    factors. Specifically, we first establish random forest-based regressions between
    ESA SSM (ERA RZSM) and explanatory factors during 1981–2013 and then apply these
    regression relationships to the explanatory factors in both historical and future
    scenarios to obtain the final SSM and RZSM simulations. To confirm the accuracy
    of the simulated soil moisture, we validated our method of calculating SSM and
    RZSM during 1981–2013 against the ESA SSM and ERA RZSM products. Our product is
    highly correlated with the ESA SSM with R2 between 0.54 and 0.64 (p < 0.01) and
    with the ERA RZSM with R2 between 0.47 and 0.55 (p < 0.01) (Figures S7 and S8
    in Supporting Information S1). We thus consider the machine-learning approach
    as robust for further IWU calculation. 2.2.4 Evaluation and Validation Before
    model establishment and application, we checked the variations and trends of the
    selected explanatory factors during 1981–2013 based on satellite observations
    and reanalysis outputs. To better understand the variations and shifts of IWU
    during the past and future, we also checked the change ratio of earth system model-based
    simulations during 2031–2100 relative to baseline periods. We used Sen''s slope
    estimator to determine the grid-level trends and change ratios based on the Seasonal
    and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL)-decomposed components that exclude the
    seasonal signal and the remaining components (Liu et al., 2021). To evaluate the
    proposed model performance, we used the reported IWU in 2011–2013 as a reference
    data set to assess the estimated prefecture-level IWU while using the data set
    in 1981–2010 as the training data set. We also used the measurements from 11 cropland
    sites across China to evaluate the model performance. For this experiment, the
    data set in 2008–2012 was used as the training period, while 2013–2014 was used
    as the evaluation period. Three metrics, that is, determination of coefficient
    (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used
    to evaluate model reliability. To check the model sensitivity to critical explanatory
    factors, we used a variety of additional data sets, that is, precipitation, ET
    and SSM, to conduct a comparative analysis. In addition, three regression models,
    that is, extreme gradient boosting (XGB), support vector machine (SVM), and multiple
    linear regression (MLR) (Text S4 in Supporting Information S1), were used to compare
    with the random forest model. To investigate the variations and trends of future
    IWU in the context of climate change and socioeconomic development, we simulated
    annual China''s IWU during 2031–2100 under three future scenarios, respectively,
    based on the training data set in the baseline period (1981–2010). The model performance
    in scenario simulations was evaluated using references during 2011–2013. In the
    final, the annual IWU of each scenario were further compared with their levels
    during the baseline period, and the corresponding extra cost due to IWU changes
    were also calculated. The change ratio (CR) in IWU was obtained using Equation
    7: CR = IWU f − IWU b IWU b × 100 % (7) where IWUf and IWUb are the IWU in the
    future and baseline periods, respectively. 3 Results 3.1 Explanatory Factors Change
    in Historical Observations and Future Scenarios The accuracy of IWU can be affected
    by factors controlling water consumption and growth activities. We first investigated
    the trends and shifts of critical impacting factors. As illustrated in Figure
    3a, during the past three decades, the spatial-temporal pattern of climatic variables
    such as precipitation and air temperature has changed obviously, especially in
    northern and western China, which is more constrained by water availability. These
    variabilities in climatic factors could further modify the variations of ET and
    SM through the water and energy cycle (Aminzadeh & Or, 2013). Critically, an increase
    in air temperature, particularly occurring in northern China, could enhance crop
    irrigation water requirements, while the rising radiation could potentially take
    effect in southern China. We cannot skimpily infer that the impact of a specific
    variable on irrigation is purely harmful or beneficial. For example, the rise
    in air temperature will generally cause an increase in water consumption as described
    above. However, for some regions in western China (such as Xinjiang), it will
    also alleviate the stress of water supply by increasing the meltwater, which is
    a crucial irrigation water source for the locals (Li et al., 2014). Figure 3 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Magnitude of change for explanatory factors. (a) Trends
    of individual explanatory factors during 1981–2013, including P (precipitation),
    ET (evapotranspiration), SSM (surface soil moisture), RZSM (root zone soil moisture),
    SWE (snow water equivalent), SRAD (shortwave radiation), Tmax (maximum air temperature),
    and Tmin (minimum air temperature). (b) Ratio of change between 2031 and 2100
    and reference period of 1981–2010 for individual explanatory factors. The dots
    represent the median values while bars indicate the entire ranges. We further
    analyzed the temporal evolution of critical variables in the future, as shown
    in Figure 3b. The maximum and minimum air temperature rose by about 2.9% and 1.6%
    during 2031–2100 relative to the baseline during 1981–2010, respectively. It indicates
    that variations in climatic factors may be the positive determinants of increasing
    IWU in the future, which is further supported by increasing ET. Another impact
    of rising temperatures is the reduction of SWE, which will be reduced by about
    32.7% in the coming decades. For areas where meltwater is the primary water source
    of irrigation, they may have to face the problem of increasing water demand and
    drying up irrigation water sources at the same time (Dai et al., 2012; Hong et
    al., 2022). Nevertheless, precipitation will increase in the future, and the ratio
    of rise will reach 10.8%, which may mute irrigation water requirements. Collectively,
    IWU will be controlled by both the positive and negative effects of climate warming,
    and its pattern remains unclear under future climate change and socioeconomic
    development. 3.2 Accuracy of Estimated IWU We evaluated the estimated annual IWU
    during 2011–2013 with the reported IWU from 339 prefectures in China. Figure 4a
    shows the spatial distribution of the estimated IWU, which varies from 0.01 to
    6.8 km3/yr. The majority of China''s prefectures have IWU of less than 3.0 km3/yr,
    and a high IWU exists in northern China, which has less precipitation. Figure
    4b shows the scatters of the estimated IWU versus the reported IWU. A high R2
    (0.86–0.91) and low RMSE (0.261–0.361 km3/yr) are obtained. The promising performance
    of our mode can be further corroborated by comparing with two generated products
    in the provinces and prefectures of China (Figures S9 and S10 in Supporting Information
    S1). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Evaluation of ML-based irrigation
    water use (IWU) estimates. (a) and (b) Spatial patterns of IWU estimates based
    on satellite observations and reanalysis outputs and their accuracy assessment
    against reported values. (c) Independent accuracy assessment of IWU estimates
    against field measurements. (d) Accuracy of IWU estimates visualized by dry and
    humid regions. (e) and (f) Same with (a) and (b) but for four earth system models
    based on historical scenarios. The proposed model was further evaluated at selected
    11 cropland sites mainly supplied by irrigation. The estimated IWU exhibits a
    relatively high correlation against the field measurements (Figure 4c, with an
    R2 of 0.67). This accuracy is acceptable considering the heterogeneous characteristic
    of actual cropland and the lack of training samples. Combining the evaluation
    from the prefecture and field scale, we believe that our IWU calculation framework
    could capture the dynamic changes of irrigation. However, lower accuracy may be
    obtained over dry regions due to the uncertainty in the available data set (especially
    ET and SM) and model applicability (Figure 4d). Meanwhile, we observe that the
    model captures intermediate IWU well but underestimates the high values and overestimates
    the low values of the IWU range. It means that the ML model depicts the dominant
    factors but potentially neglects some subtle signals that can be essential in
    capturing extreme IWU (e.g., very high and low values). We further amplified this
    asymmetric performance in calculating IWU by checking the model residuals and
    found no clear pattern for the model residual (Figure S11 in Supporting Information
    S1). Such asymmetric performance is common among ML models, partly attributed
    to the low data availability in extreme regimes (K. Liu et al., 2022; Sadayappan
    et al., 2022), which is supported by the fact that only 21% of prefectures have
    IWU above 3 km3/yr. We extended the proposed model to three future scenarios by
    transferring its learning capacity into four earth system model simulations. Figure
    4e displays the spatial patterns of the annual IWU estimated by our model at 31
    provinces. Consistent spatial patterns of IWU are predicted with four earth system
    model simulations during 2011–2013. Figure 4f compares the IWU with the reported
    IWU. Despite noticeable differences among the four earth system models, the accuracy
    of the IWU remains at a high level, with the R2 larger than 0.87. The TaiESM1
    model has the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.922), followed by MIROC6, MIROC-ES2L, and
    CESM2 (R2 = 0.915, 0.912, and 0.876, respectively). Our work is consistent with
    earlier studies that used the earth system model simulations for modeling agricultural
    variables such as crop yield (He et al., 2022) and nitrous oxide (Schauberger
    et al., 2017). In summary, the estimated IWU is reliable and robust for further
    analysis. 3.3 Model Uncertainty Analysis Precipitation and ET are essential in
    capturing soil water dynamic changes, influencing the performance of the IWU estimation
    model. Therefore, we replaced the ERA5 precipitation with CRU and GPCC products,
    as well as replacing the GLEAM ET with two widely used ET products (NTSG and SYNET)
    in calculating IWU. Figures 5a and 5b demonstrate the accuracy of the available
    precipitation and ET data set for IWU estimation. Relatively small discrepancies
    (<2%) in accuracy metrics are observed among these precipitation drivers, but
    remarkable discrepancies are observed for ET. This is reasonable considering that
    ET is highly related to plant biophysical properties that control water compositions,
    for example, leaf area index, vegetation greening, and canopy conductance. The
    unsatisfactory accuracy of current ET products also contributed to such uncertainty
    in the drylands, such as Northern China (Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2012).
    Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sensitivity analysis of explanatory
    factors and regression model structure. (a) Relative change of model performance
    when replacing precipitation with other products as compared to the baseline model.
    See Figure S13 in Supporting Information S1 for accuracy of the ML-based model
    forced with ERA5 precipitation, GLEAM ET, and ESA gap-filled SSM. (b)–(d) Same
    with (a) but for ET, SSM, and regression approach, respectively. The data gaps
    in satellite soil moisture product, generally relating to the discontinuous coverage
    and revisit frequency of satellite constellations, is a critical obstacle in implementing
    IWU estimating models. Accordingly, a machine learning-based gap-filling method
    was used to generate nearly complete coverage of soil moisture. Comparison analysis
    (Figure 5c) shows that gap-filled ESA SSM substantially improves the IWU calculation
    by 40%. To confirm this, the calculated IWU based on ESA SSM was further compared
    with the estimations based on ERA5 and GLEAM SSM. We notice that all the derived
    IWU show acceptable accuracy but vary noticeably. Higher accuracy is found for
    ESA SSM, suggesting the superiority of the reconstructed satellite products in
    modeling IWU. The proposed RF-base model was further compared against three extensively
    used regression models (Figure 5d). It''s observed that XGB could calculate IWU
    with high accuracy, suggesting the stable applicability of tree models and the
    broad feasibility of the used variables. SVM shows lower accuracies when compared
    to RF, which means there is a potential uncertainty in machine leaning approaches
    that it cannot make accurate predictions because of its model structure (Biau
    & Scornet, 2016). The lowest accuracies are found for MLR, further confirming
    the remarkable performance of the ML model. Additionally, we acknowledge that
    urban landscapes within cities or prefectures may contribute relatively less to
    overall crop cultivation in China. Despite this, we have considered irrigation
    area as a critical variable to depict land cover information. It is important
    to recognize that statistical irrigation area data may introduce uncertainties.
    While the impacts of these uncertainties are not substantial (Figures S12 in Supporting
    Information S1), further investigation is warranted to ensure the robustness of
    our model. 3.4 Variations and Trends of Future IWU Estimates Since the future
    model drivers can be available from a variety of earth system models, the proposed
    framework was used to calculate future IWU by assuming a constant irrigation area
    from 2010 onward. Figure 6a shows the temporal changes in IWU over China mainland
    during 2031–2100 based on the CMIP6 simulations (similar pattern in Figure S14
    in Supporting Information S1). Under the SSP3-70 and SSP5-85 scenarios, China''s
    IWU will evidently increase by 2100s, and an insignificant increasing trend is
    observed in the SSP1-26 scenario. With the historical period (1981–2010) as a
    baseline, it''s found in Figures 6b and 6c that under the SSP1-26 and SSP3-70
    scenarios, China''s IWU will increase by 8.5%–11.6% (6.8%–14.4%) and 10.5%–12.3%
    (16.4%–18.9%) during the middle century (late century). In the SSP5-85 scenario,
    IWU will increase by 11.3%–17.1% (20.9%–34.8%). It is important to emphasize that
    the TaiESM1 model exhibits considerable uncertainty in its performance. Despite
    indicating a larger overall national IWU during 2081–2100 compared to 2031–2050,
    this model could estimate lower IWU values for specific provinces. Collectively,
    IWU in China is likely to increase under future climate and socioeconomic change,
    and it will increase slightly in the mid-century but increase evidently in the
    late century. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Variations and trends
    of irrigation water use (IWU) during 2031–2100. (a) Time series of China''s IWU
    under low-, medium-, and high-emissions scenarios. (b) and (c) Change ratios of
    China''s IWU at the province scale by middle (2031–2050) and late (2081–2100)
    century relative to the historic period (1981–2010). The additional cost induced
    by this change is shown in the bar plot, which indicates the entire range. Dots
    show the median value across the specified model while bars indicate the entire
    ranges. By checking the spatial patterns of the changed IWU during 2031–2100 (Figures
    S16 and S16 in Supporting Information S1), we find China''s IWU will be increased
    for ∼60% of provinces, which have been experienced scarce water use, and the reduction
    of IWU in the future may alleviate their water supply stress. Meanwhile, the scarce
    water use may be eliminated for southern China due to the decreased IWU relating
    to high precipitation. It should be noted that IWU in SSP1-2.6 will shift to increasing
    from decreasing in the SSP3-70 scenario over some provinces such as Shaanxi, Henan,
    and Ningxia. This shift is more evident in the SSP5-85 scenario, suggesting that
    more IWU will be required if future warming scenarios switch from low to high.
    We calculated the extra cost resulting from future IWU changes based on 1981–2010,
    using the average IWU price of US $0.09 per cubic meters in China (Figures 6b
    and 6c). Obtaining the value of water accurately is challenging due to the lack
    of a standardized pricing mechanism across different countries and regions. Here
    we employed a global mean water value for major crops as a useful starting point
    for our analysis (Bierkens et al., 2019; D’Odorico et al., 2020), allowing us
    to gain a broad understanding of the patterns and economic effects of IWU. For
    SSP1-26 scenario, the extra cost will be US $1.65–3.25 billion/year by 2050s and
    US $2.28–3.28 billion/year by 2100s due to the increased IWU. For SSP3-70 scenario,
    an extra gain of US $2.37–3.18 billion/year by 2050s and US $3.11–5.3 billion/year
    by 2100s is obtained, higher than that for SSP1-26 scenario. Moreover, under the
    SSP5-85 scenario, the additional expenditure induced by IWU changes will reach
    US $2.37–3.91 billion/year by 2050s and US $4.88–6.5 billion/year by 2100s. Collectively,
    more costs will be required in the future scenario that is impacted by climate
    change and socioeconomic development. These findings call attention to the threat
    for future irrigation water use and even food security. 4 Discussion 4.1 Contributions
    of Remote Sensing and ML to IWU Calculation The performance of IWU calculation
    is tightly related to the proper model drivers, especially the completeness of
    SM and the accuracy of ET (Zhang et al., 2022). On the one hand, SM plays a crucial
    role in estimating IWU by characterizing soil water holding capacity. Our study
    demonstrates that combining satellite-based SSM and reanalysis RZSM allows for
    reliable IWU estimates. By considering both SSM and RZSM, our model captures the
    combined effect of immediate and sustained water availability on crop irrigation
    demand, enhancing accuracy, particularly in regions with diverse soil and crop
    types. The two soil moisture variables complement each other in representing different
    aspects of water availability to crops. Nevertheless, the lack of long-term full
    coverage soil moisture record is a notable issue for a national scale analysis.
    Here a machine learning-based approach is introduced to reconstruct nearly full
    coverage satellite-derived SSM products, and the generated nearly full coverage
    of SSM improves the model accuracy by ∼40% relative to raw ESA SSM. On the other
    hand, ET is important in determining soil water dynamics, and is correlated with
    crop biophysical characteristics. Previous studies have illustrated that GLEAM
    ET, as a seamless satellite-derived product, can achieve good performance of estimating
    IWU at a regional scale (Jalilvand et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2019). Our study
    corroborates the applicability of the GLEAM model for national-scale IWU estimation
    and demonstrates that GLEAM ET is better in estimating IWU than other ET data
    sets. Given that GLEAM may underestimate soil evaporation since it measures only
    surface soil moisture (Zhou et al., 2021), the improved version of the ET data
    set should be recommended in further work. In addition, a set of future ET and
    SM data sets are well simulated using earth system models in our work, which can
    further drive the ML-based IWU model into future scenarios. Such a scheme for
    future scenario analysis can potentially be extended to other agricultural and
    biogeochemical measures. Our results highlight the effectiveness of machine learning
    for estimating both present and future IWU. While XGB and SVM models achieved
    commendable accuracy in calculating IWU, they slightly underperformed compared
    to the RF model. The consistent performance across machine learning approaches
    strengthens the credibility of our framework, affirming the relevance of selected
    variables to IWU dynamics. These models leverage intricate relationships among
    environmental factors, facilitating reliable predictions of irrigation water requirements.
    Discrepancies among models may arise from factors such as feature engineering,
    hyperparameter tuning, data distribution, etc (Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2021).
    The potential uncertainties stemming from model complexity, highlighting the importance
    of further research and model refinement. Mention that our study primarily focuses
    on the city or prefecture level in China, providing localized and relevant insights
    for policy decisions and water resource management strategies. However, our findings
    can also serve as references for province-scale studies. Training the IWU estimation
    model at the province level may lead to higher accuracy compared to the prefecture
    scale, benefiting from a larger training data set (i.e., the combination of each
    prefecture within the province) that can better capture variations and avoid extreme
    ranges. 4.2 Comparing With Existing Studies Numerous models have been proposed
    for estimating IWU in the current literature. For instance, the SAtellite Monitoring
    of IRrigation (SAMIR) models and soil water balance models have been widely utilized
    for field-scale IWU estimation (Jalilvand et al., 2019; Simonneaux et al., 2009).
    However, many of these earlier methods have been primarily validated at the regional
    scale and rely on sufficient in situ measurements to optimize their models, thus
    limiting their nationwide implementation. Moreover, previous studies focusing
    on relatively coarse spatial resolutions at sub-catchment and watershed scales
    may result in underestimated IWU estimates due to a lack of constrained prior
    knowledge (Parsinejad et al., 2022; Zaussinger et al., 2019). In contrast, our
    proposed model effectively overcomes these limitations, achieving a harmonious
    balance between spatial scale and estimation accuracy. The national IWU estimates
    derived from our study exhibit reasonable accuracy, as demonstrated by R2 values
    ranging from 0.86 to 0.91 and RMSE values between 0.26 and 0.361 km3/yr at the
    prefecture level. These accuracy metrics are comparable to or even superior to
    those reported in existing studies (Table S3 in Supporting Information S1) and
    two IWU data sets obtained from satellite data sets and process-based models (Figures
    S9 and S10 in Supporting Information S1). Despite the growing recognition of the
    agricultural water stress under climate change (Guo & Shen, 2016; Zhang & Cai,
    2013), its future trends and variations have yet to be discovered due to data
    opacity and model constraints. While some previous studies have attempted to simulate
    global- or national-scale future (Elliott et al., 2014; Wada & Bierkens, 2014),
    the spatial resolutions of these endeavors have proven too coarse to capture intricate
    dynamics in specific regions. Our extension work offers a valuable tool to discern
    the national pattern of IWU under future scenarios. To the best of our knowledge,
    this research represents an initial step toward comprehending the potential impacts
    of climate change and effective emission controls on agricultural irrigation in
    China. 4.3 Implications, Caveats, and Prospects Our work implies that the conflict
    between water supply and withdrawal will be exacerbated under all emissions scenarios
    in China, especially in northern and western provinces. In other words, farmers
    in China may face a heavier burden under the worst-case future scenario, which
    should raise awareness of the government and stakeholders. To avoid the adverse
    effects of water scarcity resulting from the increased IWU, a variety of measures
    are needed to save agricultural water use, such as optimizing crop planting structures
    and popularizing high-efficiency irrigation technology. Meanwhile, attention should
    be given to ensure water supply, which is essential due to the already uneven
    spatial distribution of water supply and demand across China (Jiang, 2009). Although
    the southern China provinces are rich in water resources, most of the northern
    China provinces tend to be short of more water resources where a rise in IWU is
    projected. It is thus necessary to accelerate the construction of water conservancy
    projects in northern and western China, entirely using water resources, such as
    sewage and rainwater, and reducing the overexploitation of groundwater. In addition,
    our work may provide evidence for water resource management, such as China''s
    South-to-North Water Diversion Project (Y.-C. Wang et al., 2021), which has been
    transferring water from southern China to northern China since 2013. While water
    resources scarcity in some of northern China (e.g., Haihe River Basin and the
    Yellow River Basin) will be exacerbated due to the increased IWU under a warming
    climate, in other regions (e.g., Huaihe River Basin), it will alleviate slightly
    (Figures 15 and 16 in Supporting Information S1). Hence, it is necessary to consider
    the adaptation strategy of the water diversion projects. In light of our work''s
    merits, it is essential to acknowledge certain caveats that warrant careful consideration.
    First, the spatial resolution of our available data set and simulated products
    may be too coarse to effectively capture fine-scale variations in ET and soil
    moisture. Due to such limitation, the consideration of crop type and irrigation
    equipment was constrained in our model. To address this, future research could
    incorporate high-resolution satellite observations and numerical model simulations
    for more detailed estimations. Second, within the proposed machine learning-based
    framework, quantifying the contribution of groundwater to irrigation poses a challenge
    due to the limited focus on physical mechanisms. Given that groundwater serves
    as a critical water source for agricultural irrigation, particularly in northern
    China, the estimation of IWU may be prone to overestimation if groundwater supplies
    are not adequately accounted for. Third, our method may not fully capture the
    actual heterogeneity of land use changes. Factors such as stakeholders'' choice
    of crop types, the adoption of efficient irrigation methods, and various farm
    management practices including mulching, introduce significant uncertainties in
    the simulation and prediction of IWU, especially pronounced in the arid regions
    of Northwest China. To improve accuracy, future advancements could involve integrating
    crop models that consider irrigation efficiency and water distribution in the
    irrigation process. Lastly, the selection of model structures and explanatory
    variables significantly impacts the accuracy of model simulation results. Emphasizing
    the rationale behind model choices, particularly in efficiently handling extreme
    values, is of paramount importance in future research efforts. It should be mentioned
    that the unique characteristics of northern arid zones in China, including data
    limitations, model structure uncertainty, and the complex interplay of factors
    affecting IWU, make it a particularly challenging region for accurate IWU estimation
    using remote sensing. One notable challenge arises from the distribution of our
    validation sites. The high accuracy of the developed model compared to the site-scale
    data may be because most of the collected sites are concentrated in eastern China,
    and there are fewer site contrasts for the northern arid zones (e.g., Gansu, Ningxia)
    due to the inaccessibility of the data. This limitation underscores the necessity
    of addressing geographic diversity in validation data to ensure the model''s generalizability
    across a wider range of regions. This concern will be considered in our future
    work, where we intend to expand our data set through enhanced field measurements
    and integration of model-simulated data. On the other hand, our model encountered
    challenges when simulating IWU in the northern arid zone. The limitations in accuracy
    and spatial resolution of evapotranspiration data in these drylands contributed
    to this issue. Additionally, it is likely that the machine learning model overlooked
    subtle signals that are crucial for capturing high levels of extreme IWU. Addressing
    these challenges further requires a combination of improved data collection, more
    advanced remote sensing technologies, and modeling techniques that can account
    for the complexities of the region. While our study employs static irrigated areas
    for future scenarios, it is crucial to acknowledge that future irrigation water
    use is influenced by various factors. In addition to climate variables, the expansion
    and intensification of croplands plays a significant role in driving irrigation
    water demand. Regions undergoing such changes are likely to experience higher
    irrigation requirements than our model estimates suggest. Conversely, climate
    change-induced snow melting has profound implications for irrigation water use,
    especially in snow-reliant regions (Qin et al., 2020; Zhu, Kim, et al., 2022).
    As global temperatures rise, accelerated snowmelt can alter water availability,
    runoff patterns, and even impact groundwater resources, further affecting irrigation
    demands. Therefore, understanding the dynamic interplay of cropland changes and
    climate factors is essential for accurate projections of future irrigation water
    use, warranting further investigation. 5 Conclusions Machine learning has emerged
    as a powerful tool for simulating and predicting ecohydrological variables, offering
    great potential for estimating IWU on a national or global scale. Our study presents
    a robust framework for prefecture-scale IWU calculating, employing a machine learning-based
    model integrated with a bootstrap strategy and a comprehensive long-term prefecture-level
    training data set spanning approximately 30 years. The selection of an appropriate
    model structure and the identification of effective model drivers are crucial
    steps in our approach, encompassing a diverse range of data sources. These sources
    include satellite observations, field measurements, and relevant model knowledge.
    Our study establishes the credibility of the chosen variables in accurately depicting
    IWU dynamics. This substantiation is evident at both station-level assessments,
    encompassing 11 cropland stations, and prefecture-level evaluations, encompassing
    339 prefectures. Notably, our model is adaptable to future scenarios, contingent
    upon the availability of reliable data sets. Specifically, we extend our proposed
    machine learning model to project IWU trends up to the 2100s, utilizing data from
    four Earth system models. The results indicate that, under various emissions scenarios,
    China''s IWU is expected to increase by 8.5%–17.1% (6.8%–34.8%) by the 2050s (2100s)
    compared to the historical period (1981–2010), with higher emissions resulting
    in more significant increases. This rise in IWU by the 2050s (2100s) is associated
    with an estimated additional cost of US $1.65–3.91 ($2.28–6.5) billion per year.
    Our findings carry substantial implications for policymakers, providing them with
    valuable insights to anticipate forthcoming challenges and opportunities in water
    resources management. This is particularly pertinent to water security and the
    intricate balance between water supplies and usage across diverse regions. Acknowledgments

    Notes Abstract Remote sensing technology is an essential tool for tracking human-induced
    alterations on the water cycle, among which irrigation prevails. The possibility
    of obtaining detailed and accurate information on the actual irrigation extent
    through remote-sensing-based approaches is of paramount importance for water resources
    management. In this study, an update of the TSIMAP (Temporal-Stability-derived
    Irrigation MAPping) method, originally developed with satellite soil moisture
    as an input, is proposed. To demonstrate that the flexibility of the approach
    does not affect its main strength point (i.e., good accuracy in the face of high
    simplicity for users), a dual analysis relying on 1 km NDVI (Normalised Difference
    Vegetation Index) instead of soil moisture is carried out over the Ebro basin
    (Spain); data delivered by the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) are used.
    First, results of this work are compared with outcomes from the method’s original
    implementation obtained over a focus area (denominated “Ebro_CATAR”) through satellite
    soil moisture. In the proposed configuration relying on NDVI, an overall accuracy
    (OA) up to 93% is found. Results highlight an increase in OA ranging from +2%
    to +6% depending on the validation strategy with respect to the TSIMAP implementation
    relying on soil moisture. Then, a basin-scale application is performed, providing
    performances still satisfactory (OA = 75%) notwithstanding a higher degree of
    heterogeneity. Keywords: irrigation mapping; remote sensing; TSIMAP; temporal
    stability; K-means algorithm 1. Introduction Irrigation is the prevalent source
    of anthropogenic water consumption. Its effects have repercussions on multiple
    dynamics affecting human beings and Earth’s surface [1], such as food production
    [2,3,4], spread of diseases [5,6], freshwater availability [7,8,9] and climate
    [10,11,12]. Notwithstanding this, irrigation is still often not considered a hydrological
    variable in its own right, and data on irrigation dynamics are often missing [13,14,15]
    or not scientifically organised [16]. The detailed knowledge of actual irrigation
    extents is crucial for many hydrological and water resource management applications
    [17,18,19]. Starting from the early 2000s, several irrigation mapping techniques
    relying on satellite information have been developed. As pointed out by the comprehensive
    review by Massari et al. [20], various types of satellite retrievals from optical
    [21,22,23,24], to cite a few, and microwave, see, e.g., [25,26,27,28], sensors
    can be successfully exploited for mapping irrigated areas at different spatial
    scales. Methods relying on multi-source input data also exist [29,30,31,32,33,34].
    Most of the approaches available in the scientific literature rely on supervised
    machine learning models requiring training; hence, ancillary ground-truth information
    is required for their implementation. By contrast, Dari et al. [27] proposed a
    novel approach for speedy irrigation mapping relying on a combination of statistical
    features derived from the temporal stability theory [35] and the unsupervised
    k-means clustering algorithm [36], henceforth defined as TSIMAP (Temporal-Stability-derived
    Irrigation MAPping) approach. The method does not require any training procedure
    and, as recently pointed out in a comparative analysis by Bazzi et al. [37], ensures
    satisfactory performances in face of its simplicity. So far, the method has been
    developed and implemented with satellite soil moisture at different spatial resolutions
    as input [27,28]. Nevertheless, it is supposed to work with any kind of input
    information that is a proxy for irrigation occurrence. The aim of this work is
    to actually demonstrate the flexibility of the TSIMAP method, whose applicability
    is not limited by a single type of input data. In order to achieve this, a twofold
    analysis carried out over the Ebro basin (Spain) by exploiting 1 km NDVI (Normalised
    Difference Vegetation Index) from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) is
    proposed. First, a comparative analysis with outcomes from the method’s implementation
    relying on satellite soil moisture by Dari et al. [27] is carried out. The comparison
    is focused over the same period (2016–2017) and the same portion of the Ebro basin
    considered in a previous study by the authors. As a second step, a basin-scale
    application considering the irrigation seasons in the time span of 2015–2020is
    performed. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The study is focused over
    the Ebro basin (Spain), a site that has attracted, in recent years, the interest
    of many researchers working on the topic of irrigation monitoring through satellite
    data [26,34,38,39,40,41]. This is because the Ebro catchment is an area rich in
    irrigation data, a rather rare feature worldwide. With a total drainage area of
    about 86,000 km2, the Ebro basin is the largest Mediterranean catchment of Spain;
    it is prevalently characterised by a cold semi-arid climate with an oceanic climate
    area in its Northern portion [42], where several reservoirs store water from the
    Pyrenees to be delivered to the crops located downstream in the central valley
    through a complex network of irrigation canals [39]. The analysis presented in
    this study is carried out on the basin’s flat agricultural portions only, which
    are shown in Figure 1. Such a domain includes both irrigated and non-irrigated
    areas; it is outlined through the 100 m resolution Corine Land Cover data set
    referring to the year 2018 (CLC 2018), distributed by the Copernicus Land Monitoring
    Service (https://doi.org/10.2909/960998c1-1870-4e82-8051-6485205ebbac (accessed
    on 13 November 2019). The land cover types that are considered are listed in the
    figure’s legend. It is important to specify that the information from the CLC
    2018 is only used to delineate the spatial domain of agricultural areas (rainfed
    and irrigated) to be considered; as a benchmark for the actual extent of irrigated
    areas, we use more site-specific and accurate data sets as described in Section
    2.3. Moreover, a double-scale analysis is carried out. First, the area enclosed
    by the red box of Figure 1 is considered in order to compare results with outcomes
    of Dari et al. [27]; such portion, whose extension is 10,000 km2, encloses a wide
    irrigated area shared between the Catalonia and Aragon regions and is henceforth
    denominated “Ebro_CATAR”. Then, a basin-scale application is performed (see Section
    2.3 for further details). Figure 1. Land cover classes according to the Corine
    Land Cover 2018 (CLC 2018) data set that are enclosed in the portion of the Ebro
    basin considered in this study. The comparison with results from Dari et al. [27]
    is carried out over the portion delimited by the red box, the Ebro_CATAR area.

    The TSIMAP Method: Theory and Input Data The TSIMAP method was first proposed
    by Dari et al. [27]. It relies on the temporal stability concept originally formulated
    by Vachaud et al. [35] for optimising soil moisture measurement networks [43,44,45,46].
    Morbidelli et al. [47] also explored the possibility of adapting the concept to
    raingauge network design. The theory relies on statistical features able to describe
    the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input data set. Hence, if applied to an irrigation
    proxy variable, it is possible to use the temporal stability theory to detect
    where irrigation actually occurs. With this intuition, the approach was originally
    proposed by exploiting satellite soil moisture as an input [27]. In this study,
    the method is implemented using NDVI data from the CGLS (https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/ndvi
    (accessed on 29 November 2023)), retrieved through the VEGETATION sensor aboard
    the SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) platform, subsequently substituted,
    from 2013 onwards, by PROBA-V (PRoject for On-Board Autonomy-VEGETATION) [48].
    Specifically, product version 2.2 characterised by a spatial resolution of 1 km
    and sampled at a temporal frequency of 10 days is used [49]. Data from 2015 to
    2020 are considered. Considering the NDVI value observed at the pixel 𝑥 and time

             (2) If averaged in time during the highest intensity irrigation
    season, which for the study area coincides with the period spanning from May to
    September [27], the relative differences and the temporal anomalies can be used
    as diagnostic indices for detecting where irrigation occurs. In fact, during the
    irrigation seasons, irrigated crops are expected to show well-developed vegetation
    conditions, which can be translated into higher values of relative differences
    and of temporal anomalies with respect to rainfed areas. On the basis of such
    an assumption, the temporal-stability-derived indices can be used as input features
    for the k-means clustering method [36]. It allows to group 𝑛 data points into
    𝑘 clusters on the basis of their similarity, expressed by the minimum Euclidian
    distance with each cluster’s centroid. The k-means is an unsupervised clustering
    algorithm; hence, it does not require any training, but the user is asked to interpret
    the clusters’ meaning. Further details can be found in Dari et al. [27,28]. In
    this work, the mean relative differences (RD) and the mean temporal anomalies
    (TA) during the highest intensity irrigation seasons are used as input data points
    for k-means clustering. The final output consists in binary maps of rainfed and
    irrigated areas at 1 km spatial resolution. 2.3. Work Logic and Ground Truth Data
    Sets A twofold analysis is carried out. First, a comparison between results obtained
    by forcing the TSIMAP approach with NDVI data and outcomes of the method’s first
    implementation relying on soil moisture [27] is performed. The analysis iscarried
    out over the same basin’s portion considered in Dari et al. [27], the Ebro_CATAR
    domain (10,000 km2), enclosing the largest irrigated portion of the entire basin.
    In this first analysis, the same validation strategy proposed in the previous
    work by the authors is implemented to ensure that the comparison is as fair as
    possible. The crop maps produced over the domain of the Geographic Information
    System for Agricultural Parcels (SIGPAC) and distributed by the Department d’Agricultura,
    Ramaderia, Pesca i Alimentació are used. This data set, henceforth referred to
    as SIGPAC data, is available at the plot scale and for each year at http://agricultura.gencat.cat/ca/serveis/cartografia-sig/aplicatius-tematics-geoinformacio/sigpac/mapa-cultius/
    (accessed on 9 October 2019). It is noteworthy that the data set is available
    for the Catalonia region only. The pre-processing chain to aggregate SIGPAC data
    from the original resolution to 1 km is fully described in Dari et al. [27]; the
    only difference adopted in this work is that natural or forested areas are not
    considered, so, this kind of pixels are masked out. Two types of information contained
    in the SIGPAC data set are exploited, resulting in an equal number of validation
    assessments. First, the irrigated/non-irrigated attribute is exploited (first
    validation). Even though the irrigated areas of the Ebro basin are quite static
    in time, as thoroughly explained in Dari et al. [27], the irrigation attribute
    in the SIGPAC data set means that the irrigation network can reach a specific
    field, but it does not necessarily imply that irrigation actually occurs there.
    Hence, the information referring to summer crops only, which are very likely irrigated
    during the irrigation season, is considered in the second validation, in which
    all the other crops are considered as rainfed. Similarly to what was performed
    in Dari et al. [27], this first analysis covers the 2-year period of 2016–2017.
    It is important to mention that in the previous work by the authors, experiments
    considering three clusters (rainfed, natural/forested and irrigated areas) were
    carried out. To ensure a consistent comparison with the authors’ previous study,
    the best performing classification in reproducing irrigated areas resulting in
    that work is re-implemented here by considering only two clusters, i.e., rainfed
    and irrigated areas. In this way, results obtained in Dari et al. [27] and in
    this work are fully comparable. As a second step, a basin-scale application is
    proposed. Hence, the method is applied over the whole domain of agricultural areas
    (see Figure 1). In this case, as a ground truth information, the map of the basin’s
    irrigated areas according to the Hydrological Plan of the Ebro basin is used.
    The map, produced by the Ebro Hydrological Confederation (CHEBRO, https://www.chebro.es/
    (accessed on 15 April 2020)), is dated 2004; hence, it could miss some irrigation
    portions recently developed. Nevertheless, the main irrigation districts were
    already developed at that time. Such information, henceforth defined as the CHEBRO
    map, is used to validate a static map obtained by applying the TSIMAP method to
    all the irrigation seasons of the considered period, i.e., from 2015 to 2020.
    This choice is led by the reasonable assumption of irrigation extents quite static
    in time at the basin scale and also by the nature of the available ground truth
    information. For validating the basin-scale irrigation map, all the pixels of
    the CHEBRO map are considered as irrigated (since the map only provides the edges
    of irrigated areas), while the other pixels of the agricultural areas within the
    Ebro basin are considered as rainfed. Figure 2 provides a scheme summarising the
    main features of the analyses carried out. Figure 2. Overview of the analyses
    carried out: (1) comparison of results obtained in this study through NDVI against
    outcomes of method’s first implementation through remotely sensed soil moisture

    Implementation Relying on Soil Moisture In this section, results obtained over
    the smaller domain considered in Dari et al. [27] and validated with detailed
    ground truth information from the SIGPAC data set are presented. Outcomes referring
    to the irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017 are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4,
    respectively. Both figures are organised in six panels: Figure 3a and Figure 4a
    show the location of the Ebro_CATAR area with respect to the basin extension,
    Figure 3b, Figure 4b and Figure 3c, Figure 4c show the mean RD and the mean TA,
    respectively, during the highest-intensity irrigation season (May–September),
    Figure 3d, Figure 4d and Figure 3e, Figure 4e provide the SIGPAC ground truth
    maps according to the two validation strategies, and Figure 3f and Figure 4f show
    the rainfed/irrigated map resulting from the TSIMAP method, respectively. In Figures
    from Figure 3d and Figure 4d to Figure 3f and Figure 4f, light brown and blue
    green are used to indicate rainfed and irrigated areas, respectively. We note
    that for Figures from Figure 3b and Figure 4b to Figure 3f and Figure 4f, data
    are shown over the portion falling into the Catalonia region only, as this is
    the domain where benchmark information from the SIGPAC data set is available,
    respectively. Even with different magnitudes, for both irrigation seasons of 2016
    and 2017, the mean RD and TA of NDVI prove themselves to be promising diagnostic
    indices for detecting irrigated areas. In fact, the maps of Figure 3b, Figure
    3c and Figure 4b and Figure 4c show consistent spatial patterns with higher (mostly
    positive) values over areas where irrigation is expected to occur and lower (mostly
    negative) values over the surrounding dryland area extending to the east, respectively.
    Figure 3. Results obtained in this study over the Ebro_CATAR domain and referring
    to the irrigation season of 2016: panel (a) provides the location of the Ebro_CATAR
    area, panels (b,c) show the mean relative differences (RD) and the mean temporal
    anomalies (TA), respectively, during the highest-intensity irrigation season (May–September),
    panels (d,e) show the SIGPAC ground truth maps according to Validations 1 and
    2, and panel (f) shows the resulting rainfed/irrigated (R/I) map. We note that
    in panels (d–f), light brown and blue green are used to indicate rainfed and irrigated
    areas, respectively. Figure 4. Same as Figure 3 but referring to the irrigation
    season of 2017. For both irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017, the mean RD and
    TA are used as input data points to perform the k-means classification and produce
    the 1 km maps of rainfed and irrigated areas shown in Figure 3f and Figure 4f,
    respectively. Figure 5a provides the confusion matrices synthesising the accuracy
    of the resulting maps according to the two validation approaches, i.e., comparing
    maps in Figure 3f, Figure 4f with those shown in Figure 3d, Figure 4d and Figure
    3e, Figure 4e. Overall, a satisfying accuracy in properly reproducing rainfed
    and irrigated portions is obtained in both irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017.
    According to Validation 1, 88% and 87% of irrigated areas are properly reproduced
    by the TSIMAP method in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Almost all the rainfed areas
    are properly classified, since in both irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017 an
    accuracy of 97% is reached. According to Validation 2, the same results are obtained
    for both irrigation seasons considered. The accuracy in properly classifying irrigated
    areas rises to 98%, but this happens at the expense of the accuracy in reproducing
    rainfed areas, which drops to 84%. Figure 5. Panel (a): Confusion matrices synthesising
    the accuracy of the classifications into rainfed (R) and irrigated (I) areas according
    to the two validation approaches implemented. Panel (b): same but referring to
    the classifications proposed in Dari et al. [27] modified considering rainfed
    (R) and irrigated (I) areas only. For both panels, the first row refers to 2016,
    while the second one refers to 2017; ground truth classes are represented on the
    y-axis, while the classes obtained through the TSIMAP method are shown on the
    x-axis. Dari et al. [27] explored different combinations of input parameters derived
    from satellite soil moisture to map irrigation. The authors found that the standard
    deviation of RD and mean TA calculated for the 1 km DISPATCH (Disaggregation based
    on Physical and Theoretical scale Change) downscaled SMAP (Soil Moisture Active
    Passive) product [50] were the best diagnostic indices for reproducing irrigated
    areas, reporting a maximum accuracy of 78% reached according to Validation 2 considering
    the irrigation season of 2017. However, as explained in Section 2.3, such a result
    refers to the capability in reproducing three different clusters, and not in discerning
    between rainfed and irrigated areas only as in this case. For this reason, the
    experiment offering the best accuracy according to Dari et al. [27] is repeated
    here by considering two clusters only and results are summarised by the confusion
    matrices of Figure 5b. The differences with the implementation relying on NDVI
    proposed here thin out, especially in the capability of the method in reproducing
    actual irrigated areas; accuracies differ by 1–2%, still in favour of the new
    implementation. Higher differences are found with respect to the capability of
    recognising rainfed areas. The classification based on satellite soil moisture
    provides accuracies lower than those relying on NDVI by 10% and 8% (and by 3%)
    for both the validation experiments in 2016 (2017). 3.2. Basin-Scale Application
    The TSIMAP method is then applied at the basin scale to produce a static map of
    rainfed and irrigated agricultural areas across the years of 2015–2020. The k-means
    classification is carried out by using as input data points the mean RD and TA
    during the irrigation seasons (May–September) of the period of 2015–2020. The
    resulting maps are shown in Figure 6; consistent spatial patterns of higher average
    RD and TA values are found over areas known to be irrigated, such as agricultural
    lands within the Ebro_CATAR domain, the narrow area in the basin central valley
    running along the main reach of the Ebro and the river delta [39]. Figure 6. Mean
    relative differences (RD) and temporal anomalies (TA) during the highest-intensity
    irrigation seasons (May–September) of the period of 2015–2020. The accuracy of
    the map of rainfed/irrigated areas derived from the input indices shown in Figure
    6 is assessed through comparison with the CHEBRO map. Results are summarised in
    Figure 7. Figure 7a shows the map produced by the TSIMAP method, Figure 7b provides
    the ground truth map and Figure 7c contains the confusion matrix. As can be depicted
    by visual inspection of maps in Figure 7a and Figure 7b and by accuracies reported
    in Figure 7c, irrigated areas are satisfactorily reproduced at the basin scale
    also, which is characterised by higher heterogeneity. The percentage of irrigated
    areas properly classified is equal to 81% of the total. Higher uncertainty exists
    in properly classifying rainfed areas, for which the accuracy drops to 72%. Figure
    7. Assessment of results of the basin-scale application: panel (a) shows the map
    of rainfed (R, indicated in light brown) irrigated (I, indicated in green blue)
    areas produced through the TSIMAP method and panel (b) provides the CHEBRO ground
    truth map. Panel (c) shows the corresponding confusion matrix, with ground truth
    classes on the Y-axis and predicted ones on the X-axis. 4. Discussion The aim
    of this work is to showcase the flexibility of the TSIMAP method originally proposed
    in a previous work by the authors with satellite soil moisture data as an input.
    However, the method is expected to provide satisfactory results with any input
    observation that can be an irrigation proxy and for which the temporal stability
    concept applies, without losing its characteristic of ease of use that distinguishes
    it from other methods available in the literature [37]. For this reason, the approach
    is implemented with 1 km NDVI data from the CGLS, as several studies linking irrigation
    dynamics with NDVI are available in the literature [23,51,52,53]. The comparison
    against outcomes from the method’s first implementation reveal a slight increase
    in the capability of properly classifying irrigated areas and more substantial
    improvements in detecting rainfed areas when forcing the approach with NDVI observations.
    In terms of overall accuracy (OA), a value of 93% and 92% is reached according
    to Validation 1 for the irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017, respectively. For
    Validation 2, the OA is 88% for both years. Over the same area, Elwan et al. [34]
    reported an accuracy on the order of 87% through a supporting vector machine classification
    fed with statistical features from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 as an input. Gao
    et al. [26] reached an accuracy of 81% using Sentinel-1-derived features over
    the same domain, but three classes (irrigated crops, irrigated trees, and non-irrigated
    fields) were considered in that work. In both works by Gao et al. [26] and Elwan
    et al. [34], methods requiring training were adopted, while the TSIMAP approach
    did not require this step. It is important to point out that results from Gao
    et al. [26] and Elwan et al. [34] refer to a finer spatial scale (at the field
    level) with respect to the 1 km scale adopted in this work. In the basin-scale
    application, an OA equal to 75% is reached. Even though a decreasing accuracy
    can be encountered when enlarging the considered domain and thus facing higher
    heterogeneity, it is important to point out that results of the two analyses carried
    out are not directly comparable since different ground truth data sets are used.
    A closer look at NDVI dynamics can help in assessing results. Figure 8 shows the
    rainfed and irrigated areas properly classified (true rainfed and true irrigated,
    respectively), the irrigated areas erroneously classified as rainfed (false rainfed)
    and the rainfed areas wrongly classified as irrigated (false irrigated). The 14-day
    aggregated time series of NDVI averaged over each one of the domains above are
    also shown in Figure 8b, where the main watering seasons (May–September) are highlighted
    in light grey. False rainfed areas are scattered and often located adjacent to
    the edges of irrigated areas; hence, it is possible that the 1 km sampling adopted
    here is not fine enough to properly detect complex patterns. However, the NDVI
    signal over those areas is similar to the one detected over true rainfed portions
    (see light brown and pink lines in Figure 8b). The green blue line referring to
    true irrigated areas clearly shows a second NDVI peak during the period May–September
    attributable to irrigation occurrence. False irrigated areas (mostly located in
    the northwestern side) represent the highest source of uncertainties. For those
    areas, the NDVI time series (black line in Figure 8b) do not show a clear peak
    during the irrigation season, but values are comparable to those detected over
    true irrigated areas. This can be an index of areas where NDVI is systematically
    higher than the basin average (see also Figure 6), thus leading to wrong classification.
    Nevertheless, uncertainties could come from the ground truth data set as well.
    As explained in Section 2.3, the CHEBRO map dates back to 2004; hence, it is possible
    that recently developed irrigated areas are detected by satellite NDVI but are
    still classified as rainfed in the benchmark data set. Figure 8. Panel (a) shows
    the map of true irrigated, false rainfed, false irrigated, and true rainfed areas.
    Panel (b) provides the 14-day aggregated NDVI time series averaged over each domain.
    5. Conclusions The analyses carried out in this work demonstrate the flexibility
    of the TSIMAP method, able to provide optimal performances in face of its simplicity
    for end-users [37]. The approach’s applicability is not limited to the use of
    satellite soil moisture as an input, as the method can be fed with any irrigation-proxy
    data (e.g., vegetation indices, evapotranspiration estimates, land surface temperature
    records). To showcase this, an implementation relying on 1 km NDVI is proposed.
    Results outperform the method’s first implementation by Dari et al. [27], with
    increases of OA equal to +6% in the irrigation season of 2016 according to both
    validation procedures implemented and to +2% and +3% according to Validations
    1 and 2, respectively, considering 2017. A basin-scale application is performed
    as well, producing a static map across irrigation seasons within the period of
    2015–2020 providing satisfactory results despite a higher heterogeneity. The method’s
    flexibility allows potential operational applications at different spatial resolutions
    [28]. For instance, the TSIMAP approach represents a useful tool to refine irrigation
    water use estimates from satellite data, as hinted by Kragh et al. [54] and Dari
    et al. [39]. Further assessments of the performances of the proposed approach
    with different types of input (e.g., merging soil moisture and vegetation indices)
    data with respect to varying climatic contexts are the foreseen next steps of
    this research. Author Contributions Conceptualisation, J.D.; methodology, J.D.,

    Modeling Maize Yield and Soil Water Content with AquaCrop Under Full and Deficit
    Irrigation Managements Article 28 March 2015 Introduction Canola is one of the
    crops whose cultivation is increasing due to oilseeds and food consumption (Reddy
    and Redi, 2003). In addition to its high yield potential, canola has a high percentage
    of seed oil (40 to 45%) when compared with other oilseeds. Currently, canola is
    the focus of plans for increasing oilseeds production in Iran. The nutritional
    value of this crop along with its adaptation to different climate conditions has
    caused this plant to be cultivated in most parts of Iran (Zomorodian et al. 2010).
    Although the production of this product is of considerable importance in the food
    industry, the conditions of Iran’s water resources have led to the application
    of scenarios to reduce the irrigation water for various crops, including canola
    (Mousavizadeh et al. 2016). On the other hand, limited research budgets and time-consuming
    field experiments to investigate the crop response to different irrigation scenarios
    have resulted in envisaging simulation models for this purpose (Raes et al. 2009;
    Geerts and Raes 2009). Simulation models represent mutual relationship between
    the components of a system by mathematical equations (Wallach et al. 2019). Models
    are classified into four groups based on the relationships in the simulation process:
    1. mathematical models, 2. experimental models, 3. static models, and 4. dynamic
    models. In the dynamic models, the temporal variations of variables have been
    considered. That is while static models do not have the ability to predict the
    state of the system in future periods. The experimental models, unlike mathematical
    models that are completely based on cause-and-effect relationships between variables,
    have been developed based on regression relationships. Therefore, the experimental
    models cannot be generalized to different conditions and will provide appropriate
    results only under the same conditions by calibrating constant coefficients of
    equations (Overman and Scholtz 2002). Crop models are recognized as a valuable
    tool for the integrated simulation of processes affecting crop growth (Wallach
    et al. 2019). These models have been used in many research fields, including predicting
    the production of agricultural crops under different environmental and managerial
    conditions (Ahmadi et al. 2015; Sandhu and Irmak 2019) as well as scheduling and
    optimizing water and fertilizer consumption (Fang et al. 2017a, 2017b; Liu et
    al. 2017). It is known that crop models are considered as a comprehensive tool
    for estimating the crop yield, a comprehensive combination of values under physiological
    conditions (Azam-Ali et al. 2001; Steduto et al. 2009) and for evaluating crop
    management options (Mabhaudhi et al. 2014). Crop models that can accurately estimate
    various crop growth parameters, soil water dynamics, plant water use, and expected
    yield under different levels of irrigation can provide essential assistance to
    the successful implementation of limited and complete irrigation management practices
    (Sandhu and Irmak 2019). Given that previous simulation models had a lot of complexity
    in addition to many input parameters, extensive efforts have been made by FAO
    to develop a model with high accuracy, simplicity and capability. Eventually,
    this effort led to AquaCrop, which is an engineering model (Nyakudya and Stroosnijder
    2014). The AquaCrop model, whose algorithm has been developed based on the amount
    of water consumed by the plant (transpiration), is one of the most widely used
    and simplest models for simulating the crop growth (Raes et al. 2009; Steduto
    et al. 2009). AquaCrop is a comprehensive model, meaning that it can be used for
    a wide range of crops including fodder, vegetables, grains, fruits, oils and tubers.
    AquaCrop improves farm management strategies including planting time, plant density
    and chemical fertilizers and simulates water use performance and efficiency. The
    applications of this model include evaluation of rainfed crop production in the
    long term, effect of low fertilization, actual water productivity (WP) on the
    farm, analysis of future climate scenarios, deficit irrigation scheduling and
    supplementary irrigation among others. There are many models that estimate the
    crop water requirement based on the plant, soil and climate systems. The AquaCrop
    model simulates the economic yield (Y) and biomass (B) of different crops (Raes
    et al. 2009). Compared with other simulation models, AquaCrop requires fewer parameters
    and input data (including climate data, plant, farm and irrigation management,
    soil and groundwater characteristics) to simulate the crop response to water (Mousavizadeh
    et al. 2016). This model can be used for most major crop and plant products worldwide.
    It also focuses on the plant’s response to water (Steduto et al. 2009). In fact,
    simulating crop growth with limited and unlimited irrigation is one of the main
    applications of this model (Mousavizadeh et al. 2016). So far, extensive research
    has been conducted in relation to AquaCrop model for different crops in different
    countries. AquaCrop has been applied in different parts of the world to determine
    the crop response to water stress (Azam-Ali et al. 2001; Steduto et al. 2009;
    Singels et al. 2010; Sandhu and Irmak 2019), develop low irrigation scheduling
    (Geerts et al. 2010; Andarzian et al. 2011; Ahmadi et al. 2015), improve on-farm
    irrigation management (García-Vila et al. 2009; Heng et al. 2009; García-Vila
    and Fereres 2012), assess increasing crop production potential and farm management
    (Zinyengere et al. 2011; Abraha et al. 2012; Mhizha et al. 2014), assess the impact
    of climate change on crop production (Raes et al. 2009), and develop decision
    support tools to carry out farm operations (Cusicanqui et al. 2013). So far, limited
    research has been done on canola using the AquaCrop model. There is still a lack
    of valuable information about the model performance in canola plant simulation
    under different irrigation managements in arid and semi-arid regions (Mousavizadeh
    et al. 2016). The studies conducted by Zeleke et al. (2011), Arvaneh and Abbasi
    (2014) and Mousavizadeh et al. (2016) are among the limited studies performed
    on this canola using this model. Arvaneh and Abbasi (2014) used field data collected
    to calibrate AquaCrop. After calibration, the research simulated canola Y and
    soil water content (SWC) change using this model, showing that the obtained results
    were in acceptable agreement with the field results. Zeleke et al. (2011), after
    evaluating AquaCrop in Australia, reported that the model shows overestimated
    SWC values at the depths of 0 to 100 cm in most of the time during the growing
    season. But it can well simulate the SWC variation trend at these depths. They
    also reported satisfactory results from canopy cover (CC) simulation, B and Y
    of the crop. They stated that AquaCrop’s prediction in severe water stress conditions
    was less satisfactory (Zeleke et al. 2011), which has been mentioned as one of
    the shortcomings of the model in accurate simulation in severe water stress conditions
    (Mousavizadeh et al. 2016). Mousavizadeh et al. (2016) also calibrated and validated
    AquaCrop for canola and reported that this model has an acceptable ability to
    simulate Y and SWC values of canola. In general, AquaCrop is a useful and reliable
    tool for simulating CC and evapotranspiration (ET) on a daily scale and simulating
    high-precision B and Y of grains at the end of the crop growth period (Mousavizadeh
    et al. 2016). The above results show the need for proper AquaCrop calibration
    and validation for specific areas to improve the model performance in estimating
    the crop Y, water consumption, crop growth parameters and evaluating limited irrigation
    practices to develop effective management strategies (Sandhu and Irmak 2019).
    The purpose of this study is to calibrate and then evaluate the AquaCrop model
    in the simulation of SWC, ET, CC, B and Y spring canola (RGS003 variety) under
    different water stress conditions in the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran (Karkaj,
    Tabriz). Further evaluation of the AquaCrop model using measured field transpiration
    and evaporation data to determine the accuracy of plant ET partitioning by the
    model is necessary to better simulate soil water and ET, which is very important
    for estimating irrigation requirement during crop growth period, B and Y (Sandhu
    and Irmak 2019). It should be noted that in the present study, drainage lysimeter
    and microlysimeter were used in the field to accurately measure transpiration
    and evaporation. Methods and materials Study area and soil description Field experiment
    in 0.5 m wide furrows in 5 m long plots, including 8 rows of spring canola (Brassica
    Napus L.) with a density of 80 plants per square meter in a land area of 400 square
    meters in the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Tabriz (Iran), located
    in the Karkaj region, was implemented during 2012 and 2013. The longitude and
    latitude of the region and its height above sea level are 46° 37′ E, 37° 03′ N
    and 1567.3 m, respectively. In both experimental years, canola was planted in
    early May and harvested in early August. Canola seeds were placed at a depth of
    one centimeter from the soil surface. To facilitate germination, the seeds were
    covered with aerated sand (Majnooni-heris et al. 2014). Soil samples were taken
    from different depths of the field soil to determine the physical properties of
    the soil using sampling cylinders and auger. The field capacity (FC) limit and
    permanent wilting point were measured using a pressure plate device. Other soil
    physical parameters are presented in Table 1. Table 1 Physical properties of the
    experimental soil Full size table Experimental design and treatments In both cropping
    years, field experiments including four irrigation treatments I1, I2, I3 and I4
    are, respectively, equal to full irrigation (without water stress), 20, 35 and
    50% less than the canola water requirement in four replications in a complete
    random block design. Figure 1 shows images of different stages of canola growth
    in a study field. Irrigation restrictions were applied after the plant was fully
    established in the field. In both years, the first four irrigations were considered
    the same for all treatments. Fig. 1 View of the research farm; preparation A vegetative
    B flowering C and maturation D stages Full size image Field-based drainage lysimeter
    was used to measure the plant ET. Furthermore, the rate of evaporation from the
    soil surface was calculated using a microlysimeter installed between the plant
    cultivation rows. For the required climatic information, the daily data of the
    meteorological station of the Faculty of Agriculture of Tabriz University were
    used. The reference ET was also calculated based on the FAO Penman–Monteith method
    using the ETo Calculator program (Allen et al. 1998). The irrigation schedule
    of the design for different irrigation treatments in both years is according to
    Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Irrigation depth values I in the days after planting (DAP) in the
    first and second crop year Full size image Irrigation method and determining irrigation
    depth The irrigation method used in this study was closed-end furrow irrigation
    in which water was supplied to the roots using furrows created in the field. The
    first sufficient irrigation in both years was done after planting with the aim
    of wetting the farm soil with water. In order to fully establish the plant, water
    restriction was started from the fifth irrigation. Irrigation water values increased
    by increasing the leaf area index (LAI) of canola. The last irrigation in the
    first (2012) and second (2013) experimental years was 95 and 94 days after planting,
    respectively (Fig. 2). The PR2 device was used to measure SWC at different depths.
    This device is used in two models PR2/4 (with 4 sensors) and PR2/6 (with 6 sensors)
    to measure the water content in the vertical section of the soil (Khorsand et
    al. 2019). In this study, the PR2/6 device was used, which was calibrated with
    weight-water content data. The pipes of this device were placed in the middle
    of different plots. Before each irrigation, SWC was read using PR2 at the depths
    of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 100 cm. In each irrigation, the amount of soil water
    shortage and subsequently the water required for the treatments that received
    full irrigation water was determined by the following equation: $$d = \\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {\\left( {\\theta_{fi} - \\theta_{i} } \\right)} \\Delta z$$ (1) where
    n is the number of layers to the depth of root development, i denotes the number
    of each layer, d represents the depth of irrigation water (cm), \\(\\theta_{fi}\\)
    and \\(\\theta_{i}\\), respectively, represents the FC and the available water
    in the soil before irrigation (cm3 cm−3) in layer i and \\(\\Delta z\\) denotes
    the thickness of the layer (cm). The required volume of water for each treatment
    was delivered using a counter meter during irrigation. The irrigation period of
    canola in the present study was seven days. AquaCrop description The AquaCrop
    model is one of the crop models developed by FAO with a focus on water use productivity.
    It is also used as an analytical tool to study the effect of different agricultural
    management scenarios (Steduto et al. 2009). AquaCrop, while simulating the daily
    water balance which is the basis of B and WP simulations, separates ET into evaporation
    from the soil surface (E) and transpiration from the plant surface (Tr). This
    feature distinguishes AquaCrop from other crop growth models (Abedinpour et al.
    2012). In AquaCrop, water is recognized as a determinant of crop productivity.
    Therefore, the daily Tr of the plant and the normalized productivity factor is
    converted to B (Raes et al. 2009). This model is able to simulate the Y obtained
    from plant products under different managements and environmental conditions using
    several plant parameters and a small number of input variables (Vanuytrecht et
    al. 2014b). Harvestable Y is a function of B and the harvest index, thereby differentiating
    the effect of environmental stresses on B and the harvest index (Ahmadi et al.
    2015). In AquaCrop, an accurate CC estimation plays an important role in the modeling
    process and, ultimately, the accuracy of the model performance. In this model,
    the CC development is expressed by the CC growth curve (Steduto et al. 2009).
    To measure the leaf area of canola, a mobile leaf area measuring device was used
    several times during the growing season. The AquaCrop model does not use LAI directly
    but uses CC. Therefore, the following experimental equation was used to convert
    LAI to CC in AquaCrop (Garcia-Villa et al., 2009): $$CC = \\frac{{\\left( {1 -

    Calibration, validation and assessment of AquaCrop Calibration is the estimation
    of model parameters in a way that the difference between the measured values and
    its computational values estimated by the model is minimized (Singh 2004). In
    this study, calibration was done manually and by applying \\(\\pm\\) 10% of the
    default value in the AquaCrop model for each of the parameters, calibration was
    done. The model evaluation is to prove the efficiency of the model for future
    use. The purpose of calibration is to adjust the parameters and inputs of the
    model with least uncertainty (Khorsand et al. 2014a). The efficiency of a model
    is evaluated through calibration and evaluation of the model for the set goals
    (Osmani et al. 2013). In the present study, the model parameters were calibrated
    using 2012 data and validated using 2013 data. First, the calibrated parameters
    were adjusted for SWC and Y of canola seed and then for ET, CC and B (Mousavizadeh
    et al. 2016). The calibration process was performed focusing on the treatment
    I1 and then the treatments I2, I3 and I4 until the best compatible parameters
    were achieved. Then, the calibrated model was used for validation without changing
    the calibrated parameters (Ahmadi et al. 2015). Table 2 presents the calibrated
    parameters of the AquaCrop model in two groups of conservative and non-conservative
    parameters for spring canola. Table 2 List of parameters of AquaCrop model for
    spring canola in the in the Karkag of Tabriz Full size table Conservative parameters
    depend on the type of plant and factors such as time and place. The amount of
    these parameters is affected by management conditions (Raes et al. 2009). In other
    words, these parameters are essentially the same sensitive parameters in the model
    that need to be calibrated (Mousavizadeh et al. 2016). But in different environmental
    and managerial conditions, the sensitivity of each of these parameters and the
    effect of the changes of each on the output of the model vary. Given that no measurement
    alone can show how a model has performed the simulation effectively, a combination
    of statistical indicators is used to evaluate the model (Gauch et al. 2003; Iqbal
    et al. 2014). To evaluate and measure the validity of AquaCrop, the indicators
    of normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), relative error (RE), index of agreement
    (d), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were
    used. $$NRMES = \\frac{1}{{\\overline{O} }} \\times \\sqrt {\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {(S_{i} - O_{i} )^{2} } } \\times 100$$ (3) $$RE = \\sum\\limits_{i =
    1}^{n} {\\left( {\\frac{{O_{i} - S_{i} }}{{O_{i} }}} \\right)} \\times 100$$ (4)
    $$d = 1 - \\frac{{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {(S_{i} - O_{i} )^{2} } }}{{\\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {(\\left| {S_{i} - \\overline{O} } \\right| + \\left| {O_{i} - \\overline{O}
    } \\right|)^{2} } }}$$ (5) $$RMSE = \\sqrt {\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n}
    {(S_{i} - O_{i} )^{2} } }$$ (6) $$R^{2} = \\left[ {\\frac{{\\sum\\limits_{i =
    1}^{n} {(O_{i} - \\overline{O} )(S_{i} - \\overline{S} )} }}{{\\sqrt {\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {(O{}_{i} - \\overline{O} )^{2} (S_{i} - \\overline{S} )^{2} } } }}}
    \\right]^{2}$$ (7) In these equations, n is the number of measurements, Oi and
    Si measured and predicted values, and \\(\\overline{O}\\) and \\(\\overline{S}\\)
    mean measured and predicted values. The NRMSE index measures the relative difference
    between observational and simulated data and shows the percentage of the simulation
    error. The excellent NRMSE value for modeling is less than 10%. NRMSE lying in
    the ranges of 10 to 20% and 20 to 30%, respectively, indicates the good and moderate
    condition of the model in forecasts while in the ranges more than 30% it indicates
    uncertainty of the model (Raes et al. 2012). A positive value of RE indicates
    an underestimation of the model, and a negative value indicates an overestimation
    of the model (Singh et al. 2008). The d index is widely used to evaluate the performance
    of models. This indicator shows the degree of agreement between the observed and
    measured data. This index is non-dimensional, and its variation range is between
    zero and one. The closer the value of this index is to one, the higher the compliance
    rate with the value of one indicating the best fitness (Willmott 1982). The RMSE
    index indicates the absolute uncertainty of the model. If this index is lower
    and closer to zero, it shows the better estimation of the model. R2 is the measure
    of dispersion between the predicted and measured values and varies between zero
    and one (Moriasi et al. 2007). Results and discussion Soil water content (SWC)
    The simulated and measured SWC values can be only observed for the I1 treatment
    during the dynamic calibration and validation steps in Figs. 3 and 4. The values
    of statistical indices for water treatments in the calibration and evaluation
    steps of the model are presented in Table 3 and 4, respectively. According to
    these tables, the NRMSE index was calculated for SWC for both years (calibration
    and validation), which was in the range of 10 to 20%. The SWC simulated and measured
    in the root development area (depths of 0–10, 10–20, 20–30 and 30–40 cm) for four
    water treatments showed that the AquaCrop model has an acceptable capability (appropriate
    accuracy) in the prediction of SWC. Fig. 3 The observed and simulated volumetric
    SWC profiles in I1 treatment (full irrigation) for year 2012 (calibration) Full
    size image Fig. 4 The observed and simulated volumetric SWC profiles in I1 treatment

    results for SWC, ET, CC, B and GY for year 2012 (calibration procedure) Full size
    table Table 4 The statistical results for SWC, ET, CC, B and GY for year 2013
    (validation procedure) Full size table Zeleke et al. (2011) confirmed that AquaCrop
    reliably simulates the amount and trend of SWC for canola, but tends to overestimate
    during the harvest season. Arvaneh and Abbasi (2014) also examined changes in
    the water content. The results were such that the measured values of SWC varied
    from 32 to 39% during the growing season of canola. AquaCrop simulated changes
    in SWC from 32 to 37%, which was in good agreement with the measured values. The
    small difference between the measurement and simulation values at the beginning
    of the crop season may have been due to an error in measuring the initial SWC
    studied. Other studies have reported the desirable performance of the AquaCrop
    model in SWC simulations for a variety of crops, including wheat (Andarzian et
    al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2013; Khorsand et al. 2014b), maize (Hsiao et al. 2009;
    Ahmadi et al. 2015), cotton (Farahani et al. 2009; Hussein et al. 2011), and teff
    (Araya et al. 2010b). In a study by Andarzian et al. (2011) for wheat, SWC was
    estimated with excellent accuracy (NRMSE less than 10%). The results obtained
    by Khorsand et al. (2014b) showed that AquaCrop predicts SWC with relatively good
    accuracy. They also calculated NRMSE statistics for wheat varieties in the range
    of 10 to 20%. According to Hussein et al. (2011), the model prediction of SWC
    in soil profiles was close to the general trend of measurements. According to
    Table 3, the NRMSE value increased from treatment I1 to I4. Therefore, the model
    performed better in the SWC simulation in stress-free treatment (I1) than in other
    treatments. NRMSEmax also occurred in the treatment I4 (severe water stress) whose
    values in the calibration and validation stages were 18.13 and 16.72%, respectively.
    AquaCrop does the simulation well when water is available to plants. But by increasing
    the water stress, the model results become less satisfactory (Mousavizadeh et
    al. 2016). In this study, the RE values in the calibration and evaluation steps
    of the model were negative for the treatments I1 and I2 and positive for the treatments
    I3 and I4. This index showed that the model tends to overestimate SWC in the treatments
    I1 and I2 and tends to underestimate in the treatments I3 and I4. Farahani et
    al. (2009) reported for cotton that AquaCrop simulates the total water content
    of the soil profile in an acceptable way. However, there is a constant tendency
    to overestimate the total SWC, especially in deficit irrigation treatment. They
    also said that this model tends to overestimate in the surface layer of soil and
    tends to underestimate in deeper layers. Araya et al. (2010b) for teff confirmed
    an estimate of less than the SWC of the simulated using AquaCrop under high stress
    conditions. In general, however, there was a perfect compliance between the simulation
    and measurement datasets. According to the results (Table 3 and 4), the dispersion
    of measurement and prediction values relative to each other is relatively high,
    as shown by the R2 index. Overall, this model predicted SWC to be lower than the
    actual values, which is confirmed by the equation coefficient of fitness line
    below one in both the calibration and validation stages. In fact, the SWC underestimation
    of this study for canola is consistent with the results of other studies conducted
    for various crops, including maize (Biazin and Stroosnijder 2012; Mebane et al.
    2013) and wheat (Mkhabela and Bullock 2012; Khorsand et al. 2014b; Iqbal et al.
    2014). In contrast, other studies for canola (Zeleke et al. 2011), maize (Hsiao
    et al. 2009; Paredes et al., 2014; Ahmadi et al. 2015), and cotton (Farahani et
    al. 2009) have shown that the AquaCrop model predicts SWC more than the observable
    values. These discrepancies may have a variety of causes that can lead to underestimation
    or overestimation of SWC (Farahani et al. 2009; Zeleke et al. 2011; Khorsand et
    al. 2014b; Ahmadi et al. 2015) or accurate estimation of SWC (Araya et al. 2010b;
    Andarzian et al. 2011), which are explained below. One reason is that soil is
    heterogeneous throughout the field. Therefore, the model cannot consider soil
    variability in the SWC simulation. Another reason for the components of the soil–water
    balance of the model is that it starts drainage at SWC or above the FC and probably
    begins to penetrate deep into the water content below FC (Zeleke et al. 2011;
    Ahmadi et al. 2015). Khorsand et al. (2014b) attributed the possible reasons for
    the underestimation of the model to the type of equation governing the water balance
    in which some factors affecting the movement of water such as preferential currents
    and the phenomenon of hysteresis are not considered. According to Paredes et al.
    (2014), the variability of soil structure, the presence of large pores and soil
    crusts can increase the drainage through the preferential flow. Depending on the
    formation, soil crusts can be biological (microorganisms) or physical (raindrops).
    Moreover, Paredes et al. (2014) attributed another important reason to the choice
    of unregulated plant coefficient (Kc). Finally, they said that AquaCrop could
    not be used for irrigation scheduling purposes. Selecting an accurate Kc can have
    a significant effect on the accurate modeling of SWC, E and Tr (Ahmadi et al.
    2015). According to Figs. 3 and 4, the simulated SWC values at a depth of 30–40
    cm were predicted with less accuracy (almost linearly) by the model. One of the
    reasons for this is the reduction of water absorption by the roots at this depth.
    It should also be noted that this factor can be considered as AquaCrop’s weakness
    in estimating SWC at lower depths. Accurate information about the root distribution,
    main root length and longitudinal root density in the model leads to accurate
    SWC prediction because it also directly affects Tr simulation (Ahmadi et al. 2015).
    Overall, the results of the AquaCrop model in the SWC simulation for both years
    of 2012 and 2013 were satisfactory. The calibrated parameters in SWC were acceptable
    because statistical indicators were good in evaluating the results (Table 4).
    Evapotranspiration (ET) As mentioned earlier, AquaCrop is capable of separating
    E and Tr. In this section, the cumulative ET, Tr and E results simulated by the
    model with the measured values for the control treatment (I1) in the days after
    planting (DAP) of canola (106 days for 2012 and 112 days for 2013) are shown in
    Fig. 5. Two points can be found according to Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Cumulative ET, Tr
    and E observed and simulated by model in I1 treatment for years of 2012 and 2013
    Full size image First, AquaCrop simulates Tr better and more accurately than E.
    Second, the cumulative ET simulated by the model was higher than the values measured
    at the beginning of the canola growth period. At the end of the crop growth period,
    however, the simulated and measured ET values came so close to each other that
    this result is seen to be consistent with the results obtained by Mousavizadeh
    et al. (2016) for canola. The values of NRMSE, RE, d and R2 statistics for ET
    in the calibration and validation steps for I1 treatment are reported in Table
    3 and 4. According to Table 3 and 4, NRMSE was obtained in the stages of calibration
    and evaluation of ET at 28.59% and 27.43%, respectively, which showed that the
    model has a moderate status in the ET simulation and estimation. Furthermore,
    the negative and positive values of the RE index were obtained, respectively,
    in the calibration and evaluation steps of Canola ET, which showed that AquaCrop
    is overestimated in the calibration step and underestimated in the validation
    stage. The ET value of canola in 2012 and 2013 was 489.0 and 500.98 mm, respectively,
    which were estimated at 504.20 and 475.30 mm by the model, respectively. Canola
    is less resistant than other cereal crops (including wheat and barley) to water
    shortages. The amount of water consumed by the canola crop from planting to harvest
    can vary from 160 to 180 mm (in low rainfall) and 400 to 500 mm in optimal conditions
    (Zeleke et al. 2011). In a study conducted by Zeleke et al. (2011), the canola
    potential ET during growth period was 356.0 mm; while the actual ET was 330.0
    mm. In AquaCrop, the actual ET was divided into 82.0 mm E and 248.0 mm Tr. Under
    real conditions, salinity, temperature, water, fertility, pest and wetland stresses
    may reduce ET relative to potential conditions. The actual Tr of canola was 100%
    of the potential Tr during the season, indicating that the difference between
    the actual ET and the potential ET resulted from the differences in E. This result
    means that the plant’s water requirement has been met and the plant has not been
    under stress (Zeleke et al. 2011). In the study conducted by Arvaneh and Abbasi
    (2014) at the beginning of the growing season of canola, due to the empty soil
    surface of CC, the value of E was higher than Tr, and in the middle and end of
    the growing season, the value of Tr was higher than the value of E. Their research,
    which was conducted in a four-hectare and a one-hectare field, found that the
    ET value of canola by AquaCrop during the growing season was 308.8 and 259.4 mm,
    respectively, for the fields. These values were less than the total water consumed
    by canola during the growing season. Therefore, the results showed that the model
    has underestimation (Arvaneh and Abbasi 2014). Mousavizadeh et al. (2016) simulated
    ET of canola by AquaCrop slightly higher than the measured values, but the results
    were satisfactory. The results of the present study in the calibration step of
    ET of canola in terms of RE index were consistent with the results obtained by
    Mousavizadeh et al. (2016). The results of various studies reviewed for ET simulation
    by AquaCrop are as follows: The results obtained by Heng et al. (2009) showed
    that AquaCrop is able to simulate the plant ET with moderate accuracy in semi-arid
    regions. But in hot and dry areas, the model has poor performance. Katerji et
    al. (2013) concluded that the ET model simulates the plant less than the measured
    values. When deficit irrigation is high, the underestimation of ET by the model
    is high. In general, according to them, the quality of ET simulation by AquaCrop
    is poor. But Garcia-Vila et al. (2009) found a better correlation between the
    measured and simulated ET values for treatments with low ET values. Paredes et
    al. (2014) in their study stated that AquaCrop is more accurate in predicting
    the seasonal plant ET without overestimation and underestimation. They also cited
    the SWC overestimation trend (discussed in the previous section) as the result
    of an incorrect division of Tr (model tendency to overestimation) and E (model
    tendency to underestimation) by AquaCrop. Sandhu and Irmak (2019) observed in
    the model evaluation step the underestimation trend of plant ET by AquaCrop (except
    rainfed treatments), which was consistent with the results of the present study
    in the model evaluation step. Sandhu and Irmak (2019) also attributed the inaccuracy
    in the ET simulation to the SWC simulation, which in many cases was not simulated
    with sufficient accuracy by the model. Calibration coefficients such as KcTr (plant
    transpiration coefficient) and Ke (soil surface evaporation coefficient) are effective
    in accurate ET simulation (Mousavizadeh et al. 2016). According to Pereira et
    al. (2015), calibrated parameters such as KcTr,x (crop transpiration) and CCx
    parameters (CC coefficient of maximum plant density under optimal conditions)
    are changed internally by AquaCrop. This fact indicates a problem with the use
    of AquaCrop because the user has no control over the parameter and calibration
    processes (Mousavizadeh et al. 2016). Canopy cover (CC) CC is a very important
    parameter mainly because it shows how the crops grow and develop during their
    growth period as well as the periods when the plants are subjected to stress (Mousavizadeh
    et al. 2016). CC simulation and forecasting by AquaCrop were performed at 24,
    44, 56, 63, 71, 77 and 85 days for calibration and at 38, 42, 50, 57, 64, 75 and
    83 days for evaluation in four water treatments. Figures 6 and 7 present comparison
    of the CC measurements and simulations. Meantime, the values of statistical indicators
    for CC in the calibration and evaluation steps are reported in Table 3 and 4.
    Fig. 6 The observed and simulated CC in total treatments for year 2012 (calibration)
    Full size image Fig. 7 The observed and simulated CC in total treatments for year
    2013 (validation) Full size image According to Table 3 and 4, the range of NRMSE
    in the calibration and evaluation steps of CC was obtained between 6 and 12 (%)
    and 8 to 12 (%), respectively. RE statistical values for CC in the calibration
    and evaluation process were negative for all four water treatments. Therefore,
    the negative values of this statistic showed that the model is overestimated in
    simulating and predicting the CC parameter of canola. The reasons for the underestimation
    and overestimation of the AquaCrop model are fully discussed in the sections B
    and GY. According to Figs. 6 and 7, it can be found that the AquaCrop model at
    the beginning and end of the canola growth period could not accurately adapt to
    the measured CC parameter. The results obtained by Zeleke et al. (2011) in the
    validation phase for canola showed that CC started with a slight non-compliance
    from planting to flowering (early growth period), which is consistent with the
    validation results of the present study. CC has a greater effect on B than on
    other simulated parameters. In AquaCrop, as the crop approaches maturity (end
    of the growing season), CC is in a declining phase due to the aging of the plant’s
    leaves. Therefore, CC is less satisfactory at the end of the plant growing season
    (Abedinpour et al. 2012; Mousavizadeh et al. 2016). In the study conducted by
    Xiangxiang et al. (2013), CC simulations for full irrigation (without stress)
    were well adapted to the field data at all winter wheat growth stages. The results
    of studies on cotton and canola plants also showed that the model in CC simulation
    under water stress is less satisfactory (Farahani et al. 2009; Zeleke et al. 2011;
    Mousavizadeh et al. 2016), which is consistent with the results of the present
    study. The results of research conducted to simulate CC in different plants in
    terms of statistical indicators are as follows. Zeleke et al. (2011) obtained
    RMSE values for Hyola50 (calibration) and Skipton (evaluation) varieties of canola
    at 8.4 and 9.8%, respectively. Mabhaudhi et al. (2014) calculated the values of
    RMSE, d and R2 indices for the Taro plant at 2.38%, 0.92 and 0.79, respectively.
    Kim and Kaluarachchi (2015) used the AquaCrop model for the simulation and the
    remote sensing (RS) to predict CC under normal conditions for three plants. They
    obtained the efficiency coefficients for maize, barley and alfalfa in the calibration
    step (AquaCrop) at 0.94, 0.85 and 0.99, respectively, and in the evaluation step
    (RS) at 0.88, 0.92 and 0.80, respectively. Sandhu and Irmak (2019) for maize also
    obtained a smaller NRMSE error value in 2009 and 2010 equal to 15.6% (excluding
    minor differences in 2010) for the daily CC simulation. As CC is affected by both
    water stress and severe temperature stress, AquaCrop should be well calibrated
    for all stresses that may affect the simulation results (Andarzian et al. 2011;
    Mousavizadeh et al. 2016). Biomass (B) The B and GY performance are the main economic
    members of crops and that is why plant development models are targeted for acceptable
    simulations (Ahmadi et al. 2015). By simulating the water conditions that affect
    crop growth, the B results can be further discussed (Mousavizadeh et al. 2016).
    In the present study, the simulation and dynamic prediction of B by the AquaCrop
    model at 24, 43, 47, 50, 52, 56, 63, 71, 77, 85, 92 and 100 days after irrigation
    for calibration and at 38, 42, 50, 57, 64, 71, 79 and 100 days after irrigation
    were validated in four water treatments. The values of calibration and validation
    statistical indices for B are presented in Table 3 and 4. Moreover, the dynamic
    results B for all four irrigation treatments on different days after canola planting
    are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Fig. 8 The observed and simulated B in total treatments
    for year 2012 (calibration) Full size image Fig. 9 The observed and simulated
    B in total treatments for year 2013 (validation) Full size image According to
    Table 3 and 4, the RMSE range in the dynamic calibration B was obtained between
    0.6 and 1.2 (t ha−1). The value of this statistic for the treatments I2, I3 and
    I4 showed that the model has moderate accuracy. Meantime, the RMSE range in dynamic
    evaluation B was obtained between 0.2 and 1.7 (t ha−1). The value of this statistic
    for the two treatments I3 and I4 showed that the model has good accuracy, but
    for the two treatments I1 and I2 the RMSE value was calculated to be more than
    one (t ha−1). Moreover, RMSEMax for treatment I1 is obtained at 1.16 and 1.61
    (t ha−1) and RMSEMin for treatment I3 at 0.67 and 0.26 (t ha−1) by the model in
    the calibration and validation steps, respectively. Zeleke et al. (2011) tested
    the AquaCrop model for dynamic B study of two canola varieties (Hyola50 variety
    for calibration and Skipton variety for validation). Based on the results, the
    percentage of deviation from canola B in the calibration and evaluation steps
    was calculated to be 1.2 and − 9.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the RMSE of calibration
    and evaluation of 2.10 and 2.58 (t ha−1) was obtained, respectively. The RMSE
    values obtained by Zeleke et al.’s (2011) were doubled the mean RMSE values of
    the present study. They also obtained the index d during calibration and validation
    steps for B at 0.97 and 0.95, respectively. This is consistent with the results
    of the present study where the mean index d values of 0.97 and 0.96 were obtained
    during the calibration and validation steps, respectively. In the study conducted
    by Mousavizadeh et al. (2016) in Shiraz (Iran) on canola with five irrigation
    treatments, RMSE values of 0.92 and 0.84 (t ha−1) were obtained in the calibration
    and evaluation steps, respectively, which are also consistent with the results
    of this study. In the present study, the RE index showed that the model in the
    prediction B provides the simulation with values higher than those measured in
    the calibration phase. Moreover, this index tends to overestimate in the evaluation
    step (except for treatment I1) and tends from negative values of the calibration
    step to almost zero in the evaluation step (Table 3 and 4). In general, according
    to the values of statistical indicators (Table 3 and 4), the results provided
    by AquaCrop have been improved for the second year, which can be attributed to
    the high accuracy of the calibration method (applying ± 10% changes to the calibrated
    parameters) for the first year and also an increase in the accuracy of field measurements
    in the second year. Differences in tendency to overestimate and underestimate
    of B in AquaCrop model depend on various factors such as stresses (water, temperature,
    salinity and pests), irrigation system and management, environmental conditions
    (soil types, fertilizers, soil water characteristics and available water in soil),
    the quality of field measurement data and ultimately the accuracy of the calibration
    method (Heng et al. 2009; Abedinpour et al. 2012; Paredes et al., 2014; Ahmadi
    et al. 2015; Amiri et al. 2018). Mousavizadeh et al. (2016) in a study on canola
    at the validation level showed that AquaCrop could not accurately simulate B during
    the growth season. This model needs to be modified and improved for the accurate
    simulation of GY. The comments of this study are inconsistent with the results
    of the present study for canola because the results of the model were appropriate
    for the second year (validation) in this study. Ahmadi et al. (2015) concluded
    that AquaCrop in the calibration phase estimates B more than the measured values.
    Meanwhile, the model in the validation stage at the beginning and end of the crop
    growth season for deficit irrigation treatments has tendency to overestimate and
    underestimate, respectively. The results obtained by Ahmadi et al. (2015) for
    maize are consistent with the results of the present study by the AquaCrop model.
    In several studies, the B of different plants such as wheat, maize, barley and
    teff was examined by the AquaCrop model, which is discussed below. Andarzian et
    al. (2011) reported the statistical parameters NRMSE and index d at 4.4% and 0.97,
    respectively, to predict the B of wheat. Another study was conducted on the South
    China Plateau to investigate the performance of the AquaCrop model on wheat crop
    in rainfed conditions, and perennial field test data were used to calibrate and
    validate the model in B and GY simulations. According to the results, the RMSE
    statistical range of 0.16 to 0.38 (t ha−1) was considered for the B simulation
    and 0.5 to 1.44 (t ha−1) for GY. In general, the performance of the model for
    simulating Y was more accurate than for B, and the model was able to simulate
    the GY of wheat in rainfed conditions (Zhang et al. 2013). Iqbal et al. (2014)
    presented investigations on wheat in northern China for B and Y for the years
    1999–2000 and 2000–2001 to show that there is a relatively good consistency between
    the measured and simulated values. They also stated that major deviations were
    observed under severe stress conditions. Their overall results showed that AquaCrop
    is a valid model and can be used to optimize Y and B with a confident accuracy
    and precision of the model (Iqbal et al. 2014). Abedinpour et al. (2012) examined
    maize with different treatments of full and deficit irrigation by the model. According
    to the results, the harvesting estimation error was between 1.7 and 3.6%. Araya
    et al. (2010a, 2010b) reported the error range of ‒ 0.13 to 15.1% and ‒ 2.8 to
    8.5% for B of barley and teff by AquaCrop, respectively. In a study by Mabhaudhi
    et al. (2014) on the Taro plant in South Africa concluded that the model simulations
    for crop B and Y are very satisfactory. Despite the obvious challenges of the
    model in CC simulation in rainfed conditions, the model was able to successfully
    simulate the final B and Y. According to researchers, the AquaCrop model is not
    accurate enough in simulating the aging stage of the plant and has caused premature
    aging under water stress (Zeleke et al. 2011; Ahmadi et al. 2015). Because of
    the weakness of the model, Ahmadi et al. (2015) suggested that the future versions
    of AquaCrop require modifications and revisions in the crop growth development
    equations. Zeleke et al. (2011) also emphasized the importance of accurate modification
    of crop growth parameters to increase the efficiency of the crop model. It should
    be noted that in the present study, this model was sufficiently accurate in deficit
    irrigation treatments, especially in the B evaluation step. Final grain yield
    (GY) Figure 10 presents a comparison of the calculated and predicted GY values
    provided by the model during the calibration and validation steps. The quantitative
    values of model evaluation and validity measurement parameters in the GY prediction
    of canola are also reported in Table 3 and 4. Based on the results, the model
    simulated the crop GY with appropriate accuracy. Fig. 10 Graphical test of the
    simulated versus observed GY of canola Full size image The NRMSE values for both
    years were less than 10%, showing that the GY modeling is ideal according to this
    statistic. The values of this statistic for GY in the calibration and evaluation
    steps were 5.90 and 7.05%, respectively. In the research conducted by Mousavizadeh
    et al. (2016), the NRMSE values for the GY of canola in calibration and validation
    steps were 13.12 and 10.01%, respectively, which has a good status (NRMSE between
    10 to 20%) in the simulation. However, this study showed a lower step in terms
    of NRMSE statistical accuracy than the results presented in this study. Meantime,
    according to the values of R2 and Fig. 10, it is observed that the observed and
    simulated values for both years have a good correlation. The d index is close
    to one, which indicates the consistency of the Y reduction trend with the irrigation
    water amount in the model with the real Y. According to the results, REmax and
    REmin values are associated with the I1 and I4 treatments in the calibration step
    and the I4 and I3 treatments in the validation stage, respectively. A positive
    RE indicates that the model estimates GY less than the actual value and a negative
    RE value indicates that the model overestimated the parameters. The positive and
    negative mean values of RE statistics were obtained in the two stages of calibration
    and evaluation, which showed that the model has a slight tendency to underestimate
    and overestimate in these stages. Therefore, it can be concluded that the model
    in the GY prediction provides the simulation less than the values measured in
    the calibration step and predicts more than the values measured in the evaluation
    step. Therefore, this issue can be attributed to other parameters affecting the
    plant that do not exist in the model, such as the combined effect of fertilizer
    and water stress. Furthermore, the accuracy of measurements per year can also
    be effective (Amiri et al. 2018). In general, the model showed underestimation
    in the calibration step of canola GY and overestimation in the evaluation step
    because the mean values of RE index in these stages were 1.25 and − 0.43, respectively.
    The results of research conducted on canola and wheat showed that AquaCrop simulates
    the GY of the crops for deficit and over-irrigation treatments as overestimate
    and underestimate, respectively (Zeleke et al. 2011; Xiangxiang et al. 2013).
    Ahmadi et al. (2015) also reported that the model structure can be modified to
    improve B and GY simulations at different stages of severe water stress. There
    are numerous studies showing that the AquaCrop model has an acceptable performance
    in simulating the final GY of canola (Zeleke et al. 2011; Arvaneh and Abbasi 2014;
    Mousavizadeh et al. 2016; Amiri et al. 2018), wheat (Andarzian et al. 2011; Mkhabela
    and Bullock 2012; Zhang et al. 2013; Khorsand et al. 2014b; Iqbal et al. 2014),
    maize (Heng et al. 2009; Abedinpour et al. 2012; Ahmadi et al. 2015) and cotton
    (Garcia-Vila et al., 2009; Farahani et al. 2009; Hussein et al. 2011). Zeleke
    et al. (2011) examined the AquaCrop model for the evaluation of the canola GY
    in the semi-arid region of Australia under environmental stress. According to
    the obtained results, the percentage of deviation from the GY of the crop in the
    calibration and validation steps was 4.7 and − 2.1%, respectively. They concluded
    that the model is able to satisfactorily simulate GY. It was also less satisfactory
    in GY simulations under conditions of severe water stress (especially when stress
    occurred in the post-flowering stage). Arvaneh and Abbasi (2014) conducted a study
    on canola (Hyola401) in two farms: A (four hectares) and B (one hectare) in Iran.
    They showed that the model simulations were very satisfactory for GY. The GY value
    measured in field A was 1.90 (t ha−1) and the model presented the GY value of
    1.84 (t ha−1) through simulation (calibration step). Also, in field B, the measured
    GY value was 1.65 (t ha−1) and AquaCrop estimated the GY value at 1.51 (t ha−1)
    (evaluation step). The main reason for low GY of canola in farm B compared to
    farm A was the 20-day delay in the date of planting canola (Arvaneh and Abbasi
    2014). The measured GY value in this study for non-stress treatment (I1) was 1.84
    (t ha−1), which is very close to the GY value (field A) measured by Arvaneh and
    Abbasi (2014). Hsiao et al. (2009) calibrated and evaluated the AquaCrop model
    for maize. According to the results of the validation step, the error range of
    the prediction for maize GY was 1% to 24%. In the studies conducted by Heng et
    al. (2009) for calibration and validation of AquaCrop for maize in three regions
    with completely different conditions, it was found that the model satisfactorily
    simulates the growth of B and GY under conditions of without water stress and
    with moderate water stress. However, the model for the treatments of severe water
    stress, especially when water stress occurs during the critical stage of crop
    growth, cannot simulate these parameters satisfactorily. Araya et al. (2010a,
    2010b) obtained the GY error range of barley and teff at − 5.6 to 14.6% and − 22.5
    to 8.5%, respectively. Khorsand et al. (2014b) examined the GY of wheat subjected
    to salinity and water stresses by this model. According to the obtained results,
    the NRMSE value of GY prediction for Roshan and Quds varieties in the calibration
    step was 3.84 and 6.65%, respectively, and in the evaluation step, 4.65 and 4.55%
    respectively. Apart from that, the results of a study conducted by Mkhabela and
    Bullock (2012) on wheat in Western Canada showed that the model simulations for
    GY were very satisfactory. In other studies including Amiri et al. (2018), Andarzian
    et al. (2011) and Heng et al. (2009), the model predicted the GY of wheat subjected
    to water stress, the GY of wheat subjected to full irrigation and deficit irrigation,
    and GY of maize subjected to full irrigation and deficit irrigation with a relative
    error of less than 10%, which is consistent with the results of the present study.
    AquaCrop is in general a water-based model, and the performance of GY and B simulation
    depends on accurate simulation of soil water dynamics (Ahmadi et al. 2015). According
    to Ahmadi et al. (2015), it is better to consider some calibration information
    about the root growth distribution pattern in soil in future versions of AquaCrop.
    The root information and data of each plant variety help to accurately simulate
    the Tr and GY rates of the plant (Vanuytrecht et al. 2014a; Ahmadi et al. 2015).
    Conclusions In this study, the calibration and evaluation of the AquaCrop model
    during two cropping years (2012 and 2013) were tested in the climate conditions
    of Iran (semi-arid region) subjected to full irrigation and deficit irrigation
    conditions on the canola growth. The simulated and measured soil water content
    in canola root development area for irrigation treatments showed that the model
    has an acceptable capability. According to the results, AquaCrop shows overestimation
    in the evapotranspiration calibration phase and underestimation in the evapotranspiration
    validation phase. More attention should be paid to evapotranspiration; because
    it has a great impact on the canopy cover, biomass and final yield. The results
    also showed that the model provides overestimation in the simulation and prediction
    of canola canopy cover and is less satisfactory subjected to water stresses. Evaluation
    of AquaCrop model showed that this model is able to simulate biomass and grain
    yield with high accuracy. The value of normalized simulation and prediction error
    for grain yield by the model was less than 10%. AquaCrop can be used with reliable
    accuracy under mild water stress to determine the lowest sensitivity stages and
    stress thresholds of crop growth period, which is a useful and efficient tool
    for designing and evaluating low irrigation strategies. Overall, despite simplicity,
    the AquaCrop model was a good tool for studying irrigation management, biomass
    and crop yield, canopy cover, soil water content and other factors affecting canola
    growth in the fields and climate under study. It is suggested to examine the efficiency
    of the model in future studies for other crops (including canola), different soils
    and under other climate conditions. Data availability The datasets generated during

  description: Crop models are effective tools for guiding irrigation, predicting
    crop yield and enhancing water productivity. However diverse agricultural regions
    pose challenges in simulation accuracy due to variability in irrigation, agronomic
    practices, and crop types. Data assimilation offers an effective approach to reduce
    these uncertainties. In this study, we explored the performance of four data assimilation
    methods when integrated with the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model for
    simulating scenarios involving varying film mulching, irrigation levels and maize
    varieties. The data assimilation methods included global search (GS), Ensemble
    Kalman Filter (EnKF) for leaf area index (LAI) (EnKF-L), EnKF for soil water content
    (SWC) (EnKF-S), as well as EnKF for both LAI and SWC (EnKF-LS). To establish a
    baseline reference, we utilized the SWAP simulation without data assimilation
    method (OP) and compared its performance with the four data assimilation methods.
    To assess their performance, field experiments were conducted in the Shiyang River
    Basin of Northwest China during 2021 and 2022, with two varieties of spring maize
    subjected to two drip irrigation levels and two film mulching conditions. The
    treatment with full irrigation and no mulching in 2022 was employed to calibrate
    the SWAP model, while the other treatments were used for validation. The results
    showed that OP method failed to accurately capture the effects of film mulching
    and deficit irrigation on soil water and heat transport, crop growth, and meteorological
    parameters. The performance of the GS method was unstable, with a large range
    of root mean square error (RMSE) for maize growth and soil water content and temperature
    simulation. In contrast, the EnKF method significantly improved simulation accuracy,
    particularly when both LAI and SWC observations were assimilated simultaneously.
    The EnKF-LS methods reduced the root mean square error of the simulations by 0.04
    to 1.57 m2/m−2(−|-) for LAI, 0.24 to 4.74 t hm−2 for aboveground dry biomass,
    0 to 0.071 m3/m−3(−|-) for SWC, 0 to 2.74 °C for soil temperature, 2.20 to 6.91
    t hm−2 for yield and 36.84 to 98.16 mm for evapotranspiration, both in comparison
    with the GS and OP methods. In terms of computational cost, the runtime of the
    three EnKF methods depends on the number of observations, whereas, over the entire
    simulation period of the SWAP model, the time required for EnKF methods was significantly
    less than that for the GS method. We recommend combining EnKF-LS with the SWAP
    model to enhance the awareness of crop and soil conditions for agricultural decision
    support.

    environments without data assimilation. • The simulation performance relied on

    1. Introduction Maize is one of the major food crops and its production is important
    for food security (Chang et al., 2023, Messina et al., 2011). However, in arid
    and semi-arid regions, water scarcity poses a constraint on maize yield. (Chen
    et al., 2021). Consequently, the water-saving agricultural managements have been
    widely used and developed in these regions, including film mulching, deficit irrigation
    and selection of drought-resistant varieties (Zhao et al., 2021). These water-saving
    agricultural practices create distinct growing environments for maize cultivation.
    Therefore, real-time monitoring of soil and maize conditions under various environments
    is critical for precise irrigation to increase yield and water production. Crop
    models play a crucial role in understanding the complex interactions between crop
    varieties, environmental factors, and field management practices by utilizing
    intricate equations that depict processes of soil water transport and crop growth
    (Fattori Junior et al., 2022, Orlova and Linker, 2023). Crop models are valuable
    tools for decision making and planning in agricultural systems due to their numerous
    advantages (Fattori and Marin, 2023, Knowling et al., 2023, Morell et al., 2016).
    Notable crop models frequently mentioned in the literature include the AquaCrop
    model (Wu et al., 2022), the DSSAT model (Chen et al., 2023), the EPIC model (J.
    R. Williams et al., 1989), the WOFOST model (Diepen et al., 1989), and the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant
    (SWAP) model (Hu et al., 2019, Yu et al., 2020). The SWAP model, in particular,
    integrates the interconnected processes of soil water, heat, and salt transport
    with crop growth, considering various stress factors such as salinity, freeze–thaw,
    and water availability. It has been extensively applied and developed in research.
    Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the SWAP model in accurately
    simulating soil water dynamics, crop growth, and crop water consumption under
    diverse environmental conditions (Camargo and Kemanian, 2016, Jiang et al., 2016).
    However, the SWAP model presents challenges due to the high complexity of soil
    water-heat transport and crop growth processes. The model involves a large number
    of parameters related to soil and crop, making the parameter calibration process
    burdensome when applying the SWAP model to new agricultural ecosystems (Fattori
    and Marin, 2023, Kang and Özdoğan, 2019). Furthermore, the original design of
    the SWAP model did not consider the influence of film mulching on solar radiation
    absorption and utilization, soil–water-heat transport, and crop growth. Addressing
    film mulching effects often requires parameter adjustments or modification of
    the model structure, which demands extensive knowledge and programming skills
    from researchers and often requires significant time and effort investment (Liang
    et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2020). Data assimilation (DA) methods in collaboration
    with crop models can effectively address a series of challenges encountered in
    the simulation process of crop models (Hu et al., 2019, Knowling et al., 2023,
    Pauwels et al., 2007). Historically employed extensively in weather forecasting,
    DA methods have progressively become integrated with crop models within agricultural
    decision support systems in recent years (Knowling et al., 2023). It is worth
    noting that DA methods do not modify the model structure but only change the model''s
    trajectory. Commonly used data assimilation methods are: forcing, calibration,
    and updating methods (Orlova and Linker, 2023; Dorigo et al., 2007). Forcing method
    involves directly replacing the simulated variables with observational values.
    This method requires less computational effort but demands a higher number of
    observational variables (Chen and Cournède, 2014, Wagner et al., 2020). Calibration
    method refers to the optimization of model parameters by minimizing a cost function
    to obtain the optimal parameters combination. This method involves iterative computations,
    resulting in higher computational costs (Huang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022b;
    ). Updating methods, such as sequential data assimilation, perform parameter state
    updates whenever new observations are available within a specified time range.
    The commonly used updating method is the Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) algorithm
    (DeChant and Moradkhani, 2012, Ines et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2021). The calibration
    method in the data assimilation framework fully rely on the observational values
    without considering the uncertainties of both the observations and model simulations.
    On the other hand, updating methods consider the simulation errors arising from
    model structure and parameterization, as well as the errors introduced by observational
    instruments and representativeness of measurement samples. Updating methods consider
    the acceptable propagation of observation errors within the model simulation system
    (Ines et al., 2013). The selection of assimilation variables and optimal parameters
    for the crop model is crucial in data assimilation methods. Previous studies mainly
    focused on assimilating leaf area index (LAI) (Fattori Junior et al., 2022, Mokhtari
    et al., 2018), soil water content (SWC) (Hu et al., 2019, Pan et al., 2012), evapotranspiration
    (ET) (Deb et al., 2022), plant height (Yu et al., 2020), and solar radiation (Mokhtari
    et al., 2018). Dependency on simulated data sets limits the application of data
    assimilation methods to include other physiological and biochemical indicators
    not covered by crop models, such as leaf chlorophyll, chlorophyll fluorescence
    and canopy temperature. Additionally, data assimilation methods are constrained
    by the selection of parameters, as certain parameters have significant impacts
    on simulation results under specific soil or climate conditions. Prior to data
    assimilation, it is necessary to perform parameter sensitivity analysis on crop
    models. For example, Orlova and Linker (2023) incorporated sensitivity analysis
    into the sequential data assimilation process of AquaCrop, where parameter sensitivity
    analysis was conducted after each assimilation calculation to adjust the entire
    parameter set and improve the accuracy of simulations. We hypothesize that the
    accuracy of SWAP model under complex scenarios could be enhanced by choosing suitable
    data assimilation methods for simulating soil moisture, soil heat, and crop growth.
    Therefore, in this study, a two-year field experiment was conducted in a typical
    arid region of China to create diverse maize growth environments by manipulating
    three influencing factors: maize variety, film mulching, and irrigation level.
    The main objectives of the study were as follows: (1) to determine the sensitive
    parameters (LAI, aboveground dry biomass (ADB), SWC, and yield) of the SWAP model
    adapted to the experimental site and identify the parameters to be optimized or
    updated for the data assimilation method; (2) to investigate the accuracy of the
    SWAP model in simulating maize growth and soil hydrothermal transport under different
    irrigation levels, maize varieties, and film mulching conditions when the SWAP
    model is not integrated with the data assimilation method (OP method, open-loop);
    (3) to compare the improvement in simulation accuracy of LAI, ADB, SWC, soil temperature
    (ST), yield, and crop water consumption achieved by different data assimilation
    methods in the SWAP model; and (4) to assess the predictive capability of assimilated
    LAI and SWC for the SWAP model. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Field experiments
    The experiments were conducted at the National Field Scientific Observation and
    Research Station on Efficient Water Use of Oasis Agriculture in Wuwei of Gansu
    Province of China (37°52′20″N, 102°50′50″E, altitude 1581 m). The site has a continental
    temperate arid desert climate, with a mean annual precipitation of 164 mm and
    potential evaporation of 2400 mm. The precipitation at the site was 149.8 and
    186.2 mm during the spring maize growing seasons for 2021 and 2022, respectively
    (Huang et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2022a). Two film mulching treatments (non-mulched
    (M0) and full transparent plastic film mulching (M1)), two varieties (Denghai605
    (P1) and Zhengdan958 (P2)) and two irrigation levels were chosen to create various
    soil–plant water statuses for this study. Two irrigation levels were Wh and Wl,
    which represent 100 % and 40 % of the full irrigation respectively. The full irrigation
    was set to 75 %–95 % of field moisture capacity (FC), i.e., irrigation was triggered
    when the SWC reached 75 % of the FC. Irrigation was conducted using drip irrigation
    systems, with the drip line positioned between two rows of maize with 0.80 m spacing.
    The drippers were spaced 0.30 cm apart, and the dripper flow rate was 2.5 L h−1.
    The film cover was applied on the day after sowing. The plastic film used was
    transparent polyethylene film, with a thickness of 0.01 mm and a width of 1.6
    m. Denghai 605 is a maize hybrid developed by the Denghai breeding team in China,
    derived from the parent lines DH351 and DH382. Zhengdan958, on the other hand,
    is a hybrid resulting from the crossbreeding of inbred lines Zheng58 and Chang7-2,
    and it was also developed in China. The sowing dates were April 30 in 2021, and
    May 1 in 2022. The harvest dates for film mulching treatments and non-mulched
    treatments were September 14 and September 17 in 2021, and September 4 and September
    16 in 2022, respectively. The planting density of the two maize varieties is consistent
    at 1 × 105 plants per hectare, with a row spacing of 40 cm and within-row plant
    spacing of 25 cm. The fertilization schedule remains consistent across all plots
    and experimental years, involving a basal fertilizer application of 121.5 kg N
    ha−1, 98.85 kg P ha−1, and 22.35 kg K ha−1 before sowing. Additional fertilizers
    of 125.3 kg N ha−1 and 83 kg N ha−1 were applied at the jointing and tasseling
    stages, respectively. Moreover, abamectin, as well as acetamiprid, is applied
    at the seedling stage to prevent pests, following recommended rates for all treatments.
    There were eight treatments (two varieties, two irrigation levels and two film
    mulching treatments). Each treatment had three replicates. The total of 24 plots
    were arranged in a randomized block in both growing seasons of 2021 and 2022.
    Each plot was 14 m long and 7 m wide, separated by a 1 m wide alley. 2.2. Data
    collections 2.2.1. Crop data collections The leaf area (LA) was determined using
    direct method, which involved measuring the length and maximum width of fully
    expanded green leaves every 7–10 d. LAI was calculated by dividing LA by the ground
    surface area. Destructive samplings were conducted up to eight times in 2021 and
    2022 to measure ADB. Two maize plants were randomly selected for destructive sampling
    in each plot, resulting in a total of six plant samples per treatment. Yield measurements
    were taken from two rows of 15 maize plants (total number of sampling plants was
    90 of each treatment), located at the center of each plot at maturity. The maize
    ears were then air-dried until the moisture content reached 12 %. (1) (2) where
    L is the length of the leaf, m; n is the number of fully expanded leaves; W is
    maximum width of leaf (m); 0.1 is the surface area covered by a single plant (m2);
    0.75 is the experience coefficient. 2.2.2. Soil data collections Soil volumetric
    water content was measured at intervals of 3–7 days, every 20 cm from the surface
    to a depth of 100 cm, using a weighing method. ST was continuously monitored at
    5 cm, 20 cm, 40 cm, 60 cm, 80 cm, and 100 cm depths using 5TE soil tri-parameter
    sensors and recorded by EM50 data logger (Decagon, Washington, USA) at 30-minute
    intervals. Soil physical properties, including soil texture, bulk density and
    soil moisture characteristic curves, were measured every 20 cm from the surface
    to a depth of 100 m after the maize harvest in 2021. The soil physical properties
    along the soil profile are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Soil physical properties

    weather station was used to collect the meteorological data at a height of 2 m
    with a sampling interval of 30 min (Hobo, Onest Cumputerdata Corp., USA). The
    data sets included air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation
    and precipitation, which were required in SWAP model. The average daily variations

    represent the 2022. 2.2.4. Crop evapotranspiration Soil water balance method was
    used to calculate the water consumption of different treatments (Ramos et al.,
    2023), which is regarded as the observed crop evapotranspiration. The root zone
    (0–1 m) water balance are demonstrated as follows: (3) where ET is the evapotranspiration
    under non-mulched condition (mm), ET is the evapotranspiration under film mulching
    condition (mm), P is the precipitation (mm), I is the irrigation depth (mm), GR
    is the water recharge into the root zone from below (mm), D is the deep percolation
    (mm), W is the variance in water storage within root zone (0–1 m) from sowing
    to the harvest date (mm, positive when it increases), R is the surface runoff
    (mm), is the interception of precipitation by canopy (mm), is the interception
    of precipitation by mulch (mm), for the non-mulched treatments, the is equal to
    zero. For precipitation, was calculated according to the equations proposed by
    Hornung and Messing (1983) and Braden (1985), as shown in Eq. (4–5). Under film
    mulching condition, it was assumed that the percentage of precipitation interception
    by full mulch was 20 % (Haraguchi et al., 2003). The calculation for is illustrated
    in Eq. (6). (4) (5) (6) where a is an empirical coefficient (a = 0.25 mm d-1)
    (Kroes et al., 2017), b is the soil cover fraction, is the extinction coefficient
    for solar radiation (  = 0.39) (Ritchie, 1972) for common crops. For deep percolation,
    it takes place when there is a high intensity of irrigation or precipitation,
    resulting in the surplus water exceeding the field capacity (Raes et al., 2009):
    (7) (8) where is the water storage within root zone (mm), is the field capacity
    (m3 m−3), is the thickness of the root zone (m). For surface runoff, during the
    2-year crop growth period, it is not observed and therefore R was not considered.
    For GR, the water recharge into the root zone from below, because the groundwater
    table at the study site is low with a depth of 40–50 m, we did not consider it.
    2.3. SWAP model SWAP model is employed for simulation of crop growth, SWC and
    ST in this study (Kroes et al., 2017). In the following subsections, a general
    description of the processes of soil water and heat movement, as well as crop
    growth modeling are presented. 2.3.1. Soil water movement The SWAP model uses
    the one-dimensional Richards equation to describe soil moisture movement (Richards,
    1931): (9) where θ is volumetric water content (cm3 cm−3), t is time (d), h is
    soil water potential (cm), K(h) is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function
    (cm d-1), is soil water extraction rate by plant roots (cm3 cm−3 d-1), is the
    extraction rate by drain discharge in the saturated zone (cm3 cm−3 d-1), and is
    the exchange rate with macro pores (cm3 cm−3 d-1). SWAP used the Mualem-Van Genuchten
    functions to determine the relationship between soil water content and soil water
    pressure head (van Genuchten, 1980): (10) (11) where is the saturated water content
    (cm3 cm−3), is the residual water content (cm3 cm−3), (cm−1), n and m are empirical
    shape factors. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is the following functions
    (Mualem, 1976): (12) (13) where is the saturated conductivity (cm d-1), λ is a
    shape parameter, and is the relative degree of saturation. 2.3.2. Numerical solution
    for soil temperature According to conservation of energy, SWAP yields the differential
    equation for soil heat flow (Eq. (14)). Both soil heat capacity ( ) and thermal
    conductivity ( ) depend on soil composition, and are derived by Eq. (15–16). SWAP
    employs a fully implicit finite difference numerical scheme to solve Eq. (14).
    (14) (15) (16) where T is the soil temperature (°C); is the thermal conductivity(J
    cm−1 °C−1 d-1); is the soil heat capacity (J cm−3 °C−1); f on the right hand side
    of Eq. (15) are the volume fraction, (cm3 cm−3); Csand, Cclay, Corganic, Cwater
    and Cair on the right hand side of Eq. (15) are the heat capacity of sand, clay,
    organic, water and air, respectively; , , , , and on the right hand side of Eq.
    (16) are the thermal conductivity of sand, clay, organic, water and air, respectively;
    x1, x2, x5, are the weighting coefficients of each component, respectively, and
    the components are indicated by the subscripts. The values of C and of different
    soil components are given in (Kroes et al., 2017). 2.3.3. Evapotranspiration simulation
    In this study, the reference evapotranspiration method was applied for calculating
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp), which is the product of reference evapotranspiration
    (ETref) and user-defined crop coefficient (Kc). ETref can be determined in several
    ways, such as pan evaporation, or FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model (Allen et al.,
    1998). ETp was then divided into two parts, i.e., potential soil evaporation (Ep)
    and potential transpiration (Tp) (Belmans et al., 1983). The actual soil evaporation
    (Ea) and actual transpiration (Ta) are obtained according to the degree of water
    stress in soil surface and root zone, as well as the vegetation coverage (Feddes
    et al., 1978, Boesten and Stroosnijder, 1986). 2.3.4. Crop growth modeling Three
    crop growth programs are provided in the SWAP model, which can be selected by
    the user on request. A simple module for static crop and two detailed modules
    for dynamic crops: one for arable crops (WOFOST) and another detailed module for
    grass (re)growth. In this study, to investigate the variability of maize growth
    indicators under different treatments, we chose the WOFOST module to simulate
    maize growth. WOFOST uses the ratio of effective temperature (Eq. (17)) to the
    temperature sum required to complete either the vegetative (temperature sum from
    emergence to anthesis, TSUMEA) or the reproductive stage (Temperature sum from
    anthesis to maturity, TSUMAM) to calculate the stage of crop development (DVS)
    (Eq. (18)), with DVS of 0 at emergence, 1 at flowering, and 2 at maturity (Diepen
    et al., 1989). The proportions of dry matter allocated in roots, stems, leaves
    and fruits depend on the crop type and DVS, and the proportions as function of
    DVS of these allocations need to be given by the user (Spitters, 1986). WOFOST
    model simulates the canopy potential assimilation at the maximum CO2 assimilation
    rate based on the intercepted radiation fluxes canopy. However, as crops are in
    suboptimal soil conditions, actual assimilation is the results of a combination
    of potential crop assimilation and reduction factors. Some of these assimilated
    products are used for maintenance respiration of the crop organism, while others
    are consumed during dry matter partitioning, i.e., growth respiration. Eventually,
    the remaining assimilated products are transformed into roots, stems, leaves and
    fruits in different allocation ratios. (17) (18) where i is the day number, TBASE
    is the lower threshold temperature for ageing of leaves (°C), TSUM,j is the temperature
    sum required complete either the vegetative or the reproductive stage (°C), is
    the daily average temperature (°C). 2.3.5. Establishment of SWAP simulation In
    this study, the simulation period is from sowing to harvest of maize in 2021 and
    2022. The simulated soil depth is 0–100 cm. For soil water flow, the top boundary
    was given based on the specified irrigation, precipitation and potential evaporation.
    The bottom boundary was set as free drainage. For soil heat transport, the Dirichlet
    boundary conditions were applied for both top and bottom boundaries. Note that
    the soil temperature at the soil surface is difficult to monitor as it is greatly
    influenced by air temperature, here we used the observed soil temperature at 5
    cm of soil layer for the top boundary. The P1WhM0 treatment in 2022 was used as
    the calibration treatment, and the other 7 treatments in 2022 and the 8 treatments
    in 2021 were used as the validation treatments. The simulation of SWAP model based
    on the initial values of parameters without DA is named as open-loop (OP). The
    initial values of parameters were determined by field measurements or defined
    or empirical values (Hu et al., 2019, Mokhtari et al., 2018, Zhao et al., 2020).
    The initial values of required parameters in SWAP are shown in Table S1 and Table
    S2 of the Supplementary Material. 2.3.6. Parameters sensitivity analysis The SWAP
    model has a large number (>100) of parameters, some of which are challenging to
    obtain or insensitive to the outputs of SWAP model. To reduce the workload of
    calibrating parameters and to improve the performance of the model, sensitivity
    analysis is fundamental. In this study we used field dataset of P1WhM0 treatment
    in 2022 for parameter sensitivity analysis. The analysis involved 72 parameters,
    four grid levels, and 7300 parameter samples. Specifically, we conducted a comprehensive
    assessment of the sensitivity of key plant growth indicators, including maximum
    LAI, final yield, final ADB, and mean SWC at depths ranging from 0 to 100 cm,
    throughout the entire growth stage. The Morris method was chosen as the sensitivity
    analysis method for this study, which is a global sensitivity analysis method
    that performs sensitivity analysis by calculating the effect of each parameters
    on the output (Morris, 1991). The steps of sensitivity analysis are to: (1) normalize
    each parameter Pari (Par = [Par1, Par2, Par3, , Pari, Pari+1, , Parn]) and then
    divide into N uniform intervals, i.e., {0,1/(N-1), …, 1}, (2) sample the Pari
    in N uniform intervals and calculate the elementary effect (EEi) of each parameter,
    (3) repeat the above steps k times to get a certain number of parameters and outputs,
    and (4) calculate their mean values of basic effect. The calculation formulas
    are as follows: (19) (20) where are the sampling values of the parameters in the
    kth random, is equal to 1/(N-1), n is the number of parameters, r is the number
    of sampling, the total number of model calculations is equal to (n + 1)*r, is
    the mean value of basic effect. 2.4. Data assimilation method 2.4.1. EnKF method
    EnKF has become the most adopted DA method (Fattori Junior et al., 2022, Huang
    et al., 2019). The EnKF assimilation method considers the uncertainty of model
    simulation and the error of remote sensing estimations. The goal of EnKF assimilation
    method can be defined as: combine all possible information (models, observations,
    a-priori data and statistics) to obtain the best possible estimate of the state
    of a system (Evensen, 2003, Evensen, 1994, Hu et al., 2019). The values of the
    state update depend on the uncertainty in both the model state and the observations.
    Uncertainties in both model and the observations are difficult to determine. Therefore,
    we determined the uncertainty level to be 10 % (Fattori Junior et al., 2022).
    In addition, we defined the size of the ensemble as 50 (Hu et al., 2019). For
    further EnKF details, refer to Evensen et al. (1994) and Hu et al. (2019). 2.4.2.
    Calibration method Calibration method is one of the parameter optimal method (Wang
    et al., 2022b, Wang et al., 2022a). In this study, we used the global search (GS)
    method to adjust the sensitive parameters of the SWAP model using all available
    measurements in the full assimilation time period. The optimized sensitive parameter
    values using GS method are shown in Table S3 of the Supplementary Material. To
    quantify the difference between the simulated LAI/SWC and the field-measured LAI/SWC,
    we constructed the cost function shown in Eq. (21): (21) where m is the number
    of dates of LAI measurements; m1 is the number of dates of SWC measurements; is
    the estimated LAI value on the date l (m2 m−2); is the simulated LAI on the date
    l by SWAP model (m2 m−2); is the mean value of measured SWC value of 0–100 cm
    on the date l (m3 m−3); is the mean value of simulated SWC value of 0–100 cm on
    the date l by SWAP model (m3 m−3). 2.4.3. The data assimilation strategies All
    assimilation procedures of the SWAP model were executed on the Python platform
    (Jupyter Notebook). The work was conducted on a desktop computer (Dell Vostro
    5890) with an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700F @ 2.50 GHz processor, 16 GB
    RAM, and a 64-bit operating system. The flowchart of different data assimilation
    strategies is shown in Fig. 2. We combined SWAP model with three EnKF methods
    and a calibration method to assess improvements in simulation accuracy of crop
    growth, soil moisture and soil heat. The approaches compared include simulations
    using the EnKF method assimilating only LAI (EnKF-L), assimilating only SWC (EnKF-S),
    simultaneously assimilating both LAI and SWC (EnKF-LS), and calibrating sensitive
    parameters using the GS method based on LAI and SWC measured values. Download

    simulation using the five methods was evaluated by four statistical indices, including
    coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), the Bias,
    the coefficient of variation (CV) and the time spent on simulating, the equations
    are expressed as follows. R2 was employed to assess the correlation and consistency
    between simulated and measured values. A higher R2 indicates a greater consistency
    between simulated and measured values. RMSE was used to evaluate the precision
    and accuracy of the SWAP model, with a smaller RMSE indicating better precision
    and accuracy in the model''s simulation. Bias, when positive, signifies a general
    overestimation by the model, while a negative bias suggests a general underestimation.
    To assess the presence of outliers in the results simulated by the SWAP model
    under different assimilation methods and treatments, CV was utilized. A higher
    CV suggests a greater relative variability in the data, indicating higher variability.
    Conversely, a lower CV indicates relatively stable data with a smaller degree
    of relative variability. (22) (23) (24) (25) where n is the number of samples;
    x(i) is the measured value of the i sample, is the mean value of the measured
    values, y(i) is the SWAP simulated values of the i sample, is the mean values
    of SWAP simulation. 3. Results 3.1. Parameter sensitivity The results of sensitivity
    analysis of 72 selected parameters to LAI, ADB, yield and SWC are shown in Fig.
    3. The dynamics of LAI were mainly controlled by crop parameters, although they
    exhibited correlations with soil parameters as well. Notably, LAI demonstrated
    the highest sensitivity to the initial total crop dry weight (TDWI), followed
    by the TSUMEA, empirical shape factor of the soil moisture characteristic curve
    (n), light use efficiency for real leaf (EFF), and specific leaf area at DVS =
    0.50 (SLATB_2). ADB was primarily influenced by SWC and light energy radiation
    (Fig. 3(b)). The soil parameter n had the most significant impact on ADB, followed
    by TSUMEA, , TDWI, and EFF. In terms of maize yield (Fig. 3(c)), it exhibited
    sensitivity to the parameters TDWI, as well as soil parameters such as n, , Ksat,
    and EFF. The water storage of the 0–1 m soil layer was closely related to soil
    parameters such as n, , , TDWI and Ksat, and also to the parameter TDWI (Fig.
    3(d)). Based on the outcomes of the sensitivity analysis, we selected the crop
    parameters TSUMEA, EFF, SLATB_2 and TDWI for updating when assimilating LAI, and
    the soil parameters n and for updating when assimilating SWC. Download : Download

    dry biomass, SWC: soil water content. Please see Table S1 and S2 for the specific
    meaning of the parameters. 3.2. Leaf area index simulation The results of LAI
    simulations based on the four assimilation methods and model simulation using
    parameters (Table S1 and S2) are depicted in Fig. 4, and their accuracy evaluation
    is presented in Table 2. For the calibration treatment (P1WhM0 in 2022), the GS
    assimilation method exhibited superior performance for simulation LAI, with R2
    of 0.98 and RMSE of 0.41 m2 m−2. The Bias of GS method was −0.20 m2 m−2, indicating
    that the GS method slightly underestimated LAI. However, for the validated treatments,
    the GS method performed worse than the EnKF assimilation methods and even worse
    than OP method, such as P1WlM0, P2WhM0, P2WlM1 in 2022, and P1WhM1, P2WhM1, P2WlM0
    in 2021. Among the three EnKF assimilation methods, the best performance was achieved
    by simultaneously assimilating LAI and SWC, followed by assimilating only LAI,
    and the least effective method was assimilating only SWC. The mean values of R2
    and RMSE were 0.96 and 0.55 m2 m−2 for EnKF-L, 0.95 and 0.60 m2 m−2 for EnKF-S,
    as well as 0.97 and 0.37 m2 m−2 for EnKF-LS, respectively. EnKF-L and EnKF-S generally
    underestimated LAI, while EnKF-LS overestimated LAI. The mean values of Bias for
    the three EnKF methods in simulating LAI under different treatments were −0.013,
    −0.050, and 0.045 m2 m−2, respectively. When examining the variability of the
    simulated LAI throughout the entire growth period under different treatments and
    years for the five methods, the CV values were 0.74, 0.74, 0.74, 0.75, and 0.72,
    respectively. The close proximity of these CV values suggests that the performance
    of simulations of LAI under different treatments by the five methods were stable.

    0.52 0.42 0.32 0.31 −0.96 −0.06 0.14 0.10 Regarding the different treatments,
    no significant difference in simulation accuracy was observed between the two
    irrigation level treatments. However, in terms of RMSE values, the simulation
    accuracy of the adequately irrigated treatment (Wh) was lower than that of the
    deficit treatment (W1), with an average RMSE of 1.10 m2 m−2 for the former and
    1.20 m2 m−2 for the latter. In terms of the two varieties, the simulation accuracy
    of the P2 variety was closely resembled that of the P1 variety. It is evident
    that the OP method did not accurately simulate the LAI of the film mulching treatments,
    with mean values of R2 and RMSE of 0.75 and 1.30 m2 m−2, respectively. The mean
    value of RMSE was 0.61 m2 m−2 higher than that of the non-mulching treatments.
    In addition, the OP method underestimated LAI in the early growth stage of maize
    under M1 treatments. After applying the EnKF method for LAI and SWC, the RMSE
    of LAI decreased by 0.23–1.57 m2 m-2 compared with the OP method under film mulching
    treatment and decreased by 0–1.29 m2 m−2 under non-mulched treatment. It is clearly
    shown that the EnKF assimilation method performed more outstandingly compared
    with the GS and OP methods for accurate simulation of LAI. 3.3. Aboveground dry
    biomass simulation The results of ADB simulation using four data assimilation
    methods and OP methods are shown in Fig. 5, and their simulation accuracy statistics
    are presented in Table 3. The correlation between the simulated ADB values from
    the five methods and the observed ADB values was consistently strong. For the
    OP method, satisfactory accuracy was achieved in the calibration treatment (P1WhM0)
    of ADB. The OP method could effectively capture the growth trend changes of ADB,
    whereas it might have a large simulation error, with RMSE values ranging from
    1.14 t hm−2 to 5.26 t hm−2. The GS effectively revealed the differences in ADB
    among different treatments. Specifically, ADB was higher under fully irrigated
    treatments than that of deficit irrigated treatments, and higher under film mulching
    treatments as opposed to non-mulched treatments. However, the GS method performed
    unstably in the validation treatments, showing a wide range of RMSE values, from
    0.38 to 6.12 t hm−2. Furthermore, except for the P1WhM1 treatment, the GS method
    underestimated the final ADB, with mean value of Bias of −2.05 t hm−2. The three
    EnKF assimilation methods showed good simulation accuracy for ADB, with R2 above
    0.84 and RMSE less than 3.71 t hm−2. The highest accuracy was achieved when assimilating
    both LAI and SWC, followed by LAI assimilation, while the SWC assimilation had
    the lowest accuracy, with average RMSE values of 0.92, 1.68 and 1.91 t hm−2, respectively.
    The CV for the simulated ADB under different treatments and years was very similar
    for the five methods. The values of CV, from largest to smallest, were EnKF-LS,
    followed by EnKF-L and EnKF-S methods, and the smallest values were for the GS
    and OP methods. There were no significant differences in ADB simulation accuracy
    among different treatments. Download : Download high-res image (566KB) Download

    6 illustrates the average SWC results of the one-meter soil layer simulated using
    the four data assimilation methods and the OP method. The accuracy evaluation
    indexes are summarized and presented in Table 4. The GS and OP methods demonstrated
    higher accuracy in simulating of SWC in the calibration treatment than in validation
    treatments, with R2 above 0.66 and RMSE less than 0.02 m3 m−3, respectively. In
    addition, both GS and OP methods tended to overestimate SWC under film mulching
    and deficit irrigation conditions, with Bias values above zero. In the other validated
    treatments, except for the P1W1M0 treatment, the OP method showed lower accuracy
    in simulating SWC compared with the EnKF assimilation methods, with R2 decreasing
    by 0.07–0.52 and RMSE values increasing by 0.01–0.04 m3 m−3, respectively. The
    performance of the three EnKF assimilation methods in simulating the average SWC
    of the one-meter soil layer differed from that observed for LAI and ADB. The highest
    simulation accuracy was obtained when assimilating both LAI and SWC, followed
    by assimilating SWC individually, and the lowest accuracy was observed when assimilating
    LAI alone, with mean RMSE values of 0.019 m3 m−3, 0.023 m3 m−3 and 0.026 m3 m−3,
    respectively. Furthermore, from the Bias, it can be observed that the three EnKF
    methods slightly overestimated SWC for the majority of treatments. The CV values
    for the simulated SWC under different treatments for the five methods are 0.18,
    0.098, 0.20, 0.20, and 0.21 m3 m−3, respectively. This indicates that EnKF-LS
    showed a relatively larger fluctuation in simulated values, followed by EnKF-L
    and EnKF-S methods, while the GS method exhibited the smallest variability in
    simulation SWC. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    five methods in simulating SWC under different treatments was explored, which
    was demonstrated using the average RMSE. The adequately irrigated treatment exhibited
    a smaller simulation error compared with the deficit irrigated treatment, with
    average RMSE values of 0.026 m3 m−3 and 0.037 m3 m−3, respectively. There was
    no significant difference in the mean RMSE between the two maize varieties. The
    simulation accuracy of SWC varied among different film mulching treatments, with
    mean RMSE values of 0.034 m3 m−3 and 0.029 m3 m−3 for the M1 and M0, respectively.
    In summary, the EnKF-LS method exhibited clear advantages in simulating SWC, while
    the GS method demonstrated unstable performance with significant fluctuations
    in simulation accuracy. 3.5. Soil temperature simulation The results of the simulation
    of the mean ST in one-meter soil layer based on the four data assimilation methods
    and the OP method are shown in Fig. 7, and their accuracy evaluations are shown
    in Table 5. Both the OP method and the GS methods were able to simulate ST accurately,
    except for P1W1M1 and P1W1M0 treatments, with R2 values ranging from 0.79 to 0.98
    and RMSE values ranging from 0.44 to 2.0 °C, respectively. Under the film mulching
    treatment, the OP method underestimated ST during both seedling and jointing stages.
    Comparing the different data assimilation methods, there were no significant differences
    in the accuracy of simulation ST among the four data assimilation methods, i.e.,
    the four data assimilation methods simulated ST with high accuracy. Specifically,
    in terms of average RMSE values, the EnKF-LS method achieved the highest accuracy,
    followed by the GS method, the EnKF-S method, and the EnKF-L method, with mean
    RMSE values of 0.73, 1.09, 1.13,1.16 and 1.18, respectively. These findings highlighted
    the capabilities of the data assimilation methods in accurately simulating ST,
    with the EnKF-LS method showing the highest accuracy. Furthermore, from the Bias,
    it can be observed that the three EnKF methods slightly overestimated ST for the
    majority of treatments. The CV values for the simulated ST under different treatments
    for the five methods were 0.10, 0.10, 0.11, 0.11 and 0.11, respectively. Download

    methods demonstrated differences in the mean ST of the one-meter soil layer between
    treatments. Specifically, ST tended to increase with water stress under the same
    film mulching treatment and maize variety. Furthermore, film mulching significantly
    increased ST at the beginning of maize period under the same irrigation level
    and maize variety. The results emphasized the influence of film mulching and water
    stress on ST variations during the maize growth period. 3.6. Yield and evapotranspiration
    The simulation results of the four data assimilation methods and the OP method
    for maize yield and ET are shown in Fig. 8, and their accuracy evaluations as
    well as the water balance components are shown in Table 6. Precipitation and irrigation
    were the primary sources of water input, with irrigation accounting for an average
    of 78.94 % and 65.96 % of the total inflow for Wh and Wl, respectively, under
    mulched condition. Under non-mulched condition, irrigation accounted for an average
    of 65.71 % and 51.29 % of the total inflow for Wh and Wl treatments. The substantial
    water volume may leaded to deep percolation. In 2021, the proportions of deep
    percolation relative to irrigation volume for each treatment were: 20.03 %, 48.10
    %, 29.80 %, 39.64 %, 30.81 %, 45.84 %, 18.49 %, and 20.96 %, respectively. In
    2022, deep percolation occurred only during full irrigation, with percolation
    volumes ranging from 4.86 to 45.00 mm. In addition, the interception of precipitation
    by canopy in different treatments ranged from 10.80 to 21.70 mm. For the mulching
    treatment, the interception of precipitation by the mulch ranged from 22.42 to
    29.28 mm. Download : Download high-res image (739KB) Download : Download full-size

    Wh: 100 % of the full irrigation; Wl: 40 % of the full irrigation; M1: film mulching
    treatment; M0: non-mulched;. All five methods successfully captured the differences
    in yield and ET across the various treatments. The OP method simulated maize yield
    ranging from 6.46 to 17.22 t hm−2 and ET ranging from 290.17 to 474.17 mm for
    the eight treatments. The OP method failed to accurately simulate the yield for
    different treatments over the two-year period, generally underestimating the yield
    with a bias of 1.12 t hm−2. The simulated R2 of OP method was 0.50, and the RMSE
    was 2.84 t hm−2. The GS method, overall, underestimated the yield and exhibited
    a larger simulation error, with RMSE of 7.55 t hm−2. The three EnKF methods slightly
    overestimated the yield, demonstrating high simulation accuracy for maize yield
    under different mulching, irrigation levels, maize varieties and years. Their
    R2 values were greater than 0.73, and RMSE values were less than 1.38 t hm−2.
    Among the three EnKF methods, EnKF-LS performed the best, followed by EnKF-L,
    and EnKF-S performed the least effectively. We also evaluated whether the five
    methods would produce outlier values for maize yield simulation under different
    treatments and years. From Fig. 8, it can be observed that the GS method''s simulated
    values for different treatments were scattered, with the highest CV value among
    the five methods, reaching 0.68. Whereas, the CV values for the three EnKF methods
    were less than 0.22, indicating greater stability. For simulated ET, EnKF-LS exhibited
    the highest precision, with R2 of 0.88 and RMSE of 34.23 mm for different treatments.
    EnKF-L and EnKF-S followed in performance, while GS method performed the worst.
    The GS method severely underestimated ET, with RMSE of 132.39 mm. When examining
    the CV of the five methods in simulating ET for different treatments and years,
    five methods had CV values less than 0.20, suggesting that the simulation results
    did not contain outlier values. These results demonstrated the improved accuracy
    and effectiveness of the EnKF methods in simulating maize yield and water consumption,
    with substantial reductions in NRMSE values compared to both the OP method and
    the GS method. 4. Discussion 4.1. Comparison of different data assimilation methods
    (GS and EnKF) The OP method in our study relied on experimentally derived or literature-based
    parameter values for simulation. Therefore, the OP method performed well in calibration
    treatment. However, since crop parameters vary among different crop growth environment,
    the parameter values selected from Zhao et al. (2020) might not represent the
    experimental conditions in our study (Fattori and Marin, 2023). In this study,
    treatment under fully irrigated and non-mulched conditions was used as the calibrated
    treatment, so the set of calibrated parameters was not suitable for the film mulching
    and deficit irrigation treatments. Specifically, under film mulching and deficit
    irrigation conditions, the OP method failed to capture the increase in ST during
    the early growth stage of maize due to film mulching, which led to an earlier
    of crop growth stage and increased peak values of growth variables (Zhao et al.,
    2020, Zou et al., 2021). Additionally, deficit irrigation slowed down the growth
    rate before the middle growth stages and increased the growth rate of aging stages
    (NeSmith and Ritchie, 1992, Ramos-Fuentes et al., 2023). Therefore, many researchers
    have modified the crop models’ structure to improve the simulation performance
    (Han et al., 2014, Liang et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2020). We used the data assimilation
    methods to overcome the difficulties in parameters tuning and model’s modification.
    In this study, the EnKF method improved the simulation accuracy of LAI, ADB, SWC
    and ST compared with GS and OP methods (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table
    6), especially under film mulching and deficit irrigation conditions. This suggested
    that the shortcomings of the crop model performance could be compensated by continuously
    assimilating the observed data into the model (Fattori Junior et al., 2022, Mokhtari
    et al., 2018). The EnKF method employed an ensemble-based approach, maintaining
    multiple model states during the assimilation process, which aided in capturing
    the nonlinear characteristics of crop growth more effectively. Furthermore, the
    EnKF method provided appropriate weights and uncertainty estimates for observational
    data from different experimental treatments. Even in cases of diverse experimental
    conditions, the EnKF method adeptly fused various observational information during
    assimilation process, consequently enhancing simulation accuracy. Therefore, due
    to its wide applicability, the EnKF method has been extensively employed. Many
    studies have evaluated the ability of the cooperation of EnKF method and crop
    models at the early stages of crop growth for yield prediction, which supported
    the optimization of irrigation systems and situational awareness in real time
    (Knowling et al., 2023, Ziliani et al., 2022). The GS method is sensitive to parameter
    initial values and ranges, particularly when varying irrigation levels, mulching
    treatments, and maize varieties resulted in distinct sensitive parameters and
    initial values (Fattori Junior et al., 2022, Lu et al., 2021). The performance
    of the GS method was not optimal in such scenarios. The optimal parameters determined
    by the GS method were effective only for the specific maize growth conditions
    in the calibration treatment. In this study, the higher irrigation treatment (Wh)
    was utilized as the validation treatment, thereby leading to improved simulation
    accuracy in comparison to the lower irrigation treatment (Wl) for the GS method.
    When assessing the performance of the data assimilation methods, in addition to
    stability and accuracy, the computational cost of the method is a crucial evaluation
    factor (Wu et al., 2021). For the GS method, 14 sensitive parameters were selected,
    and 500 samples were taken within the parameter range. With each SWAP run taking
    4.01 s, the total runtime for the GS method was 7.79 h. Extracting results from
    one simulation took 0.0803 s, adding an additional 0.16 h. Concerning the EnKF
    method, 50 ensemble members were utilized, and the EnKF algorithm (including result
    extraction) took five seconds per run. In 2022, there were ten LAI observations
    and 17 SWC observations, with one date overlapping. In 2021, there were nine LAI
    observations and 16 SWC observations, with two dates overlapping. The runtimes
    for the EnKF-L, EnKF-S, and EnKF-LS methods in 2022 were 4.17 min, 4.74 min, and
    5.5 min, respectively. In 2021, the runtimes for the EnKF-L, EnKF-S, and EnKF-LS
    methods were 4.08 min, 4.67 min, and 5.25 min, respectively. Considering the total
    duration for all eight treatments, the GS method, EnKF-L, EnKF-S, and EnKF-LS
    methods required approximately eight hours (7.79 + 0.16 + 8 * 4.01/60), 0.5 h,
    0.62 h, and 0.70 h, respectively. Overall, the computational cost of running EnKF-LS
    was significantly lower than that of the GS method, slightly higher than both
    EnKF-L and EnKF-S. However, the combination of EnKF-LS with SWAP resulted in the
    highest simulation accuracy. 4.2. Assessment the prediction of assimilated LAI
    and SWC for SWAP model In our study, we also compared the assimilation accuracy
    of assimilating LAI, assimilating SWC, and assimilating both LAI and SWC simultaneously
    for the four data assimilation methods. We aimed to assess the impact of assimilating
    different variables on the simulation accuracy. For the GS method, we constructed
    a cost function aiming to minimize the discrepancy between the field-observed
    LAI, field-observed SWC, and the model-simulated values. Therefore, the GS approach
    exhibited encouraging performance in improving the simulation accuracy of corrected
    LAI and SWC. However, SWAP model is a highly complex system where SWC, ST, and
    crop growth are interconnected. Therefore, achieving accurate simulations of LAI
    and SWC did not guarantee precise simulations of yield and water consumption (Orlova
    and Linker, 2023). The calibrated sensitive parameters varied with different maize
    varieties and growth environments, which might affect the simulation accuracy
    of the GS method (Fattori Junior et al., 2022, Lu et al., 2021). As shown in Section
    3, for maize growth variables, the best performance was achieved by simultaneously
    assimilating LAI and SWC, followed by assimilating only LAI, and the least effective
    method was assimilating only SWC. While for ST and SWC, the highest simulation
    accuracy was obtained when assimilating both LAI and SWC, followed by assimilating
    SWC individually, and the lowest accuracy was observed when assimilating LAI alone.
    The observed phenomena in results section were related to the selection of updated
    parameters. When assimilating LAI, we chose to update the parameters TSUMEA, EFF,
    SLATB_2, and TDWI, which are mainly crop parameters. Therefore, assimilating LAI
    could improve the simulation accuracy of crop growth variables. When assimilating
    SWC, we updated the soil parameters, specifically the empirical shape factors
    of the soil moisture characteristic curve (n and ) for each soil layer. Additionally,
    ST is mainly determined by soil moisture and soil texture. Therefore, assimilating
    SWC could improve the simulation performance of ST and SWC. In this study, the
    measurement dates of SWC and LAI were not strictly consistent. Therefore, when
    having SWC observations, we updated the soil parameters, and when having LAI observations,
    we updated the crop parameters. When both observations were available, we updated
    both crop and soil parameters. As a result, the SWAP model''s trajectory was altered
    more frequently, leading to higher simulation accuracy. On the other hand, as
    shown in Fig. 9, LAI had a strong relationship with ADB, with correlation coefficient
    values of −0.64 and 0.54 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. However, the relationship
    between LAI and SWC was inconspicuous, with correlation coefficient values of
    0.32 and 0.016 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Previous studies have also reached
    similar conclusions (Ines et al., 2013, Nearing et al., 2012). Download : Download

    4.3. Potential applications and future research directions Previous research findings
    suggested that the performance of different assimilation methods was mainly determined
    by the following factors: (1) the quantity, frequency, and timing of field observations,
    (2) the effectiveness of model parameter calibration prior to assimilation, (3)
    the computational cost of the method, and (4) the selection of model parameters
    (Fattori Junior et al., 2022). Consequently, different studies recommended inconsistent
    assimilation methods. In this study, we recommended the EnKF data assimilation
    method to collaborate with the SWAP model to simulation LAI, ADB, SWC, ST and
    yield. The reasons are as follows: (1) Due to the variations in maize growth environments
    among each treatment, there is an increased potential necessity for absorbing
    observational data within the SWAP model; (2) Parameter calibration was not conducted
    prior to assimilation; (3) The SWAP model did not exhibit linear responses to
    maize growth and soil–water-heat dynamics under different irrigation levels, film
    mulching treatments, and maize varieties; (4) The sensitive parameters were not
    consistent across different treatments; (5) the EnKF-LS method needs a low computational
    cost. However, due to the EnKF method updating parameter states each time observational
    values enter the SWAP model, causing shifts in the model trajectory and resulting
    in jumps in simulated values, it may exhibit a slightly higher likelihood of producing
    outliers compared with calibration methods. This potential issue can be mitigated
    by applying smoothing algorithms to ensure that assimilated results align more
    closely with the expected patterns of the variables. In addition, some future
    approaches that could contribute to improving this study are worth noting. (1)
    For the SWAP model, its design and development did not consider the effect of
    film mulching on the soil-crop- atmosphere process. Therefore, modifying the SWAP
    model based on the method proposed by Zhao et al. (2020) and combining it with
    data assimilation methods could further enhance the simulation accuracy. (2) In
    this study, LAI and SWC were used as assimilation variables for the construction
    of the data assimilation framework. With the development of remote sensing technology,
    multi-source remote sensing data can be easily obtained, such as thermal infrared,
    etc. How to fully utilize multi-source remote sensing data into the assimilation
    framework needs further study. (3) This study focused on evaluating the performance
    of the SWAP model and a data assimilation strategy via filed experiments data.
    However, data assimilation methods are highly effective for regional crop growth
    perception and yield prediction. Applying the SWAP model and data assimilation
    methods at the regional scale can provide data support for regional crop management
    and optimization of water resources. (4) The combination of SWAP model and data
    assimilation method with stochastic irrigation scheduling optimization provide
    an effective way to develop management tool. The data assimilation method is used
    to dynamically adjust the optimized constraints and crop model states, so that
    the optimized irrigation system can better fit the field conditions and improve
    the feasibility and practicality of the irrigation system. 5. Conclusions In this
    study, a simulation framework that incorporated multiple data assimilation strategies
    in conjunction with the SWAP model was implemented based on field experiment in
    a spring maize field with variations in irrigation levels, film mulching treatments,
    and maize varieties. Four data assimilation methods including GS, EnKF-L, EnKF-S,
    as well as EnKF-LS were evaluated their performance in enhancing the simulation
    accuracy of LAI, ADB, SWC, ST, yield, and crop water consumption. Our results
    indicated that the OP method failed to accurately capture the effects of film
    mulching on soil water and heat transport, crop growth, and meteorological parameters.
    It also did not adequately reflect the impact of deficit irrigation on maize growth
    processes. The performance of the GS method was unstable in simulating crop growth
    variables and SWC. Additionally, the GS method underestimated ADB, yield, and
    crop water consumption, leading to an overestimation of SWC. In contrast, the
    EnKF method significantly improved the simulation accuracy of LAI, ADB, yield,
    SWC, ST, and crop water consumption compared with the GS and OP methods. This
    improvement was especially prominent when both LAI and SWC observations were assimilated
    into the SWAP model simultaneously. Furthermore, the EnKF-LS data assimilation
    method significantly enhanced the simulation accuracy of soil and crop variables
    under mulching and deficit irrigation conditions and needed a low computational
    cost. CRediT authorship contribution statement Xi Huang: Conceptualization, Formal

  description: Sensor data and agro-hydrological modeling have been combined to improve
    irrigation management. Crop water models simulating crop growth and production
    in response to the soil-water environment need to be parsimonious in terms of
    structure, inputs and parameters to be applied in data scarce regions. Irrigation
    management using soil moisture sensors requires them to be site-calibrated, low-cost,
    and maintainable. Therefore, there is a need for parsimonious crop modeling combined
    with low-cost soil moisture sensing without losing predictive capability. This
    study calibrated the low-cost capacitance-based Spectrum Inc. SM100 soil moisture
    sensor using multiple least squares and machine learning models, with both laboratory
    and field data. The best calibration technique, field-based piece-wise linear
    regression (calibration r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 3.13 %, validation r2 = 0.67, RMSE =
    4.57 %), was used to study the effect of sensor calibration on the performance
    of the FAO AquaCrop Open Source (AquaCrop-OS) model by calibrating its soil hydraulic
    parameters. This approach was tested during the wheat cropping season in 2018,
    in Kanpur (India), in the Indo-Gangetic plains, resulting in some best practices
    regarding sensor calibration being recommended. The soil moisture sensor was calibrated
    best in field conditions against a secondary standard sensor (UGT GmbH. SMT100)
    taken as a reference (r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 %), followed by laboratory calibration
    against gravimetric soil moisture using the dry-down (r2 = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 %)
    and wet-up curves respectively (r2 = 0.62, RMSE = 6.29 %). Moreover, model overfitting
    with machine learning algorithms led to poor field validation performance. The
    soil moisture simulation of AquaCrop-OS improved significantly by incorporating
    raw reference sensor and calibrated low-cost sensor data. There were non-significant
    impacts on biomass simulation, but water productivity improved significantly.
    Notably, using raw low-cost sensor data to calibrate AquaCrop led to poorer performances
    than using the literature. Hence using literature values could save sensor costs
    without compromising model performance if sensor calibration was not possible.
    The results suggest the essentiality of calibrating low-cost soil moisture sensors
    for crop modeling calibration to improve crop water productivity.

    Surface irrigation, like other traditional irrigation methods, is inefficient
    due to deep percolation and non-uniform distribution of water (Pramanik et al.,
    2022). However, it may continue to remain the most extensively used irrigation
    method (Raine, 2006) due to its low-cost and energy requirements (Bjorneberg,
    2013). Hence, technological improvements to improve irrigation management need
    to be relevant and correspondingly cost-effective, particularly when they are
    designed for smallholder farmers, who tend to be more economical in technology
    adoption (Singh et al., 2009). Irrigation management techniques have combined
    either data from satellites (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000) or ground sensor networks
    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015) with agro-hydrological modeling (Chiara and Marco,
    2022). Precise irrigation water management requires accurate measurements as well
    as a comprehensive biophysical process understanding of crop response to water
    at different crop growth stages (Kisekka et al., 2022). Crop water simulation
    models describe the crop growth and production responses to the soil-water environment
    (C. Zhang et al., 2022). Such models are often data intensive, requiring numerous
    input variables and parameter values, which may not be available for different
    crops and environments (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014). Similarly, though commercial
    sensors, processors and communication components may be available, they need to
    be cost-effective, easy to access and maintainable for effective agricultural
    applications (Pramanik et al., 2022; Rodríguez-Robles et al., 2020). Soil moisture
    (or volumetric water content, VWC) is a key variable involved in precision agriculture
    and agricultural sustainability (Kisekka et al., 2022), which can be an input
    to crop growth models. Soil moisture sensing technologies can have low-utilization
    due to farmers'' economic limitations and reluctance towards such investment (Srbinovska
    et al., 2015). Further, soil moisture sensors need to be calibrated at each site
    because of the effects of the variability in soil properties on the sensor outputs
    (Peddinti et al., 2020). Researchers have highlighted the importance of field
    calibration as undisturbed soil samples are representative of field conditions
    where the sensors might be used (Robinson et al., 2003). However, soil moisture
    sensing is sensitive to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, bulk
    density, organic matter and clay content (Kargas and Soulis, 2012; Matula et al.,
    2016). Hence, manufacturers generally perform indoor calibration with sieved,
    uniformly packed soils at regulated VWCs and temperature conditions, particularly
    in homogeneous coarse soils like some sands and loams (Feng and Sui, 2020). Studies
    have used irrigation scheduling with calibrated low-cost capacitance sensors to
    detect crop water stress (Thompson et al., 2007a) and irrigation thresholds computed
    using measured VWC-based indices(Thompson et al., 2007b). Other studies have used
    expensive sensors in combination with crop modeling (Lu et al., 2021). The challenge
    is to combine accurate (calibrated) soil moisture sensing at low costs and parsimonious
    crop models without losing predictive power (Landau et al., 2000). This paper
    addresses this using four research questions. RQ1 pertains to LC soil moisture
    sensor performance on the field, and RQs 2 to 4 pertain to using LC soil moisture
    data for parsimonious crop model calibration: 1. Can low-cost (LC) soil moisture
    sensors be calibrated using more sophisticated techniques such as machine learning
    algorithms to improve their field performance? 2. Do raw data from LC soil moisture
    sensors have any advantage over literature values for parsimonious crop model
    calibration? 3. What is the difference in performance when such a model is calibrated
    using raw data from a LC vis-à-vis a reference soil moisture sensor? 4. What is
    the effect of calibrating the LC soil moisture data against a reference sensor
    on crop model performance? The novelty of this study lies in combining data from
    LC soil moisture sensors with parsimonious crop modeling to evaluate crop model
    performance in simulating canopy cover, VWC and water productivity (WP) using
    a two-step calibration process. Firstly, low-cost (capacitance based) soil moisture
    sensors were calibrated against uncalibrated reference (TDR-FDR) sensors via multiple
    models (least squares and machine learning algorithms). Consequently, these calibrated
    VWC data were used for calibrating the soil hydraulic parameters of a parsimonious
    crop model to assess improvements in WP. Such a laboratory-field-simulation study
    based on a food critical region in the Majority World, which combines low-cost
    soil moisture sensor calibration (using multiple models) with parsimonious crop
    modeling, has not been undertaken yet, to the best of the authors'' knowledge.
    2. Material and methods 2.1. Study area and wheat cropping season 2.1.1. Experimental
    site The study was conducted during the wheat cropping season of 2018 in Kanpur,
    which is representative of an intensively managed rural landscape in the Indo-Gangetic
    plains (Gupta et al., 2019). Measurements were collected in a 20 m × 30 m experimental
    field (Fig. 1) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India (26°30′56.8″N,
    80°13′47.3″E and altitude of about 126 m above mean sea level). The experimental
    site falls within the sub-tropical climate zone with an average annual rainfall
    of 833.5 mm, 92.5 % of which falls within the monsoon season (June to September);
    the other two seasons are the cold season from November–February and the hot season
    from March–June (Sankararamakrishnan et al., 2008). Download : Download high-res

    with check-basins (plots) irrigated using flood irrigation. Six plots with soil
    moisture monitoring using both Ref. and LC sensors were chosen for the study.
    2.1.2. Description of the wheat cropping season The Indian spring wheat variety
    K7903 (improved Halna) (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2012) was sown in
    check basins (or ‘plots’, each 3 m × 3 m) on January 5, 2018. The seeds were sown
    with a row-spacing, depth and planting density of 10 cm, 5 cm and 363 plants/sq.m
    respectively. Halna is a very late sown, short duration, drought tolerant variety
    of wheat (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2017). Agricultural management was
    performed based on local farming practices, that included fertilizer (urea) application
    during tillering (27 days after sowing, or DAS) and 4 irrigation applications
    (25 DAS, 45 DAS, 59 DAS and 74 DAS, given in Table A1) totaling 220.2 mm, to supplement
    the 50.4 mm rainfall during the cropping season. There was a flooding event which
    occurred just following the final irrigation, totaling 262.5 mm of water. Hence,
    the total water input was 533.1 mm. The crop was harvested on April 15, 2018 (101
    DAS). 2.2. Soil moisture sensing methods 2.2.1. Selecting appropriate soil moisture
    sensing techniques The various techniques for soil moisture sensing include neutron
    thermalization (Chanasyk and Naeth, 1996), water content reflectometer (Chandler
    et al., 2004; Kargas and Soulis, 2019), time domain reflectometry (TDR) (Robinson
    et al., 2003; Topp et al., 1980), time domain transition (TDT) (Blonquist et al.,
    2005), electrical impedance (Cosh et al., 2005; Gaskin and Miller, 1996), frequency
    domain reflectometry (FDR) (Ojo et al., 2015), electrical capacitance (Zotarelli
    et al., 2011), and sensing using electrical resistance blocks (Cummings and Chandler
    Jr, 1941) or tensiometers (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005). Capacitance-type soil
    moisture sensors are more widely used for decision support systems in irrigated
    agriculture (Fares and Alva, 2000; Gallardo et al., 2020) due to their lower cost,
    robustness, precision, and low power and maintenance requirements (Jones et al.,
    2005; Rosenbaum et al., 2011; Spelman et al., 2013; Visconti et al., 2014). However,
    despite performing well in laboratory conditions, they may exhibit sensor-to-sensor
    variability in field conditions (Bogena et al., 2017; Rosenbaum et al., 2010;
    Spelman et al., 2013), and consequently require site-specific calibration to be
    able to provide reliable VWC measurements (Kisekka et al., 2022; Peddinti et al.,
    2020). The. The WaterScout SM100 soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies,
    Inc., Plainfield, IL, USA) was chosen as the capacitance based ‘low-cost (LC)’
    soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies, 2014) investigated in the study.
    The accuracy and operating range of SM100 are 3 % (for EC < 800 mS m−1) and 0.5
    °C–80 °C respectively (Spectrum Technologies, 2014). Laboratory calibration (with
    repacked sands and silty loams) has improved its VWC accuracy (RMSE, Raes et al.,
    2018) to between 1.63 % and 2.97 % (Adla et al., 2020). The manufacturer''s calibration
    equation (D. Kieffer, personal communication, September 5, 2018) is given below:
    (1a) (1b) where VWC is measured in %, and VR is the voltage ratio of the output
    and input voltages (Vout/Vin). The SMT100 sensor (manufactured by Umwelt-Geräte-Technik
    GmbH, Müncheberg, Germany) was chosen as the secondary standard soil moisture
    sensor (Nakra and Chaudhry, 2006) to calibrate the LC SM100 sensor (see Section
    2.4.1.2.). It is henceforth called the ''reference (Ref)'' sensor due to its superior
    sensing technology which combines the higher accuracy of a TDR system with the
    cost effectiveness of FDR sensing with an oscillating frequency of 340 Hz in air
    and 150 MHz in water (Bogena et al., 2017; Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH, 2017).
    Its accuracy for VWC and temperature are 3 % and ±0.2 °C respectively, and it
    operates within the temperature range of −40 °C–80 °C (Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH,
    2017). Sensor specific laboratory calibration with (non-soil) materials of known
    apparent dielectric permittivity can improve the VWC accuracy (RMSE) to range
    between 0.21 % and 1.30 % (Bogena et al., 2017). The manufacturer''s calibration
    equation is identical to the one proposed by (Topp et al., 1980): (2) where ɛr
    is the sensed dielectric constant. Since the only common output across both SM100
    and SMT100 sensors was VWC, the uncalibrated SM100 VWC values were calibrated
    on the SMT100 sensor''s output VWC values. Details of sensor outputs are mentioned
    in the Appendix. A short description of the sensors (along with their costs) is
    given in Table 1, with more details available in the Appendix. Table 1. Details

    for the LC capacitance sensor 2.2.2.1. Least squares estimate based regression
    Studies have calibrated capacitance-based soil moisture sensors to improve performance,
    both in laboratories (Adla et al., 2020; Bello et al., 2019; Nagahage et al.,
    2019; Placidi et al., 2021) and in the field (Rudnick et al., 2015; Singh et al.,
    2018). Most of the calibration equations reported in the literature for low-cost
    sensors are least-squares estimates (e.g., linear, logistic, hyperbolic, logarithmic,
    exponential, or polynomial). Based on a visual inspection of the data, piecewise
    linear regression, power law regression and polynomial regressions (degree 2 and
    3) were used to calibrate the LC capacitance based SM100 sensor. 2.2.2.2. Machine
    learning based regression Diverse machine learning algorithms were also applied,
    including standard algorithms for regression applications: linear regression (LR),
    support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR) and multilayer
    perceptron neural networks (MLP). LR models have been applied extensively in soil
    moisture applications (Qiu et al., 2003; Teng et al., 1993); and are still relevant
    due to their simplicity and easy interpretation (García et al., 2016; Lee et al.,
    2019). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm defines optimal hyperplanes
    in a high or infinite dimensional space which can be used for classification or
    regression (Vapnik et al., 1996). SVR has been applied in soil moisture related
    studies (Gill et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2012). The RFR algorithm
    (Breiman, 2001) is based on averaging non-correlated decision trees for variance
    reduction and avoidance of overfitting. Its simplicity in training and tuning
    has made it popular in current regression applications of soil moisture (Carranza
    et al., 2021; Qingling et al., 2019; Srivastava et al., 2021; H. Zhang et al.,
    2022). However, calibration hyperparameters can be computationally expensive due
    to its many possibilities. The MLP is an algorithm based on the typical architecture
    of a neural network, hence it is a nonlinear statistical model which has unknown
    parameters (weights) meant to be tuned to make the model fit well to training
    data using back-propagation equations in multiple hidden layers. It has also been
    applied in soil moisture applications extensively (Chai et al., 2009; Gu et al.,
    2021; Yan et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2012, p. 20). All the algorithms were applied
    using the Scikit-learn tool library (v.10.2) (Pedregosa et al., 2011) in Python
    (v.3.8.5). Hyperparameters of each algorithm were calibrated with default values
    available in Scikit-learn and evaluated with a 10-fold cross validation (CV, k
    = 10), and are listed in Table A3. This process avoided skewing results in validation
    due to random sampling in the training process. The controlling metrics were the
    coefficient of determination (R2, Raes et al., 2018) and the root mean squared
    error (RMSE). Hastie et al. (2009) and Arias-Rodriguez et al. (2021) provide detailed
    definitions and an application of all these machine learning models, respectively.
    2.3. Parsimonious crop modeling 2.3.1. Selecting a parsimonious crop model Crop
    growth models can simulate physiological processes (Chenu et al., 2009; Yin et
    al., 2003), and crop growth behavior in the field (Keating et al., 2003; Robinson
    et al., 2003; Steduto et al., 2009). Consequently, they can inform management
    decisions regarding water and nutrients and explore the feasibility of new cropping
    systems (Asseng et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2017). The more popular models used
    for simulating crop growth and yield production of wheat under different soil
    water conditions and irrigation scenarios are: APSIM (Ahmed et al., 2016; Chen
    et al., 2010), DSSAT-CERES-Wheat (Attia et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018), FAO
    AquaCrop (Iqbal et al., 2014; Toumi et al., 2016), RZWQM2 (Saseendran et al.,
    2015; Zheng et al., 2020), and SWAP (Eitzinger et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2021).
    Crop modeling environments like DSSAT and APSIM can require 211 and 292 parameter
    inputs respectively (Soltani and Sinclair, 2015). This increased complexity enables
    such models to address complex research questions (Todorovic et al., 2009), but
    also amplifies errors and uncertainties (Silva and Giller, 2020). Further, data
    intensive models with numerous inputs and parameter requirements may not be practical
    in data-scarce regions (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014; Varella et al., 2010) like the
    Majority World (Graves et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2012). The water-driven FAO
    AquaCrop model has been envisioned to balance simplicity, accuracy and robustness
    (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014). Consequently, it relies on considerably fewer and
    relatively easier to measure inputs (about 19, according to FAO, 2016; Raes, 2017).
    Nevertheless, FAO AquaCrop''s performance is comparable to data-intensive models
    (Babel et al., 2019; Quintero and Díaz, 2020; Todorovic et al., 2009). Moderate
    to good simulation results have also been reported for wheat and regions of water
    scarcity (Andarzian et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2022; Kale et al., 2018; Singh
    et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). 2.3.2. Description of the crop-water model
    FAO AquaCrop FAO AquaCrop simulates daily yield loss in response to soil water
    depletion in the root zone, based on the approach of Doorenbos and Kassam (1979).
    Four main variables are calculated consecutively and on a daily basis through
    individual equations; i.e., accumulated canopy cover (CC), daily plant transpiration,
    accumulated aboveground biomass, and accumulated final dry yield. These model
    variables are mainly interconnected by empirical factors, such as the water productivity
    (WP) and harvest index (HI), which convert transpiration to biomass and biomass
    to yield, respectively. Water productivity only incorporates plant transpiration
    to account for the confounding effect of the nonproductive consumptive water use
    (Steduto et al., 2009). Moreover, WP is normalized for atmospheric CO2 concentration
    and climate (Raes et al., 2018), and hence makes the model more robust and generalizable
    (Steduto et al., 2009). Model set-up requires user input for climate parameters,
    ''non-conservative'' (i.e., spatio-temporally variable) model parameters, and,
    where applicable, an irrigation schedule and the groundwater water table. The
    model also needs daily data on precipitation, reference evapotranspiration, and
    minimum and maximum temperature. Non-conservative model parameters relate to crop
    phenology, soil conditions, and field management practices (Raes et al., 2018;
    Steduto et al., 2012). This study used the MATLAB-based AquaCrop OpenSource (AquaCrop-OS)
    v.6.1 tool (Foster et al., 2017). 2.4. Measurement methodology An automatic weather
    station at the experimental field measured precipitation, barometric pressure,
    global solar radiation, wind speed and direction. It also recorded air temperature
    and relative humidity at two different heights (2 m and 3 m above the ground).
    These data were measured at 15-min intervals and aggregated to daily values. During
    the cropping season, the average daily temperature and relative humidity (both
    at 2 m) ranged from 9.3 °C to 30.7 °C and from 35.3 % to 93.9 %, respectively.
    Soil texture classification was conducted by the UGT Sedimat 4–12 instrument,
    which determines the particle size distribution in mineral soils based on the
    Köhn method (König et al., 2005). The observed crop growth parameters included
    phenological parameters like days to emergence, start of flowering, start of senescence
    and maturity, length of flowering (days). The observed soil related parameter
    was maximum rooting depth. The observed crop management parameter was plant population
    density. The observations used for calibrating model parameters were leaf area
    index, VWC and above ground biomass. Leaf Area Index (LAI) was measured eight
    times during the season (36, 44, 55, 59, 68, 83, 90 and 101 DAS) using the LAI-2200C
    plant canopy analyzer manufactured by LI-COR Biosciences. It was converted into
    Canopy Cover values using an empirical equation for wheat (Nielsen et al., 2012).
    Surface soil moisture was determined at the center of each plot at 15-min intervals
    by Ref. SMT100 and LC SM100 sensors installed at a depth of 5 cm below the soil
    surface (Section 2.2.1). Both datasets were aggregated to the daily time-step.
    Above ground dry biomass was measured using crop cutting experiments (Singh, 2014)
    from a representative 1 sq. m section for each plot. Additionally, water productivity
    (WPET), introduced in Section 2.5.2, was calculated using actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa) measured using microlysimeters (Kumar, 2019). Six plots were used for all
    the analyses, as they had both Ref. and LC soil moisture data, as well as the
    observations required for crop modeling. VWC measurements for both the sensors
    were available on average for 61.2 days (s = 3.0 days) out of the 100-day cropping
    season across the six plots. 2.5. Calibration methodology of low-cost soil moisture
    sensors 2.5.1. Strategy to calibrate-validate soil moisture data Capacitance based
    soil-moisture sensors have been calibrated both with repacked (Adla et al., 2020;
    Nagahage et al., 2019; Placidi et al., 2020) or undisturbed (Bello et al., 2019)
    soil samples inside the laboratory, as well as in the field (Rudnick et al., 2015;
    Singh et al., 2018). In the laboratory, calibration of soil moisture sensors is
    generally carried out either using the substantially faster ''wet-up'' or wetting
    (downward or upward infiltration, taking <1 day) or slower ''dry-down'' or drying
    (taking a few weeks) processes (Burns et al., 2014). Fig. 2 describes the overall
    study workflow, contextualizing each research question. The sensors used are displayed
    at the top-left corner of the figure. Throughout the study, the data corresponding
    to the LC SM100 and Ref. SMT100 sensors are represented in blue and green colors
    respectively. The simulations corresponding to the calibrated LC soil moisture
    sensor data are represented in a deeper blue compared to the lighter blue representing
    raw LC sensor data. The workflow related to the LC soil moisture sensor (SM100)
    calibration is illustrated in the inset \"Soil moisture sensor calibration\",
    in Fig. 2. To address RQ1, the LC sensor data were calibrated against either a
    primary standard (gravimetric water content, Section 2.4.1.1.) or a secondary
    standard (the Ref. SMT100 data, Section 2.4.1.2.) - this is mentioned in the respective
    bubbles, \"Lab Cal.\" (laboratory calibration) and \"Field Cal.\" (field calibration).
    The number of paired data points (sensor and primary/secondary standard) used
    in both calibration approaches were n = 100 and n = 65 for laboratory and field
    calibration, respectively. The following process resulted in selecting the \"best\"
    LC calibration model to be used for crop modeling (Section 2.5.2.). Download :

    of the study methodology, contextualizing the four research questions (RQs). Sensor
    details are given at the top-left corner. The \"Soil moisture sensor calibration\"
    of the LC SM100 sensor was conducted in the laboratory (\"Lab Cal.\") using gravimetrically
    determined VWC, and in the field (\"Field Cal.\") using the Ref. SMT100 sensor.
    All the developed models were then validated in the field (\"Field Val.\") to
    select the most suitable model, \"Best LCcal model\". The \"Crop model calibration\"
    either used the literature (\"Default\"), raw VWC values from both Ref. and LC
    sensors (\"RawRef\" and \"RawLC\"), or the Best LCcal model (\"Calibrated\") to
    calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters (SHPs) of the AquaCrop model. The Best
    LCcal rhombus in \"Soil moisture sensor calibration\" is a flowchart decision,
    and the \"Calibrated\" diamond in \"Crop model calibration\" is a representation
    followed in Fig. 5. 2.5.1.1. Laboratory calibration of LC SM100 sensor A previous
    study calibrating the LC SM100 sensor (Adla et al., 2020) used piece-wise linear
    regression functions (PWLFs) (Jekel, 2017, p. 20) against gravimetric VWC (primary
    standard), for four soils (number of data points, n = 400). The study calibrated
    five sensors in controlled laboratory conditions with the wet-up curve (similar
    to (Matula et al., 2016)) to account for sensor-to-sensor-variability and improve
    cost-effectiveness in terms of saved time and energy resources (Burns et al.,
    2014). This study used a subset (n = 100) of the data from Adla et al. (2020)
    which represented the soil sampled from the current study site. LC sensor values
    were calibrated against gravimetric VWC using the different algorithms described
    in Section 2.2.2. R2 and RMSE were used to quantify the calibration performance
    in all cases. 2.5.1.2. Field calibration of LC SM100 sensor Out of the six plots
    used for the study, the plot with the highest (significant) linear correlation
    between the aggregated daily values of Ref. SMT100 and LC SM100 sensor (n = 65,
    R2 = 0.76) was selected for calibration. Due to the impracticality of frequent
    gravimetric measurements and its superior sensing technology, the Ref. SMT100
    sensor was selected as a secondary standard (Section 2.2.1.). Consequently, the
    daily aggregated LC SM100 data were calibrated using the daily aggregated Ref.
    SMT100 data, using the algorithms listed in Section 2.2.2. Calibration performance
    in each case was quantified by R2 and RMSE indices. 2.5.1.3. Field validation
    of laboratory and field calibrations Each calibration algorithm developed using
    both laboratory and field data were validated on independent data from the five
    remaining plots (n = 302). The Ref. SMT100 data measurements were taken as the
    secondary standard used for validating the field data. R2 and RMSE were used as
    the performance indicators for the validation process. 2.6. Crop model calibration
    scenarios 2.6.1. AquaCrop calibration method AquaCrop guidelines recommend calibrating
    all non-conservative and non-observed model parameters sequentially, with appropriate
    objective functions (AquaCrop. Tutorials., 2016; Raes et al., 2018; Steduto et
    al., 2012). Accordingly, model simulation is sequentially improved using intermediately
    computed model variables like canopy cover (CC), volumetric water content (VWC)
    and biomass (BM) by adjusting different sets of model parameters, until the simulation
    of the harvested yield agrees, visually and statistically, with observations within
    an acceptable error range (Raes et al., 2018). In this study, eight (non-conservative)
    crop growth parameters of the AquaCrop-OS model were calibrated: phenological
    parameters (initial canopy size of the emergent seedling CCo, maximum canopy cover
    CCx, and canopy growth coefficient CGC) and soil hydraulic parameters (readily
    available water REW, saturated soil hydraulic conductivity Ksat, VWC at permanent
    wilting point θPWP, field capacity θFC and saturation θs). 2.6.2. Different calibration
    scenarios used in the study (default, raw and calibrated) The inset \"Crop model
    calibration\" in Fig. 2 illustrates the FAO AquaCrop modeling scenarios used to
    address RQs 2 to 4. Crop growth parameters (CCo, CCx, CGC) were calibrated using
    a trial-and-error method (Liang et al., 2017, Ma et al., 2020) to maximize the
    Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and minimize the RMSE between the measured
    and simulated CC values for each plot (Raes et al., 2018). The soil hydraulic
    parameters (SHPs), θWP (%), θFC (%), θs (%), Ksat (mm/day), and REW (mm), were
    also calibrated to respectively maximize and minimize r and RMSE between simulated
    and observed (Ref. SMT100) soil moisture data. Soil Hydraulic Parameter (SHP)
    calibration was conducted under the following scenarios: ● The \"Default\" scenario:
    SHPs were calibrated based on average values from the literature (Rawls and Brakensiek,
    1989; Gupta et al., 2021), corresponding to the classified soil texture (silty-loam).
    ● The \"Raw\" scenarios (for both Ref. and LC sensor): SHPs were calibrated with
    the raw (uncalibrated) LC and Ref. soil moisture sensor data using a trial-and-error
    method (Liang et al., 2017, Ma et al., 2020). ● The \"Calibrated\" scenario (only
    for LC sensor): SHPs were calibrated using the \"best\" LCcal model. The difference
    in AquaCrop model performance between the Default and RawLC scenarios would illustrate
    the advantage of using raw LC data over literature values (RQ2). The difference
    between the performance of the models calibrated in the RawLC and RawRef scenarios
    would address RQ3, indicating the relative loss in crop model performance when
    LC sensor data is used for calibration vis-à-vis reference soil moisture sensor
    data. The difference between the \"Calibrated\" (CalLC) and \"Raw\" (RawLC) model
    performances would quantify the additional impact (on crop model performance)
    of using calibrated vis-à-vis raw LC soil moisture data (RQ4). Above ground dry
    biomass (BM) simulated by AquaCrop was compared with the observed biomass, using
    the mean absolute error (MAE, Witten et al., 2011), RMSE, NRMSE (normalized RMSE,
    Raes et al., 2018), and percentage bias (PBIAS, Sorooshian et al., 1993) indicators.
    Additionally, Water Productivity (WP) was simulated for each scenario to understand
    the \"efficacy of the crop production processes in relation to their required
    water consumption\" (Van Halsema and Vincent, 2012). This study used ET Water
    Productivity or WPET, defined as the following (Van Halsema and Vincent, 2012):
    (3) where Yield is the final (simulated or observed) crop yield (kg/m2) and ETa
    (m) is the cumulative actual evapotranspiration during the cropping season. The
    simulated WPET was computed by extracting the yield and seasonal evapotranspiration
    values simulated by AquaCrop. Observed WPET was computed using the observed biomass,
    the default harvest index for wheat, and ETa estimated on the field using microlysimeters
    (Kumar, 2019). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Description of the cropping season
    Fig. 3 illustrates the seasonal evolution of the daily water demand (depicted
    by the FAO-56 reference ETo, from (Allen et al., 1998)), water supply (depicted
    by rainfall and applied irrigation during the season), and soil moisture (VWC)
    monitoring by both low-cost (LC) SM100 and reference (Ref.) SMT100 soil moisture
    sensors. The soil texture, with 15.4 % sand and 66.3 % silt, was determined to
    have silty-loam texture (USDA classification). Moreover, the soil was relatively
    homogenous in depth and the groundwater table was deep enough to prevent capillary
    rise from influencing soil moisture measurements. Download : Download high-res

    performance in the laboratory and field respectively, using R2 and RMSE as the

    equations developed using (a) lab and (b) field data. The index numbers correspond
    to Table 2. In both cases, the data used for calibration are given as points,
    and the \"Best\" model (in blue) is PWLF. During both laboratory and field calibrations,
    the performance of the machine learning algorithm Random Forest Regression (RFR)
    was quantitatively the best among all the algorithms included in the study (R2
    = 0.98 and RMSE = 1.26 % for laboratory calibration; R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 1.67
    % for field calibration). However, overfitting was observed (index 6 in Fig. 4),
    likely due to the limited tuning of the hyperparameters due to limited computational
    resources. Though RFR avoids overfitting from original decision trees (Hastie
    et al., 2009), generalization error variance decreases as more trees are added
    to the algorithm, without a change in the generalization bias. Though this study
    used the default n_estimators = 100 (Pedregosa et al., 2011), different options
    of decision trees should be examined, particularly searching for lower n_estimators
    using a GridSearch. As a consequence, the RFR-laboratory model had inadequate
    validation performance (R2 = 0.20, RMSE = 8.88 %). Moreover, the RFR-field and
    RFR-laboratory models were respectively non-monotonic and monotonically non-decreasing
    functions, implying that the calibrated LC VWC values could also decrease (or
    not increase, respectively) with increasing Ref. VWC. Both the model behaviors
    were not realistic. Consequently, the RFR algorithm was excluded from further
    analyses. The piece-wise linear regression function (PWLF) had the next best performance
    during calibration: laboratory R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 1.96 %; and field R2 = 0.76,
    RMSE = 3.13 %. Further, during both the respective validation cases, the PWLF
    performed adequately well when compared to the relative performances of the RFR
    models (PWLF-laboratory: R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 7.98 %, PWLF-field: R2 = 0.67, RMSE
    = 4.57 %). This piece-wise (segmented) behavior is also a feature of the manufacturer''s
    calibration equation which has linear and quadratic segments (Kieffer, personal
    communication, September 5, 2018). Fig. 5 shows scatter plots between measured/calibrated
    LC SM100 values and the measured Ref. SMT100 values for (a) laboratory calibration,
    (b) validation of the laboratory-calibrated PWLF model, (c) field calibration,
    and (d) validation of the field-calibrated PWLF model. Raw and calibrated data
    are represented by cyan bubbles and deep blue diamonds respectively. Some best
    practices for soil moisture sensor calibration were derived from this comparative
    analysis of calibration models, which can be more specific to capacitance-based
    sensors used in silty-loam agricultural soils: ● Field calibration of fewer sensors
    may be more robust than laboratory calibration of multiple sensors: Field calibrations
    with undisturbed soils may be more robust for field applications. The field validation
    performance (both R2 and RMSE) of laboratory-calibrated models was significantly
    poorer than field-calibrated models, supporting previous recommendations of on-site
    calibration using undisturbed soil samples (Feng and Sui, 2020). ● If field calibration
    is not possible, calibration should be done using the dry-down curve: Calibrating
    LC sensors in the laboratory using the dry-down curve rather than the wet-up curve
    leads to superior performance for field applications. The laboratory validation
    results corroborated with previous literature which claimed superior laboratory
    calibration accuracy using dry-down curves, particularly for finer textured soils
    (Burns et al., 2014). An earlier study which calibrated 3 LC SM100 sensors with
    a similar soil using the dry-down curve in the laboratory was found to have the
    best validation performance (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 %) among all laboratory calibrated
    models (Rai, 2012). Similarly, a linear dry-down calibration equation developed
    in the laboratory by Gedilu (2020) using only one LC SM100 sensor using repacked
    soil from the experimental field, also performed well (R2 = 0.61 and RMSE = 6.06
    %). These models performed better than all the laboratory models in this study
    (models 0 to 7), which were developed using the wet-up curve with five LC sensors.
    This suggests that capturing dry-down dynamics can compensate for the sensor-to-sensor
    variability even for repacked soils inside the laboratory. Further, the dry-down
    curve is more representative of the soil water dynamics during the dry non-monsoonal
    rabi cropping season in northern India, where rainfall majorly occurs during the
    monsoon kharif season (Sankararamakrishnan et al., 2008). ● Overfitting during
    calibration can lead to loss in robust application: Overfitting was observed in
    both laboratory and field RFR models, both of which performed poorly during validation.
    Machine learning models, applied to non-linear hydrological processes have had
    limitations of overfitting and reasonable justification of results (Elshorbagy
    et al., 2010). The data in this study suggest that monotonic (preferably \"gently
    sloped\") curves are more robust for soil moisture calibration. Overfitting using
    ML techniques is possibly also due to the relatively lower number of samples that
    exemplify soil moisture sensor calibration. This supports previous studies which
    mainly report linear and polynomial calibration curves (Bello et al., 2019; Deng
    et al., 2020; Gedilu, 2020; Nagahage et al., 2019; Placidi et al., 2020; Rudnick
    et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2007b, 2007a). With respect
    to research question 1 (RQ1), the PWLF model calibrated using field data was chosen
    as the \"best\" LCcal model due to the flexibility of multiple segments without
    compromising the positive correlation expected between data from two electromagnetic
    sensors in the same soil. This suggests that simpler models such as PWLF are more
    robust in calibrating LC soil moisture sensors than more sophisticated ML techniques,
    in such conditions, addressing RQ1. 3.3. Crop model calibration scenarios 3.3.1.

    DAS implies days after sowing. In the Default scenario, only crop growth parameters
    (i.e., CCo, CCx and CGC) were altered to improve the fit of the simulated CC curve
    with the observations. The SHPs which would impact the VWC curve fitting were
    chosen from (the average of) default values from literature (Table A2). CC was
    predicted very well as compared to the previous literature on AquaCrop wheat growth
    simulation, with r = 0.98 and RMSE = 5.71 % (Huang et al., 2022; Kale et al.,
    2018). These calibrated canopy growth parameters values were hence used in the
    RawRef., RawLC and CalLC scenarios, leading to nearly identical r and RMSE indicators.
    In all scenarios, the VWC simulations are compared against the observed soil moisture
    data from the reference sensor (Ref.). For the VWC simulations, the Pearson r
    values did not show significant differences across the scenarios. However, when
    the SHPs were modified based on the raw Ref. and LC sensor values, the RawRef.
    (RMSE = 5.69 %) showed a significant improvement, and RawLC (RMSE = 8.58 %) showed
    a significant deterioration, both compared to the Default scenario (RMSE = 7.76
    %). The worsening of the VWC simulation performance in the RawLC scenario in Fig.
    6 (g), which overestimated the VWCobs with a PBIAS = 46.19 %, resulted majorly
    from respectively higher VWCsim values during the drying periods leading up to
    each of the irrigation days, when compared with the Default scenario in Fig. 6
    (e), with a PBIAS = 27.74 %. This implies that the SHPs calibrated using raw LC
    soil moisture data were significantly poorer than those derived from the literature
    (Gupta et al., 2021; Rawls and Brakensiek, 1989), addressing research question
    (RQ) 2. For the VWC simulations, the Pearson r values did not show significant
    differences across the scenarios. However, when the SHPs were modified based on
    the raw Ref. and LC sensor values, the RawRef. (RMSE = 5.69 %) showed a significant
    improvement, and RawLC (RMSE = 8.58 %) showed a significant deterioration, both
    compared to the Default scenario (RMSE = 7.76 %). To answer research question
    (RQ) 2, the performances of the RAWLC and Default scenarios were compared. The
    worsening of the VWC simulation performance in the RawLC scenario in Fig. 6 (g),
    which overestimated the VWCobs with a PBIAS = 46.19 %, resulted majorly from respectively
    higher VWCsim values during the drying periods leading up to each of the irrigation
    days, when compared with the Default scenario in Fig. 6 (e), with a PBIAS = 27.74
    %. Hence, the SHPs calibrated using raw LC soil moisture data were significantly
    poorer than those derived from the literature (Gupta et al., 2021; Rawls and Brakensiek,
    1989), implying the AquaCrop models calibrated with raw data from LC soil moisture
    performed relatively poorly compared to those calibrated using the literature,
    addressing RQ2. The answer to RQ3 is that there was a significant difference between
    the VWCsim performances of the SHPs calibrated using the RawRef (RMSE = 5.7 %,
    PBIAS = 3.99 %) and RawLC (RMSE = 9.55 %, PBIAS = 46.19 %) data. This implies
    that the RawRef derived SHPs led to significantly superior VWCsim performances
    than that of the RawLC both in terms of accuracy and bias. To answer RQ4, the
    SHPs were modified using the calibrated LC soil moisture data (in the CalLC scenario).
    The CalLC scenario (RMSE = 5.9 %, PBIAS = 5.22 %) in Fig. 6 (h) significantly
    outperformed the RawLC (RMSE = 9.55 %, PBIAS = 46.19 %), nearly attaining the
    performance of RawRef (RMSE = 5.7 %, RMSE = 3.99 %). The SHPs calibrated in CalLC
    reduced the VWCsim overestimation seen in the RawLC scenario. This was corroborated
    by the seasonal water balance computations, which showed that the SHPs interacted
    to reduce the final root zone soil water storage in the CalLC scenario to 19.85
    % lower than the RAWLC scenario (but still not as low as the RawRef. scenario).
    This implies that there were significant advantages of using LC soil moisture
    data calibrated using the Ref. sensor data, to calibrate the crop model SHPs,
    which addressed RQ4. These results indicated the utility of calibrating LC sensors
    using Ref. sensors in terms of improving VWC simulation performance of AquaCrop,
    and that using raw LC sensor data would lead to poorer results than using the
    literature to calibrate SHPs. However, the overall VWC simulation performance
    was not as good as previous studies which used either cumbersome gravimetric VWC
    measurements or costly neutron probes, both of which are highly accurate in VWC
    measurement (Huang et al., 2022; Kale et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013). Nevertheless,
    it was promising to note that significant improvements were obtained in the VWC
    simulations by calibrating the LC capacitance-based sensor even against an uncalibrated,
    reference (TDR-FDR) sensor. 3.3.2. Final crop model outputs: crop model yield
    and water productivity Fig. 7 illustrates the simulated aboveground crop Water
    Productivity (WPET) for all the scenarios, as averages and standard error of the
    mean (SEM) for all the plots taken together. Table 3 also lists the MAE, RMSE
    and PBIAS for the respective biomass values. AquaCrop-OS overestimated the observed
    biomass by an average of 0.11 kg/m2, and an average RMSE of 0.145 kg/m2, and NRMSE
    of 13.41 %, which is considered to be a ''good'' simulation performance (Jamieson
    et al., 1991; Raes et al., 2018). There were no significant differences in the
    simulated BM across the five scenarios irrespective of the strength of VWC simulation,
    indicating that the FAO AquaCrop simulation of biomass relied primarily on the
    canopy curve development. Download : Download high-res image (183KB) Download

    (WPET) averaged over 5 field plots, for the 3 different AquaCrop-OS crop modeling
    scenarios (RawRef., RawLC and CalibratedLC). Error bars in all figures represent
    the SEM. However, the simulated water productivity (WPET) varied across the different
    scenarios. There was an improvement in WPET when the SHPs were calibrated using
    the raw Ref. sensor data as compared to the default literature (WPET for Def =
    1.566 ± 0.009 kg/m3, WPET for RawRef. = 1.629 ± 0.006 kg/m3), due to significantly
    lower ET in RAWRef. compared to Def. There was a non-significant change in WPET
    when raw LC sensor data were used to calibrate the SHPs: (WPET for Def = 1.566
    ± 0.009 kg/m3, WPET for RawLC = 1.564 ± 0.011 kg/m3), which corresponded to the
    non-significant differences in simulated ET (and yield) between the two scenarios.
    This implies that incorporating the raw LC SM100 sensor data to calibrate the
    SHPs was not significantly more useful compared to using the literature values,
    and did not address any water saving objectives, further highlighting the ineffectiveness
    of using raw LC soil moisture data shown in Section 3.2.1. However, when the LC
    sensors were calibrated using the Ref. sensors, there was a significant improvement
    in WPET (WPET for RawLC = 1.564 ± 0.011 kg/m3, WPET for CalLC = 1.601 ± 0.010
    kg/m3), due to the significant differences between simulated ET between both the
    scenarios. This difference of 0.037 ± 0.021 kg/m3 corresponds to water savings
    between 17,241 L and 62,500 L per kg of wheat yield produced. 3.4. Summary of
    results This section summarizes the conclusions regarding each research question.
    ● The answer to RQ1 was that simpler models are more effective than sophisticated
    machine learning (ML) algorithms in calibrating LC soil moisture against data
    from a reference soil moisture sensor, since ML techniques can lead to model overfitting
    and overall less robust results. This was based on the discussion surrounding
    Table 2, and Fig. 4, Fig. 5. ● The answer to RQ2 was that raw LC sensor data performed
    significantly poorly than literature values for parsimonious crop model calibration.
    There was no significant improvement in WPET compared to the default calibration
    case. These results were based on Fig. 6 in Section 3.3.1. However, sensor calibration
    may be difficult to implement due to the corresponding resource requirements (e.g.,
    scientific, logistical, financial, human). If the LC sensors cannot be calibrated,
    using default values from the literature for SHP calibration can save sensor costs
    without compromising crop model performance. ● The answer to RQ3 was that the
    simulated AquaCrop VWCsim output and WPET were poorer and significantly lower,
    respectively, when the raw LC soil moisture data was used to calibrate the SHPs
    (RMSE = 9.55 %, PBIAS = 46.19 %), compared to when the Reference soil moisture
    data were used (RMSE = 5.7 %, PBIAS = 3.99 %). These results were based on the
    discussion surrounding Fig. 6 in Section 3.3.1., and Section 3.3.2. ● The answer
    to RQ4 was that the effect of calibrating the raw LC soil moisture on the Reference
    sensor data significantly improved the VWCsim output of the AquaCrop model compared
    to the respective output from the raw LC data, nearly attaining the performance
    based on the Reference sensor data. Additionally, this calibration led to significant
    improvements in simulated WPET. These results are based on the discussions in
    Section 3.3.1. (Figs. 6) and 3.3.2. (Fig. 7). 3.5. Further discussion Capacitance
    based sensing is affected by environmental factors such as salinity and clay content,
    which can be measured and compensated for, to improve performance at lower frequencies
    of soil moisture sensing (Adla et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020). The SM100 sensor
    has been shown to have low sensitivity to salinity by Adla et al. (2020), and
    their recommendations of soil specific calibrations have been followed in this
    study to account for soil textural variability. Similarly, the UGT manual (Umwelt-Geräte-Technik
    GmbH, 2017) mentions that the SMT100 sensor can operate well in clayey soils,
    and has low salinity sensitivity. Hence, this study implicitly accounts for these
    environmental factors. The presence of a distinct wetting-front may also affect
    the calibration curves (Kargas et al., 2013; Young et al., 1997). While not capturing
    this phenomena is a limitation of the study, its impact on this particular application
    may have been relatively minor. The time for a wetting-front to pass the order
    of the sensor depth (∼10 cm) (Chu et al., 2018) was much smaller than the time-resolution
    of the crop model (daily) for which soil moisture measurements were used. Also,
    the horizontal placement of the sensors was more likely to ensure uniform VWC
    within the sensing volume (Kargas et al., 2013). Machine learning algorithms may
    have performed better by incorporating more data and variables (e.g., weather),
    but this was also not done to ensure comparability between the least squares and
    machine learning algorithms. The validations of the different soil moisture calibration
    models performed poorly than the recommended 3 % sensor accuracy for soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling systems (Soulis et al., 2015). However, since
    this study was aimed at analyzing the effect of sensor calibration on relevant
    crop model outputs, this was not a valid concern within this context, and would
    need further investigation. 4. Conclusions A set of best practices of calibrating
    capacitance based low-cost (LC) Spectrum SM100 soil moisture sensors was developed
    using two calibration approaches: calibrating against gravimetric water content
    in the using wet-up curve laboratory conditions, and calibrating against a TDR-FDR
    reference (Ref.) soil moisture sensor (UGT SMT100) in the field. Different least
    squares and machine learning approaches were used to calibrate the LC sensor.
    Field calibration was observed to be more robust than calibration in the laboratory.
    Calibration of the dry-down curve was found to be more accurate, and even calibrations
    using the dry-down curve in the laboratory were robust enough to perform similarly
    well as the superior field calibrations. Overfitting during calibration can lead
    to loss in robustness in the field, and hence, should be avoided. The best calibration
    model (LCcal), considering the above issues, was the field calibrated piece-wise
    linear regression function (PWLF-field). The soil hydraulic parameters (SHPs)
    of the FAO AquaCrop model were calibrated under different calibration schemes
    to understand the effect of using raw soil moisture sensor data, and the additional
    effect of calibrating the capacitance LC sensor, on model outputs. VWC estimation
    respectively improved and worsened on incorporating the Ref. and LC sensor data
    to calibrate SHPs, when compared with literature derived SHPs. However, LC data
    calibrated using the PWLF-field model resulted in nearly the same VWC simulation
    performance as the Ref. sensor. The water productivity (WPET) improved significantly
    when incorporating raw Ref. sensor data to calibrate SHPs. This was not seen when
    incorporating raw LC data, but on transforming the data using the best LCcal model,
    a significant improvement was seen in the WPET compared to both the raw and default
    scenarios. These experiments and modeling reveal that if calibration of LC sensors
    is not possible, it is preferable to use the literature to calibrate crop model
    SHPs without compromising overall model performance. However, calibrating the
    LC sensors using a higher-quality secondary standard sensor in the field may give
    rise to not only better VWC simulations by the crop model, but also significant
    improvements in water productivity and corresponding water savings at the same
    level of yield. CRediT authorship contribution statement Soham Adla: Conceptualization,

    overall field support for the experiment to be completed successfully. The Technische
    Universität München Studienqualitätskommission (SQK) 2017-18 funding was used
    to purchase the SMT100 soil moisture sensors deployed in the study. Soil testing
    for the study was conducted at the Bayerische Landesanstalt für Landwirtschaft
    (LfL), Germany. Appendix. Details on the low-cost SM100 sensor The capacitance-based
    Water Scout SM100 soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield,
    IL, USA) operates with a pair of electrodes behaving as a capacitor and the soil
    surrounding the sensor behaving as the charge storing dielectric medium (Spectrum
    Technologies, 2014). An oscillator operating at 80 MHz drives the capacitor, and
    generates an output (voltage ratio) which is proportional to the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil-water system. The sensor output (voltage ratio/raw value) is then
    converted to a VWC value using the factory calibration equation - Equation (1a),
    (1b) in the manuscript (Kieffer, 2018). The outputs of the SM100 sensor are \"Raw
    value\" (which is related to the voltage ratio of the output to the input voltage)
    and \"VWC\". Details on the reference SMT100 sensor The sensor head of the UGT
    SMT100 soil moisture sensor (manufactured by Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH, Müncheberg,
    Germany) contains the sensor electronics which emit a steep pulse traveling along
    a closed transmission line buried in the soil. However, instead of directly measuring
    the time for the pulse to return (e.g., in TDT or TDR), the pulse is inverted
    and fed back into the line driver input, resulting in an \"oscillation\" frequency
    which is a function of the soil dielectric permittivity (Bogena et al., 2017).
    Also, unlike the FDR which is based on a capacitor, the SMT100 uses a ring oscillator
    to generate the pulse and transform the travel time to frequency (Bogena et al.,
    2017; Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH, 2017). The oscillation frequency is around 340
    MHz in air and 150 MHz in water (Bogena et al., 2017). This resultant frequency
    is high enough to not be influenced by the high clay content, electrical conductivity
    or imaginary dielectric permittivity of the soil (Blonquist et al., 2005; Umwelt-Geräte-Technik
    GmbH, 2017). The outputs of SMT100 are \"Supply Voltage\", \"Count\" (which can
    be linked to apparent dielectric permittivity through an empirical model, Bogena
    et al., 2017), \"relative permittivity\", \"volumetric water content\" (computed
    using the relative permittivity, Topp et al., 1980) and \"soil temperature\".

  description: The availability of accurate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) data
    is crucial for developing decision support systems for optimal water resource
    management. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of three empirical models
    (Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestly-Taylor (PT), and Turc (TU)) and three machine
    learning models (Multiple linear regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial
    Neural Network (NN)) in estimating daily ETo compared to the Penman-Monteith FAO-56
    (PM) model. Long-term data from 42 weather stations in Florida were used. Moreover,
    the effect of ETo model selection on sweet corn irrigation water use was investigated
    by integrating simulated ETo data from empirical and ML models using the Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model at two locations (Citra
    and Homestead) in Florida. Furthermore, a linear bias correction calibration technique
    was employed to improve the performance of empirical models. Results were consistent
    in that the NN and RF models outperformed the empirical models. The empirical
    models tended to underestimate and overestimate small and high daily ETo values,
    respectively, with the HS model exhibiting the least accuracy. However, calibrated
    PT and TU models performed comparably to the ML models. Results also revealed
    that using an inappropriate ETo model could lead to over-irrigation by up to 54
    mm during a single crop season. Overall, ML models have proven reliable alternatives
    to the PM model, especially in regions with access to long-term data due to their
    site-independent performance. In areas without long-term data for ML model training
    and testing, calibrating empirical models is viable, but site-specific calibration
    is needed. It is important to highlight that distinct plant species exhibit varying
    transpiration characteristics and, consequently, have different water requirements.
    These differences play a pivotal role in shaping the overall impact of ETo models
    on crop water use.

    1. Introduction Evapotranspiration (ET) is the combined loss of water through
    evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) in the form of vapor and plays an essential
    role in linking water, energy, and carbon cycles in the land and the atmosphere
    (Fisher et al., 2008; Wang and Dickinson, 2012). Roughly two-thirds of terrestrial
    precipitation is returned to the atmosphere from the earth''s surfaces through
    ET (Oki and Kanae, 2006). Accurate measurement or estimation of ET is critical
    to understand fundamental hydrological processes at different scales and developing
    models and decision support tools that allow optimal use of water resources (Tang
    et al., 2018). Currently, ET measuring approaches include the use of lysimeters
    (Guo et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022), eddy covariance methods
    (Yang and Lei, 2022), and Bowen ratio (Bowen, 1926). However, these methods are
    time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, making measuring actual ET challenging
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011). Therefore, most water management
    decisions, such as irrigation scheduling and hydrologic modeling, rely on estimated
    reference ET (ETo) using models (Courault et al., 2005; Farahani et al., 2007).
    The earliest ETo modeling approaches primarily relied on temperature measurements
    (Farahani et al., 2007). The most widely used method for estimating reference
    ETo is the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) method (Allen et al., 1998). The PM model
    allows the calculation of ETo from weather inputs. Crop ET (ETc) is then estimated
    based on reference ETo and crop coefficient (Kc) values. This approach is widely
    used for irrigation scheduling and hydrologic modeling (Thorp et al., 2020). The
    FAO-56 PM method is recommended as the standard ETo model by the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) (Allen et al.,
    1998; Vishwakarma et al., 2022). However, the FAO-56 model is data intensive,
    requiring multiple input parameters, including solar radiation, air temperature,
    relative humidity, and wind speed, making its broader applications challenging
    (Subedi and Chávez, 2015). As a result, alternative methods with fewer data requirements,
    including Blaney-Criddle (Blaney and Criddle, 1962), Thornthwaite (Thornthwaite,
    1948), Makkink (Makkink, 1957), Turc (Turc, 1961), Priestley Taylor (Priestley
    and Taylor, 1972), Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985), have been developed.
    The Thornthwaite, Makkink, and Priestley Taylor models were proposed for humid
    climate conditions, while Hargreaves and Blaney Criddle methods were recommended
    for arid and semi-arid climates of the United States. However, the accuracy and
    reliability of all these models are affected by several factors and vary from
    region to region. As a result, ETo models need to be evaluated for their reliability
    under different climate, weather, and environmental conditions (Kang et al., 2009a,
    Kang et al., 2009b). Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have made
    it possible to estimate ETo accurately using machine learning (ML) models such
    as linear regression (R), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (NN)
    (Agrawal et al., 2022; Antonopoulos and Antonopoulos, 2017; Pirvali Beiranvand
    and Ghamghami, 2022; Küçüktopcu et al., 2023; Makwana et al., 2023; Peng et al.,
    2017; Shu et al., 2022). Studies have shown that RF is a robust method for estimating
    ET with high accuracy (da Silva Júnior et al., 2019; Douna et al., 2021; Wang
    et al., 2019), while NN has been found to perform better than other methods such
    as Priestley and Taylor and Hargreaves (Antonopoulos and Antonopoulos, 2017; Heramb
    et al., 2023; Makwana et al., 2023). However, the accuracy of ML models can be
    affected by the climatic region of the study area (Wang et al., 2019). Furthermore,
    advanced ML models like NN require expertise and a rigorous selection of parameters
    to achieve optimal performance. Within crop growth simulation and hydrologic models,
    ETo is calculated in the backend using limited ET model options. Therefore, it
    is crucial to investigate the accuracy of the ETo modeling approach used to minimize
    error propagation and bias from the ETo model to crop simulation and hydrologic
    models. This study integrated the ML ETo models into the DSSAT CSM (Decision Support
    System for Agrotechnology Transfer Cropping System Model) model by modifying the
    DSSAT''s source code. The aim of this study was twofold: first, to investigate
    the performance of three empirical [Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestly-Taylor (PT),
    and Turc (TU)] and three machine learning (ML) [Multiple linear regression (LR),
    Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (NN)] models in estimating daily
    ETo compared to the FAO-56 PM model; and second, to evaluate how the choice of
    ETo model affects irrigation scheduling and sweet corn irrigation water use using
    the DSSAT CSM. The three empirical and machine learning (ML) ETo models were chosen
    for their efficiency in estimating ETo, requiring comparatively minimal data input.
    This selection is grounded in established literature demonstrating their effectiveness
    in estimating reference ETo across diverse geographic regions. 2. Research methods
    2.1. Study area and data This study covered 42 weather stations distributed across
    Florida, USA (Fig. 1). Florida is a low-lying peninsula with a diverse topography.
    It has infertile sandy and loamy soils (Harris et al., 2010). The state holds
    significant aquifers, including the Floridan and Biscayne Aquifers, which contain
    abundant water (https://www.sfwmd.gov/science-data/gw-modeling). Florida''s climate
    is characterized by a humid subtropical zone in most of the state and a tropical
    savanna region in the southernmost part. Florida experiences a range of temperatures
    throughout the year (Florida Climate Center, 2022). In January, temperatures vary
    between 10 and 15.6 °C. In the hottest month, typically July and sometimes August,
    average temperatures hover around 27.2–28.3 °F across the state. On average, Florida
    receives more than 1300 mm of rainfall annually (Zhang et al., 2017). However,
    Florida weather stations experience considerable annual and monthly precipitation
    variations. Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Spatial distribution of FAWN weather stations in Florida and location
    of the two stations (Citra and Homestead) used for irrigation scheduling study.
    This study uses 42 weather stations that are distributed throughout Florida as
    part of the Florida Automated Weather Network (FAWN), established by the University
    of Florida (https://fawn.ifas.ufl.edu) (Fig. 1). The FAWN website offers both
    real-time and historical weather data, which are freely available for the public.
    The website provides weather data every 15 min, ensuring up-to-date information
    is accessible to users at no cost. The study used 213,650 observations from 2003
    to 2020. Calculated ETo using the FAO-56 PM model was considered as observed ETo
    due to the lack of measured data. The PM model is considered the gold standard
    model by FAO and is one of the most widely used approaches in crop simulation
    and hydrologic models (Allen et al., 1998; Vishwakarma et al., 2022). 2.2. Empirical
    modeling Daily data used in this study includes precipitation, minimum temperature
    (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), average wind speed (Ws), average dew point
    (Tdew), solar radiation (Rs), and average relative humidity (RH). Data from all
    weather stations were combined and checked for quality, such as missing values
    and outliers. Wind speed was measured at 10 m height, and 2 m wind speed values
    were estimated using the equation (Eq. 1) by Allen et al. (1998). (1) where u2
    and uz are calculated and measured wind speed at 2 and z m above ground, respectively;
    z is the height at which wind speed was measured. Days with outliers or missing
    values are not included in the analysis. The outliers were identified by calculating
    the standard deviation and discarding all data points with values more than three
    standard deviations from the mean. Such values were regarded as outliers and removed
    from further analysis. Once daily data is cleaned and checked for quality, daily
    ETo was calculated using three empirical in addition to the standard FAO-56 Penman–Monteith
    model (PM; Eq. 2). The three additional empirical ETo models include Hargreaves–Samani
    (HS; Eq. 6), Priestley-Taylor (PT; Eq. 8), and Turc (TU; Eq. 9). (2) where ETo
    is the reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), Rn is the net solar radiation
    (MJ m−2 day−1), G is the soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), T is the mean
    daily air temperature at 2 m height (°C), Δ is the slope of the saturated vapor
    pressure curve (kPa °C−1), γ is the psychometric constant (0.066 kPa °C−1), es
    and ea are saturated and actual vapor pressure (kPa), respectively, and u2 is
    the mean daily wind speed (m s−1) at 2 m height. Saturated vapor pressure (es)
    was estimated as follows: (3) The mean saturated vapor pressure (eo) at the air
    temperature T was calculated as: (4) The slope of the saturated vapor pressure
    curve Δ (kPa °C−1) was calculated using Eq. (5). (5) The Hargreaves model was
    calculated as follows (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) (6) where Tav, Tmax, and Tmin
    are average, maximum, and minimum air temperatures (°C), respectively, and Ra
    is the extraterrestrial radiation (MJm−2day−1) estimated using eq. 7. (7) where
    Gsc is the solar constant = 0.0820 MJ m−2 min−1; Dr is the inverse relative distance
    between the Earth and Sun; δ is the solar decimation (rad); φ is the latitude
    (rad); ωs is the sunset angle (rad). The Priestly and Taylor model was implemented
    using Eq. 8 (Priestley and Taylor, 1972) (8) where △ is the slope vapor pressure
    curve (kPa °C −1); Rn is the net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m −2 day −1);
    G is the soil heat flux density (MJ m −2 day −1), and it was assumed to be 0 based
    on Allen et al. (1998); γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1); The Turc model
    was used to calculate ETo using Eq. 9 (Turc, 1961) (9) where Rs (mm day-1) and
    RH (%),Tav (°C) are solar radiation, relative humidity, and average temperature,
    respectively. WRH is 1 when RH <50% and 0 when RH > 50%. 2.3. Machine learning
    Two traditional machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Multiple
    Linear Regression (LR), and one deep learning algorithm, Artificial Neural Network
    (NN), were compared against the FAO-56 PM in estimating daily ETo. These models
    were selected based on their performance in solving non-linear and complex problems
    and handling big data. 2.3.1. Multiple linear regression Multiple linear regression
    (LR) model is based on a linear relationship between one dependent variable and
    multiple independent variables. The LR model has a general mathematical expression
    as described in Eq. 10. Detailed explanation of LR modeling approach can be found
    in Özbayoğlu and Evren Özbayoğlu (2006). (10) where a and b are coefficients.
    2.3.2. Random Forest Random Forest (RF) is a type of supervised machine learning
    algorithm developed by combining several trees that, in turn, result in a combined
    power of prediction accuracy (Huang et al., 2019). During the construction of
    trees, the algorithm chooses a random variable subset, which was used to estimate
    a variable of interest (da Silva Júnior et al., 2019). Then, the prediction of
    new data will be done by aggregating the predictions made by the trees. The RF
    modeling used 600 trees with the lowest error. A detailed mathematical description
    of RF models can be found in Breiman (2001). 2.3.3. Artificial neural network
    Artificial neural network (NN) is one of the most commonly used deep learning
    models with a wide area of applications (LeCun et al., 2015). The NN model had
    three layers, i.e., input, hidden, and output layers. The input layer consists
    of a single layer with two neurons corresponding to the number of input features
    (Tav and Rs). The hidden layer consists of two hidden layers with five neurons
    each, and the output layer, the last layer of the network, contains one layer
    with one neuron for the estimated ETo. The number of hidden layers and neurons
    in each hidden layer was selected to achieve a well-performing NN algorithm without
    overfitting or underfitting. A hyperparametrization technique was used to determine
    the best batch size (15) and epoch weight (50) for improved model accuracy. 2.3.4.
    Feature selection and model training The correlation-based feature selection (CFS)
    method was employed to select input features and estimate ETo using each ML algorithm.
    Initially, seven weather parameters, including minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum
    temperature (Tmax), average temperature (Tav), wind speed (Ws), solar radiation
    (Rs), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation (PRCP) were included in the feature
    selection analysis. The analysis has shown that Rs and Tav were the most critical
    weather parameters to simulate ETo using ML algorithms. Input features were scaled
    using max-min scaling to avoid dominance due to the high-weight parameters. This
    approach scales input features to a 0–1 scale. The three ML models (NN, RF, and
    LR) used Rs and Tav as input features. The ML models were trained and tested using
    213,650 daily observations from all 42 weather stations. The dataset was split
    randomly into 70 % for the training, and the remaining 30 % was used for model
    testing/evaluation. The test data set results were used to discuss ML models''
    performance evaluations. 2.4. Simulating irrigation using the DSSAT model The
    Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT v4.8.0.027) cropping
    system model (CSM) (Hoogenboom et al., 2021) is a dynamic model that allows simulation
    of soil-plant-water relationships on a daily timestep. A calibrated CERES-Sweet
    corn model by Lizaso et al. (2007), using field experimental data from a study
    in Citra, Florida, was developed for optimal sweet corn production with an automatic
    irrigation scheduling option to meet crop water requirements. Model simulation
    with an automatic irrigation scheduling option was run for 18 years at Citra and
    Homestead, Florida sites. The study sites exhibit distinct soil characteristics,
    as outlined in Table TS1. The standard DSSAT software calculates ETo from weather
    data primarily using the Prestley Taylor or the FAO-56 PM methods. The DSSAT model
    source code was modified in FORTRAN so that estimated ETo using empirical and
    ML models could be be used for irrigation scheduling instead of the built in ETo
    models within DSSAT. Modifying the model''s source code allowed the DSSAT model
    to read the calculated ETo outside the DSSAT shell. This facilitated the evaluation
    of how uncertainties in daily ETo estimation methods tested in this study propagated
    into irrigation scheduling and seasonal agricultural water use for sweet corn
    production at the two selected sites in Citra and Homestead (Fig. 1). 2.5. Model
    calibration and evaluation To improve the performance of empirical ETo models
    in estimating daily ETo, a linear bias correction technique was employed to calibrate
    poorly performing ETo models. A similar calibration approach by Djaman et al.
    (2016) was used. Linear bias correction regression equations were developed for
    each weather station using the PM-ETo as the dependent variable and ETo from the
    empirical models as an independent variable. The calibration coefficients were
    then obtained by multiplying the slope of a regression equation by its inverse
    to bring the slope close to one and adding the opposite intercept value to get
    the intercept close to zero. A suite of model evaluation criteria such as coefficient
    of determination (r2; Eq. 11), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE; Eq.
    12), mean absolute error (MAE; Eq. 13), and root mean squared error (RMSE; Eq.
    14) was used to determine the performance of empirical and ML models in estimating
    daily ETo compared to the PM model. (11) (12) (13) (14) where Oi is observed data
    at weather stations, Si is simulated data, while Ō and S̄ are observed and simulated
    means, respectively, and n is the number of observations. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Performance of machine learning and uncalibrated empirical ETo models The
    NN and RF models had the highest r2 and NSE and the lest MAE and RMSE, while the
    HS model performed the least based on the long-term simulations using historical
    weather data (Fig. 2). However, both the NN and RF had higher r2 and NSE, the
    NN model had a slightly lower MAE and RMSE than the RF model. On the other hand,
    the HS model had the lowest r2 and NSE and the highest MAE and RMSE. Among the
    three empirical models, the performance of the PT and TU models was comparable;
    however, it should be noted that all three empirical models had very high RMSE
    values compared to the ML models. Overall, the ML models, especially NN and RF,
    performed better than the other models, including the LR, during model training
    and testing (Table 1, Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download

    strong as the other two ML models, its performance was better than the other three
    empirical models, as reflected by the high NSE coefficient and lower MAE and RMSE
    values (Table 1). Previous research reports also showed that the LR model performed
    better than the HS and TU models (Üneş et al., 2020). Overall, better performances
    of ML models over empirical methods are well documented (Kumar et al., 2002; Rahimi
    Khoob, 2008a, Rahimi Khoob, 2008b; Zanetti et al., 2007; Landeras et al., 2008;
    Ferreira et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Pirvali Beiranvand and Ghamghami, 2022;
    Chen et al., 2020). For instance, the findings of Pirvali Beiranvand and Ghamghami
    (2022) showed that ML models were more reliable than empirical models such as
    HS and TUR. According to Landeras et al. (2008), the NN model outperformed the
    HS, PT, and TU models, demonstrating its better performance. Similarly, Ferreira
    et al. (2019) concluded that the NN model exhibited higher r2 values and lower
    RMSE values when compared to the HS model. Additionally, Chen et al. (2020) found
    that the RF model performed better than the HS and PT models. For instance, Pagano
    et al. (2023) demonstrated that the RF model outperformed empirical models in
    an experimental site in Palermo, Italy, with an RMSE of 0.39 mm/day and an r2
    of 0.84. Although the performance values obtained in this study are slightly higher
    than those reported by Pagano et al. (2023), the overall trend supports the superiority
    of ML models in estimating ETo. Multiyear simulation results also revealed that
    each model performed consistently across all weather stations. This suggests that
    geographic location appears not to influence model performance (Fig. 3). However,
    a consistent issue observed with the HS, PT, and TU models is that the models
    tend to underestimate lower ETo while overestimating higher ETo values compared
    to the PM model across most weather stations (Fig. 3). Similarly, the overestimation
    issue of the HS model was reported by Antonopoulos and Antonopoulos (2017), Allen
    et al. (1998) and Rahimi Khoob (2008a), and Kumar et al. (2002). Kumar et al.
    (2002) reported an over and underestimation of the HS model by up to 37 and 20
    %, respectively, compared to the PM model. Overall, the results confirmed the
    seasonal dependency of the empirical models in accurately estimating ETo, which
    was not observed with the ML models. For example, the r2 value of HS was higher
    at the hottest months of the year (June, July, August, and September), where it
    tends to lower for the rest of the months, which are relatively colder. On the
    other hand, the RMSE of HS tends to be higher for March, May, and April and relatively
    lower for the rest of the months. Similarly, variation in performance of TU and
    PT was evident across months of the year. This indicates a seasonal variation
    in the performance of empirical models and the potential of ML models in accurately
    estimating daily ETo without seasonal bias. Download : Download high-res image

    PM model vs. other empirical and ML models at each weather station. Machine learning
    (ML) models generally resulted in more accurate estimates of ETo than empirical
    models. This improvement in estimation accuracy holds significant potential for
    simulating water balance and optimizing irrigation water management in irrigated
    fields when coupled with hydrological or crop growth models. By leveraging ML
    models, it becomes possible to enhance the precision and reliability of water-related
    simulations, thereby enabling better-informed decision-making regarding irrigation
    practices and efficient water allocation in agricultural settings. 3.2. Actual
    ET (ETc) and irrigation water use at Citra and Homestead Sweet corn planting at
    the two sites selected for irrigation scheduling using the DSSAT model occurs
    during March in Citra and November in Homestead. This resulted in different weather
    patterns after sweet corn planting (Fig. 4). Average temperature and PM ETo increased
    in Citra right after sweet corn planting, while opposite trends were observed
    in Homestead. As expected, Homestead''s average relative humidity was higher than
    Citra''s (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (452KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Measured weather characteristics in Citra and Homestead
    during corn growing seasons. Source https://fawn.ifas.ufl.edu Observed differences
    between empirical and ML models in estimating daily ETo were also reflected in
    daily actual ET (ETc) values for the two sites, as demonstrated by the DSSAT simulations
    (Fig. 5). Since the DSSAT model was developed to optimize sweet corn yield by
    applying needed irrigation water, the choice of ETo estimated by both empirical
    and machine learning models did not have a significant effect on final sweet corn
    yield (Table TS2). However, a much higher yield was observed from DSSAT modeling
    in Citra compared to the Homestead site, which could be attributed to the better
    soil properties of the Citra site than Homestead used in the DSSAT for modeling
    the yield. For example, the Citra site has 180 cm tick soil with a soil fertility
    factor of 0.92, much higher than the homestead soil, which is only 18 cm thick
    with a soil fertility factor of 0.70. The HS and TU models resulted in higher
    ETc values in Citra compared to the PM model, while results were opposite in Homestead,
    where ETc values from HS were consistently lower than the PM model (Fig. 5). In
    general, ETc from ML models showed the least seasonal variation at the two sites
    compared to ETc values based on empirical models including PM. Download : Download

    actual ET (ETc) simulated by DSSAT based on ETo inputs from empirical and ML models.
    Differences in daily ETo estimates between models were also reflected in the sweet
    corn irrigation water requirements of the two study sites. In Citra, the empirical
    model-based irrigation scheduling resulted in increased irrigation by up to 54
    mm during a single crop growing season compared to the PM model (Fig. 6). In contrast,
    the empirical models, except PT, resulted in a reduction of sweet corn irrigation
    water use in Homestead (Fig. 6). Reduction in irrigation water use from ML models
    was as high as 20 mm per season. Like the ETc estimates, sweet corn irrigation
    water use based on the ML models was very close to the PM model, except on a few
    occasions when irrigation water uses from the ML models were lower by up to 20
    mm compared to the PM model (Fig. 6). Overall, ETc and irrigation water use in
    Homestead were smaller compared to Citra (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). This could be due to
    differences in weather conditions during crop growth season in both locations
    (Fig. 4). Sweet corn cultivation in Homestead and Citra follows different planting
    periods. In Homestead, sweet corn is grown during the winter season, whereas in
    Citra, planting occurs in spring. The distinct climate and agricultural practices
    influence this difference in planting schedules in the respective regions and
    impact ETc estimates. In addition, Homestead has high relative humidity, which
    indicates a lower vapor pressure deficit in the air, which is the primary driving
    mechanism for evapotranspiration (Fig. 4). This highlights the variation in water
    use estimates among the different models and underscores the importance of selecting
    the most suitable model for accurate irrigation management. Download : Download

    of employing different ETo models on estimating total irrigation water use (mm),

    18 data points representing the seasonal irrigation water use. The lower whisker
    represents the smallest value within 1.5 times the interquartile range below the
    25th percentile, while the upper whisker represents values within 1.5 times the
    interquartile range above the 75th percentile. Values outside the lower and upper
    whiskers were considered outliers. The ML models consistently outperform empirical
    models in accurately estimating ETc, leading to reductions in water use across
    the two study areas. In contrast, empirical models yielded inconsistent results.
    Consistent with the findings of this study, previous research conducted in the
    United States and elsewhere has also highlighted the better performance of ML
    models in estimating ETc (Costa et al., 2023; Granata, 2019; Küçüktopcu et al.,
    2023; Pagano et al., 2023). This advancement is crucial for ensuring a precise
    and accurate assessment of crop water demand, as accurate estimation of ETc plays
    a vital role in the modeling process (Costa et al., 2023; Djaman et al., 2018;
    Koech and Langat, 2018). Previous studies have consistently highlighted the significance
    of ML models in enhancing water use efficiency and facilitating precision irrigation
    management. For example, research conducted in various regions, such as the Kansas
    High Plains in the United States, has shown the remarkable performance of ML models
    in capturing the intricate dynamics of water consumption in agricultural fields
    (Wei et al., 2022). In general, by accurately estimating ETc and irrigation water
    requirements, farmers and water resource managers can make informed decisions
    regarding irrigation scheduling, crop water allocation, and overall water resource
    planning (Küçüktopcu et al., 2023; Pirvali Beiranvand and Ghamghami, 2022; Wang
    et al., 2019). This, in turn, helps to mitigate the risks of over-irrigation,
    under-irrigation, and water scarcity, leading to improved crop yields, reduced
    environmental impacts, and enhanced water conservation (Ahansal et al., 2022;
    Liakos et al., 2018). Integrating ML models into agricultural water management
    practices offers substantial benefits, enabling precise estimations of ETc and
    irrigation water use. By leveraging the power of advanced computational algorithms,
    ML models provide a valuable tool for optimizing water resources and enhancing
    agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. 3.3. Calibrated empirical ETo
    models The bias correction-based calibration results of the three empirical models
    (HS, PT, and TUR) exhibited substantial improvements, with NSE values ranging
    from 0.76 to 0.97, MAE values ranging from 0.11 to 0.33, and RMSE values ranging
    from 0.15 to 0.41, as presented in Table 2. Calibrated model RMSE error values
    were reduced by 35 % for HS, while the reduction for PT and TU models was as high
    as 67 and 65 %, respectively (Table 2). Reductions in MAE for the three models
    ranged between 32 % for HS and 72 % for PT. In addition, NSE for the HS model
    showed an average improvement of 80 %. Table 2. Summary of empirical ETo models

    −69.2 −64.5 While calibration improved the performance of the HS model, it still
    had the highest RMSE and MAE values, while its NSE was still the lowest compared
    to other models. Calibration addressed the HS model overestimation issues in most
    weather stations, but the calibrated model still tends to slightly overestimate
    smaller ETo values (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (889KB)

    hand, calibration of the PT and TU models addressed observed under and overestimation
    issues of these models (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10). The results demonstrate that
    the calibrated PT and TU models exhibited comparable performance to the NN and
    RF models, as evidenced by their low MAE and RMSE values and high r2 and NSE coefficients
    (Table 2). This suggests that the calibrated PT and TU models achieved accuracy
    and precision like the NN and RF models. This also showed that calibration of
    empirical models could be an option without the data inputs needed to develop
    ML models. Calibration parameters (intercept and slope) estimated for the three
    empirical models at each weather station (Table TS3) could be applied to correct
    daily ETo estimates and achieve comparable results with the PM model (Fig. 8,
    Fig. 9, Fig. 10). This would allow users to overcome the need for additional weather
    variables for the PM model and the need for big datasets by the ML models. Generally,
    according to the evaluation criteria established by Nash and Sutcliffe (1970),
    Saleh et al. (2000), and Van Liew et al. (2007) for NSE, MAE, and RMSE values,
    the performance of the empirical ETo models can be classified as ranging from
    very good to excellent. Download : Download high-res image (712KB) Download :

    performance of the calibrated ETo models exhibited slight variations across the
    weather stations, which could be attributed to differences in the stations'' topographical
    location and climate regions. Likewise, the calibrated ETo models displayed diverse
    performance compared to the PM-ETo, depending on the region''s climate conditions.
    The PT and TU models were initially developed to suit humid climate conditions,
    while the HS model was designed for arid and semi-arid climates, as documented
    by Hargreaves and Samani (1985), Priestley and Taylor (1972), and Turc (1961).
    In the context of Florida, where the majority of the state falls within a humid
    subtropical climate zone, the HS model demonstrated the highest error rates for
    both inland and island locations, as reported by Irmak et al. (2003) and Martinez
    and Thepadia (2010). The authors explicitly highlighted that the HS model is prone
    to errors due to temperature fluctuations caused by weather shifts, wind speed
    variations, and cloud cover changes. Poor performance of the PT model was also
    reported in China''s semi-arid climate, where the PT estimation fluctuated by
    the variation in the monthly precipitation and wind speed (Xiaoying and Erda,
    2005). As observed in this study, previous studies have also demonstrated the
    effectiveness of ETo calibration approaches in improving the simulation performance
    of different empirical ETo models (Djaman et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2015; Valipour,
    2015). For example, a previous study by Valipour (2015) reported the best performance
    of calibrated PT and TU with an average r2 value of 0.98 across 181 synoptic stations
    in Iran. Using inaccurate ETo models led to significant errors when estimating
    irrigation water use. However, employing a linear regression equation developed
    between daily PM-ETo and ETo estimates shows promising results for enhancing the
    estimation performance of ETo models. This improvement in simulation accuracy
    can positively impact irrigation water efficiency and agricultural water management
    practices. By employing the calibrated linear regression equation, the ETo models
    can more accurately estimate evapotranspiration rates, leading to better-informed
    decisions regarding water usage in irrigation and agriculture. Consequently, this
    advancement could potentially optimize water resources and enhance overall sustainability
    in these sectors. 4. Conclusion This study evaluated the performance of three
    empirical models (HS, PT, and TU) and three machine learning models (LR, RF, and
    NN) for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ETo) compared to the standard
    FAO-56 PM model. Historical weather data collected from 42 weather stations distributed
    throughout Florida were used. The ML algorithms were tested to determine if they
    could serve as reliable alternatives to the empirical models or the data-intensive
    PM model. The study addressed uncertainties in estimating daily ETo among the
    empirical models. It also investigated how the choice of the ETo model affects
    sweet corn irrigation water use by modifying the source code of the DSSAT model
    to incorporate ETo estimates from empirical and ML models. In addition, the poorly
    performing empirical models were further calibrated against the PM model using
    linear regression bias correction techniques to improve their accuracy. The findings
    consistently showed that the NN and RF models outperformed the uncalibrated empirical
    models in accurately estimating daily ETo with higher r2 and NSE values of 0.97
    for both NN and RF, lower MAE values of 0.1, 0.11, and lower RMSE values of 0.14,
    0.15, respectively for NN and RF. The uncalibrated empirical models tended to
    exhibit underestimation and overestimation of daily ETo, with the HS model performing
    the poorest (r2 = 0.75). The study also demonstrated that the choice of ETo model
    could result in up to 54 mm of irrigation water wastage during a single crop season
    when using ETo-based irrigation scheduling. The findings suggest a preference
    for machine learning models, specifically NN and RF, as alternatives to the PM
    model when input parameters such as average temperature and solar radiation are
    available, even when other parameters are lacking. Calibration of the empirical
    models was found to be effective in improving their performance by reducing errors.
    Numerically, after calibration, the NSE value of HS, PT, and TU was improved by
    80.1 %, 39.9 %, and 36.6 %, MAE decreased by 31.5 %, 71.5 %, and 69.2 %, and RMSE
    decreased by 34.5 %, 66.6 %, and 64.5 %, respectively. It is worth mentioning
    that the calibrated PT and TU models showed comparable performances with the ML
    models. Therefore, when sufficient long-term data needed to train and test machine
    learning models is unavailable, calibration of empirical models could be considered.
    The findings of this study have practical implications for water resource engineers,
    irrigation managers, hydrologists, and others involved in freshwater resources
    management, aiding in the selection of appropriate ETo models for informed decision-making.

    development is facing a hotspot issue called global climate change that is being
    increasingly noticed by all sectors of society [[1], [2], [3]]. The global climate
    problem has become a common responsibility of all mankind because climate warming
    is a threat. In the past six meetings of the IPCC, it has become apparent that
    human activities are significantly contributing to and impacting climate change.
    The world must reach zero greenhouse gas emissions by halfway through the 21st
    century to prevent major harm from extreme climate change [4]. Changes in ecosystem
    structure and function will be caused by land use change, which will impact carbon
    emission and carbon sink processes [5]. Carbon storage is the amount of carbon
    retained in ecosystems. It includes four basic carbon pools [6]: Above ground
    biological carbon (carbon in all living plant material above the soil), underground
    biological carbon (carbon in the living root system of plants), soil carbon (organic
    carbon distributed in organic and mineral soils), dead organic carbon (carbon
    in litter, and carbon in dead trees standing upside down or standing). However,
    land use change has a significant impact on carbon storage [7,8]. Carbon sinks
    are processes or mechanisms by which vegetation uses photosynthesis to absorb
    atmospheric carbon dioxide and fix it in the vegetation and soil, thereby reducing
    the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The capacity of ecosystems
    to sequester carbon is reflected in carbon sinks, which is an important indicator
    [9,10]. First, arid inland river basins are often important areas for carbon cycling,
    and the study of their carbon storage can help us to better understand and quantify
    carbon cycling processes [11]. Second, the study of carbon storage in arid inland
    river basins, which are often characterized by water scarcity and land degradation,
    can help us to better assess and predict ecosystem health in these areas [12].
    The global carbon balance and climate change can be affected by changes in carbon
    storage in arid inland river basins, which are often sensitive to increased drought
    and global warming [13]. Northwest China is a difficult area for the carbon cycle
    (The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon is exchanged in the biosphere,
    lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. It encompasses a series of key processes
    and events that enable the continuation of life on Earth.) research due to its
    high aridity, low species richness, and fragile ecological environment. Assessing
    the impact of ecosystem carbon storage on spatial differentiation will help protect
    ecosystems in inland river basins in arid zones [14]. The field sampling method
    is currently the primary method for estimating ecosystem carbon storage [15],
    the ecosystem carbon flux (Carbon dioxide transfer from one carbon pool to another
    per unit area per unit time in the carbon cycle.) monitoring method [16], and
    the model estimation method [17]. The field sampling method is based on manual
    sampling and estimates regional ecosystem carbon storage by actual sampling samples.
    This method is relatively simple in technology, but it has a large workload and
    a long data sampling period, so it is not suitable for use in regions with significant
    land use changes [18]. The ecosystem carbon flux monitoring method uses modern
    measurement technology to estimate regional carbon storage, which has high accuracy
    but has high instrument requirements and high cost. Compared with the previous
    two methods, the model estimation method can estimate regional ecosystem carbon
    storage more quickly and clearly show the space and time arrangement and change
    traits of Carbon storage at various regional levels [19]. In the model estimation
    methods, many studies combined with the GLO-PEM model [20,21], CASA model [22,23],
    and Bookkeeping model [24], to determine how much carbon is stored in the area.
    The InVEST model is a popular choice for carbon cycle studies, because it is easy
    to calculate and has low data requirements. Numerous researchers have studied
    the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of regional carbon storage
    using this model from various perspectives over the last few years. From the perspective
    of urbanization, Hwang et al. [25] evaluated how carbon storage is affected by
    the establishment of environmental protected areas in the context of megacity
    expansion. Their findings indicate that the establishment of environmentally protected
    areas in megacities leads to an increase in regional carbon sinks. The model was
    used by Lyu et al. [26] to examine and predict the guides of urbanization on carbon
    storage in Shizuishan City, an arid region in Northwest China. Compact urban growth
    patterns and environmental protection will reduce the negative impact of urbanization
    on carbon storage, as has been discovered. From the point of view of ecological
    preservation, Wu et al. [27] researched the main factors that contribute to forest
    carbon storage in areas covered by forest protection programs and estimated it
    in 17 administrative regions of China. In terms of research scale, the influences
    of land use type conversion and management of vegetation to soil carbon storage
    were examined by Lai et al. [28]. Their research revealed that carbon storage
    was significantly impacted by land use management. The PLUS and InVEST models
    were employed by Zhang et al. [29] to analyze carbon storage in ecosystems in
    Jiangsu Province, China. Different scenarios were used to predict the connection
    between carbon storage and land use change. Their findings indicated that areas
    with rapid economic and urbanization development experienced greater carbon storage
    losses. The Shiyang River Basin (SRB)''s carbon sinks and carbon sources (Carbon
    sources refer to processes, activities or mechanisms in the carbon pool that release
    carbon to the atmosphere, such as deforestation, coal combustion for electricity
    generation, and other processes.) transitions were analyzed by Zhou et al. [11]
    through spatial and temporal dynamics. Their findings suggest that oasis-desert
    transition zones are highly vulnerable to carbon storage loss. The InVEST model
    is commonly used in studies to estimate carbon storage, but the InVEST model''s
    lack of temporal resolution is a problem, and the dynamic changes in carbon storage
    were not significant. Correcting carbon storage, which is estimated by the InVEST
    model was not considered by most scholars because it simplifies the cycle, so
    by considering the carbon sink during vegetation growth, the accuracy of carbon
    storage estimation can be improved. The ecological zoning of SRB is typical for
    “alpine-oasis-desert”. This characteristic has a significant impact on how humans
    use and exploit natural resources. The central oasis areas of Yumen City and Guazhou
    County, even though the land use type of SRB is mostly undeveloped, possess strong
    ecological resilience and potential for development. Agriculture irrigation and
    resettlement measures have been implemented since 1996, and the land uses and
    carbon storage have undergone significant changes in the oasis area in the central
    part of SRB. The carbon storage was calculated and revised using MODIS NPP data
    and the soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) model simultaneously. Finally, the
    OPGD is used to find how natural and anthropogenic factors are affecting carbon
    storage. The primary research goals of this paper are (1) to explore the spatio-temporal
    distribution characteristics of carbon storage alterations due to irrigated agriculture
    and resettlement measures in Yumen City and Guazhou County in the middle SRB,
    (2) to explore the main impacts of agricultural irrigation and resettlement measures
    on the project area, and (3) to explore the drivers of spatial differentiation
    of carbon storage in Yumen City and Guazhou County. 2. Study area SRB is one of
    the three inland river basins in the Hexi region of China and at the westernmost
    point of China''s Hexi Corridor. In terms of administrative divisions, the Shule
    River flows through Tianjun County of Qinghai Province, Subei County, Yumen City,
    Guazhou County, and Dunhuang City of Gansu Province, and finally enters Ruoqiang
    County of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with a total drainage area of 1.03
    × 105 km2. The basin is 830–5738 m above sea level, and the overall terrain is
    high from north to south and relatively gentle in the middle. The basin is a continental
    arid desert climate, rich in light and heat resources, long frost-free period,
    less precipitation, evaporation, annual average precipitation between 46 and 64
    mm, annual evaporation of 2894–3043 mm, annual average temperature of 6.7–8.9
    °C. The basin is dominated by low vegetation coverage, and the spatial distribution
    difference is large, mainly concentrated in Yumen City and Guazhou County Hexi
    corridor oasis agroecological area. This oasis agro-ecological area is the main
    irrigated agricultural area of SRB with a concentration of migrant population.
    Therefore, in the following sections, we focus on the carbon storage in this area

    use data used in this paper are derived from the 1990–2020 China Land Cover Annual
    Dataset (CLUD), with a spatial resolution of 30 × 30 m. The data are used to analyze
    the land use in China [30]. In this paper, the land use data of SRB from 2000
    to 2020 are obtained by cropping, and the land use types include cropland, forest,
    grassland, water area, unused land, and construction land. The NPP (Net Primary
    Production) data were derived from MOD17A3HGF NPP data published by LP DACC with
    a spatial resolution of 500 m. The NPP data were used as a basis for the development
    of the NPP data. The meteorological data were obtained from the National Earth
    System Science Data Center (http://www.geodata.cn) with a spatial resolution of
    1 km, and were cropped and projected to obtain the annual mean temperature, annual
    precipitation, and annual potential evapotranspiration for SRB for the years 2000–2020.
    The digital elevation model (DEM) was obtained from the United States Geological
    Survey (https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/HYDRO1K) with a spatial resolution of 90 m. The
    slope as well as the direction of SRB was obtained using the Slope and Slope Direction
    tool in ArcGIS 10.8. Population density data were obtained from WorldPop (http://www.worldpop.org.uk),
    which mainly utilizes Landsat remote sensing imagery to identify residential areas,
    and then uses census and other data to generate regional population raster data
    using Random Forest Estimation with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The GDP spatial
    distribution data were obtained from the Resource and Environmental Sciences and
    Data Center (https://www.resdc.cn/Default.aspx) with a spatial resolution of 1
    km. The NDVI data were obtained from the MOD13A3 dataset (https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search),
    which is a month-by-month NDVI data, and the maximum synthesis method was used
    to obtain year-by-year NDVI data from 2000 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of
    1 km. SRB boundary data were obtained from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center
    (https://data.tpdc.ac.cn). The administrative division data were obtained from
    the National Geomatics Center of China (http://www.ngcc.cn). Projection and resampling
    of all spatial data, the new projection system being the Albers projection, and
    the resolution is 1 km. This step can reduce regional distortion and maintain
    data consistency. After reviewing the relevant literature, the carbon density
    (Carbon storage per unit area) data was corrected [6,31,32]. SRB''s climate conditions
    were utilized to obtain the final carbon density values for every land use type
    [33,34]. The demographic statistics for Yumen City and Guazhou County are from
    the China County Statistical Yearbook. The project''s basic data were obtained
    from relevant government websites information and study reports on SRB agricultural
    irrigation and resettlement practices (http://xbkfs.ndrc.gov.cn/ldzc, http://www.gsdrc.gov.cn).

    central SRB has been estimated using a framework presented in this study (Fig.
    2). The framework consists of two main parts: estimation and modification of carbon
    storage in the Yumen City and Guazhou County agricultural irrigation and migration
    area in the central part of the SRB, and the analysis of its drivers using the

    Fig. 2. Research framework. 3.2.1. Carbon storage estimation and carbon density
    coefficient correction The carbon storage in SRB was calculated by using the InVEST
    model in this paper. This model has four basic carbon pools. As follows is the
    calculation formula [6]: (1) where Ctotal is the total carbon storage. Cabove
    is the amount of carbon stored above the ground. Cbelow is the amount of carbon
    stored under the ground. Csoil is soil carbon storage. Cdead is dead organic carbon
    storage. This study''s carbon density data is based on research findings related
    to the country and climate zone with SRB. Adjusting carbon density values is necessary
    due to variations in soil properties and land use. Average annual precipitation
    influences soil and biomass carbon density through a formula described by Alam
    et al. [35]. Mean annual temperature and biomass carbon density were correlated
    using equations improved by Giardina et al. [33] and Chen et al. [34]. As follows
    is the calculation formula [33,34]: (2) (3) (4) where CSP is soil carbon density,
    CBP and CBT are biomass carbon densities, P is average annual precipitation and
    T is average annual temperature. Substituting precipitation and temperature for
    SRB and the whole country into the above equation (2000–2020, average annual temperature
    of the whole country and SRB is 9.58 °C and 8.8 °C, respectively, and annual precipitation
    of the whole country and SRB is 673.9 mm and 63 mm), carbon density in SRB is
    corrected by the ratio of the two. As follows is the calculation formula [33,34]:
    (5) (6) (7) (8) where KBP and KBT are the correction coefficients of precipitation
    factor and temperature factor of biomass carbon density. C′ and C″ are carbon
    density data for SRB and the country. KB and KS are the correction coefficients
    of biomass carbon density and soil carbon density. From calculation (2), (3),
    (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), it follows that the value of KBP is 0.037, KBT is 0.967,
    KB is 0.036 and KS is 0.669. Building on existing references [31,32,36], the corrected
    carbon density data of SRB is obtained by multiplying the carbon density correction
    coefficient with the national carbon density value (Table 2). Table 2. Carbon
    density in the area of study. Landuse type Cabove/(t·hm−2) Cbelow/(t·hm−2) Csoil/(t·hm−2)

    0.33 0 14.47 0 3.2.2. Net ecosystem productivity estimation model The strength
    of carbon sources and sinks is often measured by NEP [37]. The NEP can be got
    by subtracting soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) from NPP without taking into
    account other natural conditions. As follows is the calculation formula [37]:
    (9) － Soil heterotrophic respiration is greatly influenced by both temperature
    and precipitation. Pan et al. [38] used temperature, precipitation, and soil heterotrophic
    respiration models to calculate carbon sinks in arid regions. The study area''s
    location in the semi-arid zone resulted in its model being used for estimation.
    As follows is the calculation formula [38]: (10) where T is average annual temperature
    and P is average annual precipitation. 3.2.3. Trend analysis In this paper, a
    single linear regression analysis method [39] was used to perform linear regression
    on pixel-by-pixel carbon storage and NEP respectively. Next, we analyzed the trend
    of its carbon storage and NEP. As follows is the calculation formula [39]: (11)
    where slope indicates the slope of the trend line, n is the length of the time
    series, i is the chronological order, Ci is the value of carbon storage in the
    year i, NEP, and modified carbon storage pixel. 3.2.4. The OPGD model The detection
    of spatial divergence and the identification of its drivers can be achieved through
    the use of geodetector, a statistical method [40]. However, traditional geodetector
    is highly subjective. Discrete continuous variables yield similar spatial distributions
    between the two variables when the independent variable has a significant impact
    on the dependent variable. The optimal size of spatially stratified heterogeneity
    will be affected due to this. Geographic features and spatial variables can be
    used by the OPGD to extract more information during the parameter optimization
    modeling process. It is versatile enough to be applied to many types of spatial
    data for global and regional spatial analysis [41]. The OPGD is used to examine
    how spatial differentiation affects carbon storage in SRB. We apply several classification
    methods in R. And the classification level is 3–9. For spatial discretization,
    the combination of parameters with the highest q value is selected. The extent
    of interaction and whether there is an interaction between two factors can be
    determined by calculating the one-factor q value and the two-factor interaction
    q value. As follows is the calculation formula [40]: (12) (13) (14) － where the
    factor''s explanatory power is expressed through q, which ranges from 0 to 1,
    and the higher the number, the stronger its power. The explanatory variable is
    stratified in h. The variance of layer h and whole region Y values is represented
    by σh2 and σ2. SSW and SST can be employed to represent the total variance of
    the entire region and the sum of intra-layer variance. 4. Results 4.1. Agricultural
    irrigated land and immigration status Agriculture irrigation and resettlement
    measures have been implemented since 1996. The operating period of the immigration
    measures is 10 years, and the later period is the stable period of agricultural
    irrigation and the implementation effect of immigration. The central oasis area
    around Yumen City and Guazhou County had the highest growth in agricultural irrigated
    farmland area between 2000 and 2010 (Fig. 3), while the area of grassland around
    Yumen City also increased correspondingly. From 2010 to 2020, scattered parts
    of grassland in Yumen City and Guazhou County were converted into agricultural
    irrigated land. The distribution of grassland around Yumen City remained unchanged,
    and most of the other areas were unused. The areas in the red boxes are areas
    of high variability in land-use types. Download : Download high-res image (462KB)

    Township, Chijin Township, and Qingquan Township. In Yumen City and Guazhou County,
    between 2000 and 2010, the shift in land use type was dominated by the change
    of unused land to grassland (Fig. 4a), the change area was 9.00 × 104 hm2 (Table
    3). The area that was converted from unused land to cropland was 1.34 × 104 hm2,
    and the area that was converted from grassland to cropland was 2.36 × 104 hm2.
    However, the change area from cropland to grassland was 0.74 × 104 hm2 (Table
    3). From 2010 to 2020, the amount of unused land transfer declined, while the
    amount of grassland transfer increased significantly (Fig. 4b). Among them, the
    change area of unused land to cropland was 0.60 × 104 hm2, the change area of
    grassland to cropland was 2.63 × 104 hm2, the change area of grassland to unused
    land reached 3.47 × 104 hm2, and the change area of unused land to grassland was
    3.27 × 104 hm2 (Table 4). Among them, the net increase of cropland was about 5.41
    × 104 hm2, and the net increase of grassland was about 4.12 × 104 hm2. Download

    of the central oasis area in Yumen City and Guazhou County has shown obvious fluctuation
    characteristics since the implementation of the immigration policy (Fig. 5). Between
    2000 and 2010, there was a fluctuating upward trend for the population, followed
    by a downward trend in 2010. In 2012, the population peaked at about 3.14 × 105,
    a net increase of about 3.30 × 104 compared to 2000. The agricultural population
    showed a rapidly rising trend from 2000 to 2012, reaching a peak of about 2.19
    × 105 in 2012, and maintaining a relatively stable level from 2012 to 2020. Compared
    with 2000, the net increase of agricultural population was about 9.80 × 104. Download

    in Yumen City and Guazhou County The calculations from the carbon storage module
    of the InVEST model were imported into Origin software to visualize the results
    (Fig. 6). The central oasis region is where high carbon storage areas are concentrated.
    Carbon storage in the central oasis areas of Yumen City and Guazhou County follows
    a pattern of change that involves first increasing and then stabilizing. The regional
    storage of carbon underwent a significant growth trend from 2000 to 2010. After
    2008, the trend of increase slowed down, reaching its highest value in 2013, approximately
    1.631 × 108 t, and then maintaining a relatively stable level. The average annual
    carbon storage in 20a is about 1.552 × 108 t. Download : Download high-res image

    middle, with Huangzhawan Township, Liuhe Township, and Hedong Township as the
    main areas (Fig. 7ⅲ); carbon storage in the east is highly valued, with Liuhu
    Township and Xiaojinwan Township being the primary areas (Fig. 7ⅳ). The remaining
    areas with high carbon storage show a decentralized spatial pattern. In most areas,
    cropland and grassland have high carbon storage. The land that was not used had
    a less effective carbon storage capacity and was mostly distributed on the northern
    and southern sides of the central oasis area. From 2000 to 2010, carbon storage
    increased mainly in the western region dominated by Guazhou Township, and in the
    central region dominated by Huangzhawan Township. From 2010 to 2020, carbon storage
    increased mainly in the eastern region of Liuhu Township and Xiaojinwan Township

    spatial changes of NEP in Yumen City and Guazhou County The NEP values were calculated
    by (9), (10). Then the spatial statistics were carried out in ArcGIS, and finally,
    the spatial statistics results were imported into Origin software to visualize
    the results (Fig. 8). During 2000–2020, the trend of change showed an upward trend
    in the total amount of NEP in the study area. The mean NEP in 20a is about 1.78
    × 105 t. The maximum amount of NEP in 2019 was 2.24 × 105 t. The minimum value
    was 1.29 × 105 t in 2001. Although the total amount of NEP shows an overall increasing
    trend, the change is not stable enough, and the annual fluctuation is large. The

    in the MOD17A3HGF raw data have a value of No data. 4.4. Temporal and spatial
    changes of carbon storage after modification in Yumen City and Guazhou County
    The modified carbon storage values were spatially counted using ArcGIS, and then
    the spatial statistics were imported into Origin software to visualize the results
    (Fig. 10). Based on the annual NEP amount in the study area, the calculation result
    of the InVEST model was revised. Because the total amount of NEP is smaller than
    that of carbon storage, the change trend and numerical representation of the result
    after carbon storage revision have a general change trend compared with that before
    revision. The modified carbon storage has a different spatial and temporal distribution.
    The modified carbon storage in the central oasis region of Yumen City and Guazhou
    County still showed a change characteristic of “first increasing and then stable\",
    which showed an increasing trend in general. The trend of carbon storage increased
    significantly from 2000 to 2010, and reached the highest value in 2013, about
    1.625 × 108 t. After 2008, the increase trend slowed down. Download : Download

    distribution on the whole (Fig. 11). Regarding the trend of spatial variation,
    carbon storage has mainly increased after modification. The modified high carbon
    storage areas are concentrated in the central and eastern parts (Fig. 11). In
    2010 and 2020, the carbon storage of Huangzhawang Township, Xiaoxihao Township,
    and Chijin Township showed an obvious high-value area (Fig. 11ⅲ–11ⅳ). An increase
    in cropland area in the central oasis of Yumen City has resulted in an increase
    in carbon storage. High carbon storage is also present in Jinwan Township located

    Determination of optimal parameters of driving factors In this paper, nine influence
    factors including elevation (X1), slope (X2), aspect (X3), temperature (X4), vegetation
    (X5), population (X6), GDP (X7), potential evapotranspiration (X8) and precipitation
    (X9). The optimal parameter results show that different discretization methods
    and the choice of different intervals will make the q values of drivers different.
    Specifically, elevation (X1) has a maximum q value at an equal interval classification
    of 7 (Fig. 12a); slope (X2) has a maximum q value at a standard deviation classification
    of 9 (Fig. 12b); aspect (X3) has a maximum q value at a standard deviation classification
    of 9 (Fig. 12c); temperature (X4) has a maximum q value at a natural breaks classification
    of 9 (Fig. 12d); vegetation (X5) has a maximum q value at a standard deviation
    classification of 9 (Fig. 12e); population (X6) has a maximum q value at a natural
    breaks classification of 8 (Fig. 12f); GDP (X7) has a maximum q value at a quantile
    classification of 6 (Fig. 12g); potential evapotranspiration (X8) has a maximum
    q value at an equal interval classification of 7 (Fig. 12h); and precipitation
    (X9) has a maximum q value at an equal interval classification of 9 (Fig. 12i).
    From the above optimal discretization results, the discretization of the driving

    (natural), equal interval (equal), and geometrical interval (geometric) are five
    spatial data classification methods in ArcGIS. The OPGD model optimally discretizes
    the driving factors in the study, and (a)–(i) are the discretization results for
    different driving factors, with the value of the horizontal axis is the number
    of discretization intervals and the value of the vertical axis is the q value.
    4.5.2. Factor detection and interactive detection The q value is obtained from
    (12), (13), (14). The single-factor detection results (Table 5) reveal that each
    factor has a prominent impact on spatial distribution characteristics of carbon
    storage in the study area. Vegetation is the most significant factor in explaining
    the spatial differentiation in carbon storage among natural factors. Elevation,
    potential evapotranspiration, and precipitation have a slightly weaker ability
    to explain spatial differentiation in carbon storage. The natural factor with
    the weakest explanatory power for spatial differentiation is aspect. GDP is the
    most significant contributor to the spatial differentiation among the anthropogenic
    factors, while Population is the least significant. Table 5. q value of driving

    0.381 0.349 0.055 0.204 The interaction test revealed that the interaction between
    the two factors was greater than the effect of the single factor (Fig. 13). Double-factor
    enhancement and nonlinear enhancement were the main characteristics of the interactions
    among the factors. Nonlinear enhancement is observed when X1, X2, X3, X4, and
    X6 interact with X3, X4, X6, X7, X8, and X9. This suggests that the influence
    of factors on the spatial distribution of carbon storage can be greatly enhanced
    by specific combinations. The main interaction between vegetation and other factors
    involved double-factor enhancement, which had an effect on carbon storage spatial
    differentiation that exceeded 69 %. According to the results, the main factor
    that influences the spatial distribution characteristics of carbon storage in
    Yumen City and Guazhou County is the interaction between vegetation and other
    factors. From the perspective of time change, the interaction between population,
    GDP and vegetation has significantly increased from 2000 to 2020, and the interaction
    between other natural factors and vegetation has also greatly increased (Fig.
    13a–c). Each factor''s explanatory power for the spatial differentiation of carbon
    storage is enhanced by the interaction between natural and anthropogenic factors.

    InVEST model is not without its limitations in studying carbon storage changes
    in long-term ecosystems. The model relies on land use type changes to get changes
    in carbon storage. Secondly, this model ignores the carbon sink in the vegetation
    growth process, which leads to a certain deviation between the actual carbon storage
    and the estimated carbon storage. Using NEP to modify the InVEST model estimates
    can improve the accuracy of carbon storage estimates to some extent. Based on
    this, NEP was used to quantify the carbon sink during vegetation growth to correct
    the carbon storage in the central oasis area in Yumen City and Guazhou County.
    Ren et al. [32] obtained carbon density for Gansu Province only by correcting
    the national carbon density data. The impact of land use change on carbon storage
    was assessed by them. By correcting carbon storage using NEP, this paper offers
    a new approach to improve carbon storage estimation accuracy. This paper extends
    the temporal resolution of the study area simultaneously. The spatial and temporal
    changes in regional carbon storage become more clearly characterized due to the
    improved temporal resolution. 5.2. The main impacts of agricultural irrigation
    and resettlement measures on the project area The carbon cycle in terrestrial
    vegetation can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using NEP, making
    it an important index to characterize regional carbon sources and sinks. 2000–2020,
    the total amount of NEP in Yumen City and Guazhou County showed an upward trend
    on the whole, and the carbon sink capacity was significantly changed. This is
    similar to the results of Li et al. [42] who argue that the increase in precipitation
    delays the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) peak, which makes semi-arid grassland
    ecosystems behave as carbon sinks in the carbon cycle. NEP''s trend will be directly
    influenced by changes in soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and NPP. The response
    of Rh and NPP to temperature and precipitation was examined by Naidu et al. [43].
    According to their findings, precipitation is the primary factor influencing the
    change in soil heterotrophic respiration when the climate is warming. Since the
    implementation of agricultural irrigation and resettlement measures in SRB, the
    cultivated land area and grassland cover area in Yumen and Guazhou Oasis have
    increased significantly, which makes the regional ecosystem NPP show a significant
    increasing trend. Although precipitation and temperature increased, the amplitude
    of soil heterotrophic respiration did not change much during this period, indicating
    an overall increasing trend in regional NEP. The spatio-temporal evolution and
    drivers of carbon storage in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) were analyzed by Gao
    et al. [44]. The YRD has seen a significant loss of carbon storage due to population
    growth and urbanization, according to their findings. Different from the above
    studies, the focus of this study is on the changes in carbon storage in the oasis
    region of the Middle SRB over time, considering agricultural irrigation and resettlement
    measures. The central oasis region of SRB experienced a significant increase in
    carbon storage due to the increase in cropland and grassland area from 2000 to
    2020, as shown by the results. Since the implementation of the agriculture irrigation
    and resettlement measures in 1996, the population of Yumen City and Guazhou County
    at the end of the year showed a trend of fluctuation and decline after reaching
    a peak in 2012, but the agricultural population showed an upward trend, with a
    net increase of about 98,000. The migrating population is predominantly agricultural,
    and the region''s carbon storage has increased because of the expansion of cropland
    and grassland areas. Following the implementation of measures like returning pastures
    to grasslands, the Government has adopted projects to improve irrigation area
    support facilities and conserve water. The ecological environment has been improved
    by these projects. Nie et al.''s findings are similar to this. The impact of land
    use change on carbon storage under different scenarios was assessed by Nie et
    al. [14] by combining the CLUMondo and InVEST models. They discovered that under
    the natural growth scenario, carbon storage in urban development zones would decrease,
    while that in agricultural production areas and key ecological functional areas
    would increase. From the ecological point of view, the migration and agricultural
    irrigation measures not only did not reduce the regional carbon storage but increased
    it to a certain extent. The promotion of regional economic development from a
    social and economic perspective is greatly influenced by migration and irrigated
    agriculture measures. Population migration increased the agricultural population
    in Yumen City and Guazhou County. Agricultural irrigation projects greatly increased
    the cultivated land area, and agricultural crop yields increased to varying degrees
    (Fig. 14). Among them, grain output and oil-crop output showed an upward trend,
    but the fluctuation range was large. Cotton production is at a relatively stable
    level. Although meat production is low, it is on the increase trend in general,
    from 0.74 × 104 t in 2000 to 1.78 × 104 t in 2020. The area used to grow feed
    crops has significantly increased due to the increase in cropland. In the primary
    sector, the industrial model is gradually changing from traditional agriculture
    to a combination of agriculture and livestock husbandry. The growth value of the
    primary industry increased from 4.15 × 104 million yuan in 2000 to 3.79 × 105
    million yuan in 2020 (Fig. 14). The agricultural population''s growth has been
    a significant factor in the development of the primary industry in the study area.
    Moreover, the per capita disposable income of the rural population in Yumen City
    and Guazhou County increased significantly in 2020, from 0.66 × 104 yuan in 2000
    to 3.93 × 104 yuan in 2020. Rural residents have seen a significant increase in
    their standard of living and quality of life, which is reflected in their per
    capita disposable income. Therefore, resettlement and agricultural irrigation
    measures not only increased the carbon storage in Yumen City and Guazhou County,
    but also played a big role in promoting the advancement of its primary industry
    and improving the living conditions of rural residents. Download : Download high-res

    County Statistical Yearbook. 5.3. Spatial drivers Yumen City and Guazhou County''s
    oasis area in the central area have been detected by single-factor detection,
    which shows that vegetation, potential evapotranspiration, and precipitation are
    the main driving factors. Unexpectedly, this paper finds that the single-factor
    detection results of GDP and population are relatively small, which is different
    from the results of Li et al. [45] and Xiang et al. [46]. Because the population
    in the study area is concentrated in the population gathering area such as the
    county seat and the land type of this part of the region is mainly construction
    land, and the rest of the agricultural population is scattered in various regions
    by township. Population dispersion and sparseness are the main characteristics
    of population distribution in northwest China. Thus, in agricultural irrigation,
    fewer people are needed to manage a large portion of the cultivated area. Because
    Worldpop is the source of population density data used in this paper [47]. The
    data set was produced taking into account the number of administrative unit population
    and night light intensity, and the night light intensity of Yumen City and Guazhou
    County is very low, so the population density of this area appears low on the
    grid. The low explanatory power of population density for the spatial differentiation
    of carbon storage in single-factor detection results could be due to these factors.
    Under certain combination conditions, the spatial distribution of carbon storage
    can be greatly enhanced by the influence of both anthropogenic and natural factors,
    as revealed by the results of interaction detection. This indicates that the central
    oasis area of Yumen City and Guazhou County has spatial distinctions in carbon
    storage as the result of the joint action of natural and socio-economic factors.
    Although the single-factor explanatory power of human factors is weak, it has
    high explanatory power in the interaction, indicating that agricultural irrigation
    and resettlement projects greatly increase carbon storage in the central oasis
    region. 5.4. Limitation and prospect This paper is set in the context of SRB''s
    agricultural irrigation and migration measures. The results of the InVEST model
    are corrected by using NEP. The accuracy of carbon storage estimation is improved
    to some extent. In addition, OPGD was used to discretely optimize the continuous
    variable factors and to more objectively analyze the impact of each driver on
    the spatial differentiation of carbon storage. Nevertheless, there are some uncertainties
    in this paper. First, the InVEST model fails to account for the many factors that
    influence the carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis rates and soil microbial activity.
    Secondly, the potential impact of water resource factors on carbon storage in
    oasis regions is not considered in this paper, because the distribution of water
    resources will cause changes in vegetation, which will indirectly cause changes
    in carbon storage, and such changes are difficult to measure. Finally, the exploration
    of factors that affect carbon storage will be affected by the distribution of
    population density, because compared with the population concentration area in
    the southeast of China, the population distribution in the semi-arid area is scattered
    and the migration rate is high. Therefore, higher spatial and temporal resolution
    population density data will be utilized in future studies, and the effects of
    the introduction of water resources on vegetation growth and distribution will
    be considered, which will better improve the accuracy of carbon storage estimation.
    Overall, the use of the NEP modification method can improve the accuracy of carbon
    storage estimation in the study area. Meanwhile, the introduction of the OPGD
    model to determine the optimal parameters of driving factors has better analytical
    results compared to the traditional GD model. Moreover, in terms of spatial and
    temporal distribution, the carbon storage in the study area showed an elevated
    trend in the context of agricultural irrigation and migration measures. This is
    contrary to the conclusion in most current studies that human activities have
    led to a decline in ecosystem carbon storage, which provides a new perspective
    for similar studies. Finally, research on carbon storage in arid inland river
    basins will be an important part of overall ecological conservation and will help
    to provide a reference for the formulation of ecological conservation policies
    in arid areas. In future studies, exploring the coordinated relationship between
    human social development and ecological preservation and finding a balance between
    them will be an issue worth pondering. 6. Conclusion Taking into account the agriculture
    irrigation and resettlement measures, the central oasis area around Yumen City
    and Guazhou County is the focus of this paper. The InVEST model was used to estimate
    regional carbon storage using land use data, and the results were adjusted by
    using NEP. Finally, the OPGD was utilized to evaluate the factors that contribute
    to the spatial heterogeneity in carbon storage in the central oasis areas of Yumen
    City and Guazhou County. Here are the main findings. (1) 2000–2020, the net growth
    of cropland area and grassland area in Yumen City and Guazhou County is about
    5.41 × 104 hm2 and 4.12 × 104 hm2. The net increase in population was approximately
    9.80 × 104 people. Carbon storage increased from 1.421 × 108 t in 2000 to 1.596
    × 108 t in 2020. Cumulative carbon storage increased by 1.75 × 107 t. The central
    and eastern regions are the main locations for high carbon storage, while some
    areas in the north and south are low carbon storage areas. (2) 2000–2020, the
    NEP trend in the study area''s central oasis area fluctuated upwards. Average
    annual NEP was 1.78 × 105 t, and the cumulative increase of carbon sink was 0.95
    × 105 t. Significant differences exist in the spatial distribution of NEP, with
    higher levels in the east and lower levels in the west and south. (3) The OPGD
    indicates that there are significant variations in the effects of various drivers
    on the spatial differentiation of carbon storage. Vegetation, elevation, potential
    evapotranspiration, and precipitation are the main driving factors. The explanatory
    power of spatial differentiation of carbon storage is enhanced when natural and
    anthropogenic factors interact. In particular, the interaction between vegetation
    and anthropogenic factors is greater than the role of anthropogenic single factors.
    (4) Agricultural irrigation and resettlement measures did not cause a decline
    in ecosystem carbon storage in Yumen City and Guazhou County in the central part
    of SRB. Conversely, the increase in cropland has led to an increase in carbon
    storage in the ecosystems of the region. The standard of living of agricultural
    settlers has improved to some extent. (5) NEP modification method can improve
    the accuracy of carbon storage estimation. The introduction of the OPGD model
    to determine the optimal parameters of driving factors has better analytical results
    compared to the traditional GD model. This study provides a new perspective for
    carbon storage estimation as a whole, and provides a reference basis for the formulation
    of ecological protection policies. Funding This work was supported by the National

  description: Knowledge of the yield components of wine grapevines is essential to
    achieve target production and effectively design vineyard management. Therefore,
    it is necessary to map and analyze the factors that control the yield components
    to optimize wine production and profitability. The objective of this study was
    to identify the ranked effects of environmental and agrotechnical factors (e.g.,
    meteorological, physiological, vegetative, and irrigation) on grapevine yield,
    number of clusters, and cluster weight, and to quantify their patterns. To achieve
    this objective, a multi-experiment database was used, assembling data collected
    during four long-term irrigation experiments including different varieties and
    diverse climatic regions across Israel. First, a paired analysis of the yield
    components was conducted to define the relationships among them. Then, prediction
    models for the three variables (i.e., yield components) were designed using the
    support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to explore the ranked effects and patterns
    of the controlling factors. Validation was conducted using a test set, consisting
    of 20 % of the dataset. The relationships between yield and cluster weight (0
    < r < 0.73) and between yield and the number of clusters were always positive
    (0.67 < r < 0.77), while negative relationships were found between cluster weight
    and number of clusters (-0.61 < r < 0). The accuracy of the prediction models
    was high, with mean absolute errors (normalized to the range) ranging between
    4.1 % and 8.11 %. The most dominant factors affecting yield components were cumulative
    leaf area index, accumulated growing degree days (GDD), cumulative irrigation,
    and evapotranspiration. Leaf area showed an optimum point, below and above which
    the values of the yield components decrease; GDD negatively affected yield and
    cluster weight but had a positive effect on the number of clusters; irrigation
    was positively associated with yield components but leveled out above 348–395
    mm per season. Reference evapotranspiration had a negative effect on yield and
    cluster weight, and a generally positive effect on the number of clusters. Utilizing
    data from multiple experiments and applying multivariate analysis, allow to define
    general patterns of relationships and interactions between controlling factors
    and yield components. Extracting this knowledge from the data and managing the
    growing amounts of information can be achieved through complex modeling and the
    implementation of standard protocols for data collection and monitoring.

    were analyzed. • Relationships among the yield components were defined. • A machine
    learning algorithm was applied to generated regression models. • Effects of environmental
    and irrigation factors on yield components were quantified. Abstract Knowledge
    of the yield components of wine grapevines is essential to achieve target production

    vector machine 1. Introduction Yield components of grapevines refer to the factors
    that contribute to the total yield of grape production, such as the number of
    clusters, cluster weight, berry size, number of berries per cluster, and more.
    These components as well as the potential quality of grapes are the main drivers
    for vineyard production revenue (Van Leeuwen et al., 2019). Accordingly, yield
    and its components have been studied for decades, motivated by the inclination
    to optimize wine production and profitability. There is a constant decreasing
    trend in the area available for vineyard cultivation worldwide (Ohana-Levi and
    Netzer, 2023; OIV, 2021). This reduction underlines the need to pursue more information
    and broaden the knowledge domains regarding yield components for achieving more
    efficient viticulture practices and desirable products as well as continuously
    increasing the effectiveness of field management. Agronomical field studies on
    Vitis vinifera during the past decades have been documenting a standard set of
    yield components that are regularly measured and analyzed. These include crop
    yield, number of clusters per vine, cluster weight, berry weight, and number of
    berries per cluster (e.g., Baeza et al. 2007, Chaves et al. 2007, Intrigliolo
    and Castel 2008, Keller et al. 2016, Munitz et al. 2016, Netzer et al. 2022, Vilanova
    et al. 2019, Williams 2012). Understanding the driving forces of yield components
    and their patterns can assist growers in mitigating the impact of these factors
    and adapting to various conditions. Information-based decision making of field
    management and accurate practices for yield optimization can advance long-term
    sustainability of grape and wine production and the economic viability of vineyards
    (Azorín and García, 2020). Multiple studies have dealt with various factors that
    affect yield components. These factors are typically classified into categories
    and include environmental effects, such as meteorological conditions (e.g., temperature,
    precipitation, evapotranspiration, etc.) (Camps and Ramos, 2012; González-Fernández
    et al., 2020), vineyard terrain characteristics (Bahat et al., 2021; Ohana-Levi
    et al., 2022c), and soil properties (Ohana-Levi et al., 2019); vine performance
    indicators such as vegetative growth (Smart, 1985) and physiological conditions
    (Munitz et al., 2020); and agrotechnical practices such as irrigation strategies
    (Intrigliolo and Castel, 2010a; McClymont et al., 2012; Munitz et al., 2016),
    pruning methods (Morgani et al., 2023; Netzer et al., 2022), pest control (Reineke
    and Thiéry, 2016), and many more. The common approach in grapevine research is
    to study the impact of each of these factors or paired factors on yield components,
    which provides narrow conclusions regarding the causes and effects. However, these
    factors do not act independently; they interactively influence yield components
    along with other influencers or indicators. Furthermore, most published studies
    on grapevine response to various factors included datasets from one or two plots,
    making the study specific to a site and variety. During the past few years, efforts
    have been made to utilize complex modeling techniques to analyze multivariate
    effects on grapevine yield components (Ohana-Levi et al., 2019; Sirsat et al.,
    2019), mostly using remote sensing products and computer vision (Arab et al.,
    2021; Taylor et al., 2023). These studies often apply machine learning (ML) algorithms
    to generate the models when large, multidimensional datasets are considered (Barriguinha
    et al., 2022; Ohana-Levi et al., 2022c). Studying multiple plots with different
    varieties, climatic conditions, and agricultural practices provides an opportunity
    to utilize highly variable data to compose generalized models for analyzing yield
    components response to various factors. Such comprehensive modeling is designed
    to improve the profiling of these selected factors according to their ranked effects,
    interactions, and patterns. Very few studies have focused on characterizing the
    patterns of affecting factors against yield components using ground measurements
    along with meteorological data. This present study suggests a novel method to
    quantify and characterize these effects. The main objective was to comprehensively
    identify the ranked effects and patterns of various environmental and agrotechnical
    factors on grapevine yield components (i.e., yield weight, number of clusters,
    and cluster weight). This study focused on three specific objectives: 1. Defining
    the characteristics of the three yield components according to their respective
    field experiment and quantifying the relationships between these components; 2.
    Constructing prediction models for the four yield components (i.e., yield, number
    of clusters, and cluster weight) based on various meteorological, physiological,
    and vegetative factors; and 3. Characterizing the ranked effects and patterns
    of these predictors on the yield components. 2. Methodology 2.1. Experimental
    sites The current study utilized datasets collected from four long-term experiments,
    located within commercial vineyards, all named after the nearby villages: Hulda,
    Kida, Merav, and Tal-Shachar (Table 1, Fig. 1). The experimental plots were all
    characterized by a Mediterranean climate, with warm, dry summers and precipitation
    occurring typically between October and April and insignificant amounts of precipitation
    during the growing season. The data were collected as part of irrigation experiments
    that were conducted during multiple timeframes and followed different objectives
    (see Section 2.2 for detail). This multi-experiment database attempted to represent
    various characteristics of wine grapevines, such as different climatic regimes
    (Fig. 1, Table 1); distinguished varieties (two red varieties – Vitis vinifera
    L. cv. ‘Merlot’ and ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ - and two white varieties – Vitis vinifera
    L. cv. ‘Sauvignon Blanc’ and ‘Emerald Riesling’); and diverse yield targets (i.e.,
    premium vineyard vs. high-yield targets). Table 1. A short summary of the experimental

    2.2. Field experiments 2.2.1. The experimental design The four experiments included
    in this study are summarized in Table 2. They all followed a spatially-balanced
    complete block (SBCB) design (van Es et al., 2007), as illustrated in Fig. 1b.
    Each experiment was assigned different irrigation treatments, replicated four
    times, where each block consisted of three rows with 16 vines. The middle row
    in each block comprised of 12 measurement vines, while two vines at each end were
    considered buffer vines, and two outer rows (16 vines per row) in each block being
    border rows to avoid border effects among treatments (Munitz et al., 2020, 2016;
    Ohana-Levi et al., 2022c). In every experiment, each irrigation treatment was
    applied to the same measurement vines and border rows throughout the experiment
    period, i.e. 48 vines per replicate (Netzer et al., 2022). All experiment plots
    were located within commercial vineyards, with identical plant density (1.5 m
    spacing between vines and 3 m between rows). The irrigation was managed according
    to the research objectives of each experiment, but all other agrotechnical practices
    (e.g., pest and canopy management, fertilization, pruning, etc.) were conducted
    according to agricultural practices applied to the commercial vineyard. The grapevines
    in all vineyards were trained onto a two-wire vertical trellis. All experiments
    used drip irrigation systems with in-line 16 / 20 mm pressure-compensated 1.6
    / 2.4 L h−1 UniRam drippers. Irrigation control units (Talgil Computing & Control
    Ltd., Haifa, Israel) were utilized to irrigate the various irrigation treatments
    in each experiment. Table 2. Descriptive statistics of the target variables and

    dedicated to studying the effects of different irrigation strategies on grapevine
    physiological, vegetative, and reproductive performances. In all case studies,
    the technique used to determine the irrigation amounts was to calculate a predefined
    portion (i.e., irrigation coefficient) of crop evapotranspiration (ETc). ETc is
    defined as the amount of water consumed by the plant under standard conditions,
    where the plant is disease-free, has optimal soil-water content, and is well-fertilized
    (Allen et al., 1998). Over the years, multiple methods of assessing ETc were developed
    (e.g., Allen et al. 1998, Munitz et al. 2019, Ohana-Levi et al. 2022a, 2020b),
    and each experiment detailed hereinafter used a different approach. 2.2.2. Hulda
    (‘Merlot’) The Hulda experiment took place between 2009 and 2012. Appropriate
    data records were available for seasons 2011–2012. This experiment took place
    in a commercial Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Merlot’ vineyard, planted in 1998 with
    a North-South row direction. The irrigation experiment included three sustained
    deficit irrigation (SDI) treatments, which received irrigation coefficients of
    20 %, 35 %, and 50 % of calculated ETc, and two regulated deficit irrigation (RDI)
    treatments: one with irrigation coefficients of 0 %, 20 %, and 50 % during phenological
    stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively; and a second with coefficients of 50 %, 20 %,
    and 20 % during these stages. ETc was calculated using a typical seasonal curve
    of the crop coefficient (Kc) (Netzer et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2003), according
    to calculated reference evapotranspiration (ETo) values using the Penman-Monteith
    equation from meteorological data (Allen et al., 1998). Irrigation was applied
    twice a week. For further detail regarding this experiment, please refer to Munitz
    et al. (2016). 2.2.3. Kida (‘Cabernet sauvignon’) The Kida experiment was conducted
    between 2014 and 2019 (six years) in a commercial vineyard planted in 2007 with
    Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’. The row orientation of the vines was
    East-West. The irrigation experiment was focused on the initiation of irrigation
    during the season, while each treatment was irrigated when stem water potential
    (SWP) dropped below a predefined threshold: −0.6 MPa, −0.8 MPa, −1.0 MPa, and
    −1.2 MPa, and the control treatment was irrigated since budbreak. Irrigation amounts
    were calculated for irrigation coefficients of 40 %, 15 %, and 10 % during phenological
    stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. ETc was calculated using an empirical formula
    defining the LAI-Kc relationship (Munitz et al., 2019). Further detail on the
    Kida experiment may be found in Munitz et al. (2020). 2.2.4. Merav (‘Sauvignon
    blanc’) The experiment in Merav (Gilboa Mountain region) was conducted between
    2017 and 2022. This Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Sauvignon Blanc’ vineyard was planted
    in 2009 with a South-East - North-West row orientation. The irrigation treatments
    in this experiment included SDI of low, medium, and high irrigation amounts (irrigation
    coefficients of 30 %, 45 %, and 60 %, respectively). Two additional RDI treatments
    were included, the first with irrigation coefficients of 30 % during phenological
    stages 1 and 2, and 60 % during stage 3; and the second applying 60 % during Stage
    1, and 30 % during stages 2 and 3. ETc was calculated following the LAI-Kc relationship
    formula developed by Munitz et al. (2019). Further detail about the experiment
    can be found in Ohana-Levi et al. (2022b). 2.2.5. Tal-Shachar (‘Emerald riesling’)
    The Tal-Shachar experiment involved using three different irrigation models as
    treatments, applied across four blocks. The experiment was conducted in a Vitis
    vinifera L. cv. ‘Emerald Riesling’ vineyard, planted in 2010 with an East-West
    row orientation and was conducted between 2020 and 2022. The three irrigation
    models were: (a) ETc calculated using the LAI-Kc empirical formula (Munitz et
    al., 2019); (b) ETc calculated using a machine-learning algorithm with meteorological
    data as input (Ohana-Levi et al., 2022a, 2020b); and (c) irrigation amounts quantified
    based on available soil water derived from profile soil sensors. The latter model''s
    irrigation scheduling was define according to the current level of soil water
    content within an allowable depletion level (ADL), in order to keep enough readily
    available water for root intake (DFM Software Solutions cc, 2016; Myburgh, 2018),
    similar to previous works that used soil water content measurements to calculate
    irrigation amounts for vines (Ortega-Farias et al., 2004). The soil probes used
    for monitoring soil water content were Dirk Friedhelm Mercker capacitance probes
    (DFM Software Solutions, South Africa) (Myeni et al., 2021), measuring 6 depths
    of the soil profile between 0 and 80 cm, every 10 cm. For models (a) and (b) the
    irrigation coefficient throughout the growing season was set to 50 % of estimated
    ETc. 2.3. Data collection and feature engineering For all experiments, data were
    collected during varying timeframes. These data included field measurements (yield
    components, plant physiological and vegetative conditions, and irrigation), and
    meteorological records from nearby local stations. A summary of descriptive statistics
    for each yield components and features measured in the field and from the meteorological
    stations is available in Table 2. 2.3.1. Field data In each experiment plot, sample
    vines were numbered and tagged at the beginning of the experiment and sampled
    during each growing season and at harvest every year. The data composing the entire
    dataset were based on the same 60 vines in each experiment from which the physiological
    and vegetative data were collected. Phenology: ln each experiment, during each
    growing season, the dates of budbreak and harvest were recorded. The calculations
    of all features, aside from precipitation, were conducted within the timeframe
    between budbreak and harvest. Yield and its components: The target variables yield
    (ton/ha), number of clusters per vine, and cluster weight (g) were measured for
    12 vines per repetition (e.g., treatment and block) at the end of each growing
    season. Physiological and vegetative components: Phenological stages (i.e., budbreak,
    flowering, bunch closure, veraison, and harvest, following Ohana-Levi et al. (2020a)
    and Munitz et al. (2019) were documented for each experiment plot, each year.
    SWP and LAI were measured for three predefined vines per repetition each week
    (total of 60 vines per experiment), the day before irrigation was applied, to
    represent the most stressful physiological condition of the vines. For analysis
    purposes, the lowest value of SWP of each sampled vine in each season was considered,
    representing the strongest drought stress of the season, usually occurring prior
    to harvest. LAI values were interpolated to represent daily values, assuming that
    vegetative growth is a linear process (Ohana-Levi et al., 2022b, 2020a), and then
    accumulated for the entire season (between budbreak and harvest) to generate a
    single value per season, representing vegetative growth (Bréda, 2003; Ohana-Levi
    et al., 2020a) that incorporates the changed in LAI throughout the season (e.g.,
    pruning, hedging, shoot removal) and differences among plots and seasons (e.g.,
    varieties, management practices of different growers). SWP may be related to yield
    and its components, as the drought stress of the grapevine are somewhat negatively
    linked to its reproductive growth (Bahat et al., 2021; Williams and Araujo, 2002).
    LAI is a well-established indicator of grapevine yield (Ohana-Levi et al., 2022b;
    Smith and Kliewer, 1984; Sun et al., 2017) Irrigation practices: The various irrigation
    practices were represented by irrigation amounts (mm), accumulated during the
    growing season (between budbreak and harvest). Each grapevine in every experiment
    was assigned a cumulative irrigation value for each season, according to its respective
    treatment. Irrigation is one of the common practices used for adjusting and modifying
    grapevine yield and quality (Junquera et al., 2012). Soil water availability during
    the growing season is crucial to vine performance, allowing to modify yield and
    wine composition (Intrigliolo and Castel, 2010a; Scholasch and Rienth, 2019).
    It is therefore an important feature to include in the model. 2.3.2. Meteorological
    data records The meteorological data was collected from official meteorological
    stations near the experiment plots. The stations were located 1.5 km, 50 m (within
    the vineyard), 4.5 km, and 3.25 km from the Hulda, Kida, Merav, and Tal-Shachar
    plots, respectively. All stations had identical measurement equipment, and details
    regarding the sensors can be found in Ohana-Levi et al. (2020b). The data collected
    included five meteorological variables, at an hourly temporal resolution: temperature
    ( °C), relative humidity (%), solar radiation (MJ/m2), wind speed (m/sec), and
    precipitation (mm). The measured meteorological variables were used to compute
    the following meteorological features: Seasonal mean values of temperature, wind
    speed, and relative humidity using data collected during the entire growing season,
    from budbreak to harvest. Additionally, the mean seasonal vapor pressure deficit
    (VPD, kPa) was calculated, denoting the difference between saturated air and actual
    vapor pressure. It is associated with plant conditions and stomatal photosynthetic
    activity (Grossiord et al., 2020) and was shown to affect water stress in vines
    (Williams and Baeza, 2007). The mean seasonal VPD was considered in this study.
    Seasonal accumulated values of radiation, ETo, GDD, and precipitation were calculated
    as the sum of values for the entire growing season, from budbreak to harvest.
    Daily ETo values were calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation, and the values
    were summed for the entire season to represent the evaporative demand in each
    experiment plot during each growing season. Accumulated growing degree days (
    °CGDD)(base 10 °C) is a measure of plant growth and development according to temperature
    starting from budbreak. The daily GDD is calculated as ten subtracted from the
    average daily temperature, and the accumulated GDD is computed by summing the
    daily values. This feature may provide an indication of plant phenology and water
    stress (Ohana-Levi et al., 2022d; Taylor et al., 2009). GDD was calculated from
    budbreak until harvest of each season. Two precipitation features were derived.
    The total precipitation was the sum of precipitation accumulated between October
    and April (entire rainy season); and spring precipitation was computed using the
    sum of values recorded during March and April. All computations and manipulations
    made on the field and meteorological data was conducted using R (R Core Team,
    2021). 2.3.3. Feature selection The final features included in the model were
    determined after ensuring that no multicollinearity was present in the dataset.
    The relationships among the features were examined using a correlation matrix
    and the variance inflation factor (VIF) to ensure that collinearity does not affect
    the estimation precision (Fox and Monette, 1992). Ideally, all features should
    have VIF values lower than 10 (Stine, 1995). These procedures were applied using
    the “corrplot” (Wei and Simko, 2021) and “car” (Fox and Weisberg, 2019) packages
    in R. 2.4. Relationships among yield components The associations among the three
    yield components (e.g., yield, number of clusters, and cluster weight) and between
    experiments, were quantified using several statistical measures. These included
    histograms of each yield component for each experiment to understand the ranges
    and frequencies; density plots to visualize and compare the distributions; scatter
    plots for each pair of yield components to illustrate their relationships; boxplots
    that denote the median, range, interquartile range, and outliers; and Pearson
    correlation coefficients, ranging between −1 and 1, describing the strength and
    direction of the paired relationships among the yield components. The latter analysis
    was conducted for each experiment and for the entire dataset. 2.5. Relationships
    among the features and yield components The linear associations between the features
    and yield components were computed using Pearson correlation and illustrated in
    a correlation matrix. This visualization was conducted using the “corrplot” package
    in R (Wei and Simko, 2021). 2.6. Prediction models for the yield components The
    twelve features detailed in Section 2.3 and Table 2 were assessed for their contribution
    to grapevine performance, targeted at yield, number of clusters, and cluster weight
    (specific objective 3). The support vector regression (SVR) algorithm was used
    to generate three regression models for the yield components. SVR is a supervised
    learning algorithm that uses a cost function to determine the best parameters
    of the hyperplane, attempting to maximize the margin between the hyperplane and
    the data points while minimizing the prediction errors (Boser et al., 1992; Noble,
    2006). Additionally, SVR is well-suited for high-dimensional datasets and can
    handle relatively small datasets (Ramón et al., 2005). SVR and support vector
    machine (SVM) are used extensively for agricultural applications (Kok et al.,
    2021), typically for analyzing data collected in irrigation experiments (Shen
    et al., 2021), including those conducted on grapevines (Zhai et al., 2020). Hence,
    it was found compatible for the dataset at issue and was selected for modeling
    the yield components (using SVR). The SVR model was applied using a radial basis
    (gaussian) kernel with hyperparameters that reduce overfitting and preserve higher
    accuracy, including sigma inverse kernel width = 0.1, epsilon = 0.1, and cost
    of constraints C = 2. The algorithm was applied using the “e1071” (Meyer et al.,
    2022) and “rminer” (Cortez, 2020) packages, along with other supporting packages,
    including “dplyr” (Wickham et al., 2022) and “reshape2” (Wickham, 2007) in R.
    The algorithm results may be analyzed to formulate the patterns and directions
    of influence that the features have on the target variables. Two computed products
    were derived from the SVM model for each target variable, detailed hereinafter.
    Relative contribution: Extracted from the fitted SVR model, and is defined as
    the amount of variance in the target variable that can be attributed to any specific
    feature (Tonidandel and LeBreton, 2011) while controlling for the other features
    in the model. This information was extracted using the sensitivity analysis (SA)
    method (Cortez and Embrechts, 2013), which is employed by querying the fitted
    models using sensitivity samples and documenting the responses without relying
    on the information gathered during the fitting procedure. In this study, the one-dimensional
    sensitivity analysis method was used, when only one input is changed at a time
    and the others are left at their average values. Defining and analyzing the relative
    contribution of various features on yield components may assist with decision
    making regarding crop management (Chen et al., 2016), such as prioritizing and
    allocating resources according to the impact of certain processes on grapevine
    performance. Partial dependence plots (PDP): Graphical illustrations of the functional
    relationships between an individual feature to the fitted model while holding
    the other features constant (Cutler et al., 2007; Hastie et al., 2001). The PDPs
    indicate the direction of influence, and can identify non-linear relationships,
    thus explaining the pattern of effects of specific factors on the target variables
    (Dutta et al., 2020). This knowledge is valuable for optimizing agricultural practices
    to improve productivity and efficiency. PDPs are being used to study various effects
    of environmental and agricultural conditions on grapevine status and performance
    (Ohana-Levi et al., 2022c; Simhayov et al., 2023). The PDPs were extracted using
    the R package “pdp” (Greenwell, 2017) and visualization was carried out using
    the “ggplot2” (Wickham, 2016) package in R. 2.7. Prediction model validation and
    accuracy assessment Validation tests were carried out to ensure the reliability
    of the SVM models (specific objective 2). The performance of the model was evaluated
    by using a test set. The entire dataset included a sample size of 901 (i.e., yield
    components values with corresponding predictors values), from which 20 % were
    set aside. For each target variable, the model was then trained using the training
    set (consisting of 80 % of the data). Prediction was then carried out on the test
    set using the selected features for the model. The measured values of the target
    variables in the test set were compared to the fitted values generated by the
    SVM model, and the model performance was evaluated by computing the following
    statistics: Correlation (r) between the predicted and test values. The values
    of r range between −1 and 1, with values further from zero denoting a stronger
    association. Values approaching 1 denote a perfect compatibility between the fitted
    values and the test set. t-test (t): A parametric test designed to compare the
    means of the two variables (fitted vs. measured). The test calculates a t-value,
    measuring the difference between the means relative to the variability of the
    data. The output of the t-test also includes a p-value, denoting the significance
    of the difference between the means. A difference with p > 0.05 implies that the
    mean of the fitted values is overall similar to that of the measured values, indicating
    a good model performance. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (D): A non-parametric test designed
    to compare distributions of two vectors. The D statistic measures the distance
    between the two distributions, with a corresponding p-value defining the level
    of significance of the difference. A difference with p > 0.05 implies that the
    distributions of the fitted and the measured values are similar, indicating a
    good model performance. Mean absolute error (MAE): Measures the average differences
    between the fitted and measured values. The higher the value, the higher the dissimilarity
    between the fitted and measured values. The MAE was also normalized to the range
    of the measured values, providing the error in percentage. Root mean square error
    (RMSE): Measures the average differences between the fitted and measured values,
    with higher values denoting higher dissimilarities. RMSE is more sensitive to
    extreme values than MAE because it squares the differences between the fitted
    and measured values, thus penalizing larger errors more heavily and providing
    a stricter metric. The RMSE was also normalized to the range of the measured values,
    providing the error in percentage. The statistical metrics were computed using
    the “Metrics” package in R (Hamner and Frasco, 2018). 3. Results 3.1. Relationships
    among yield components The associations between the three yield components were
    quantified and summarized in Fig. 2. The results show large differences in yield
    components among the datasets of the different experiments, with Tal-Shachar (‘Emerald
    Riesling’) having the largest values of yield and cluster weight, and Kida (‘Cabernet
    Sauvignon’) having the lowest. Furthermore, the level of association between the
    yield components varied between experiments. Yield and number of clusters were
    found to have the strongest association in the Tal-Shachar (‘Emerald Riesling’)
    dataset (r = 0.77), and the lowest in Kida (‘Cabernet Sauvignon’) (r = 0.67).
    Yield and cluster weight were found to have the highest association in Kida (‘Cabernet
    Sauvignon’) (r = 0.73), and none in Tal-Shachar (‘Emerald Riesling’) (r=−0.02),
    with a general correlation of r = 0.8. The relationship between number of clusters
    and cluster weight was weak and negative in general, with a higher association
    in Tal-Shachar (‘Emerald Riesling’) (r=−0.61) and much lower values for the other
    datasets (r ranging between 0.03 and −0.29). Download : Download high-res image

    Relationship among features The linear relationships among the selected features
    and between the features and the yield components are illustrated in Fig. 3. Among
    the features, the strongest linear association was found between total precipitation
    and spring precipitation (r = 0.65). The highest correlation coefficients were
    found for the yield components between yield and cluster weight and seasonal ETo
    (r=−0.58, r=−0.69), and number of clusters was found to have the highest association
    with cumulative LAI (r = 0.52). Download : Download high-res image (685KB) Download

    pressure deficit, seasonal reference evapotranspiration, minimum midday stem water
    potential, cumulative leaf are index, cumulative irrigation, accumulated growing
    degree days, total precipitation, spring precipitation, yield, number of clusters,
    and cluster weight. 3.3. Model results – relative contribution and patterns of
    the predictors The feature selection procedure resulted in the elimination of
    mean relative humidity (multicollinear with VPD, r=−0.94) and solar radiation
    sum (multicollinear with accumulated GDD, r = 0.8, and cumulative ETo, r = 0.77),
    after the filtering out of these features resulted in VIF < 10 for the remaining
    features. The four experimental datasets were used to conduct the SVM regression
    models for the target variables of yield, number of clusters, and cluster weight.
    The validation results are reported in Table 3, showing that for the yield and
    cluster weight models, the correlation was strong between the fitted and measure
    values (r = 0.94 and r = 0.95, respectively), with low MAE (5.22 % and 4.1 % normalized
    to the range) and RMSE values (6.9 % and 6.3 % normalized to the range) compared
    to those of number of clusters (r = 0.72, and normalized MAE and RMSE of 8.11
    % and 11.64 %, respectively). The t and D metrics were all associated with p-values
    higher than 0.05, signifying similarities between the means and distributions
    of the fitted and measured values. Table 3. Validation measures for the predictions

    of the model features was derived for each SVM model, and the outputs are reported
    in Fig. 4. For the yield and number of clusters models (Fig. 4a,b), cumulative
    LAI was found to be the highest contributing factor, and for cluster weight it
    was accumulated GDD (Fig. 4c). ETo was the second most influencing feature for
    the number of clusters and cluster weight models. Cumulative irrigation was ranked
    third or fourth for the yield, and cluster weight models, while rated eighth for
    the number of clusters model. Download : Download high-res image (489KB) Download

    value of midday stem water potential (f); mean vapor pressure deficit between
    budbreak and harvest (g); Mean temperature between budbreak and harvest (h); reference
    evapotranspiration (i); and spring precipitation (j). For the yield SVM model,
    the cumulative leaf area index pattern (Fig. 5a) showed an optimum point, below
    and above which yield decreases. Increasing accumulated GDD (Fig. 5b) was associated
    with gradual decrease in yield. Increase in cumulative irrigation (Fig. 5c) was
    found to increase yield, however the effect leveled out above 394 mm. Higher total
    precipitation values were also associated with increased yield (Fig. 5d). Mean
    wind speed, mean VPD, and ETo all displayed a negative effect on yield (Fig. 5e,g,i).
    The minimum SWP value was a potential indicator for yield, suggesting that below
    −1.6 MPa, yield begins to decrease (Fig. 5f). Panels 5 h and 5j illustrate that
    there were optimal values for both mean temperature (seasonal mean of 22.8 °C)
    and spring precipitation (at 100.3 mm), and conditions below or above these values
    were associated with decrease in yield. Fig. 6 shows the PDPs for the SVM model
    for number of clusters. The cumulative leaf area index was found to have similar
    patterns for the number of clusters and yield models (Figs. 5a and 6a), reaching
    an optimum value. Figs. 5i and 6i indicated that cumulative ETo demonstrated an
    opposite trend regarding the number of clusters in comparison to yield. Increasing
    cumulative ETo was linked to a rising number of clusters, eventually reaching
    an optimum value at ∼970 mm/season. Positive associations were found between the
    number of clusters and accumulated GDD (Fig. 6b). Increasing trends were also
    found for seasonal irrigation (Fig. 6c), total precipitation (Fig. 6d), and mean
    temperature (Fig. 6h), with non-linear patterns that level out after 376 mm, 638
    mm, and 23.5 °C, respectively. Mean seasonal VPD had a similar negative effect
    on number of clusters as on yield (Figs. 6g and 5g). Mean wind speed (Fig. 6e),
    minimum SWP values (Fig. 6f), and spring precipitation (Fig. 6j) and were characterized
    by an inverted u-shaped curve, indicating an optimum value (3.8 m/sec, −1.6 MPa,
    and 88.1 mm, respectively). Fig. 7 shows the PDPs generated for the cluster weight
    SVM model. Accumulated GDD (Fig. 7b), mean wind speed (Fig. 7e), mean temperature
    (Fig. 7h), and ETo (Fig. 7i) all displayed negative effects on cluster weight.
    Cumulative irrigation was found to have a positive effect on cluster weight, until
    leveling out after 348 mm a season (Fig. 7c). The pattern for cumulative LAI against
    cluster weight was similar to those for yield and number of clusters, with a positive
    trend that reached an optimum followed by decrease (Fig. 7a). The pattern of minimum
    SWP for cluster weight (Fig. 7f) displayed a gradual increase for values below
    −1.6 MPa, and a plateau for higher values (i.e., less negative SWP minimum values
    were associated with high cluster weight at a constant level). Mean VPD (Fig.
    7g) and mean spring precipitation (Fig. 7j) displayed inverted u-shaped patterns,
    indicating an optimum value, below and above which cluster weight decreased. The
    interaction effects of total precipitation and cumulative irrigation on each of
    the yield components are illustrated in Fig. 8. In all cases, mutual increases
    in precipitation and irrigation resulted in higher values of yield (Fig. 8a),
    number of clusters (Fig. 8b), and cluster weight (Fig. 8c); however, for each
    target value there were different interacting values where plateaus were reached,
    and the rate of increase (slope) varied. Download : Download high-res image (630KB)

    associations between yield components and their responses to some environmental
    and irrigation features have been widely documented in the literature. In this
    study, the utilization of multiple experiments, conducted over a wide timespan,
    enabled to make generalized conclusions about patterns and relationships. Our
    findings show different extents of relationships among the yield components, but
    overall similar directions of associations (Fig. 2). Corresponding to our findings,
    Naor et al. (2002) reported a positive, linear relationship between yield and
    number of clusters. Similar findings were reported for two ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’
    vineyards in China, along with a positive relationship between cluster weight
    and yield (Cheng et al., 2014). Reynolds et al. (1994) found a negative relationship
    between cluster weight and number of clusters in ‘Emerald Riesling’ in an experiment
    in Canada, similar to the correlation found for the Tal-Shachar (‘Emerald Riesling’)
    experiment. Evidence regarding the positive relationship between yield and cluster
    weight, as well as number of clusters, was also reported in a study on ‘Merlot’
    in Idaho, USA (Shellie, 2006). The relationship between the model features and
    the yield components were not very strong (ranging between 0 and 0.65, Fig. 3),
    signifying the need for a complex model that can analyze non-linear relationships.
    The performances of the four SVM models were validated using multiple metrics
    and were found reliable (Table 3), with normalized MAE ranging between 4.1 % and
    −8.11 % for yield, number of clusters, and cluster weight. This current study
    relies on the assumption that various factors have similar, although widely variable
    effects on yield components for the selected varieties. Some similar relations
    were previously documented and supported by our finding, while several results
    were never recorded prior to this study. The patterns of these relationships are
    detailed below for the most contributing factors (Fig. 4). Multiple studies have
    concluded that LAI and canopy cover are known indirect indicators for assessing
    yield components, while positive relationships between these factors were found
    in different varieties, such as ‘Pinot Noir’ (Ohana-Levi et al., 2022b; Sun et
    al., 2017), ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ (Bahat et al., 2021; Hall et al., 2011), ‘Malbec’
    (Netzer et al., 2022), ‘Merlot’ (Chacón-Vozmediano et al., 2020), and also table
    grapes (Arab et al., 2021). This present study somewhat supports these previous
    findings; while cumulative LAI was found to be a strong contributor to yield and
    number of clusters (Fig. 4), the relationship was never linear. For all yield
    components, cumulative LAI was characterized by a linear pattern up to an optimum
    level above which a decline was observed (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). This mechanism
    may be associated with increased dense canopies due to excessive vigor. Over-developed
    canopies are associated with reduced fruit initiation in the buds, and reduced
    fruit and wine quality (Dry and Loveys, 1998). High yields are typically produced
    by high shoot numbers, as well as more canopy shading (Smart, 1985). The relationship
    between yield and canopy cover is therefore linear, up to a point where canopy
    shading prevents the exposure of a large portion of leaf area to light, leading
    to a decrease in yield components (Reynolds and Vanden Heuvel, 2009). It is also
    worth noting that while cumulative LAI was found to be a leading contributor to
    the model, it is an intermediate factor, (i.e., affected by some of the other
    features in the model while affecting the outcome) (Ohana-Levi et al., 2022c,
    2020b), thus masking some of the variation explained by other features, such as
    temperature, ETo, and cumulative irrigation. Accumulated seasonal GDD is known
    to negatively affect yield and cluster weight. Severe heat is commonly associated
    with water stress (Shtein et al., 2021) and negative effects on yield, as suggested
    by studies conducted in vineyards in Portugal (Alves et al., 2012; Fraga and Santos,
    2017) and New York (Karl et al., 2016). It is worth noting that for values under
    1800 °CGDD, yield did not show a decreasing pattern, which corresponds with the
    optimal ranges of GDD for Mediterranean vineyards, typically between 1500 and
    1800 °CGDD from budbreak to harvest (Ortega-Farias and Riveros-Burgos, 2019; Ramos,
    2017; Vanino et al., 2015), depending on the varieties and their respective phenological
    cycle. Alternatively, high accumulated GDD values may be caused by delaying the
    harvest to reach sugar accumulation targets. Prolonged growing seasons can lead
    do berry shrivel, thus decreasing berry weight as accumulated GDD reaches high
    values (Greer and Weedon, 2013). Cumulative ETo was found to be a major contributor
    to the number of clusters and cluster weight (about 20 %) (Fig. 4). Cumulative
    ETo has an indirect effect on grapevine yield performance, as it affects the water
    demands of the plant, with an interactive effect with irrigation (Pérez-Álvarez
    et al., 2021). Our findings suggest that the number of clusters increased as ETo
    approached 970 mm/season (Fig. 6i), and then moderately decreased, similar to
    the results reported by Reynolds et al. (2012). They also described a negative
    linear effect of ETo on cluster weight, as apparent in Fig. 7i. It should be noted
    that potential of the number of clusters is known to be determined during the
    previous growing season (Monteiro et al., 2021), and in this current study past
    meteorological and irrigation features were not included. Further research in
    this direction may illuminate the quantitative response of number of clusters
    to multiple drivers. Irrigation was found to be one of the most important factors
    affecting yield and cluster weight. The trend of effect was characterized by a
    positive relationship until plateauing at 394 mm for yield, and at 350 mm for
    cluster weight. This means that applying large amounts of irrigation does not
    increase yield linearly, and high quantities of water do not necessarily guarantee
    more yield. There are numerous studies that report significant differences of
    vine performance in terms of yield and cluster weight between irrigation regimes,
    illustrating a gradual increase in yield and cluster weight with higher amounts
    of irrigation (Junquera et al., 2012; Munitz et al., 2020; Munitz et al., 2016;
    Wenter et al., 2018). However, not much documentation is available regarding a
    practical threshold for seasonal irrigation, above which there is no longer a
    positive effect on yield components. Contrarily, a minimum SWP value, which is
    an indicator of grapevine drought stress, was found to be a valuable predictor
    only for number of clusters (ranked fourth, with 11.76 % relative contribution,
    Fig. 4), while cumulative irrigation showed a very low value (2.76 %). The contradicting
    impacts of cumulative irrigation and minimum SWP on yield components can be attributed
    to the fact that irrigation amounts do not determine the number of clusters, as
    opposed to yield and cluster weight. Instead, the potential inflorescence differentiation
    is determined during the previous growing season (Monteiro et al., 2021), regardless
    of the irrigation amounts during the current growing season. Multiple studies
    indeed found that the different irrigation strategies did not have a significant
    effect on the number of clusters per vine (Chaves et al., 2007; Intrigliolo and
    Castel, 2010b, 2008), or displayed a weaker effect of irrigation treatments on
    number of clusters than on berry mass, number of berries per cluster, or cluster
    weight (Basile et al., 2012; Munitz et al., 2020; Munitz et al., 2016). Precipitation
    throughout the winter and spring was found to have a stronger effect on the number
    of clusters than irrigation during the season (Fig. 4b); yield and cluster weight,
    however, were affected more by irrigation amounts than by precipitation (Fig.
    4a,c). The findings show positive relationship patterns of precipitation against
    all three yield components (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). The positive response of
    the number of clusters to precipitation amounts was also found by Martínez-Lüscher
    et al. (2017), and the increasing effect of precipitation on yield was reported
    in various studies and varieties (Camps and Ramos, 2012; Maxwell et al., 2016;
    Ohana-Levi et al., 2022c). Mean wind speed was found to negatively affect cluster
    weight (17.03 %, Figs. 4 and 7e). Strong winds are known to cause partial berry
    dehydration, thus affecting the cluster weight (Chorti et al., 2010). Strong winds
    may also harm pollination and fruit set in grapevines, thus reducing the cluster
    weight. Few studies found decreases in yield as a function of higher wind speeds,
    indicating a negative effect on yield in ‘Cabernet Franc’ in an Australian experiment
    (Dry et al., 1989), and a positive effect of wind sheltering on yield in a ‘Chardonnay’
    experiment (Bettiga et al., 1996). Expected climate change projections include
    increased temperature and higher variation in precipitation with prolonged drought
    periods (Cramer et al., 2018; Raymond et al., 2019). The focus should therefore
    be on particular methods of adaptation to possible higher GDD values and lower
    precipitation rates in some seasons, which may impact yield components (Holland
    and Smit, 2010; Van Leeuwen et al., 2019). Such methods have already been discussed
    in the literature and may include, among others, changes in pruning timing (Netzer
    et al., 2022), irrigation during dormancy (Bonada et al., 2020), and redesigning
    vineyards and their locations (Naulleau et al., 2021). The multivariate analysis
    conducted in this present study was enabled using a ML algorithm in order to utilize
    large amounts of data and reveal underlying effects and patterns (Liakos et al.,
    2018). The dataset may be improved for such an analysis. Naturally, not all the
    influencers were considered and some of the features were not sampled using consistent
    methods and protocols (for example, the physiological features were not sampled
    for identical periods throughout the growing season in the various experiments;
    irrigation amounts were not determined using identical irrigation strategies and
    models). Also, the sample size (n = 901) was quite small for using a ML algorithm;
    incorporating more irrigation experiments would have resulted in a more accurate
    generalization of the feature patterns against yield components. Additionally,
    a larger sample size would enable considering other ML algorithms more suitable
    for interpretive purposes. Nevertheless, the method presented hereinafter can
    support various types of data and be further utilized to investigate a wider set
    of factors and their interactions. Applications of advanced methods for modern
    agriculture purposes present opportunities for integrating datasets, handling
    the data effectively, exploring them more thoroughly, and gaining knowledge to
    achieve more efficient and compatible solutions for vineyard management. 5. Summary
    and conclusions The multivariate interactions between vegetative, meteorological,
    physiological, and agrotechnical factors with yield components were studied using
    a ML algorithm. The results show that cumulative LAI, accumulated GDD, seasonal
    ETo, and cumulative irrigation strongly affect yield components. Naturally, there
    are many other factors that may be studied in this context, and the methods used
    in this current study may be further applied to other target variables, such as
    quality measures, must components, wine characteristics, and more, and can also
    be adopted for modeling other crops. The findings of this study identify the relations
    between three yield components (yield, number of clusters, and cluster weight).
    This knowledge may be useful for yield optimization and vineyard management (e.g.,
    cluster-thinning, irrigation practices, pruning). Understanding the ranked effects
    of various features on these yield components and uncovering their patterns may
    support the decision making of vineyard managers and viticulturists. For example,
    knowing the optimal irrigation amounts, given specific meteorological conditions,
    may assist in designing an irrigation plan that suits the yield target. Additionally,
    by identifying the patterns of the effects of various meteorological factors on
    yield, vineyard managers and viticulturists can identify potential risks and opportunities
    associated with climate change. For example, rising temperatures, increasing evapotranspiration,
    and changes in precipitation patterns can all have a significant impact on yield
    components. These effects may be modified if the suitable adjustments are made.
    Within the context of the response of yield components to various factors, future
    endeavors ought to focus on two directions: broader scopes, which should account
    for a wider set of experiments, including various climatic regions, more varieties,
    and diverse irrigation strategies; and narrower perspectives, which target smaller
    sets of factors, to study their exclusive patterns, causes and effects on yield
    components, as well as very specific interactions of factors. The latter, more
    restricted approach for studying effects of specific factors on yield components,
    is being studied ordinarily. Moving towards a multivariate and multi-experimental
    concept, where generalizations can be made based on ensemble of datasets, demands
    adopting a uniform standard of sampling, measuring, documenting, and calculating
    the various features and target variables; however, if conducted appropriately
    and managed meticulously, it may introduce new information and insights on grapevine
    and horticultural crops performance and advance practical solutions for vineyard
    management. Furthermore, as field datasets become more accessible and affordable,
    complex modeling will be practiced regularly to handle larger amounts of information.
    Such approaches as suggested in this study may assist in embedding protocols for
    extracting knowledge from field data. Declaration of generative AI and AI-assisted

  description: In this study, the temporal variation in soil salinity dynamics was
    monitored and analyzed using electromagnetic induction (EMI) in an agricultural
    area in Port Said, Egypt, which is at risk of soil salinization. To assess soil
    salinity, repeated soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements were
    taken using an electromagnetic conductivity meter (CMD2) and inverted (using a
    time-lapse inversion algorithm) to generate electromagnetic conductivity images
    (EMCIs), representing soil electrical conductivity (σ) distribution. This process
    involved converting EMCI data into salinity cross-sections using a site-specific
    calibration equation that correlates σ with the electrical conductivity of saturated
    soil paste extract (ECe) for the collected soil samples. The study was performed
    from August 2021 to April 2023, involving six surveys during two agriculture seasons.
    The results demonstrated accurate prediction ability of soil salinity with an
    R2 value of 0.81. The soil salinity cross-sections generated on different dates
    observed changes in the soil salinity distribution. These changes can be attributed
    to shifts in irrigation water salinity resulting from canal lining, winter rainfall
    events, and variations in groundwater salinity. This approach is effective for
    evaluating agricultural management strategies in irrigated areas where it is necessary
    to continuously track soil salinity to avoid soil fertility degradation and a
    decrease in agricultural production and farmers’ income.

    inversion; monitoring 1. Introduction Soil salinization, caused by soluble salts
    in the soil and/or irrigation water, is a leading factor in soil degradation [1].
    The 2021 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report estimates that, globally,
    833 million ha of agricultural land is salt-affected, including saline and sodic
    soils, with most of these areas located in arid and semi-arid regions [2]. This
    salinity poses a severe threat to agricultural production and food security [3].
    Approximately 20% of cultivated lands and 33% of irrigated agricultural lands
    worldwide are affected by soil salinity, with an annual expansion rate of 10%,
    driven by many factors such as low precipitation, the use of saline irrigation
    water, and shallow and saline groundwater [4]. Soil salinity is a significant
    driver of land degradation, negatively impacting crop growth and quality due to
    osmotic stress [5]. Monitoring soil salinity is essential to support farmers and
    rural development offices for better soil and water management, such as choosing
    crops according to their salt tolerance and estimating the water leaching fraction
    requirement to avoid soil salinization and soil fertility degradation [6]. To
    mitigate the spread of soil salinization, efficient and time-saving methods are
    required to monitor soil salinity in agricultural plots. This necessity arises
    because conventional methods for measuring salinity are considered time-consuming
    and labor-intensive. One method for quickly and reliably assessing soil salinity
    across different locations is through electromagnetic induction (EMI) [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14].
    Electromagnetic instruments measure the apparent electrical conductivity of soil
    (ECa; mS m−1), which is often strongly correlated with the electrical conductivity
    of saturated soil paste extract (ECe) [14]. Recent advancements include the use
    of electromagnetic inversion software to account for vertical variation in ECe,
    which involves the creation of electromagnetic conductivity images (EMCIs) for
    salinity mapping. Notable programs include the Aarhus Workbench [15] and EM4Soil
    [16]. Many researchers [17,18,19,20,21,22] developed a linear regression (LR)
    relationship between soil electrical conductivity (σ), inverted from various combinations
    of ECa data, and soil salinity. Although EM38 and electromagnetic conductivity
    meter (CMD mini-explorer) devices are commonly employed for soil salinity mapping
    across various global locations [23,24,25,26], the use of the CMD2 device has
    been comparatively limited. Utili [27] employed the CMD2 device to establish a
    calibration relationship between water content and ECa to monitor water content
    in earthen embankments along the river Irvine in Galston, UK. Apostolopoulos and
    Kapetanios [28] integrated CMD2 and CMD4 devices into an archaeological study
    to map the distribution of loose sediments in Lavreotiki, Greece, aiming to predict
    the paths of ancient rivers. Koganti et al. [29] established three-dimensional
    maps of the electrical conductivity (ECe) across an agricultural field in central
    Haryana, India. They used a DUALEM-2S, with a configuration (2mHcon) comparable
    to the CMD2 instrument in its vertical mode of operation, with an effective depth
    of exploration (DOE) of 3 m. Yao et al. [30] used repeated electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) measurements and linear mixed-effects models to map soil salinity in a coastal
    agricultural landscape in Jiangsu Province, China. The results demonstrated that
    EMI measurements were effective at calibrating and identifying the spatial distribution
    of soil salinity in the predominantly moderately and highly saline areas of the
    landscape. Yao and Yang [31] used EM38 and EM31 instruments in a mobile EMI system
    to address soil salinity issues in the Lower Yellow River Delta. Their study aimed
    to assess soil salinity patterns by analyzing the relationship between ECa measured
    by EM38h and EM31h and corresponding salinity levels through linear regression
    models (where h represents the horizontal mode of EM measurement). The effective
    depth of investigation for EM38h when placed on the ground is generally shallower
    (i.e., 0.75 m), whereas EM31h has deeper penetration, reaching 3 m beneath the
    soil surface. EM38h was found to sense shallow depths (0 to 40 cm), while EM31h
    detected deeper layers (40 to 100 cm) within the 0 to 100 cm range. The authors
    of [10] conducted EMI surveys and soil sampling between May 2017 and October 2018
    in Lezíria de Vila Franca, Portugal, to assess soil salinity at four locations
    with varying salinity levels. The study aimed to evaluate the regional calibration’s
    effectiveness in predicting soil salinity and performing a preliminary qualitative
    analysis of soil salinity dynamics using time-lapse EMCI data. The results showed
    that time-lapse EMCI is evolving as a valid methodology for assessing soil salinization
    risk, supporting the evaluation and implementation of effective agricultural management
    strategies. Since the inversion of ECa for soil characterization using EMI is
    a relatively recent development, the lack of validation using independent datasets
    currently limits its more widespread use in salinity monitoring [32]. Therefore,
    it is crucial to conduct additional tests to verify its accuracy in monitoring
    salinity. The current study takes a new approach to address concerns raised by
    [10]. In response to their suggestions for future improvements in time-lapse EMCI
    performance, particularly regarding the inversion process, this research stands
    out by directly comparing time-lapse EMCI inversion with individual EMCI inversion.
    This study goes beyond the previous methodology that used individual EMCI inversion
    only, which pointed out the potential distortion in inversion results due to the
    ignorance of the reference model and previous information. This innovative approach
    fills a gap in the literature by assessing the efficacy of time-lapse inversion
    algorithms, aiming to produce more precise EMCIs. Moreover, a critical research
    question in the context of employing EMI for soil salinity monitoring, particularly
    using LR, is whether the LR developed within one survey can be applied to subsequent
    surveys without the necessity of establishing a new LR for each survey, which
    requires further investigation. The main objectives of this study were to (a)
    evaluate CMD2’s capability to track and monitor soil salinity in intensely used
    agricultural land over an extended period, (b) develop site-specific calibration
    for using time-lapse EMCI inversion and individual EMCI inversion, (c) assess
    and compare the predictive performance of the developed calibration equation from
    both techniques in predicting ECe from EMCIs, and (d) analyze and track the dynamics
    of soil salinity over time by creating soil salinity cross-sections for each data
    collection date. The indirect objective of the current research was to assess
    the impact of canal lining on soil salinity in the investigated agricultural plot.
    In this regard, the CMD2 instrument was used to perform EMI measurements. The
    ECa data were measured in horizontal and vertical orientations at a single height
    (i.e., on the ground surface) and soil samples were collected six times between
    August 2021 and April 2023. Using both time-lapse inversion and individual inversion
    algorithms, the collected ECa data were inverted to obtain EMCIs for every measurement
    surveys, enabling the continuous monitoring of soil salinity. The obtained σ values
    were converted to predict ECe using site-specific calibration developed from both
    techniques. Finally, an assessment was conducted to compare their predictive performance
    and, subsequently, the best inversion algorithm was chosen to generate salinity
    maps. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The study area is located approximately
    10 km south of Port Said City in Egypt (Figure 1a). This study focused on one
    intensely used and representative agricultural plot in the area, as shown in Figure
    1b. The Suez Canal bounds this area to the east and El-Manzala Lake to the west.
    The area is located between 32°15′ E to 32°17′ E longitude and 31°10′ N to 31°11′
    N latitude, covering an agricultural area of 1200 ha. This area has a relatively
    flat topography, with an elevation ranging from 1 to 2 m above the mean sea level.
    The soil texture in the study area is classified as sandy clay loam [33], and
    the region is classified as arid according to the Köppen–Geiger climate classification
    [34]. In the past, this area was part of Lake Manzala but was drained and converted
    into agricultural land in 1990, where sabkha deposits and salt crusts with remnants
    of seashells dominate the region. When the water was drained from the lake, it
    left behind a sediment layer that was rich in nutrients and organics. However,
    the sediment layer also contains high levels of salt, which can lead to soil salinization
    and decreased crop productivity over time [35]. Figure 1. (a) Location of the
    study area in southern Port Said City; (b) location of the plot (CMD2 transect
    marked with orange lines and soil sampling sites with black dots) and location
    of the drainage water and irrigation water system (irrigation and drainage directions
    marked with blue and green lines, respectively. The plot comprises four basins,
    and the dimensions of each basin, as well as the location of the drainage water
    and irrigation water system, are depicted in Figure 1b. Figure 2 displays daily
    recordings of the total rainfall and average temperature obtained throughout the
    study period at the Port Said meteorological station, indicated by the yellow
    circle in Figure 1a, located at 31°15′36.0″ N and 32°17′24.0″ E, along with irrigation
    and survey events [36]. The average annual rainfall is 98 mm, mainly occurring
    in winter with a maximum amount of 49 mm in January. The average minimum and maximum
    temperatures are 4.2 and 42.6 °C, occurring in January and May, respectively.
    The groundwater level was measured during each survey and the recorded depth was
    similar and approximately around 0.85 m during all surveys. Figure 2. Distribution
    of daily rainfall (mm/day) and mean temperature (°C/day) recorded at the meteorological
    station located in the study area during the study period, including the dates
    of irrigation events, the corresponding irrigation water amounts (mm/day), and
    EMI survey dates. Flood irrigation is the main irrigation method used in the study
    area. The agricultural plot receives irrigation water from the final branch of
    the Port Said Canal, which receives its water supply from the Ismailia Canal.
    The irrigation canal used to irrigate the agricultural lands in the study area
    is part of the national canal rehabilitation project initiated by the Egyptian
    Government [37]. This canal was recently lined with cement concrete during the
    period between January 2022 and May 2023. During the 2021 surveys, there was occasional
    seepage of drainage water into the canals due to the absence of canal lining.
    Before the lining, the measured electrical conductivity of the irrigation water
    (ECw) was 4.0 dS m−1, falling within the moderately saline range (2–10 dS m−1)
    as defined by FAO guidelines [38]. However, according to the guidelines for interpretations
    of water quality for irrigation, which take into account crop tolerance to salinity,
    the degree of restriction is severe for use with ECw values superior to 3 dS m−1
    [39]. Following the initiation of canal lining, subsequent measurements indicated
    a significant reduction in the ECw, decreasing to 1 dS m−1 which falls within
    the slightly saline range (0.7–2 dS m−1). The surface drainage system consists
    of open drains in a V-shaped pattern with a depth of 1.0 m and which are 17.5
    m apart. These drains ultimately converge into the branch drain, as shown in Figure
    1b. The main crop cultivated in the area is Sorghum Sudanese (Sorghum bicolor
    subsp. drummondii), which is used as animal feed. The geophysical surveys were
    conducted to monitor the soil salinity of the investigated plot at the 20 m transect
    shown in Figure 1b. These surveys mainly aimed to track the temporal variation
    in soil salinity distribution during a complete agricultural season. The salinity
    levels in the plot were relatively moderate, with vegetation covering the entire
    plot. The Turkmen Agricultural Institute found that planting Sorghum Sudanese
    in saline areas reduces soil salinity, promoting healthy crop growth and yields
    [40]. Additionally, it lowers the groundwater level and prevents soil salinization
    [40,41]. The productivity of Sorghum Sudanese has the potential for up to five
    annual harvests [42]. The study area was initially prepared for planting Sorghum
    Sudanese in September 2021 when fertilization with potassium, nitrogen, and phosphate,
    as well as seed sowing, were conducted. However, the presence of harmful weeds
    caused a delay in cultivation until December 2021. The cultivation extended over
    six months, encompassing five harvests, with the last harvest in May 2022. 2.2.
    Soil Sampling and Laboratory Analysis As shown in Figure 1b, soil samples were
    taken along the investigated transect on all dates concurrently with EMI surveys.
    Between 1 and 6 boreholes were drilled, depending on the date of measurement,
    as illustrated in Table 1. At each borehole location, three soil samples were
    collected along a 90 cm depth representing topsoil (0.0–0.3 m), subsurface (0.3–0.6
    m), and subsoil (0.6–0.9 m). The ECe of the soil saturation paste extract was
    determined in the soil laboratory of the Faculty of Engineering, Port Said University,
    Egypt. The collected soil samples were air-dried at room temperature and the portion
    of the soil that passed through a 2.0 mm sieve was weighed and placed in a container.
    A volume of distilled water was added to the soil, stirring thoroughly until a
    saturated paste was achieved. The soil was allowed to be fully saturated by covering
    the container and letting it sit for 24 h. After saturation, according to Richards
    [43], the ECe was measured in the extract obtained using suction filters from
    soil saturation paste using a conductivity meter (HI5521-01). In general and according
    to the soil salinity classification proposed by Barrett-Lennard et al. [44], the
    soil was considered non-saline, slightly saline, moderately saline, highly saline,
    and severely saline if its ECe ranged from 0 to 2 dS m−1, 2 to 4 dS m−1, 4 to
    8 dS m−1, 8 to 16 dS m−1, and >16 dS m−1, respectively. Table 1. Detailed information
    regarding the dates of measurements, agricultural state, number of drilled boreholes
    in each survey, and survey utilization. 2.3. Collection and Inversion of ECa Data
    ECa data were collected using a low-frequency electromagnetic induction (EMI)
    technique (i.e., a CMD2 conductivity meter; GF Instruments). The CMD2 has a transmitter
    coil consisting of horizontal (ECah) and vertical (ECav) receiver arrays. It functions
    at a frequency of 10 kHz. The separation between the transmitter and receiver
    is 1.89 m, allowing for theoretical measurements of ECa depths ranging from 0.0
    to 1.5 m and 0.0 to 3.0 m for the ECah and the ECav, respectively. In the beginning,
    a pilot survey was conducted with the CMD2 positioned approximately 1.00 m above
    the ground surface throughout the investigated plot (Figure 1b) to explore variations
    in soil salinity. Only the horizontal dipole orientation was considered during
    this survey. The objective of the initial investigation was to gain qualitative
    insights into the spatial variability of soil salinity across the field and to
    identify a representative transect for further study. According to this survey,
    a specific transect within the investigated plot was selected for detailed study
    (Figure 1b). The location of this transect was selected based on the variability
    of the measured ECa values in the investigated plot (Figure 3). Figure 3. The
    spatial distribution of the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa, mS m−1) of
    the CMD2 data obtained from a pilot survey using the horizontal dipole (ECah)
    orientation at a height of 1.00 m. Notable heterogeneity in the ECa values was
    observed along this transect. Furthermore, it was oriented parallel to the drainage
    direction, located between two drains to ensure that the CMD2 readings were not
    affected by drainage water or its salinity. Subsequently, a series of CMD2 surveys
    were conducted along the selected single transect over a period spanning six dates
    from August 2021 to April 2023. Measurements were obtained at intervals of 1 m
    along the 20 m transect (Figure 1) using a GPS integrated with the device for
    registration of the position. The ECa was collected with a CMD2 lying on the ground
    surface in both horizontal and vertical dipole orientations. For the inversion,
    the EM4Soil software (V-3.05) [45] was used to estimate the true electrical conductivity
    (σ, mS m−1) at any depth. These estimates were generated by using 1D laterally
    constrained inversion, Quasi 2D, a technique developed by [16,46,47]. A forward
    model based on the full solution of the Maxwell equations [48] was used in this
    study. This method is recommended when the ECa values are high (>100 mS m−1).
    Two different inversion algorithms, S1 [49] and S2 [50], were used that are based
    on Occam regularization [51]. To run these algorithms, the special Lagrangian
    multiplier (λ) should be determined. λ is responsible for regulating the balance
    between the smoothness of the spatial model and the misfit to the data response.
    A larger λ typically results in a model with a greater misfit error but smoother
    conductivity values. This is generally acceptable when soil conductivity changes
    follow a gradual pattern, leading to a more realistic model. Conversely, a smaller
    λ is usually required when anticipating sharper transitions in soil conductivity
    to accurately delineate abrupt boundaries. The determination of a suitable λ value
    is typically conducted through inversions with various λ values [52,53]. The number
    and depth of layers in the initial model and the conductivities of each layer
    were determined based on the ECa data mean. The value of λ varied from 0.02 to
    a maximum of 3.0, with inversion stopping after a maximum of 10 iterations. Two
    different techniques were used to invert the six surveys, namely individual and
    time-lapse inversion. In the individual inversion, each survey was inverted independently,
    and only spatial regularization was applied. In contrast, in the time-lapse inversion,
    the data for the six dates were simultaneously inverted and the temporal regularizations
    were also applied. Therefore, it was necessary to optimize the spatial and temporal
    Lagrangian multipliers. The temporal Lagrangian multiplier (α) functions as a
    temporal damping factor, assigning weight to the minimization of temporal conductivity
    changes along the time axis. The α remains constant and is determined by the similarity
    between two consecutive reference times. A higher α value yields more similar
    reference models resulting from the inversion, while a value of zero signifies
    the absence of temporal constraints, resembling a traditional non-time-lapse inversion
    [54]. The value of λ used in the current study ranged from 0.02 to a maximum of
    1.5, while α was set at either 0.5 or 0.1, with a maximum number of 10 iterations.
    To develop optimum electromagnetic conductivity images (EMCIs) relative to the
    measured ECe, the CMD2 ECa data associated with the soil sampling sites were used.
    Subsequently, the optimal inversion method was determined based on whether the
    individual or time-lapse inversion algorithm provided a better LR for the soil
    salinity calibration and optimal inversion parameters were chosen. The selected
    parameters achieved a higher R2 value between σ and the measured ECe and a lower
    model misfit error among different regression models (EMCIs). The R2 values were
    compared using the classification proposed by Moore and Kirkland [55], where a
    strong agreement was defined as R2 > 0.70, moderate as 0.5 < R2 < 0.7, weak as
    0.3 < R2 < 0.5, and very weak as R2 < 0.3. 2.4. Prediction of ECe from EMCI Using
    Site-Specific Calibrations As a first step, a unique equation (i.e., a site-specific
    calibration equation) was derived for the investigated plot based only on the
    ECa data from the third survey. The best-selected sets of inversion parameters
    described in Section 2.3 were used to develop a linear regression model between
    σ and the measured ECe. After that, a cross-validation process was used to assess
    the predictive ability of the calibration equation. Cross-validation was carried
    out using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV; [56]) method. In this method,
    one sample was removed, and the calibration was established based on the remaining
    samples to predict the ECe at the point where the sample was removed. This process
    was iteratively repeated for each sampling point from the sampling sites (18 soil
    sampling points) until each sample had been taken once. The ability of the site-specific
    calibration to predict the ECe was assessed using several metrics. The root mean
    square error (RMSE; Equation (1)) was computed to evaluate the overall prediction
    accuracy and the mean error (ME; Equation (2)) was calculated to assess any prediction
    bias. Additionally, Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC; [57]) was
    calculated to evaluate the degree of similarity between the linear regression
    (LR) and the 1:1 relationship and to quantify the agreement between the two variables.

    points; ECmi and ECpi are the measured and predicted ECe values, respectively.
    In the second step, repeated EMI and ECe measurements, which were collected simultaneously
    with the EMI surveys for all measurement surveys except survey 3, were used as
    an independent validation dataset. This dataset was employed to assess (i.e.,
    validate) the prediction ability of the site-specific calibration to predict ECe
    values from EMCIs at various depths over time. This was performed for both inversion
    techniques (i.e., time-lapse and individual inversions). In the last step, the
    RMSE, ME, and LCCC were used as indicators to evaluate the ability of the site-specific
    calibration equation to predict the ECe. 3. Results 3.1. ECe Data Analysis Initially,
    the third survey was chosen as a calibration dataset based on the fact that this
    survey included both the minimum and maximum ECe values measured across all surveys
    (Table 2) and it had a wide range of ECe values (ECe range = 12.32 dS m−1). Moreover,
    the third survey was characterized by the largest number of soil samples collected
    during the surveys (i.e., n = 18). Table 3 summarizes descriptive statistics for
    the measured ECe values in the calibration dataset (i.e., n = 18; the third survey).
    In the first layer (0.0–0.3 m), the minimum ECe value was 4.63 dS m−1, which is
    classified as moderately saline (4–8 dS m−1). Both the mean (7.16 dS m−1) and
    the maximum (8.19 dS m−1) ECe values showed moderate and high salinity levels,
    respectively. The ECe in the second layer (0.3–0.6 m) was highly saline (8–16
    dS m−1), with a minimum ECe value of 8.66 dS m−1, a maximum of 11.50 dS m−1, and
    a mean of 9.96 dS m−1. In the third layer (0.6–0.9 m), the minimum ECe value was
    12.95 dS m−1 and the mean was 14.92 dS m−1, indicating high salinity, while the
    maximum ECe value was 16.95 dS m−1, which is classified as severely saline (16–32
    dS m−1). Table 2. Measured ECe values for each surveying campaign, all surveys,
    and validation surveys. Table 3. Descriptive statistics of the measured electrical
    conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract (ECe in dS m−1) at various depths,
    including the topsoil (0.0–0.3 m), subsurface (0.3–0.6 m), and subsoil (0.6–0.9
    m), in the calibration (n = 18) and validation (n = 57) soil samples. SD and Cv
    are the standard deviation and variation coefficient, respectively. Table 3 summarizes
    the statistics of the measured ECe in the validation dataset (i.e., n = 57). In
    the first layer, the minimum and the mean ECe values were 5.29 and 7.47 dS m−1,
    respectively, and was moderately saline, while the maximum ECe value was 11.8
    dS m−1 and was highly saline. In the second layer, the validation ECe data had
    minimum, mean, and maximum ECe values of 8.00, 10.89, and 12.59 dS m−1, respectively.
    These values were slightly higher than the calibration data, except for the minimum.
    The validation ECe data for the third layer demonstrated lower minimum, mean,
    and maximum values in comparison to the calibration dataset. The statistics for
    all layers in the calibration samples fell within the same salinity classes, with
    only a difference in the maximum value of the third layer. This high level of
    consistency enhances confidence in the calibration model’s ability to provide
    accurate estimations for ECe values. By comparing the calibration and the validation
    datasets, it can be noted that the mean ECe value (i.e., 10.68 dS m−1) was slightly
    higher for the calibration dataset. The standard deviation (SD) was also slightly
    higher for the calibration ECe dataset and was equal to 3.52 dS m−1 as compared
    to 2.94 dS m−1 corresponding to the validation ECe dataset, indicating greater
    variability in the calibration ECe data. Both the minimum and the maximum values
    were slightly higher for the calibration ECe dataset. Furthermore, the coefficient
    of variation (CV) was higher for the calibration ECe dataset and was equal to
    32.9% as compared to 27.9% for the validation ECe dataset, suggesting that the
    calibration ECe data exhibited relatively higher variability with their mean.
    3.2. Determination of the Optimal Inversion Parameters and Inversion Technique
    After the analysis of determining the optimal parameter configuration for individual
    inversion and establishing a calibration relationship between σ and the measured
    ECe, the best sets of inversion parameters were assessed. These were obtained
    using the S2 inversion algorithm, FS forward modeling, and λ = 0.4. The calibration
    equation developed from the individual inversion was as follows with an R2 value
    of 0.88: ECe = 0.3084 + 0.05039 × σ (3) Likewise, to determine the optimal parameter
    configuration for time-lapse inversion and to develop a calibration relationship
    between σ and the measured ECe, various EMCIs were generated. These were created
    by using ECa data from all EMI survey dates; employing inversion algorithms (S1
    and S2); and varying the initial model conductivity, λ, and α values as described
    in Section 2.3. Firstly, it is worth mentioning that the model derived using λ
    values exceeding one is not shown here. Using λ values higher than one led to
    a considerable misfit error between the predicted and measured ECa. Therefore,
    opting for a high λ is not advisable, especially when expecting sharp vertical
    conductivity contrasts in the field. Regarding the impact of the temporal smoothing
    parameter (α), various values were investigated (results not presented here).
    It was observed that values exceeding 0.10 overly smoothed the anticipated temporal
    changes, making it challenging to resolve detailed variations. Hence, for this
    study, a value of 0.10 was determined to be the optimal choice for α in addressing
    the temporal variation of σ. An analysis for the time-lapse inversion technique
    was conducted using the best-selected sets of inversion parameters. These parameters
    were achieved when using the S2 inversion algorithm, α = 0.10, and λ = 0.90. The
    calibration equation developed from TL inversion was as follows with an R2 value
    of 0.89: ECe = −9.1485 + 0.0910 × σ (4) Table 4 presents the R2 values between
    σ and the measured ECe for both the individual (IN) and time-lapse (TL) inversion
    techniques. Moreover, it shows the RMSE, ME, and LCCC between the measured and
    predicted ECe values for all data calculated by using site-specific calibration
    equations for both techniques (i.e., Equations (3) and (4)). These estimates were
    assessed by considering survey 3 (i.e., n = 18) as the calibration dataset and
    the remaining surveys (i.e., n = 57) as the validation dataset. The R2 values
    were strong for all surveys (i.e., R2 > 0.70) using both techniques, with R2 values
    of 0.81 and 0.77 for time-lapse and individual inversion, respectively. This suggests
    that the time-lapse technique may offer a slightly more accurate calibration for
    the measured ECe. Table 4. Statistical indicators for measured ECe: RMSE, ME,
    LCCC, and R2 for all data types using both individual (IN) and time-lapse (TL)
    inversion techniques. Considering the mean error (ME) between the measured and
    predicted ECe values for all surveys, it was clear that the least biased (i.e.,
    closest to zero) inversion technique was the time-lapse inversion as it represented
    an ME value of 0.17 dS m−1 compared to 0.85 dS m−1 for the individual inversion.
    According to Singh et al. [58], a satisfactory prediction RMSE should be half
    the standard deviation (SD) of the measured ECe. As the SD of the ECe for all
    the validation data was 2.94 dS m−1, as shown in Table 3, the RMSE should be 1.47
    dS m−1 or lower to achieve satisfactory prediction. As the RMSE was equal to 1.45
    dS m−1 in the time-lapse inversion as compared to 2.10 dS m−1 in the individual
    inversion, the time-lapse inversion is considered the optimal inversion technique.
    The LCCC between the measured and predicted ECe values for all surveys is displayed
    in Table 4. The analysis of the LCCC reinforced the superiority of the time-lapse
    inversion technique, with a stronger agreement between the measured and predicted
    ECe (LCCC = 0.90) compared to that in the individual inversion (LCCC = 0.84),
    indicating the effectiveness of time-lapse inversion in making predictions. Based
    on the results, time-lapse inversion is recommended compared to individual inversion
    as it showed improved accuracy and effectiveness in ECe prediction. Therefore,
    the time-lapse inversion technique was applied in this study and used for monitoring
    and mapping soil salinity, as shown below. 3.3. Time-Lapse EMCIs Figure 4 displays
    the obtained EMCIs from the time-lapse inversion of EMI surveys. The figure shows
    that σ increases with depth, consistent with the previously established soil salinity
    distribution. Across multiple EMI surveys conducted at the same location, the
    temporal variations in σ were monitored for one agricultural season spanning from
    August 2021 to June 2022. In August 2021, the σ values fluctuated between a minimum
    value of 138.4 mS m−1 and a maximum value of 352.5 mS m−1. This wide range indicated
    significant variability in σ compatible with the large measured ECe within this
    timeframe. Figure 4. Time-lapse electromagnetic conductivity images (EMCIs) for
    the experimental plot. In September 2021, the σ values ranged from 142.7 to 343.7
    mS m−1. The recorded σ ranges for both dates can be attributed to fertilizer application,
    irrigation water salinity (ECw = 4 dS m−1), and the existence of shallow saline
    groundwater with a depth level of 0.85 m below the soil surface and a salinity
    of 14 dS m−1. In arid climates and under evaporation, an important solute up-flow
    from the shallow and salty groundwater (capillarity rise processes) could be the
    main cause of soil salinization [59]. In February 2022, the maximum σ values decreased
    compared to those in August and September 2021. The σ values in February 2022
    ranged from 142.7 to 323.7 mS m−1. April 2022 exhibited a similar pattern, with
    σ values ranging from 145.4 to 318.1 mS m−1. This reduction in the maximum σ values
    can be attributed to the winter rains, as shown in Figure 2. This resulted in
    a corresponding decrease in the measured ECe which agreed with the reduction in
    σ values in the subsoil, as shown in Figure 4. In June 2022, a slight increase
    in the minimum σ values was noted and the σ values ranged from 152.17 to 322.21
    mS m−1. Finally, in April 2023, another agricultural season one year later, the
    σ values ranged from 157.0 to 329.8 mS m−1, maintaining an almost consistent pattern
    as observed during the antecedent four surveys. This pattern involves a decrease
    in σ values within the subsoil as compared to those in February 2022 as shown
    in Figure 4. This trend was also reflected in the measured ECe values in the subsoil.
    The ECe values decreased in the subsoil. 3.4. Prediction of ECe Using Site-Specific
    Calibration Figure 5a displays the calibration relationship between the ECe and
    σ using the calibration equation developed from survey 3 using the time-lapse
    technique and the best inversion parameters (i.e., the S2 inversion algorithm,
    α = 0.10, and λ = 0.90). The best LR equation gave an R2 equal to 0.89, expressed
    as ECe = −9.1485 + 0.0910 × σ (5) Figure 5. Plots of (a) soil electrical conductivity
    (σ, mS m−1), the measured electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste
    extract (ECe, dS m−1), and the linear regression (LR) of the calibration equation
    using survey #3 and time-lapse inversion; (b) validation results of the LR calibration
    equation using other surveys excluding survey #3. Figure 5b shows the predicted
    ECe plotted versus the measured ECe and the 1:1 line using the calibration equation
    developed using the time-lapse for different measurement dates and different measurement
    depths. The validation of the calibration equation using time-lapse inversion
    resulted in an RMSE of 1.45 dS m−1 and a strong R2 of 0.79, indicating acceptable
    predictive capability given the wide ECe range (10.41 dS m−1). These results concur
    with the findings of Zare et al. [60], who observed a larger RMSE (5.28 dS m−1)
    in an irrigated cotton field under a wider ECe range (68.4 dS m−1). However, in
    the current study, the predictive bias (ME) was small and equal to 0.24 dS m−1,
    indicating a slight tendency for overestimation of the ECe. This level of bias
    was slightly higher than the ME reported by Zare et al. [60], which was 0.03 dS
    m−1. However, it can be considered well within acceptable limits. A high LCCC
    of 0.88 indicates a strong agreement between the measured and predicted ECe values
    during validation. Figure 5b displays variations in the predictive accuracy of
    the validation data for all EMI survey dates. The figure shows that the predicted
    ECe was generally slightly overestimated in the subsoil, particularly in April
    2022. This result is unsurprising, given that the soil in April 2022 had the lowest
    maximum measured ECe among other survey dates, as shown in Table 2. Also, these
    results could be explained by the spatial variation in the soil properties (such
    as the soil texture and cation exchange capacity) and the temporal spatial variation
    in the soil water content and shallow ground water properties (depth and salinity).
    In contrast, the predicted ECe in the subsurface was generally slightly underestimated
    except for that in April 2023. This discrepancy is likely due to April 2023 having
    the lowest ECe among other survey dates. The greater variations in the measured
    ECe values during survey 3 had a considerable impact on the calibration equation,
    limiting its ability to monitor the smaller variations observed in April 2022
    and 2023. For the topsoil layer across all observation dates, the data points
    exhibit a dispersed distribution around the unity line (Figure 5b). Generally,
    the statistical indicators presented in Table 4 for the validation data, segregated
    by measurement date, indicate that the prediction ability remained relatively
    consistent across all five dates. These results indicate that the spatial variability
    of the data had a much stronger influence on the prediction ability of the site
    calibration than the temporal variability. To improve the spatial sensitivity
    of the site calibration, observation times can be extended, the number of EMI
    surveys can be also increased, and a different EM device with a shallow effective
    depth, like the CMD mini explorer, can be used. Paz et al. [9] recommended soil
    sampling and continuous monitoring of the volumetric water content (θ), soil temperature,
    groundwater level, and salinity to improve the spatial sensitivity of the site
    calibration. 3.5. Generation of Soil Salinity Cross-Sections from Time-Lapse EMC
    Figure 6 shows the soil salinity cross-sections for each EMI survey date. Consequently,
    the figure tracks the salinity dynamics over time. The cross-sections were generated
    by using the site-specific calibration equation to predict the ECe, which was
    classified into three salinity classes ranging from moderately to severely saline.
    The measured ECe values for each EMI survey’s sampling site and groundwater level
    are also displayed. Figure 6. Predicted soil salinity maps along vertical transects
    for the plot with representations of the measured ECe (in circles) and groundwater
    level (blue triangles) at the sampling sites located in the middle of each transect
    for all surveying campaigns. Furthermore, the elevated ECgr reached a high saline
    level of 14 dS m−1 during the dry period of the year (i.e., the summer of 2021).
    Higher groundwater salinity levels can be attributed to the absence of rainfall
    and the use of moderately saline irrigation water. However, the degree of salinity
    overestimation tended to subside during the winter surveys, due to rainfall which
    reduced the groundwater salinity to a relatively lower level (ECgr = 10 dS m−1).
    Figure 6 depicts soil salinity fluctuations for all surveyed dates. The soil salinity
    at the subsurface layer was accurately predicted in most sampling sites on all
    dates. In contrast, soil salinity predictions for the topsoil tended to be slightly
    overestimated. During September 2021, the salinity cross-section revealed a larger
    portion of high salinity within the topsoil layer. In February and April 2022,
    many soil sample sites reached a moderately saline level as indicated by the measured
    ECe. In April 2023, the measured ECe at all sampling sites within the top and
    the subsurface soils showed a moderate saline level (ECe = 4–8 dS m−1). However,
    the salinity cross-sections for the topsoil estimated by CMD2 did not accurately
    reveal changes in soil salinity and tended to be overestimated. This inconsistency
    may be attributed to the weak correlation between the responses of the CMD2 device
    and the topsoil layer, as demonstrated in similar results obtained with an EMI
    device with an effective depth of 2.0 m [61]. The CMD2 has an effective depth
    of 1.5 m for horizontal (ECah) and 3 m for vertical (ECav) receiver arrays according
    to the manufacturer’s guide. This exploration depth was significantly larger than
    the depth of the topsoil, which makes it challenging to resolve ECe changes in
    the topsoil [62]. Considering the circumstances of elevated initial soil salinity,
    active water movement, salt conveyance, and the presence of a shallow groundwater
    table, salts migrated upward through capillary action and accumulated within the
    root zone. This phenomenon was particularly notable during the dry season of summer
    2021. However, the use of slightly saline irrigation water (after canal lining)
    led to a gradual reduction in soil salinity, particularly within the topsoil,
    proven by subsequent EMI survey dates. Using the information obtained from time-lapse
    spatial distribution maps, the classification of soil salinity becomes a valuable
    tool for rational crop allocation within the investigated agricultural field.
    The primary objective of this allocation strategy is to effectively maximize crop
    yield in salt-affected soils. This approach involves the cultivation of crops
    renowned for their high salt tolerance, such as cotton, barley, and sorghum, even
    in soils exhibiting moderate to heavy salinity levels. The results of the current
    study can help local farmers monitor soil salinity more accurately, allowing them
    to develop customized soil management strategies and make informed decisions in
    agriculture. 4. Discussions It is worth noting that the minimum ECe at all depths,
    excluding the topsoil, indicated highly saline conditions. The higher salinity
    values in the study area can be attributed to climate change, leading to sea-level
    rise [63,64]. Consequently, this phenomenon impacts the groundwater, causing an
    increase in saltwater intrusion from El Manzala Lake, located near the study area
    [65]. Although Sorghum Sudanese is generally moderately salt-tolerant, the grain
    yields of two cultivations decreased by 16% per unit increase in ECe values above
    6.8 dS m−1 [66]. Sorghum is soil- and water-salinity tolerant up to 6.8 and 4.5
    dS m−1, respectively [67], in the investigated agricultural field. The crop yield
    was high, which is consistent with the results of Almodares and Sharif [68]. Additionally,
    the extended trials conducted at the Turkmen Agricultural Institute demonstrated
    the feasibility of achieving a substantial Sorghum Sudanese yield, even in the
    presence of highly saline soils [40]. A higher Sorghum Sudanese yield in the investigated
    plot can also be attributed to the use of organic and mineral fertilizers during
    the cultivation season. The reduction in σ and measured ECe values within the
    subsoil can be attributed to the decrease in irrigation water salinity due to
    the canal lining and the continued cultivation of Sudanese Sorghum. Although the
    decrease in irrigation water salinity resulted in a reduction in measured ECe
    within the topsoil layer during the last survey, no corresponding decrease was
    observed in σ. This can be attributed to the lower sensitivity of the CMD2 to
    soil salinity within the root zone due to the existence of shallow groundwater
    which considerably affects the readings and the high temporal variation in soil
    moisture at the topsoil under evapotranspiration demand and water apply events
    [6]. Also, according to McNeill [69], part of the salts present in surface soils
    may not be in solution due to low water contents and therefore will not affect
    the CMD2 readings. Moreover, a smoothness constraint was imposed in the modeling
    to stabilize the inversion and smooth conductivity variations over short depth
    increments [54,70]. Consequently, the ability to predict salinity from σ in the
    topsoil was diminished, as discussed earlier in Section 3.5. To improve the prediction
    of soil salinity in topsoil, other EMI multi-coil sensors such as the CMD Mini
    Explorer can be used. These sensors are designed for detailed investigation of
    the topsoil as they feature multiple receivers situated closely to the transmitter,
    thus providing more detailed ECa data for the topsoil. In the absence of such
    a sensor, multi-height ECa measurements [71] might also help to better resolve
    topsoil conductivity variations in short depth increments. Furthermore, obtaining
    additional soil information, particularly related to water content and soil texture,
    could facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the influence of other soil
    properties on the EMI signal for a more precise evaluation of topsoil salinity.
    The salinity cross-sections revealed that the salinity levels tended to increase
    with depth, starting from a moderately saline level in the topsoil to a highly
    saline level in the subsoil. Severe saline zones were found at the bottom of the
    subsoil layer across every surveyed date. These saline zones overestimated soil
    salinity compared to the measured ECe values. The observed overestimation can
    be attributed to the proximity of groundwater to the root zone. Shallow groundwater
    can affect CMD2 measurements because water is a significantly better conductor
    of electricity than soil. Consequently, this situation can lead to an overestimation
    of soil salinity. The increase in salinity at the topsoil layer during September
    2021 can be primarily attributed to the application of fertigation practices and
    the use of saline irrigation water (ECw of 4.0 dS m−1). Subsequently, with the
    arrival of the winter and rainy seasons, which represented 66% of the year 2021’s
    total annual rainfall, the salinity levels decreased. It is worth mentioning that
    the initiation of canal lining in January 2022 led to a considerable reduction
    in irrigation water salinity. The salinity of irrigation water decreased to 1.0
    dS m−1 by April 2023. This reduction in water salinity notably contributed to
    lower soil salinity levels. The adoption of Sorghum Sudanese cultivation may be
    another factor for soil salinity reduction during the successive surveys. Worku
    et al. [72] investigated the effect of Sudanese Sorghum cultivation for eighteen
    months on the changes in soil ECe. The results showed a remarkable improvement
    in soil salinity with a reduction in ECe of 52.60% (from 9.81 to 4.65 dS m−1)
    in the upper 0–30 cm soil layer and of 54.76% (from 7.67 to 3.47 dS m−1) in the
    lower 30–60 cm. Mirsharipova et al. [42] stated that Sorghum Sudanese can absorb
    salts from the soil and thereby decrease the soil salinity. The yield of Sorghum
    Sudanese in the investigated agricultural plot increased by more than 10% during
    the year 2023, which can be attributed to the reduction in soil salinity. Challenges
    in generating soil-salinity predictive maps at the field-scale were faced due
    to the following reasons: (i) a lack of repeated field-scale EMI surveys across
    the entire field and only having data from a single measurement; (ii) the absence
    of soil sample collection on the day of the field-scale EMI survey, preventing
    the upscaling of our approach for predictive maps, even on that single day; and
    (iii) limited EMI measurements in a single orientation during the field-scale
    investigation, rendering them unsuitable for the inversion modeling that was presented
    for quantitative investigation. 5. Conclusions This study employed EMI surveys
    and soil sampling to estimate soil salinity distribution across a 20 m transect
    within a highly utilized agricultural plot in the risk-prone Port Said region,
    Egypt. Through time-lapse inversion and site-specific calibration, the EMI data
    were transformed into soil salinity cross-sections, enabling the assessment of
    soil salinity dynamics. The developed soil salinity cross-sections showed how
    soil salinity responds to inputs such as salts and water, whether through irrigation,
    rainfall, or changes in shallow groundwater salinity. This method can assess suitable
    agricultural management practices for salinity reduction. Notably, the study revealed
    that cultivating Sudanese Sorghum contributed to a reduction in soil salinity,
    while canal lining also played a role in lowering soil salinity due to its direct
    impact on ECw. The outlined methodology showcased reliable predictions of soil
    salinity over time, underscoring the suitability of the CMD2 device for monitoring
    soil salinity. However, it revealed a limitation in accuracy for the topsoil layer
    (0–0.3 m). This limitation is primarily attributed to the CMD2’s lack of resolution
    for topsoil characterization, compounded by the substantial variability of other
    soil properties, notably water content. The latter significantly impact the EMI
    signal and soil salinity assessment. To address this limitation and enhance topsoil
    salinity monitoring, the use of sensors specifically designed for shallow investigations,
    such as the CMD Mini Explorer, is recommended. Addressing irrigation water and
    soil salinity management challenges is often complex, particularly in fields and
    at large scales. The EMI method offers a non-invasive, rapid, and cost-effective
    solution for soil salinity dynamic monitoring that can cover expansive areas quickly.
    Although our study focused on a small transect, there is potential for scaling
    up from small-scale to field assessments due to the method’s ability for rapid
    data collection. Our attempt is now towards securing additional funding to facilitate
    this undertaking in the near future. It is important to highlight that such applications
    have been very rare in Egypt, despite many lands facing issues with soil salinity
    and degradation. We consider this study as a proof of concept to demonstrate how
    EMI can be applied in this region for quantitative monitoring of soil salinity.
    This lays the foundation for further research to explore the efficacy of EMI sensors
    and incorporate them into broader 4D investigations for monitoring soil salinity
    in fields and at large scales. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.G.E.,

  description: Accurate cropland information is critical for agricultural planning
    and production, especially in food-stressed countries like China. Although widely
    used medium-to-high-resolution satellite-based cropland maps have been developed
    from various remotely sensed data sources over the past few decades, considerable
    discrepancies exist among these products both in total area and in spatial distribution
    of croplands, impeding further applications of these datasets. The factors influencing
    their inconsistency are also unknown. In this study, we evaluated the consistency
    and accuracy of six cropland maps widely used in China in circa 2020, including
    three state-of-the-art 10-m products (i.e., Google Dynamic World, ESRI Land Cover,
    and ESA WorldCover) and three 30-m ones (i.e., GLC_FCS30, GlobeLand 30, and CLCD).
    We also investigated the effects of landscape fragmentation, climate, and agricultural
    management. Validation using a ground-truth sample revealed that the 10-m-resolution
    WorldCover provided the highest accuracy (92.3%). These maps collectively overestimated
    Chinese cropland area by up to 56%. Up to 37% of the land showed spatial inconsistency
    among the maps, concentrated mainly in mountainous regions and attributed to the
    varying accuracy of cropland maps, cropland fragmentation and management practices
    such as irrigation. Our work shed light on the promotion of future cropland mapping
    efforts, especially in highly inconsistent regions.

    among the maps, concentrated mainly in mountainous regions and attributed to the
    varying accuracy of cropland maps, cropland fragmentation and management practices
    such as irrigation. Our work shed light on the promotion of future cropland mapping
    efforts, especially in highly inconsistent regions. Previous article in issue

    food security [1]. With only 7% of global cropland, China feeds nearly 22% of
    the global population [2] and contributes to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development
    Goal of zero hunger (SDG 2) [3]. However, croplands in China face pressure from
    non-food crop cultivation, cropland abandonment in mountainous regions, and ecological
    damage caused by cultivation of marginal lands [4]. Timely and accurate spatiotemporal
    cropland information remains a prerequisite for food security monitoring [5],
    pest [6] and field management [7]. Remote sensing is an efficient way of acquiring
    cropland information [8], [9]. The research community has produced hundreds of
    land-use and land-cover (LULC) products from regional to global scales, and most
    of them include the category of cropland [10], [11], [12]. The spatial resolution
    of these products has improved from coarse (1 km, 500 m) to moderate (30 m, 10
    m). In the 2010s, 30-m global to regional-scale land-cover maps, including GlobeLand
    30 [13], Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC)
    [14], [15], Global Land-Cover product with Fine Classification System (GLC_FCS30)
    [16], and the annual China Land Cover Dataset (CLCD) [17] have been released and
    widely used, followed by the freely accessible Landsat archives from the United
    States Geological Survey (USGS) since 2008 [18] and the emergence of cloud computing
    techniques. Since 2015, satellites from the Copernicus Sentinel Programme [19]
    have laid the foundation for LULC mapping at 10-m or even higher resolution, offering
    the opportunity to generate cropland datasets with unprecedented spatial resolution
    [20]. Recently, three Sentinel-derived 10-m LULC maps with worldwide cropland
    categories have been delivered: Google Dynamic World [21], WorldCover 2020 from
    European Space Agency (ESA) [22], and Land Cover 2020 from Environmental Systems
    Research Institute (ESRI) [23]. Given that the remotely sensed data from commercial
    satellites (such as the PlanetScope CubeSat [24]) has not been freely available
    on a global scale, these open-source 10-m land-cover datasets offer the highest
    spatial resolution of current maps and show great potential for agricultural application
    in China [25]. However, evident discrepancies are widespread in existing land-use
    products employing differing mapping methods. A cross-comparison and accuracy
    assessment [26] of three 10-m land-cover products demonstrated the ability of
    ESA WorldCover to delineate landscape elements in greater detail on the global
    scale. On the continental or sub-global scale, reports of the consistency assessment
    of multi-class land cover products [27], [28], [29] or thematic maps [30], [31]
    also reveal discrepancies. Wei et al. [32] evaluated the consistency of five medium-resolution
    arable-land products across Africa and found that cropland area derived from GlobeLand30
    was more consistent with FAO statistics than MODIS products for Africa. Zhang
    et al. [33] found that the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) 30-m cropland
    dataset with the benchmark year of 2015 gave the highest overall accuracy of 0.88
    in China. Thus, global accuracy does not promise regional accuracy. However, prior
    cropland-mapping studies have relied mainly on datasets with coarse to medium
    resolution released before 2020, with limited spatial detail. The further application
    of Google Earth Engine (GEE) in cropland mapping [34] after 2020 transformed the
    paradigm, permitting higher-resolution and wider scale studies. China-specific
    assessments have overlooked the latest 10-meter resolution maps, leaving a knowledge
    gap in this field. Multiple factors, including natural factors and human activities,
    contribute to discrepancies among cropland products [35]. The factors that constrain
    the consistency of cropland datasets in China have not been clearly identified.
    Previous studies [36], [37] have examined these factors from both natural and
    human perspectives, and similar investigations [32], [38] have been conducted
    on the African continent. But because China and Africa differ in geographic and
    climatic conditions, as well as agricultural practices, their conclusions cannot
    be extended to China, where the farming model follows a “big country, small farmer”
    approach. Given the aforementioned issues, the objectives of this study were to
    1) quantify the consistency among three 10-m resolution cropland datasets for
    Chinese mainland and compare it with that of three 30-m datasets; 2) evaluate
    the accuracy of six cropland datasets using a sample dataset independent of the
    data producers; and 3) investigate the climate, landscape, and agricultural management
    factors influencing consistency 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Cropland datasets
    Detailed information on the six cropland maps compared in this study is presented
    in Table 1. The three 10-m resolution maps were Google’s Dynamic World (DW) [21],
    ESA’s WorldCover 2020 (WC) [22], and ESRI’s Land Cover (ESRI) [23]. The deep learning
    models are trained and applied to the production of DW and ESRI maps based on
    the same reference dataset of over 5 billion pixels derived from the Sentinel-2
    images around the world and produced separately by cloud computing on GEE and
    Microsoft Planetary Computer. For WC, 141,000 hand-labeled pixels were used to
    train a random forest model using both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. For the
    minimum mapping unit (MMU), the ESRI and DW models were trained on reference data
    with a MMU of 250 m2, whereas WC was trained on data with a 100 m2 MMU. The WC
    and ESRI are annually updated datasets, whereas the DW is operationally delivering
    a near real-time LULC map when Sentinel-2 scenes become available approximately
    every 5 days [26]. Table 1. Basic information of six cropland maps derived from

    30 (GL30), and GLC_FCS30 (GLCFCS). CLCD is a time-serial LULC dataset for 1990–2020
    produced by Wuhan University in China and is generated using a nationwide training
    sample and the random forest algorithm based on GEE [17]. The GL30 product is
    one of the most widely used land cover products developed using a pixel-object-knowledge
    method based on multi-temporal Landsat and HJ-1 (China Environment and Disaster
    Reduction Satellite) A/B imagery [13]. The latest version of GL30 was updated
    in 2020. GLC_FCS is a global land-cover product based on time series of Landsat
    imagery and automated training dataset derived from the Global Spatial Temporal
    Spectra Library (GSPECLib), with a fine classification system and updated at 5-year
    intervals since 1985 [16], [39]. The overall accuracy declared in the user guides
    for CLCD, GL30, and GLC_FCS are 79.31%, 85.72%, and 82.50%, respectively (Table
    1). GL30 and GLC_FCS offer full world coverage, whereas CLCD is a China-specific
    product. 2.2. Ancillary data 2.2.1. Ground-truth sample The volume and distribution
    of ground-truth data can affect the results of validation [40]. In this study,
    a multi-sourced ground truth dataset was used to quantitatively evaluate the precision
    of the cropland products. The dataset comes from our previous study [33] and consists
    of 33,713 vector sample points across China recorded in ESRI Shapefile format,
    each of which lists two attributes including the geo-position and binary cropland/non-cropland
    label. The sample used in the study was generated by integration of the validation
    sample subset in China from the GFSAD (Global Food Security-support Analysis Data)
    [41] and AGLC (Annual Global Land Cover) [42] global validation dataset, as well
    as augmentation with the help of Google Earth’s highly detailed images and historic
    Landsat archive. First, 4435 total samples (1999 from GFSAD and 2436 from AGLC,
    respectively) were inherited from the existing global sample pool and randomly
    distributed across China. Second, 29,278 further sample points distributed throughout
    the country were generated by stratified random sampling to preserve a balance
    among numbers of samples in potential cropland layers (rather than a random distribution
    across the whole of China). We sampled these points with strata defined by the
    proportion of pixelwise consistency evaluation among the six cropland datasets
    (proportions are shown in Fig. S1). The non-cropland category (regions not classified
    as cropland in any datasets, shown in black pixels in Fig. 1C) was overrepresented
    and thus did not participate in the stratified sampling. In all, 33,713 samples
    were generated, distributed across the country in every stratum as well as in
    non-cropland regions. They also encompassed diverse landscapes present in China.
    Prior to final validation, each sample unit underwent careful examination by two
    trained persons to ensure they were located within the field boundary of pure
    rather than the mixed pixel with the help of Google Earth images within the year
    of 2020 through the online accessible web map tile service (WTMS) services (Fig.
    S2A), and their stability and representativeness were also demonstrated. The Fig.

    area data for years 2019–2021 were acquired from China Rural Statistical Yearbooks
    published by China’s National Statistical Bureau (https://data.cnki.net/Yearbook).
    The data were derived from the Third National Land Survey, which is considered
    [43] to be the most authoritative source of land use data in China. Given that
    this Survey was based on December 31, 2019 as the reference time point, the statistics
    for the year 2020 were corrected at the provincial scale. To remove the inter-annual
    fluctuation of cropland areas, they were averaged over 2019–2021 (Table S4). 2.2.3.
    Agri-climate zones and irrigation datasets Ancillary data for spatial agreement
    analysis consisted of agricultural climate zones and irrigated areas. The natural
    agricultural zones of China are mapped in ESRI Shapefile format based on temperature
    and humidity, which divide China into 13 temperature zones (Fig. S3) and 37 natural
    agricultural zones (with abbreviations shown in Tables S1, S2). These zone data
    are from the Center for Resource and Environmental Data Science, Chinese Academy
    of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/). Although located in the same agri-climate
    zone and with similar parcel sizes, the consistency of different cropland products
    varies due to the different agricultural management. Irrigation is a universal
    agricultural management practice in coping with monsoon climates for the shortage
    of precipitation in Eastern Asia countries, especially in China. Irrigation may
    affect the accuracy of cropland mapping subtly by influencing biogeochemical characteristics
    or surface albedo [44], leading to spectral differences in cropland mapping [45].
    The irrigated-area data were derived from China’s first long time-series annual
    irrigation map IrriMap_CN, incorporating data from multiple sources and using
    statistical downscaling and collaborative mapping methods with a stable accuracy
    of over 75% [45]. The spatial consistency percentages of farmland with different
    irrigation ratios were counted in six subgroups (less than 15%, 15%–30%, 30%–45%,
    45%–60%, 60%–75% and over 75%) in our study. 2.3. Preparations of six cropland
    maps in China All the six cropland thematic maps used in this study were extracted
    from the corresponding global or regional LULC datasets according to the definitions
    in the user manuals of each dataset, in which for GLC_FCS there are multiple cropland
    subcategories to be merged into one category to generate a cropland/non-cropland
    binary map. Cropland datasets were divided by their spatial resolution into two
    groups and then uploaded to GEE Assets for further processing. They were then
    clipped to the boundary of China, reprojected to an equal-area projection, resampled
    to the 10-m or 30-m spatial resolution individually, and stored locally. Each
    dataset was thus binarized as cropland and non-cropland pixels with values 1 and
    0, respectively (Fig. S4). In view of the near real-time nature of DW, which differs
    from the other annually updated datasets, we used the MODE compositing method
    in GEE Application Programming Interface (API) documents (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-imagecollection-mode)
    to calculate the most frequent value at each pixel for generating the cropland
    map for 2020. 2.4. Area-based consistency comparison Cropland areas derived from
    each dataset at the national and provincial levels were calculated using zonal
    statistics and then compared to the statistics data. The degree of consistency
    was defined as high, medium, or low if respectively three, two, or one dataset
    labeled the same area as cropland. Accuracy metrics were and root mean square
    error ( ). The indicator including coefficient and RMSE could give a further quantitative
    measurement. A higher correlation coefficient (and lower RMSE) indicates better
    fitness and less deviation from statistics, and vice versa. (1) (2) where and
    is the cropland area of province derived from the datasets and the statistic,
    is the number of provinces taking part in the comparison (Hongkong, Macau and
    Taiwan are excluded due to the lack of statistic area). Areal consistency in this
    study refers to the degree to which the boundaries of two cropland datasets match
    and coincide as well as their differences. To assess areal consistency, the cropland
    maps from each dataset were overlaid, and the proportion of the overlap was calculated
    as a proportion of the total cropland area in the cropland dataset being compared:
    (3) where is the area of overlapping regions of two pairwise cropland products,
    represents the area of assessed cropland datasets being compared, and denotes
    the proportion of consistency, where the maximum value does not exceed 100%. 2.5.
    Spatial consistency comparison Cropland is unevenly distributed in China, meaning
    that consistency in the overall area does not necessarily lead to spatial consistency.
    In this study, a pixel-by-pixel comparison was conducted on different products.
    The six cropland datasets were divided into 10-m and 30-m groups. In each group,
    the three binary cropland labels for each pixel were summed to yield the frequency
    (0–3) with which the pixel was labeled as cropland. A pixel labeled as cropland
    by at least one product thus showed either high, medium, or low cropland consistency.
    Spatial consistency was retrieved also from the samples. Cropland samples in the
    sample pools permits estimating not only the degree of cropland identification
    in each product but also the consistency and correctness of cropland labeling.
    2.6. Sample-based accuracy assessment Because the cropland labels were binarized,
    accuracy assessment was identical to binary classification testing. Unlike a single
    global estimate of classification accuracy provided by the dataset’s producers,
    individual samples were used to perform local accuracy assessment for cropland
    in a sub-region. Five metrics: user accuracy ( , also known as precision), producer
    accuracy ( , also known as recall or sensitivity), F1 score, overall accuracy
    ( ), and Matthews correlation coefficient ( ), were derived from the confusion
    matrix [46]. The calculation of these metrics is as follows: (4) (5) (6) (7) (8)
    where and represent true and false positive predictions of cropland class by the
    maps and and represent true and false negative predictions. 2.7. Analyses of factors
    influencing consistency The cropland products'' consistency across China could
    be attributed to natural and anthropogenic factors. Several potential factors
    (such as climate characteristics and pattern of terrain and parcels) can influence
    consistency. Most of the non-natural factors are affected by human activities
    directly or indirectly (for example, by government policy changes in land use
    or irrigation infrastructure). Based on our previous analysis and evidence from
    various relevant studies [33], we attributed the cropland product consistency
    across China primarily to the influence of agroclimatic zones, the pattern of
    parcels, and irrigation status. Using the agri-climate classification division
    boundary, we characterized the relationship between climatic distribution and
    spatial consistency. We divided China into 13 climate zones and 37 agricultural
    subzones according to temperature and wetness indicators (Fig. S3). This climate
    distribution was overlaid on the consistency map developed in the section 2.5
    and spatial consistency was calculated for each subzone. In view of China’s vast
    area and its land policy (such as the Household Responsibility System for Collective
    Farming policy which divided the collective cropland into individual parcels [47]),
    agronomic practices vary widely across the country, resulting in heterogeneity
    in patch size and degree of aggregation. The pattern of cropland parcels was also
    analyzed due to its previous discussion in related articles [48]. Three landscape
    indicators derived from the 10-m WC: mean patch size (MPS), edge density (ED),
    and fragmentation index (FI), were computed on 20-km grids using the SDMTools
    R package [49]. MPS, ED, and FI were calculated for each map in formula (9) to
    (11). In this calculation, each patch represents a single cropland parcel. (9)
    (10) (11) where and and represent respectively the number of patches, the area
    of patch in the projected coordinate system and the total length of patch. Furthermore,
    a LOESS fitting was performed in temperature or agricultural zone regions, and
    coefficients were calculated to quantify the relationship between pattern indicators
    and spatial consistency. The statistic were used to analyze the relationship between
    the shape of cropland and levels of spatial consistency. The proportions of irrigated
    cropland pixels were used to indicate irrigation levels ranging from 0 and 100%.
    The spatial consistency map was calculated for various irrigation levels. 3. Results
    3.1. Areal consistency The six LULC datasets-based cropland maps describe the
    spatial patterns in China. In general, most of the croplands are distributed in
    the monsoon region of east China and the northwestern region, while sporadic croplands
    occur in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (Fig. S4). The three 30-m products showed
    similar cropland distribution patterns, whereas the three 10-m products showed
    sparser cropland in southern China. GL30 has the largest cropland area in Chinese
    mainland, reaching 199.26 104 in 2020; while the ESRI has the smallest cropland
    area of 137.80 104 . The two products showed a difference of 30.84% in cropland
    areas. For cropland products with the same spatial resolution, the differences
    in the quantification of China’s cropland area are relatively small. Note that
    the 10-m products generally have a lower average area than 30-m products and are
    closer to the statistical data from the Yearbook. Although there are differences
    among these cropland datasets, they are somewhat consistent in portraying the
    spatial distribution of cropland across China. All datasets, especially the 30-m
    resolution products, overestimated the cropland area described in the Yearbook
    at the provincial level (Fig. 2A, B). Of the six products, all but DW showed a
    good correlation between statistics (Fig. 2C). The cropland area derived from
    WC gave the highest correlation with an of 0.96, indicating a more accurate estimation
    of cropland area than provided by the other five datasets. DW showed the poorest
    fit (  = 0.52) and the highest RMSE (12.85). In scatterplots (Fig. 2C), regression
    outliers indicate provincial administrations showing large differences between
    mapped cropland areas and census data, in particular Inner Mongolia in DW. 3.2.
    Spatial consistency among cropland maps Fig. 2 depicts the pixelwise spatial consistency
    for the six cropland datasets at 30-m resolution. The proportion of the six datasets
    that were completely agreement was only 26.6% and the proportion with the worst
    consistency was 28.3%. In contrast, 45.1% of the regions had 2–5 of the six datasets
    considered to be arable land. High-consistency areas were concentrated in middle-to-high
    latitude agricultural regions with flat terrain, primarily in the plains of northeastern
    and central China (east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line), and in the Hetao Plain and
    oases in the Tarim Basin. Owing to the favorable climate and advanced tillage
    technology, extensive and continuously distributed croplands were found mainly
    in these regions. An area of low consistency was found in the center of the Inner
    Mongolian Plateau. Low-consistency area (owing to commission caused by DW) accounted
    for nearly a quarter of the cropland area. The landscape in these regions was
    dominated by fragmented parcels mosaicked by diverse land cover types or sparse
    vegetation, making misclassification a common source of error in cropland extent
    mapping. Consistency among datasets with the same spatial resolution (Fig. S5)
    agreed with the consistency of the six datasets on a national scale. A zoomed-in
    illustration of six typical sites (Fig. 3A–F) demonstrates the differences between
    the cropland products. These sites’ spatial distributions are shown in Fig. S5.
    Both the 10-m and 30-m datasets accurately mapped the spatial extent of concentrated
    and continuous cropland evenly distributed in the broad plain area with high accuracy,
    except for DW, which showed the highest omission error. However, in areas with
    fragmented parcels (Fig. 3F) or complex backgrounds in transitional zones (Fig.
    3B), the 10-m products better delineated cropland boundaries. Among the three
    datasets with 30-m resolution, the cropland extent in the fragmented area was
    overestimated. The same overestimation was observed in cropland mapping in humid
    and semi-humid regions. GLC_FCS and CLCD described the spatial extent of cropland
    similarly to the 10-m datasets in most geographic areas. However, large discrepancies
    were found in highland valley regions such as the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (Fig.
    3E), with CLCD almost unable to detect the presence of cropland. The WC yielded
    a cropland distribution most similar to the actual cropland distribution, followed
    by ESRI, GLC_FCS, and CLCD. The performance of DW in depicting cropland parcels
    was relatively unstable. Download : Download high-res image (917KB) Download :

    3.3. Accuracy assessment with sample points Table 2 shows error matrix metrics.
    The overall accuracy in all products ranged from 81.9% to 92.3%, higher than the
    accuracy claimed by the product developers at the global scale. The 10-m products
    were more accurate than the 30-m products. WC showed the highest overall accuracy
    of 92.34%, followed by GL30 (86.24%), ESRI (85.33%), and CLCD (84.59%). Despite
    the overall accuracy of GLC_FCS being the lowest among the six products, the number
    was still 81.87%. With respect to omission error, DW ranked first with 26.1%.
    The highest omission error is reflected in the poorest fitting effect due to the
    overestimation of cropland area, especially in northern China provinces such as
    Inner Mongolia (Fig. 4A). The small omission error in WC (9.8%) is consistent
    with its performance in cropland estimation. For commission error, GLC_FCS exceeded
    other products with a value of 25.3%, matching its overestimation in the cropland
    area for all provinces. For MCC, a more appropriate metric for binary classification,
    WC still ranked first with 0.845, followed by GL30 and ESRI with Matthews correlation
    coefficient values above 0.70. They were followed by CLCD, DW, and GLC_FCS in
    descending order. Taking all metrics into consideration, WC gave the most balanced
    performance (higher overall accuracy and lower omission and commission error),
    followed by GL30. The accuracy of the six cropland maps on the scale of 13 climatic
    zones is illustrated in Table S3. Fig. 4 (b) depicts the positive relationship
    between the high accuracy represented by the average F1 score and the proportion

    the inconsistency of cropland maps 3.4.1. Performance in agri-climate zones Spatial
    heterogeneity across climatic and agricultural zones was visualized by overlaying
    the consistency map (Section 3.4) with the boundaries of agriclimatic zones (Fig.
    S3). The consistency between 10-m and 30-m products was similar across temperature
    zones (Fig. 5). For both 10-m and 30-m consistency comparison, the level of high
    consistency dominated the components in warm temperate (53.97% and 60.98% respectively)
    and mid-temperate (54.56% and 68.32% respectively), while the level of low consistency
    dominated in arid temperate (61.07% and 37.49% respectively), cold temperate (54.97%
    and 64.43% respectively) and Plateau climate zones (60.73%–99.19% and 57.64%–99.95%
    respectively). Differences lay mainly in Arid Warm Temperate and Arid Temperate,
    where the proportion of medium-level consistency varied widely. Download : Download

    (A, C) and (B, D) show the 10-m and 30-m consistency maps, respectively. The full
    names of the x-axis labels can be found in Tables S1 and S2. At the level of the
    37 agricultural zones, the high-consistency proportions were located mainly in
    regions with suitable farming conditions shaped by climate. In the 10-m products,
    the highest proportions of complete agreement (with percentages above or below
    but close to 50%) were distributed mainly in the North China Plain (NCP, 68.19%),
    Songliao Basin (62.18%), Northern Xinjiang (55.36%), and Liaodong-Shandong Peninsula
    (50.85%), followed by Southern Xinjiang (49.36%), Northwestern Xinjiang Mountainous
    (48.39%), Middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (47.28%) and Middle and
    Upper Reaches of the Han River (46.98%). These areas have a high concentration
    of population and well-developed agriculture. The spatial distribution of arable
    land is dense and the size of individual parcels is large, making them well-monitored
    by satellites at either 30-m or 10-m spatial resolution. The spatial distribution
    of high consistency was broader and more uniform in 30-m than in 10-m products
    across China. In addition to the same areas as the 10-m data, the following areas
    also showed high agreement: Sanjiang Plain (77.70%), Sichuan Basin (68.63%), Hinggan
    and the Changbai mountain (60.18%), and Northern Taiwan (50.31%) for 30-m cropland
    products, with over 50% pixels showing high agreement. In contrast to the pattern
    of high-consistency distribution, the low-consistency areas of the two resolution
    products are highly coincident in spatial distribution. In some regions, the low-consistency
    ratio even exceeded 80%, such as in the Hinggan Mountains, the Hengduan Mountains,
    and Xizang or Qiangtang areas with extreme climates. Among them, the Qinghai-Xizang
    Plateau is known as the third pole of the earth, where high-altitude solar radiation
    is intense and cumulative temperatures are low. Most areas have an arid climate
    and insufficient water for irrigation, resulting in poor crop growing conditions.
    Only in some lower-altitude areas, such as the southern Yarlung Zangbo River valley,
    the eastern Huangshui valley, arable land is located mainly in the river valley
    zone terraces. These areas have a large elevation drop, and the already sparse
    cropland is interspersed with bare land or mixed with other vegetation, such as
    coniferous forests. The combination of multiple types of vegetation and cropland
    prevented the dataset from achieving greater consistency in cropland mapping.
    The semi-humid semi-arid zone in northwestern-northern China is an eco-vulnerable
    zone that spans a wide range of longitudinal gradients. There were large differences
    in spatial consistency within the agricultural zones of the region. This is mainly
    because the region is influenced by various factors, such as the degree of agricultural
    land development and utilization, the level of socio-economic development, and
    agricultural management practices. As several of the most agriculturally developed
    regions in northwest China, the Hexi Corridor, which is irrigated by the glacier
    meltwater, and the Hetao Plain, which has the benefit of irrigation by the Yellow
    River, have the highest consistency. For the same reason, the Xinjiang oasis arable
    land region with similar resource conditions also showed high spatial consistency.
    3.4.2. Landscape fragmentation pattern In the grids with 20 km resolution, grids
    with lower MPS and higher ED tended to have larger FI values, indicating more
    fragmented agricultural landscapes with smaller cultivated parcels or more discrete
    distributions. MPS is a ratio-type indicator with a directly comparable scale.
    For the temperature zone scale, regions with small MPS values (the values of the
    horizontal coordinates in Fig. 6) were distributed mainly in the vast hilly areas
    south of the Qinling-Huaihe River (MGTR, MTR, SS) or in the high-altitude cold
    regions (PS, PCT). Download : Download high-res image (848KB) Download : Download

    in four representative climate zones (MS, NS, SS, and WT). All 13 climate-zone-level
    correlations can be seen in Fig. S8. There were positive correlations between
    FI, ED, and inconsistency at the temperature-zone level, with reaching 0.787,
    and P-value less than 0.001. In contrast, there was a significant positive correlation
    between MPS and consistency. In both 10-m and 30-m products, regions with concentrated
    distribution of cropland, large parcel sizes, and even agricultural landscape
    homogeneity such as AT, AWT, and MS reduce the difficulty of satellite mapping,
    thereby reducing inconsistency between cropland datasets. 3.4.3. Irrigation Fig.
    7A shows that the high consistency of cropland datasets tended to increase with
    the proportion of irrigated cropland at the low to medium irrigation levels (<
    60%) level. In contrast, low consistency tended to decrease as the irrigation
    percentage increased before the maximum interval of irrigation rate (60%–75%)
    was reached. Regions with a larger share of irrigated cropland (usually accounting
    for over 60 %) yielded high consistency among cropland mapping products, with
    high agreement reaching 74.57%. High consistency ranged from 54.34% to 65.62%,
    and low consistency ranged from 17.96% to 24.78% in the middle interval of irrigated
    cropland (30%–60%), indicating comparatively high consistency. The regions with
    irrigated proportion below 30% showed the poorest spatial agreement of cropland
    mapping datasets. These regions have the lowest irrigation rates in the six groups,
    resulting in the highest proportion (up to 54.20%) of disagreement owing to relatively
    unsuitable farming conditions caused by scattered tiny fields or climate conditions
    and the relative backwardness of irrigation techniques. Download : Download high-res

    of the 10-m cropland dataset within 11 climate zones and 32 agri-zones (excluding
    two temperate zones and five agri-zones where there was no irrigated cropland).
    Tendency was found in most regions, except for PS in the temperature zone and
    SQ in the agri-climate zone, where there was a near absence of scatter representing
    irrigated cropland. To further investigate the relationship, we divided the 32
    agri-zones containing irrigated cropland into two categories: below and above
    the 800 mm isoprecipitation line (Fig. 7B). For agri-zones located north of the
    800 mm isoprecipitation line, which typically receive less than 800 mm of annual
    precipitation, the proportion of low-consistency pixels within the region gradually
    decreased as the proportion of irrigation increased. This trend was not as clear
    for irrigated cropland in the south. A more detailed quantitative relationship
    analysis of each agri-zone and temperature zone is presented in Figs. S10, S11.
    4. Discussion 4.1. Reasons for inconsistency among cropland maps The first reason
    for the discrepancies in cropland assignment among mapping datasets was the inconsistent
    definition of cropland in the classification system used. The definition of cropland
    varies between datasets, and the six datasets tended to adopt a broader interpretation
    of cropland than specified in the classification system (Table 1). For example,
    the inclusion of grasslands in DW and herbaceous or shrub cover in GLC_FCS contributed
    to overestimating cropland area (Fig. 2A). This inconsistency in definition is
    also the primary reason for the overestimation of cropland area in all datasets
    with respect to the official land survey [15]. Finding a consensus on a definition
    of cropland that can satisfy both remote sensing datasets and the mapping capabilities
    of the algorithms, while also meeting the commonly accepted needs of tillage science,
    could reduce the inconsistency among remote sensing-derived cropland datasets.
    The definitions of cropland in all six datasets evaluated in the study include
    human-planted cereal crops, but vary to include cereals, grass, shrubs, and economic
    crops. GLC_FCS differentiates between four subcategories of cropland: rainfed
    cropland, irrigated cropland, herbaceous cover, and shrub-covered surfaces [16].
    We recommended that producers of remotely sensed maps of cropland should first
    focus on mapping cropland accurately following the consensus definition and only
    then consider developing maps of other land-cover types associated with cropland
    systems. To achieve this, more attention should be paid to abandoned cropland,
    irrigated cropland, shrub- and grass-covered cropland, and cash crops and cereals,
    which are difficult to distinguish from conventional medium-resolution optical
    remote-sensing data. A path towards the realization of the above recommendations
    is to make full use of higher-resolution optical data, to combine remote sensing
    data from multiple sources such as radar and LiDAR, and to promote the sharing
    of ground-based crowdsourced samples [50] for more accurate mapping of cropland
    systems. Five of the six cropland products were produced using cloud computing
    technology (on Google, Amazon, or private cloud-computing platforms), but their
    performance in China varied greatly, even though they were derived from the same
    data source. The semi-automated classification with human intervention of GL30
    showed a closer match to official statistics with respect to the definition of
    arable land [13]. The increased spatial resolution of the 10-m datasets contributed
    to their superiority in matching the official statistics (Fig. 2) and delineating
    parcel boundaries (Fig. 3), in agreement with the findings of Lu et al. [51].
    Owing to the higher spatial resolution, the proportion of mixed image elements
    in heterogeneous regions was greatly reduced, particularly in southern hilly and
    mountainous regions (Fig. 3E). However, the 30-m products, such as GLC_FCS and
    CLCD, still offered advantages. GLC_FCS performed better than all 10-m products
    in characterizing cropland subtypes and delineating the extent of irrigated cropland
    (Fig. 3D), owing to its detailed classification system with four subtypes of cropland
    (shown in Table 1). This is also consistent with the findings of our previous
    research [33]. In addition, CLCD’s annual long-time-series mapping capability
    has played an irreplaceable role in mapping the spatial and temporal dynamics
    of cropland on a time-series national scale since the 1980s. The ability to map
    long time series of cropland dating back to the 1980s is not possible with existing
    10-m data under current data-processing schemes. 4.2. Importance of regional scale
    evaluation Our study also emphasizes the importance of evaluating the accuracy
    of cropland mapping products on a regional scale. The three 10-m products showed
    higher overall accuracy than the 30-m products (Fig. 4). The overall accuracy
    of these products in China differed from the global accuracy reported by their
    producers. WC had the highest overall accuracy of 92.34% across China, followed
    by ESRI and DW, which differs from worldwide results [26]. DW’s accuracy in China
    was much lower than its reported global accuracy, owing to the huge commission
    error caused by massive misclassification in Inner Mongolia Gobi regions (Fig.
    S9B). Among the 30-m datasets, CLCD had the highest accuracy, followed by GL30
    and GLC_FCS. This finding is consistent with those from a previously reported
    comparison [33] of five 30-m datasets. The reasons for the discrepancies are also
    associated with the definition of cropland, the characteristics of the validation
    data and the temporal phase of cropland mapping datasets. While the validation
    dataset is a binary shapefile data format of cropland/non-cropland, in reality
    however, the distinction between cropland and non-cropland is not absolutely strict
    (being confounded by widespread cropland abandonment, also known as de-farming
    [52], de-fooding [53], etc.). This means that conventional hard classification
    strategies cannot represent this natural process well. Moreover, in semi-arid
    or semi-humid regions with intense surface vegetation dynamics, the process of
    surface cover change in arable land within a year is complex [47]. This complexity
    prevents cropland datasets with a lower update frequency (like the annual-scale
    cropland mapping products) from accurately labeling cropland, resulting in reduced
    overall accuracy. In this way, the GLC_FCS dataset, with its refined cropland
    subclass mapping capability, represents the future direction of soft classification
    strategies. In the meantime, the utility of DW in mapping near-real-time dynamics
    should be recognized and valued. The six cropland maps showed high consistency,
    particularly in agricultural zones such as NCP, SCB, and SJP. This means that
    both maps performed quite well in these regions. These regions are distinguished
    by climates, soils, and topographies that are favorable for agricultural cultivation.
    They are prominently represented in Fig. 1 as areas shaded in blue, indicating
    a cropland frequency of greater than or equal to 5. In these regions, the differences
    in the application of various cropland maps due to inconsistencies can be significantly
    reduced compared to other regions. This reduction in inconsistency becomes particularly
    important when cropland maps are used as masks for predicting the impacts of hazards,
    such as floods [54]. 4.3. Effects of climate and irrigation on spatial consistency
    Producing cropland datasets is inherently difficult owing to the extensive biogeographical
    variation within and across biomes, resulting in diverse spectral signatures.
    For this reason, differences and inconsistencies among datasets are unsurprising.
    Spatial heterogeneity of consistency across climatic and agricultural zones was
    observed in the analysis based on parcel patterns and agricultural land management
    measures represented by irrigation. Spatial consistency was negatively correlated
    with the degree of fragmentation of arable land, and consistency was generally
    higher in areas with suitable climatic conditions and developed irrigation management.
    In agricultural areas suitable for farming, the more concentrated and contiguous
    the distribution of cropland and the larger the average patch size, the larger
    was the MPS and the smaller the FI, as reflected in Fig. 6. Thus, the probability
    of pure cropland pixels is higher for optical satellite data with a spatial resolution
    of 30 m or 10 m, so that the difference in the cropland mapping result between
    the two spatial resolution products in these regions is small. In contrast, for
    areas with relatively small patch area and fragmented distribution, increasing
    the spatial resolution of remote sensing will improve arable-land mapping. Irrigation
    affects the performance of arable mapping products and consistency among datasets
    by influencing the degree of spectral variation in farmland. Such agricultural
    practices have a stronger effect on irrigated cropland area north of the 800 mm
    isoprecipitation line. In this region, the heterogeneity of spectral features
    between cropland and grassland or shrubland gradually increased with irrigation
    percentage, increasing the separability of features and the consistency of remote
    sensing mapping products for cropland [55]. Our study highlights the importance
    of a consistent definition of cropland and the effect of spatial resolution in
    producing accurate and consistent datasets, as well as the necessity of correction
    of global maps at local scale and the effect of parcel and land management practice
    on accurate cropland mapping. 4.4. Uncertainties of works and implications for
    future studies Differences in definitions of cropland lead to inconsistency among
    remote-sensing mapping products, even after reclassification into cropland thematic
    maps. However, this inaccuracy caused by different classification schemes is unavoidable
    before the widely acceptable agreement is reached. Secondly, cropland area calculation
    by pixel counting is affected by mixing of cropland and other land cover types
    in a single pixel. Small parcels that blend with natural vegetation increase the
    difficulty of accurate classification, resulting in greater variation and less
    consistency in these areas. Although the 10-m data contain fewer mixed image elements
    than 30-m data, they still cannot be completely avoided in the mapping process,
    especially in southern or mountainous regions. Mixed categorization of cropland
    and grassland and forest land, which is common in southern China, usually leads
    to overestimation of cropland area. In contrast, the omission of cropland in the
    Qinghai-Xizang Plateau region leads to underestimation of area [56]. Design-based
    inference [57], which has been widely used to adjust for errors in remote sensing,
    may improve area estimation and promote to the wall-to-wall mapping. The year-long
    compositing of DW, performed to allow comparison with the other datasets, may
    introduce errors in near-real-time datasets such as the overestimation of cultivated
    land in the Inner Mongolia region (Fig. 2C). To demonstrate the stability of the
    method of mode compositing method for the near real-time datasets, we also changed
    to other data compositing methods and compared them with the statistical data
    and found that the performance of DW annual compositing data remained stable,
    suggesting that MODE compositing method was reasonable. Since comparisons in this
    study were made only for the common time window within the year of 2020, long
    time-series cropland maps are valuable for agricultural management, although the
    dynamic updating of samples on an inter-annual basis and retrospective mapping
    of 10-m data are laborious. Future attention should be paid to the assessment
    of the accuracy and consistency of time-series cropland maps based on state-of-the
    art algorithms such as change detection method [58]. The accuracy of the statistics
    used in this study may be affected by the third national land survey in China
    starting at the end of 2019 and differences in the reliability of statistical
    data at various levels of administrative units. The latest available statistics
    may be out of date compared to the real situation in 2020. Liu et al. [59] also
    pointed out that there are differences in the reliability of statistical data
    at different administrative levels. Given that the overall accuracy of the six
    arable land datasets based on ground-truth points was, in fact, higher on the
    national scale, there may have been errors in the validation of the provincial
    scale. But comparison with official statistics is still a widely used method in
    addition to cross-validation for assessing the accuracy of remote-sensed datasets.
    Despite these uncertainties, the prospect and use of 10-m state-of-the-art products
    are promising for their application in retrieving details of patterns and dynamics
    in surface processes. Existing 30-m remote sensing data is becoming increasingly
    stable and abundant, further contributing to the development of arable land mapping
    [60]. Although our study provides a primary reference for the performance of existing
    cropland maps in China for the base year of 2020, it remains to be seen which
    cropland product provides the least error in characterizing cropland dynamics
    in time series analysis, especially to meet the demand of continuous land change
    monitoring. Open-source validation samples and the emerging paradigm of citizen
    science sample collection offer new avenues for more comprehensive and timely
    assessment and comparison of multiple arable land products [61]. Our previous
    studies have confirmed that thematic cropland datasets perform better than full-element
    LULC products [33]. We recommend that future efforts be made to improve the performance
    of the algorithms for the regions indicated above, as well as in the development
    of mapping agricultural management or tillage practice measures in areas with
    relatively stable cropland extent, such as crop types [62], cropland abandonment
    [63], and cover crops [64]. 5. Conclusions Accurately mapping cropland extent
    and area is crucial for effective agricultural management and development. This
    study provides crucial insights into the accuracy and consistency of six state-of-the-art
    cropland datasets in China. Through a cross-resolution investigation, we assessed
    the consistency of these datasets and evaluated their accuracy based on extensive
    field samples. The pairwise consistencies of Chinese cropland area estimated by
    six remote-sensing-derived mapping products ranged from 57% to 96%. All products
    overestimated cropland area relative to census statistics, with coarser-resolution
    datasets displaying higher overestimation. WC yielded the highest fitness in comparison
    to the statistical area by province and DW performed worst owing to huge commission
    errors. Spatial disagreement ranged from 27% to 38%. Individual sample-based validation
    highlighted the superior performance of the 10-m WC dataset. Datasets with 10-m
    resolution captured more spatial detail than 30-m datasets. Spatial consistency
    was negatively associated with cropland fragmentation. Regions with higher accuracy,
    suitable climatic conditions, and well-developed agricultural management practices
    showed higher consistency. Continuous improvements in accurately mapping national
    cropland are needed, with particular attention to addressing spatial inconsistency
    and accounting for regional natural conditions and agricultural management practices.

  description: 'CONTEXT: Saline water irrigation presents a viable solution to alleviate
    freshwater scarcity. However, it''s crucial to consider the threshold of salinity,
    as excessive levels can adversely affect crop yield, crop productivity and soil
    sustainability. Additionally, due to varying surface conditions and management
    practices at the regional level, a distributed approach to saline water irrigation
    management is necessary. OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this research was to develop
    a regional agro-hydrological crop model. The validated regional model was then
    employed to identify the spatial water salinity threshold for saline water irrigation.
    METHODS: In this research, we utilized the WAVES (WAter Vegetation Energy and
    Solute model), which was adapted for mulching environment and validated in severely
    arid and saline fields. To account for spatial variations, we applied a distributed
    method to upscale the WAVES to the regional level. Multisource and multiscale
    data were used for regional model validation. Different scenarios of salinity
    levels for saline water irrigation were simulated, and a comprehensive criterion
    to determine water salinity threshold was proposed considering cotton yield, water
    productivity and soil salt accumulation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Model evaluation
    indicated a high level of accuracy for the developed regional model. The comparison
    between simulated and measured values for soil salt content, soil water content,
    cotton leaf area index, measured lint yield, and statistical yield resulted in
    indices of agreement of 0.90, 0.71, 0.93, 0.58, and 0.70, respectively. The validated
    regional model was employed to simulate various saline water irrigation scenarios.
    The findings revealed that under identical irrigation water salinity, cotton cultivation
    on sandy loam soil is more productive but has a larger yield reduction percentage
    compared to silty loam soil. Moreover, the research indicates a groundwater depth
    of 1.5 m is associated with higher cotton production. Additionally, a spatial
    pattern of the irrigation water salinity threshold for saline water irrigation
    was determined, suggesting that the water salinity in most areas of the Tarim
    Irrigation District should not exceed 6 g L−1. Notably, in the current practice
    of pumping groundwater in situ for irrigation, approximately 46% of the areas
    are at risk, indicating that it''s not suitable for saline water irrigation. SIGNIFICANCE:
    This study developed a distributed model under a typical irrigation district characterized
    by mulching, severe drought and salinization and defined the distributed spatial
    threshold for saline water irrigation. These research results hold significant
    implications for guiding regional-scale saline water irrigation and groundwater
    extraction.'

    in the Tarim Irrigation District is 6 g L−1. • 46% of the area are not suitable
    using in-situ groundwater for irrigation. Abstract CONTEXT Saline water irrigation
    presents a viable solution to alleviate freshwater scarcity. However, it''s crucial
    to consider the threshold of salinity, as excessive levels can adversely affect
    crop yield, crop productivity and soil sustainability. Additionally, due to varying
    surface conditions and management practices at the regional level, a distributed
    approach to saline water irrigation management is necessary. OBJECTIVE The primary
    goal of this research was to develop a regional agro-hydrological crop model.
    The validated regional model was then employed to identify the spatial water salinity
    threshold for saline water irrigation. METHODS In this research, we utilized the
    WAVES (WAter Vegetation Energy and Solute model), which was adapted for mulching
    environment and validated in severely arid and saline fields. To account for spatial
    variations, we applied a distributed method to upscale the WAVES to the regional
    level. Multisource and multiscale data were used for regional model validation.
    Different scenarios of salinity levels for saline water irrigation were simulated,
    and a comprehensive criterion to determine water salinity threshold was proposed
    considering cotton yield, water productivity and soil salt accumulation. RESULTS
    AND CONCLUSIONS Model evaluation indicated a high level of accuracy for the developed
    regional model. The comparison between simulated and measured values for soil
    salt content, soil water content, cotton leaf area index, measured lint yield,
    and statistical yield resulted in indices of agreement of 0.90, 0.71, 0.93, 0.58,
    and 0.70, respectively. The validated regional model was employed to simulate
    various saline water irrigation scenarios. The findings revealed that under identical
    irrigation water salinity, cotton cultivation on sandy loam soil is more productive
    but has a larger yield reduction percentage compared to silty loam soil. Moreover,
    the research indicates a groundwater depth of 1.5 m is associated with higher
    cotton production. Additionally, a spatial pattern of the irrigation water salinity
    threshold for saline water irrigation was determined, suggesting that the water
    salinity in most areas of the Tarim Irrigation District should not exceed 6 g
    L−1. Notably, in the current practice of pumping groundwater in situ for irrigation,
    approximately 46% of the areas are at risk, indicating that it''s not suitable
    for saline water irrigation. SIGNIFICANCE This study developed a distributed model
    under a typical irrigation district characterized by mulching, severe drought
    and salinization and defined the distributed spatial threshold for saline water
    irrigation. These research results hold significant implications for guiding regional-scale
    saline water irrigation and groundwater extraction. Graphical abstract Download

    water salinity thresholdTarim irrigation district 1. Introduction Water scarcity
    is a significant constraint on global agricultural production. Researchers have
    been exploring alternative irrigation methods to address the growing demand for
    food and water resources. Among these methods, the use of saline water has emerged
    as a potential solution to mitigate water scarcity in regions with limited freshwater
    resources, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas (Huang et al., 2012; Qadir
    et al., 2007; Reca et al., 2018). Cotton, considered a salt-tolerant plant (Allen
    et al., 1998), holds promise for saline water irrigation. Notably, cotton is a
    key economic crop in Xinjiang, Northwest China. In 2022, China accounted for 24%
    of global cotton production (Meyer and Dew, 2022), with 90% of China''s cotton
    being grown in Xinjiang (National Bureau of Statistics, 2022). Given the region''s
    low precipitation and high evaporation rates, irrigation plays a vital role in
    Xinjiang''s agriculture, but freshwater resources are scarce. Hence, saline water
    serves as an important alternative for irrigation. Xinjiang possesses about 34.21
    billion tons of saline water resources, representing 13.2% of the country''s available
    saline water reserves, with significant potential for development and utilization
    (Chen et al., 2021). Research by Li et al. (2014) on the plain area of the Tarim
    Basin in Xinjiang indicated that approximately 82.5% of shallow groundwater sources
    in the region have a salinity level exceeding 1 g L−1. Additionally, Dong and
    Deng (2005) found that the area with groundwater salinity ranging from 3 to 5
    g L−1 in the same plain area of the Tarim Basin covers about 44,264.34 km2. The
    widespread availability of underground saline water resources presents a promising
    opportunity for irrigation in Xinjiang, and responsible use of saline water could
    help bridge the gap between freshwater demand and supply. Numerous experimental
    studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of saline water irrigation
    on cotton. Overall, saline water irrigation can induce salt stress in cotton,
    impacting its growth (Chen et al., 2018; Min et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018)
    and leading to soil quality deterioration (Devkota et al., 2022; Forkutsa et al.,
    2009; Mandal et al., 2008). However, some studies have demonstrated that when
    applied within a certain salinity range, saline water irrigation does not result
    in reduced cotton yield (Moreno et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2020), compromised
    cotton quality (Mantell et al., 1985; Zhang et al., 2020), or soil quality deterioration
    (Wang et al., 2017). In fact, at controlled salinity levels, saline water irrigation
    can even enhance cotton yield (Ren et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2020). Thus, there
    appears to be a safety threshold for saline water irrigation, within which negative
    impacts on crops, soil, and the environment can be minimized, while maximizing
    benefits. The specific safety threshold for saline water irrigation varies across
    different regions, as indicated by experiments. For instance, in Shihezi, Xinjiang,
    China, the water salinity threshold of a 10% yield decline is 4.61 dS m−1 (equivalent
    to 2.89 g L−1) (Min et al., 2014). In Hengshui, China, it is 8.8 dS m−1 (equivalent
    to 5.69 g L−1) (Zhang et al., 2018). In Spain, the threshold is reported to be
    22.7 dS m−1 (equivalent to 14.99 g L−1) with one irrigation event with saline
    water (Moreno et al., 2001). In Israel, when the irrigation water salinity is
    7.3 dS m−1 (equivalent to 4.69 g L−1), no significant cotton yield decline was
    observed (Mantell et al., 1985). In India, it is possible to use the saline water
    up to 14 dS m−1 (equivalent to 9.17 g L−1) alternatively with canal water for
    cotton-wheat rotation in both sandy loam and loamy sand soils (Singh, 2004). Additionally,
    Bezborodov et al. (2010) found that mulching can result in higher yield and water
    productivity compared to non-mulching practices under saline water irrigation.
    These variations in the threshold can be attributed to differences in regional
    factors such as field management (mulching or not), soil properties, and climate.
    Therefore, distinguishing spatial heterogeneity conditions are crucial for developing
    a reasonable saline water irrigation management system. Field experiments provide
    valuable insights into the response of cotton to irrigation salinity under specific
    conditions, but they are limited in their ability to test all scenarios due to
    time, labor, and financial constraints. Validated numerical models, however, serve
    as powerful tools to compensate for these limitations. Researchers worldwide have
    proposed various models to quantitatively describe soil water-salt dynamics, crop
    growth, and final yield under saline irrigation conditions. Examples include AquaCrop
    (Zhang et al., 2022), HYDRUS (Shan et al., 2022), SALTMED (Soothar et al., 2019),
    SWAP (Verma et al., 2012), and ENVIRO-GRO (Chen et al., 2010). Nevertheless, few
    crop models have been utilized for mulched crops in extreme drought and severely
    saline alkali areas, that is soil salt content exceeding 6 g kg−1 (Gao et al.,
    2011). Limited research under severely saline alkali areas has led to suboptimal
    results (Qureshi et al., 2013; Su et al., 2005). Among the few available studies,
    the process-based WAVES model demonstrated successful calibration and application
    in Southern Xinjiang, China, an area afflicted by severe water and salt stress
    (Yu et al., 2021). Modifications were made to account for film mulching effects,
    making it more suitable for application in mulching environments in Xinjiang (Yu
    et al., 2023). In saline water irrigation, the combination of underlying surface
    conditions and management practices has varying effects on crop yield, necessitating
    accurate assessment for the rational formulation of a saline water irrigation
    management system. At the regional scale, Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
    have enabled the analysis of spatial variations in factors like climate, soil,
    and groundwater. Building upon this foundation, several spatially distributed
    models have been developed, including AquaCrop (Lorite et al., 2013) and SWAP
    (Li and Ren, 2022), which have been upscaled to the regional level to consider
    spatial heterogeneity. However, it is worth noting that there is a scarcity of
    modeling research applied in severely saline alkali areas, as well as a lack of
    regional scale simulations under mulching environments. For example, Li and Ren
    (2021) evaluated saline water irrigation schemes using a distributed agro-hydrological
    model for maize and wheat on non-saline or slightly saline soil (< 3 g kg−1).
    To the best of our knowledge, existing regional models rarely explore the adaptability
    of saline water irrigation and the regional irrigation water salinity threshold.
    The WAVES model has been successfully calibrated and verified using data from
    saline water irrigation experiments in an extreme drought and salinization environment
    under mulching (Yu et al., 2021). Considering the different underlying surface
    conditions in the irrigation district, the constructed regional WAVES model holds
    promise in guiding local distributed management of saline water irrigation. Considering
    all these factors, the present study developed a distributed agro-hydrological
    crop model to address the challenges of severe salinization and mulching conditions.
    The main objectives of this paper are: 1) to assess the accuracy of regional simulations
    using the constructed regional WAVES model; 2) to analyze the regional patterns
    of crop yield and water productivity under current management practices; and 3)
    to determine the spatially distributed threshold of irrigation water salinity.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Overview of the study area The study was conducted
    in the Tarim Irrigation District of the First Division of the Xinjiang Corps,
    China (Fig. 1, E 81°30′-82°00′，N 40°23′-40°65′, altitude 987–1047 m). This district
    is situated on the northwest border of China, covering an area of approximately
    150 km from east to west and 40 km from north to south. The terrain slopes from
    northwest to southeast within the district, and it is traversed by the Tarim River,
    the largest inland river in China. On the southern side of the Tarim Irrigation
    District lies the Taklimakan Desert. The region exhibits typical characteristics
    of oasis irrigated agriculture in arid zones, with agriculture heavily reliant
    on irrigation. Cotton cultivation in the Tarim Irrigation District is conducted
    under plastic film cover, and the primary source of irrigation water is the freshwater
    from the Tarim River. The local climate features an average annual temperature
    of 11.3 °C, rainfall of 45.7 mm, relative humidity of 48%, sunshine hours of 2948
    h, pan evaporation of 2500 mm, and solar radiation of 6000 MJ m−2 (Hu et al.,
    2013). Cotton dominates the irrigation area, accounting for over 84% of the total
    sowing area (2020 Corps Statistical Yearbook). It serves as a vital income source
    for local farmers and a significant high-quality cotton base for China (Zhao et
    al., 2015). This study focuses on the cotton crop. Download : Download high-res

    the sampling location. 2.2. Acquisition of the data 2.2.1. Sampling data In April,
    June, September, and October 2021, four regional samplings were conducted in the
    Tarim Irrigation District, with the sampling points indicated in Fig. 1. Soil
    samples were collected during these surveys to analyze the soil water content
    and soil salt content within the 0–1 m depth (divided into five layers of 20 cm
    each). Gravimetric method was used to measure the soil water content, while the
    soil salt content was initially expressed as soil water electrical conductivity
    (EC1:5, dS m−1). The EC1:5 was measured using a Mettler-Toledo S230 instrument
    (Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Switzerland) on 1:5 extracts of soil and water
    (by weight). An empirical formula (SSC = 4.61∙ EC1:5) was employed to establish
    the conversion relationship (Hu et al., 2013) between EC1:5 and soil salt content
    (SSC, g kg−1). Moreover, the soil samples obtained during the first survey were
    used to determine the soil particle size distribution through a Mastersizer 2000
    laser particle size analyzer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, U.K.),
    with texture classified according to the American Soil Texture Classification
    System. Lastly, during the fourth survey, cotton yield data was collected. 2.2.2.
    Statistical data The regional groundwater depth and groundwater salinity data
    were obtained from the “Report on Investigation and Evaluation of Groundwater
    Resources and Delineation of Overexploited Areas of the First Division of Xinjiang
    Production and Construction Corps.” During the growing season, the irrigation
    amount applied is 400 mm, with an irrigation interval of 7 days. The irrigation
    water salinity is 1 g L−1. Meteorological data, including daily minimum temperature,
    daily maximum temperature, and precipitation, were collected from the weather
    station within the Tarim Irrigation District. The statistical yields for each
    town were also obtained. 2.2.3. Remote sensing retrieval of cotton planting area
    The method used to determine the cotton planting area is as follows. Three Sentinel
    2 remote sensing (RS) images were collected on April 29, June 23, and September
    6, 2021 from Copernicus Services Data Hub (https://cophub.copernicus.eu/). The
    supervised classification method of random forest was selected for the analysis,
    using the spectral characteristics of the three dates as input. During the surveys,
    land use and crop types were recorded. The records from the last three surveys
    were used as training datasets, while the first survey record was used as the
    testing dataset. The verification accuracy was found to be 80.12%, and a land
    use map of the Tarim Irrigation District in 2021 was generated. This map was resampled
    (using the Majority method) to a scale of 1 km 1 km, and the areas classified
    as cotton were considered for the research in this study. Therefore, this study
    is based on the cotton planting areas obtained from this section. 2.3. Distributed
    WAVES model 2.3.1. Modified field-scale WAVES model In this study, we employed
    the WAVES (the WAter Vegetation Energy and Solute model), which was developed
    by CSIRO in 1993. WAVES is a process-based daily time-step model capable of simulating
    energy, water, carbon, and solute processes in the one-dimensional soil-canopy-atmosphere
    system. It strikes a favorable balance between complexity, utility, and accuracy
    and has been extensively tested and applied in various contexts. For detailed
    principles of the model, please refer to Zhang and Dawes (1998). The research
    by Yu et al. (2021) demonstrated that the WAVES model can effectively simulate
    the response of cotton to water and salt stress in areas characterized by extreme
    drought and high salinity. Given that film mulching is widely used in cotton production
    in the Tarim Irrigation District, we incorporated relevant modifications into
    the WAVES model. Three functions were added, considering the film mulching effect
    on potential evaporation, underlying surface reflectance, and soil resistance.
    Detailed formulas and processes can be found in Yu et al. (2023). After revising
    the model, we conducted sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method and parameter
    calibration employing the SCE—UA method. The modified field-scale WAVES model
    was validated through experiments conducted on silt loam and sandy loam and experiments
    involving saline water irrigation. The simulated soil water content, soil salt
    content, cotton leaf area index (LAI), and cotton yield were compared with the
    measured values. The flow chart of the field-scale model is depicted in Fig. 2.

    2. Operational flow of the regional WAVES model. 2.3.2. Regional simulation method
    Due to the spatial variations in soil salinity, texture, and groundwater conditions,
    the one-dimensional hydrological crop model cannot directly capture regional farmland
    processes. In this study, we upscaled the WAVES model in a distributed manner
    to analyze agricultural hydrological processes and crop growth at the regional
    scale. We partitioned the study area into uniform grids with each measuring 1
    km 1 km. Each grid was assigned different model inputs to account for spatial
    heterogeneity. RS images and machine learning methods were used to generate a
    map of the cotton growing regions. ArcGIS was employed to extract various spatially
    heterogeneous data into grids for simulation. Soil texture, initial soil salt
    content, and initial soil water content were obtained by interpolating survey
    data from the Tarim Irrigation District using the Inverse Distance Weighting method.
    Groundwater depth and salinity data were collected from statistical sources. Soil
    hydraulic properties were selected based on soil texture and recommended values,
    as listed in Table 1. The distribution of soil texture, initial soil salt content,
    groundwater depth, and groundwater salinity in the regional soil surface (0–20
    cm) is shown in Fig. 3. The sowing date was April 14, and crop parameters were
    adopted from Yu et al., 2023. The WAVES model was independently operated on each
    grid with specific environmental conditions, and batch processing of the model
    was conducted using MATLAB (R2020b). Spatial visualization analysis of the simulation
    results was carried out through the ArcGIS (10.6) platform. Table 1. Soil characteristic

    District. The area marked by the red box in the figure is a typical area of severe
    salinization. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
    the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 2.3.3. Model evaluation
    Model verification involves comparing the simulated values with the measured data
    for soil salt content, soil water content, measured yield, and statistical yield.
    Additionally, the LAI data product at a resolution of 500 m from MODIS (http://glass.umd.edu/Download.html)
    was downloaded and compared with the corresponding simulated values. To evaluate
    the model performance, statistical indices such as the correlation coefficient
    (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and index of agreement (IoA) were calculated
    using the following equations: (1) (2) (3) where Oi and Si are the observed and
    simulated values, respectively, and is the average of observed and simulated values,
    and n is the number of observations. Crop water productivity (WP) was calculated
    using Eq. (4) as follows: (4) where WP represents crop water productivity (kg
    m−3), Y stands for cotton lint yield (kg ha−1), and ET denotes crop evapotranspiration
    (m3 ha−1) during the growing season. 2.4. Scenarios of saline water irrigation
    Various scenarios were established to investigate how crop yield responds to different
    irrigation water salinity levels in the Tarim Irrigation District and to identify
    the threshold at which excessive yield reduction and negative environmental effect
    are avoided. Based on the groundwater salinity distribution map in the area (Fig.
    3d), the maximum groundwater salinity does not exceed 15 g L−1. Consequently,
    the range of irrigation salinity was set from 0 to 15 g L−1 with increments of
    1 g L−1. The simulations were sequentially conducted on each grid using different
    irrigation salinities. The yield reduction percentage and WP reduction percentage
    was calculated as the relative decrease percentage when irrigated with saline
    water compared to fresh water (0 g L−1). A comprehensive criterion to determine
    water salinity threshold was proposed considering cotton yield, water productivity
    and soil salt accumulation. Among them, a 10% reduction percentage was considered
    as the threshold for significant decrease for cotton yield and water productivity,
    as reported earlier (Bajwa et al., 1992; Caparas et al., 2021; Zaman et al., 2018).
    In terms of salt accumulation, referring to the research of Li and Ren (2021)
    and combining with the cotton salt tolerance and salt distribution in the Tarim
    Irrigation District, we set that the soil salt content under saline water irrigation
    should not exceed 6 g kg−1 (the lower limit of severely saline alkali soil) at
    the end of the growth period. The irrigation water salinity threshold is the minimum
    of the three above thresholds. Additionally, the impact of different irrigation
    salinity levels on crops was simulated with an increased irrigation amount of
    500 mm (an increment of 100 mm). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Model performance
    The WAVES model has undergone rigorous calibration and verification at the field
    scale (Yu et al., 2021), demonstrating its ability to effectively simulate crop
    responses to salt stress in extremely drought and salinization environments. After
    upscaling the WAVES model to the regional scale using the distributed method,
    the verification results in the Tarim Irrigation District are presented in Fig.
    4. The correlation coefficients for soil salt content, soil water content, LAI,
    measured yield, and statistical yield all exceed 0.85. Moreover, the IoA for all
    variables is above 0.58, indicating that the regional WAVES model successfully
    simulates water-salt dynamics, crop growth, and yield responses. The established
    model accurately depicts spatial differences in crop responses. The simulated
    LAI aligns well with MODIS LAI data, with an IoA of 0.93. However, the cotton
    yield performance using statistical data (Fig. 4e, IoA of 0.70) is slightly better
    than that using measured yield (Fig. 4d, IoA of 0.58). This discrepancy could
    be attributed to the limited representativeness of the survey sampling points.
    The statistical yield considers the average yield of each town, mitigating the
    influence of extreme values. Overall, both yield evaluations are generally within
    an acceptable range. Li et al. (2021) introduced a regional crop yield simulation
    framework that combined a cropping system model (CropSyst) with GIS. The cotton
    yield performance of their model in the IoA was 0.59. In our study, we achieved
    slightly improved results with statistical data compared to Li et al. (2021).
    This could be attributed to the adaptive modifications we made to our model, which
    accounted for the specific conditions of the region and mulching practices. In
    conclusion, the regional WAVES model has been thoroughly verified using multisource
    and multiscale data in the Tarim Irrigation District, confirming its suitability
    as a management guidance tool. Download : Download high-res image (644KB) Download

    (IoA). 3.2. The spatial patterns of cotton response In the Tarim Irrigation District,
    saline-alkali soil is widely distributed. Within the cotton planting regions,
    approximately 17% of the area exhibits severe salinization with soil salt content
    >6 g kg−1, while only 3% of the area has soil salt content <1 g kg−1 (Fig. 3b).
    The regional WAVES model constructed in this study effectively simulates soil
    water-salt dynamics and cotton growth in the region. The simulation results provide
    valuable insights into cotton yield, evapotranspiration during the growth period,
    and water productivity, as depicted in Fig. 5. There is consistency in spatial
    variability among these three variables. It is evident that simulated yield decreases
    with increasing initial soil salt content, leading to corresponding reductions
    in evapotranspiration and water productivity. A noteworthy example is the northwestern
    region (Fig. 5, red box), where higher soil salt content results in significantly
    lower evapotranspiration, yield, and water productivity. Pearson''s correlation
    coefficient analysis revealed a significant and negative correlation between soil
    salinity and cotton yield (R2 = 0.86, p < 0.001). The simulation results from
    all grids demonstrate that for every 1 dS m−1 (0.74 g kg−1) increase in initial
    soil salt content, the relative yield decreases by 4.94% (Fig. 6), which is slightly
    lower than the 5.2% proposed by FAO (Allen et al., 1998). This variation could
    be attributed to factors such as crop variety and climate conditions. Under the
    current management practices, the average lint yield of cotton in the Tarim Irrigation
    District is 2506 kg ha−1. High-yield areas of cotton are primarily concentrated
    along the banks of the Tarim River and on the southern side of the river. This
    is likely due to ample water supply along the riverbanks (shallow groundwater
    depth and low mineralization) and generally lower soil salt content in the southern
    areas. During the growth period, cotton''s average evapotranspiration is 537 mm,
    and the average water productivity is 0.46 kg m−3. Download : Download high-res

    3.3.1. Yield response to saline water irrigation under different underlying surface
    conditions Using the regional WAVES model, we simulated various scenarios of different
    irrigation water salinity levels in each grid. Initially, we analyzed the response
    of cotton yield to saline water irrigation under different underlying surface
    conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 7, varying levels of water salinity (represented
    by 5, 10, and 15 g L−1), soil textures and groundwater depth influenced the yield.
    We observed that the yield initially increased with the rise of groundwater depth
    and then decreased with further increases in groundwater depth. The peak yield
    was achieved at a groundwater depth of 1.5 m. Different groundwater levels had
    both positive and negative impacts on cotton growth. Shallow groundwater levels
    facilitated more water transport to the topsoil (Ayars et al., 2005). However,
    as the groundwater level approaches the surface, rapid capillary rise could lead
    to challenges like increased soil evaporation, risk of soil salinization, and
    potential anaerobic stress on the root system (Soylu et al., 2014). Previous studies
    by Zhang et al. (2017) and Han et al. (2015) also arrived at similar conclusions,
    with optimal groundwater depths of 1.87 m and 1.73 m, respectively, for cotton.
    Our findings align closely with these previous results. Presently, areas with
    a groundwater level of 1.5 m cover 22.7% of the cotton planting area within the
    district, while more areas possess deeper groundwater levels, indicating suboptimal
    conditions for cotton growth. As the groundwater level map in the research area
    is somewhat coarse, further investigation is necessary to determine more specific
    suitable groundwater levels. Download : Download high-res image (277KB) Download

    loam and silt loam, respectively, with the shaded area representing the 95% confidence
    interval. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
    the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) In the study area,
    two primary types of soil texture predominate: sandy loam (22%) and silt loam
    (63%). The data analysis revealed that cotton yield exhibited different responses
    to saline water irrigation depending on the soil type-sandy loam versus silt loam.
    As illustrated in Fig. 7, at low irrigation water salinity (Fig. 7a, 5 g L−1),
    cotton yield on sandy loam surpassed that on silt loam. However, as irrigation
    water salinity increased to 15 g L−1 (Fig. 7c), the difference in cotton yield
    between sandy loam and silt loam decreased, particularly when the water table
    ranged from 2.5 m to 5.5 m. Fig. 8 depicts the relationship between the yield
    reduction percentage and soil texture under varying water salinity levels. It
    is evident that with increasing irrigation water salinity, the yield reduction
    percentage increased regardless of soil texture. This can be attributed to the
    higher salt content brought into the soil as the salinity of irrigation water
    rises, leading to intensified stress on the crops. Under the same irrigation water
    salinity (Fig. 7a), the yield reduction percentage of cotton on sandy loam was
    higher than that on silt loam. This trend remained consistent under different
    irrigation water salinities (Fig. 7b and c). These findings indicate that silt
    loam exhibited a stronger ability to sustain cotton yield under saline water irrigation
    conditions. Higher yield under sandy loam could be one of the reasons that lead
    to larger yield reduction. There may be other factors that lead to the results,
    such as sandy loam soil usually has lower soil water content and water retention
    capacity, which may result in greater negative impacts under saline irrigation.
    A global meta-analysis by Cheng et al. (2021) supported our observations, demonstrating
    that crops grown on medium soil (including silt loam) experienced a smaller yield
    reduction percentage compared to those grown on coarse soil (sandy soil) under
    saline water irrigation. These results are in line with our study. Similar conclusions
    were also drawn from experimental studies comparing sandy loam (Liu et al., 2020)
    and silt loam (Wang et al., 2019) in the vicinity of Xinjiang, China, under comparable
    meteorological conditions. Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download

    for saline water irrigation The spatial distribution of the water salinity threshold
    for saline water irrigation is presented in Fig. 9. The Random Forest machine
    learning method was employed to rank the impact of various spatial heterogeneity
    variables on water salinity thresholds. The order of ranking, as per the method,
    is soil salinity, soil texture, groundwater depth, and groundwater salinity (see
    Fig. S1 for details). Soil salt has the greatest impact on the threshold, indicating
    the higher the salt content, the lower the threshold and severely saline-alkali
    areas are not suitable for underground saline water irrigation (Fig. 9, red box).
    Besides, it is evident that areas with lower thresholds are predominantly located
    in the central region of the Tarim Irrigation District. This aligns with the prevalence
    of sandy loam soil texture in these regions, as discussed in Section 3.3.1, where
    cotton is more susceptible to yield decline (one aspect to determine threshold)
    under saline water irrigation. The overall threshold mode of irrigation water
    salinity for the entire area is 6 g L−1 (Fig. 9a). Findings from Li et al. (2018)
    revealed that using saline water irrigation with a salinity of 3.37 dS m−1, increasing
    the irrigation amount can enhance yield. Sadeh and Ravina (2000) also indicated
    the same results under saline water irrigation. Therefore, a scenario simulation
    of saline water irrigation was conducted with an amount of 500 mm irrigation.
    Upon increasing the irrigation amount by 100 mm, 13.47% of the area experienced
    a threshold increase, 59.41% the area remained unchanged, and 27.12% of area witnessed
    a decline. This implies that increasing the irrigation amount by 100 mm can indeed
    alleviate the stress caused by salinity to a certain extent and raise the threshold
    of irrigation water salinity in some area, but the effect is limited and the overall
    effect is negative with the threshold mode decreasing from 6 g L−1 to 5 g L−1
    (Fig. 10). Consequently, blindly increasing the irrigation amount for higher production
    may lead to salt accumulation in the soil and additional stress on the crops.
    In line with this, Wang et al. (2022) recommended careful consideration when choosing
    large quantities of saline water to mitigate salinity stress. In practical operation,
    when groundwater is utilized for irrigation, it is usually pumped locally. As
    depicted in Fig. 9b, 46% of the irrigation area is not suitable for saline water
    irrigation (i.e., classified as “risk”) based on the comprehensive threshold.
    This condition is not conducive to ensuring cotton production and is largely influenced
    by either the low threshold of water salinity or the high salinity of groundwater
    in those regions. In regions at risk, the government should consider limiting
    groundwater extraction, such as by closing groundwater extraction wells. In addition,
    it is worth noting that extensive or prolonged use of groundwater for irrigation
    may lead to a deeper groundwater table, resulting in reduced yield (Fig. 7) and
    potential ecological and environmental issues (Zhang et al., 2020). Download :

    hydrological crop model (WAVES) that considers the spatial variability of the
    underlying surface. The model was validated and applied in the Tarim Irrigation
    District, a typical region in Northwest China characterized by mulching and extreme
    drought and salinization. The main findings are summarized as follows: 1) The
    established regional model successfully passed the verification at the regional
    scale and demonstrated excellent performance. The simulated values of soil salt
    content, soil water content, cotton LAI, measured yield, and statistical yield
    closely matched the measured values, with R2 of 0.88, 0.94, 0.93, 0.94, and 0.99,
    respectively. The indexes of agreement were all >0.58. 2) With the validated model,
    we obtained the spatial distribution of regional yield, evapotranspiration, and
    water productivity under current management conditions in the Tarim Irrigation
    District. The average values for these parameters were 2506 kg ha−1, 537 mm, and
    0.46 kg m−3, respectively. Soil salt content emerged as the dominant factor limiting
    yield in this district. Higher soil salt content resulted in lower yield, evapotranspiration,
    and water productivity. Specifically, for each 1 dS m−1 (0.74 g kg−1) increase
    in soil salt content, the relative yield decreased by 4.94%. 3) We conducted simulations
    of various saline water irrigation scenarios with different water salinities.
    The results revealed that cotton is more productive on sandy loam soil, while
    cotton maintain yield on silt loam better than on sandy loam under saline water
    irrigation. Moreover, a groundwater depth of 1.5 m was found to be most suitable
    for cotton in this region. The threshold mode of irrigation water salinity in
    the Tarim Irrigation District was determined to be 6 g L−1. Notably, when using
    in-situ groundwater for irrigation, 46% of the area faced a risk of yield reduction,
    WP reduction or excessive salt accumulation, indicating groundwater saline irrigation
    is not suitable. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, farmers,
    and researchers working in similar regions. Declaration of Competing Interest

    the cycle, and productivity at harvest), climate, irrigation, soil and management
    were observed. In all, data from six production units were used for calibration
    and six for validation. The performance of the model was evaluated using statistical
    indices. AquaCrop resulted in admissible errors in predicting the productivity
    of the crops under evaluation, showing good accuracy with a coefficient of determination
    greater than 0.80 and performance classified as ‘very good’ (confidence coefficient

    (39 g m−2). It was concluded that the model can be used to simulate crop productivity
    under different cropping arrangements in agricultural environments in the semi-arid
    region of Brazil with the aim of meeting the forage deficit of livestock in the
    region.

    resilience 1. Introduction Livestock activity in Brazil accounts for 31 % of the
    Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in addition, it guarantees greater economic stability
    to the population compared to agriculture, especially in the semi-arid region
    of the country (Moraes et al., 2019; Veloso et al., 2020). In this region, the
    water deficit and its interannual variations, together with inefficient agricultural
    management, affect forage production in years with climatic anomalies and during
    the period of greatest water scarcity (Er-Raki et al., 2021; Silva et al., 2021;
    Jardim et al., 2021a). Knowledge of production alternatives is therefore essential
    to ensure an increased supply of forage to the herds. Among these alternatives,
    the selection of resilient forage plants with productive potential can help to
    mitigate part of the adversities of soil and climate (Mudgal et al., 2018). Species
    such as the forage cactus, sorghum and millet can help reduce the deficit in forage
    demand in the semi-arid region of Brazil (Jardim et al., 2021b; Pinheiro et al.,
    2021). The forage cactus (Opuntia spp. and Nopalea spp.) has a high production
    of green matter per unit area, high palatability and energetic value (Dubeux et
    al., 2021; Jardim et al., 2023a). This characteristic is attributed to its crassulacean
    acid metabolism (CAM), which allows the plant to close its stomata during the
    day and to assimilate CO2 at night, affording greater water use efficiency (Araújo
    Júnior et al., 2021; Pessoa et al., 2020; Jardim et al., 2023b). In turn, sorghum
    (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) are
    crops with a C4 metabolism, which assimilate CO2 during the day and display a
    high potential for biomass production, high tolerance to water deficit, and high
    water use efficiency (Taylor, 2019; Jardim et al., 2021b; Lauriault et al., 2021,
    2022). In addition to choosing crops that are adapted to the climate, production
    can be increased by adopting agricultural management practices that optimise land
    use and water use efficiency (Araújo Júnior et al., 2021; Souza et al., 2022;
    Jardim et al., 2021b). Intercropping, the use of irrigation, mulching, and increasing
    the planting density can promote greater biomass production in systems that include
    the forage cactus (Nyakudya and Stroosnijder 2014; Diniz et al., 2017; Lima et
    al., 2018; Jardim et al., 2021b; Mupangwa et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2023). However,
    understanding the efficiency of agricultural crops under different management
    practices and soil and climate conditions requires costly investment in research
    and demands on time. Therefore, the use of tools that are capable of aiding agricultural
    management and simulating productivity is an important strategy for planning and
    decision-making, in addition to reducing vulnerability to climate risks (Kanda
    et al., 2021; Nunes et al., 2021). Models that simulate plant growth are mathematical
    representations of scenarios that encompass a combination of environmental and
    management effects (Adeboye et al., 2020; Chibarabada et al., 2020; Nunes et al.,
    2021) and help in elaborating scenarios of agronomic management, agricultural
    calendars and harvest forecasts under current and future climate conditions (Karuku
    and Mbindah, 2020; Martins et al., 2018). In this sense, the AquaCrop model is
    an agroclimatic tool that allows the effect of climate conditions to be measured
    on the productive performance and the drop in productivity of agricultural crops
    under a variety of water conditions (Hsiao et al., 2009; Steduto et al., 2009).
    The interface allows accuracy and stability to be reconciled, in addition, the
    input parameters are more intuitive compared to other simulation models (Karuku
    and Mbindah, 2020; Pinheiro et al., 2021). The AquaCrop model was initially parameterised
    and used in various studies to simulate the responses of agricultural crops, such
    as sorghum (Araya et al., 2016; Hadebe et al., 2017) and millet (Bello and Walker,
    2016; Guo et al., 2018), under different water conditions and soil fertility.
    However, there have been no studies on the use of the AquaCrop model for forage
    cactus crops and their interactions with other crops and cultivation arrangements.
    According to Chimonyo et al. (2015), the AquaCrop model has limitations in its
    application to intercropping systems due to insufficient specification in data
    entry. Here, we propose model adaptations in calibration and validation to infer
    forage cactus responses in different cropping systems. Applying this tool to various
    agricultural scenarios is very important in decision-making, optimising resources
    and increasing yields. As such, our hypothesis is that it is possible to calibrate
    and validate AquaCrop for the forage cactus, millet and sorghum under different
    production systems, in order to apply it to scenarios of climate change and soil
    of the semi-arid region of Brazil under different management practices. The aim
    of this study was to calibrate and validate the AquaCrop model for agricultural
    systems of the forage cactus, millet and sorghum under different production arrangements.
    This study is the first to apply the AquaCrop model to forage cactus cultivation.
    In addition, the results of this paper can offer valuable insights into essential
    AquaCrop parameter calibration, informing future model enhancements and applications
    in data assimilation. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Experimental area and data
    collection The study was conducted in the experimental area of the International
    Reference Centre for Agrometeorological Studies of the Cactus and other Forage
    Plants – CentroRef, at the Serra Talhada Academic Unit of the Federal Rural University
    of Pernambuco, in the district of Serra Talhada, Pernambuco, Brazil (7º56′20”
    S, 38º17′31” W, altitude 499 m) (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). According
    to the Köppen classification, the climate in the region is type BSh, semi-arid
    with rainfall concentrated during the hottest months (Alvares et al., 2013), with
    an average minimum and maximum air temperature ranging from 20.1ºC to 32.9 ºC,
    an average rainfall of 642 mm year−1, average relative humidity of 63 %, and atmospheric
    demand greater than 1800 mm year−1 (Pereira et al., 2015). The soil in the study
    area was classified as a typical eutrophic Ta Haplic Cambisol with a sandy-loam
    texture, well-drained and non-stony, whose physical and chemical properties are
    shown in Table S1. 2.2. Experimental arrangements In the present study, 57 experimental
    arrangements were conducted simultaneously in 12 production units, of which six
    units were used during calibration of the AquaCrop model and six during the validation
    stage. The units intended for validation were conducted under the same soil and
    climate conditions, management and cropping systems as the calibration areas.
    The duration of the tests, from 12 to 15 months, varied based on the cropping
    arrangement. Meteorological and irrigation data throughout the crop cycles are

    system of cactus with sorghum and millet (F). 2.2.1. Production unit 1: single
    and intercropped cactus and sorghum Three clones of the forage cactus, IPA Sertânia
    (IPA) [Nopalea cochenillifera (L.) Salm-Dyck], Miúda (MIU) [Nopalea cochenillifera
    (L.) Salm-Dyck] and Orelha de Elefante Mexicana (OEM) [Opuntia stricta (Haw.)
    Haw.] and three sorghum cultivars (SF11, 467 and Progenitor-288, hereinafter called
    P288) were combined in 15 cropping arrangements: intercropped (IPA-SF11, IPA-467,
    IPA-P288, MIU-SF11, MIU-467, MIU-P288, OEM-SF11, OEM-467, and OEM-P288) and single
    crops (IPA, MIU, OEM, SF11, 467, and P288). The forage cactus was planted, inserting
    50 % of the cladode into the soil, at a spacing of 1.0 m between rows and 0.2
    m between plants (50,000 plants ha−1), giving a total area for the plot of 20
    m2. The study was conducted between 6 February 2019 and 4 February 2020. The sorghum
    cultivars were sown in furrows, 0.05 m deep, spaced 0.25 m from the forage cactus,
    at 20 plants per linear metre (density equal to 200,000 plants ha−1). Irrigation
    was based on 120 % of the crop evapotranspiration of the forage cactus (considered
    the main crop), using a drip system with a uniformity coefficient of 92 % at a
    pressure of 100 kPa. The mean electrical conductivity of the water was 1.62 dS
    m−1, classified as C3 (high salinity) according to the Richards classification
    (Richards, 1954), with a pH of 6.84 and a sodium and potassium concentration of
    168.66 mg L−1 and 28.17 mg L−1, respectively. 2.2.2. Production unit 2: cactus
    clones under different water regimes Three forage cactus clones (IPA, MIU and
    OEM) cultivated as single crops, were planted at a spacing of 1.0 × 0.2 m (50,000
    plants ha−1), covering 50 % of each cladode, and grown under rainfed conditions
    with supplementary irrigation based on a fraction of the crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc): 0 %, 40 %, 80 % and 120 % of the ETc. The OEM, MIU and IPA clones were
    each submitted to the same rainfed conditions and the three irrigation depths.
    The study was conducted between 15 March 2019 and 11 May 2020, when the harvest
    took place. 2.2.3. Production unit 3: cactus clones under different irrigation
    frequencies The production area included three cactus clones (IPA, MIU and OEM),
    with irrigation at a fixed depth of 14 mm, at frequencies of 7, 14, 21 and 28
    days, i.e. 12 treatments. The clones were planted at a spacing of 1.0 × 0.2 m
    (50,000 plants ha−1), covering 50 % of each cladode. The study was conducted between
    5 September 2019 and 25 November 2020. 2.2.4. Production unit 4: cactus intercropped
    with millet, with and without mulch This system was arranged with two levels of
    ground cover, with and without mulch (15 Mg ha−1) in three cropping arrangements:
    single forage cactus (OEM), single millet cv. ‘IPA Bulk-1-BF’ and intercropped
    cactus and millet (OEM-millet), with four repetitions. The area was planted in
    June 2016, at a spacing of 1.5 × 0.2 m (31,250 plants ha−1). The study was conducted
    between 25 February 2019 (keeping the first-order cladodes) and 12 February 2020.
    During the study, irrigation management was carried out, replenishing the water
    to 120 % of the ETc of the forage cactus. 2.2.5. Production unit 5: cactus clones
    under supplementary irrigation The area consisted of forage cactus clones (IPA,
    MIU, OEM, V19, F8 and Orelha de Elefante Africana – OEA) under irrigation based
    on 120 % of the ETc. The cladodes were planted at a spacing of 1.2 × 0.2 m. The
    study began on 28 March 2019 and lasted until 15 May 2020. 2.2.6. Production unit
    6: cactus intercropped with sorghum and millet The forage cactus (OEM) was planted
    on 16 April 2017 at a spacing of 1.0 × 0.1 m (100,000 plants ha−1). In this study,
    we used data from 15 February 2019 to 15 June 2020. Four production arrangements
    were adopted: single cactus; cactus intercropped with millet cv. ‘IPA Bulk-1-BF’;
    cactus intercropped with sorghum ‘1011’; and cactus intercropped with sorghum
    ‘SF15’. The intercropping systems (cactus-millet and cactus-sorghum) were planted
    on 4 February 2019. Each of the species was sown in rows, 0.05 m deep, 0.25 m
    from the basal cladode of the cactus. The sorghum and millet cultivars were grown
    with 20 plants per linear metre. 2.3. Biometric and biomass data Analyses were
    carried out throughout the cycle for all crops. For the sorghum and millet cultivars,
    readings of biometric and biomass characteristics were taken in the field at intervals
    of 7 and 15 days, respectively. For the forage cactus, the readings were taken
    every 30 and 90 days, respectively. The biometric values of the sorghum and millet
    were recorded from a metric analysis of the leaf area (cm2) and area of soil occupied
    per plant (cm2), to obtain the leaf area index – LAI (cm2 cm−2). Biomass was determined
    by weighing the fresh and dry biomass (Mg ha−1) of the aerial part of the plant
    (stem + leaves + panicle). All sorghum and millet cultivars were harvested at
    the soft dough stage. For the forage cactus clones, biometric readings were taken
    by measuring the height (cm) and width (cm) of the plant and the number of cladodes.
    One representative branch of the plant was selected to analyse the length, width
    and perimeter of all of the cladodes. As such, based on the methodology suggested
    by Silva et al. (2014), the cladode area (cm2) was obtained for the different
    clones, in addition to the cladode area index (cm2 cm−2), from the ratio between
    the cladode area and the crop spacing (Pinheiro et al., 2014). For biomass, representative
    plants were selected per experimental area, cut, and weighed on a precision balance
    (fresh weight, Mg ha−1), and dried by forced air circulation at 65 °C, to obtain
    the dry weight (Mg ha−1). The canopy cover (CC) was calculated from the leaf and
    cladode area index, using the ratio to the LAI (Heng et al., 2009): (1) The final
    yield of the crops was expressed by the biomass, as suggested by Raes et al. (2009)
    and Steduto et al. (2009). (2) where B is the biomass (Mg ha−1), WP is the water
    productivity (kg m−2 mm−1), and Tr is the harvest by transpiration (mm). 2.4.
    Calibration and validation of the AquaCrop model for the different production
    arrangements Field data on canopy cover and biomass from the six production units
    were used to calibrate the AquaCrop model for the different production arrangements.
    As the model does not simulate intercropping systems, the crops were calibrated
    individually. However, it was possible to determine the productivity of the intercropping
    system from the recorded biomass of each crop. For the forage cactus clones, the
    AquaCrop model simulated the increase in biomass based on an initial or residual
    biomass, therefore, to simulate the biomass (B) of the forage cactus crops, the
    initial biomass (residual B) was considered as equal to the basal cladode used
    when planting and the first-order cladodes kept in the field following the harvest.
    This practice is common in this type of crop, and should be considered in the
    simulation. The calibration step was carried out by adjusting the parameters canopy
    growth coefficient, canopy decline coefficient, maximum effective root depth,
    coefficient of crop decline as a result of age, nitrogen deficiency (fkc), water
    productivity, upper limit of soil water depletion for canopy expansion (Pexp,upper),
    lower limit of soil water depletion for canopy expansion (Pexp,lower), power limit
    of soil water depletion for canopy expansion (Pest) and upper limit of soil water
    depletion for canopy senescence (Psen) (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). These
    parameters are the most sensitive based on the specific conditions of the crop,
    environment and management (Guo et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2018; Upreti et al.,
    2020; Vanuytrecht et al., 2014; Xing et al., 2017). In order to obtain the best
    results for the statistical indices, the parameters were continually adjusted
    until the simulated values for canopy cover and biomass approached those observed
    in the field. In general, the simulation performed by the AquaCrop model followed
    the steps described in Figure S2. Initially, the input data on climate, soil,
    agricultural management, and phenological and cycle characteristics of the crop
    were added. Then, conservation and crop management parameters were included, using
    initial values based on data or behaviour observed in the field, or on data taken
    from published works with similar characteristics. The parameters considered in
    the AquaCrop model are shown in Table S2. The canopy growth coefficient (CGC)
    and canopy decline coefficient (CDC) were determined based on an analysis of canopy
    cover (CC) development in the field once the best statistical indices were obtained,
    defining the time required for the crop to entirely cover the ground. The parameters
    relating to water stress (Table S2) were adjusted according to the productive
    response of the crop as seen in the field. Calibration of these parameters was
    carried out by trial and error, adjusting the values within the limits of the
    curve shape factor and the parameter relating to leaf senescence (Ks), until the
    smallest statistical differences were obtained between simulated and actual dry
    biomass production over the growing cycle of the crops (Abedinpour et al., 2012;
    Araya et al., 2010; Paredes and Torres, 2017). The first simulation of the values
    for canopy cover and biomass was carried out. The values were compared with the
    field data in a self-validation procedure, using diagnostic statistics. In response
    to the dispersion of the simulated and observed data, non-conservative parameters
    were readjusted in order to reduce the errors. New simulations were carried out
    until the smallest relative and absolute errors were obtained. To validate the
    calibrated parameters, data from six independent experimental areas were used.
    This stage considered, the management data from each experimental area, the climate,
    soil and management. 2.5. Statistical analysis of the simulations Differences
    between the simulated and observed data for canopy cover and biomass were evaluated
    using the following statistical indices: root mean square error (RMSE) (Browne
    and Cudeck, 1992); normalised root mean square error (NRMSE); coefficient of determination
    (R2), which shows the degree of dependence between the predicted variable and
    the predictor; Willmott''s concordance index (d) (Willmott, 1982), which represents
    the accuracy of the model, and confidence index (c) (Camargo and Sentelhas, 1997).
    (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) where Ri and Si are the actual and simulated productivity
    over the cycle, respectively, and are the actual and simulated mean productivity,
    r is the Pearson''s correlation coefficient and n is the number of samples. The
    RMSE is used to measure the overall performance of the model, and expresses the
    mean discrepancy between the simulated and observed values. The model shows the
    best adjustments as the RMSE approaches 0. The NRMSE is a relative measure and
    is more efficient than the RMSE, as it allows different variables to be compared,
    classifying the model as ‘very good’ (< 10 %), ‘good’ (10 % to 15 %), ‘acceptable’
    (>15 % to 20 %), ‘poor’ (>20 % to 25 %) and ‘bad’ (> 25 %) (Kanda et al., 2021;
    Yang et al., 2014). R2 describes the proportion of the total variance in the observed
    data that can be explained by the model. The values of R2 range from 0 to 1, where
    the closer to 1 the better the fit. For Willmott''s concordance index (d), the
    results range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 show better agreement between
    the simulated and observed data; as such, this parameter was limited to d ≥ 0.75
    as the minimum permissible value for models of growth and crop-yield (Yang et
    al., 2014). The confidence index (c) classifies the performance of the model,
    given by the product of r and d, and ranges from 0 to 1, with values closer to
    1 showing the best performance. 3. Results 3.1. Single and intercropped systems
    of cactus and sorghum Fig. 2 shows the interactions and responses of the forage
    cactus clones (MIU, IPA and OEM) for the different production systems, as single
    crops and intercropped with the sorghum varieties (SF11, P288 and 467). In general,
    greater canopy cover (CC) and biomass production were found in the forage cactus
    under the single system compared to the intercropping systems with sorghum cultivars.
    The single system with the OEM clone, stood out in relation to the other forage
    clones for rapid growth of the canopy cover up to 80 days after the uniform cut,
    and a growth rate of 0.59 % day−1 up to approximately 46.54 % of the canopy cover.
    After this period, growth was continuous but more stable to the end of the cycle,
    with a growth rate of approximately 0.08 % day−1. In the other systems, canopy
    cover developed more evenly throughout the cycle, with 0.20 % day−1 and 0.16 %
    day−1 for the MIU and IPA clones, respectively (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res

    and OEM (C) in intercropping systems with varieties of sorghum and as single crops,
    under supplementary irrigation in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Biomass production
    in the OEM clone under the intercropping and single production systems showed
    the highest rates in relation to the other systems. At the end of the cycle, the
    OEM clone showed a mean value of 12.56 Mg ha−1, with a mean dry biomass of 82.56
    %, 135.65 % greater than that of the MIU and IPA clones, respectively. The parameters
    of the forage cactus clones under the single systems and intercropped with the
    sorghum cultivars, with the adjustment of the parameters of the sorghum cultivars
    for both systems are shown in Table S3. It should be noted that, in general, the
    behaviour of the different clones under the various production systems is similar.
    However, it can be seen that maximum canopy growth occurs earlier under systems
    that include the OEM clone compared to the other clones (Table S3). In line with
    the higher biomass production seen in the OEM clones, the parameters of water
    productivity and maximum root depth also showed higher values than those of the
    MIU and IPA clones. On average, water productivity in the OEM clone was 39 g m−2,
    a value 19.08 % and 39.29 % higher than shown by the MIU and IPA clones, respectively.
    After adjusting the parameters, the model was validated for the forage cactus
    (Table S4). It was found that the estimate for canopy cover, despite showing a
    good performance in the different systems, obtained higher NRMSE values. The greatest
    accuracy was for biomass, with mean values for R2 greater than 0.94 (Fig. 2).
    The Willmott''s concordance and confidence indices also showed high values, resulting
    in ‘optimal’ performance for the model, displaying high model accuracy. For the
    sorghum, canopy cover growth during the cycle (P288, 467 and SF11) was similar
    (Fig. 3). However, the greatest canopy cover was seen in the P288 cultivar (93.7
    %), followed by 467 (87.4 %) and SF11 (83.6 %). In response to canopy cover growth,
    cultivar P288 showed the highest biomass production under the systems intercropped
    with the forage cactus, with a mean value of 19.8 Mg ha−1, a value 25.7 % and
    28.3 % higher than those of the SF11 and 467 cultivars, respectively. Each of
    the cropping systems showed the highest biomass production for the sorghum cultivars
    as single crops. Among the principal adjusted parameters in simulating the sorghum
    cultivars, most notable is the greater water productivity of the single sorghum
    (Table S5). Validating the simulations of growth and development in the sorghum
    cultivars within the different systems showed results of ‘acceptable’ reliability,
    with a mean NRMSE value of 15.6 % and R2 of 0.97 for canopy cover. At the same
    time, biomass production showed mean statistical values for NRMSE of 10.9 % with
    R2 equal to 0.92 (Table S6), demonstrating ‘good’ performance. Download : Download

    clones and as single crops, under irrigation in the semi-arid region of Brazil.
    3.2. Forage cactus clones under different water regimes Cropping systems with
    the forage cactus clones (MIU, IPA and OEM) under different water regimes based
    on the crop evapotranspiration (0 %, 40 %, 80 % and 120 % of the ETc) showed results
    that demonstrate the direct influence of water management on crop response. In
    general, application of the maximum irrigation depth (120 % of the ETc) has a
    marked effect on reducing the canopy cover in all the clones (Fig. 4). Analysing
    each clone individually, it can be seen that, regardless of irrigation depth,
    the OEM clone had the greatest canopy cover growth in relation to the other clones.
    Biomass production in these cropping systems showed the best results at an irrigation
    depth of 80 % ETc for the three clones under evaluation (Fig. 4). The OEM clone
    was responsible for the greatest biomass production, with a mean value of 16.8
    Mg ha−1. Table S7 presents the main parameters adjusted for the simulation, and
    highlights the high water productivity of the OEM clone, with an approximate mean
    value of 37.5 g m−2, followed by IPA (17.8 g m−2) and MIU (12.5 g m−2). Download

    80 % 120 %) based on the crop evapotranspiration (ETc), in the semi-arid region
    of Brazil. Fig. 4 shows the validation of the presented simulation that resulted
    in high mean R2 values for biomass, with values greater than 0.82, indicating
    good model accuracy. Among the irrigation depths, 120 % of the crop evapotranspiration
    had the lowest R2, with a mean value of 0.87. In general, despite the high NRMSE
    values, the models showed ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ performance for the different
    production systems based on the confidence and Willmott''s concordance indices,
    which indicate high model accuracy. 3.3. Response of the forage cactus clones
    under different irrigation frequencies For the forage cactus system under different
    irrigation frequencies, there is no difference in canopy cover growth between
    clones. However, as in previous experiments, the OEM clone had higher biomass
    production than the other clones (Fig. 5). The experiment began in September 2019,
    a time of year when the semi-arid region of Brazil is historically characterised
    by a high water deficit and high temperatures. As a result, at the start of 2020,
    when the rainy season began, followed by a reduction in air temperature, there
    was a marked increase in canopy cover. Even in the system grown under irrigation,
    there is a mixture of climate factors, affording fewer crop losses through evapotranspiration.

    Fig. 5. Simulation of canopy cover growth (A, B and C) and biomass (D, E and F)
    in the MIU, IPA and OEM forage cactus clones under different irrigation frequencies
    (7, 14, 21 and 28 days) in the semi-arid region of Brazil. According to the conditions
    observed in the field, the forage cactus did not show flowering and leaf senescence,
    parameters that limit some projections of the AquaCrop model. For the OEM clone,
    a forage cactus with high productive potential, its simulated values were below
    those observed at the end of the cycle (Fig. 5). This is because the AquaCrop
    model has limitations in simulating water productivity for plants that present
    high values of this variable, as is the case with the OEM clone. In order to have
    the closest possible approximation between the simulated and observed results,
    it was necessary to increase the maximum depth of the root system of the OEM clone
    (Table S9). The statistical results of the biomass simulations therefore showed
    high coefficients of determination, i.e. excellent model accuracy, with a mean
    value for R2 of 0.99. However, the observed and simulated results for biomass
    showed highly varying behaviour, as seen with the normalised root mean square
    error (NRMSE), ranging between 5.23 % and 91.89 % (Table S10). In estimating biomass,
    the OEM irrigated with a frequency of 14 and 28 days had the highest NRMSE values
    and, consequently, the lowest performance, based on the confidence index. 3.4.
    Forage cactus intercropped with millet under different soil conditions, with and
    without mulch Analysing the behaviour of the production systems between the OEM
    cactus clone and the millet under single and intercropped conditions in systems
    with and without mulch, it can be seen that there is greater initial growth in
    the canopy cover of the OEM clone when subjected to mulching (Fig. 6A). Download

    Simulation of the effect of mulching (i.e., with mulching—WM and without mulching—NM)
    on canopy cover growth (A and B) and biomass (C and D) in the OEM forage cactus
    clone and millet as single crops and in intercropping systems in the semi-arid
    region of Brazil. From the results obtained in simulating the production of the
    OEM clone, it can be seen that during the period of greater water deficit and
    higher temperatures, the model underestimates the observed biomass production.
    Among the main adjustment parameters of the model, the treatments under analysis
    were similar in their respective metabolic characteristics, i.e. a comparison
    of the OEM clone in each situation, and of the millet under the different production
    systems (Table S11). The statistical results from the validation of canopy cover
    and biomass showed high values, with a mean value for R2 of 0.88 and 0.98, respectively.
    Together with these data, there is greater accuracy in the simulation of biomass
    production than in the simulation of canopy cover, as expressed by the respective
    mean NRMSE values of 6.77 % and 36.86 %. The high accuracy in estimating productivity
    is confirmed by the excellent performance of the confidence and Willmott''s concordance
    indices (excellent accuracy) for each of these systems (Table S12). 3.5. Different
    forage cactus clones under supplementary irrigation Fig. 7 shows six forage cactus
    clones with the potential for forage production. It can be seen that clone F8
    showed reduced canopy cover growth and, consequently, low biomass production.
    This is mainly due to the high mortality seen in plants of this clone throughout
    the cycle. The OEM (26.5 Mg ha−1) and OEA (18.0 Mg ha−1) clones stood out for
    having the highest biomass production in relation to the other clones studied
    in this research. When simulating development in the OEA and OEA clones, it was
    necessary to increase the depth of the root system, which contributed to a better
    fit between the simulated and observed data (Table S13). These two clones, physiologically
    more rustic and adapted to the climate, had the highest water productivity, of
    39 and 33 g m−2, respectively. Statistically, the simulation of clone F8 showed
    poor results, with a range, represented by the NRMSE, of approximately 230 % for
    canopy cover and 336 % for biomass production. On the other hand, simulation of
    the other clones gave a mean NRMSE value of 20.9 % for canopy cover and 8.6 %
    for biomass production, the latter classified as ‘optimal’ performance (Table
    S14). Download : Download high-res image (683KB) Download : Download full-size

    Cactus intercropped with different forages under supplementary irrigation The
    production systems consisting of the OEM cactus clone grown as a single crop or
    intercropped with two densely planted sorghum cultivars (SF15 and 1011) and densely
    planted millet demonstrated that, due to the high planting density, development
    and biomass production in the intercropped sorghum and millet were compromised
    (Fig. 8). The sorghum cultivars showed a mean canopy cover value of 73 % and mean
    biomass value of 10 Mg ha−1, while the millet showed almost no development. The
    forage cactus displayed varying behaviour, even under dense conditions, with a
    mean biomass production at the end of the cycle of approximately 36 Mg ha−1, and
    the single crop showing the highest production (39 Mg ha−1). Based on the parametric
    behaviour of the cropping systems, the low water productivity of the millet intercropped
    with the OEM clone (9.0 g m−2) was noteworthy and far lower than the mean value
    of the sorghum cultivars intercropped with the OEM clone (33.0 g m−2). The OEM
    forage cactus, regardless of the cultivation system, had high WP values, with
    a mean value of 49.0 g m−2 (Table S15). Download : Download high-res image (799KB)

    under supplementary irrigation in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Table S16 (see
    Supplementary Materials for detail) shows the adjustment of the main parameters
    and the statistical results, with greater similarity between the simulated biomass
    data and those observed in the field for the single and intercropped forage cactus,
    with a mean R2 value of 0.94 and NRMSE of 7.90 %. On the other hand, the intercropped
    sorghum and millet showed an R2 of 0.91, albeit with greater variability, as verified
    by the mean value of the NRMSE (29.45 %). 3.7. Intercropped forage plants versus
    single crops under supplementary irrigation In Fig. 9, the effect of the intercropped
    forages can be seen in relation to the single crops. Under single cultivation,
    there were higher individual values for productivity. Despite the individual values
    for biomass of the intercrops being reduced by around 25 %, the sum of the intercropping
    system considerably increased the total value, giving biomass values that were
    approximately 63 % greater than in the single crops (Fig. 9A). Intercropping the
    OEM cactus clone and millet afforded an increase of approximately 64 % in biomass
    production compared to the single cactus. However, when mulch was applied to the
    intercropping system, biomass production increased by 78 % compared to the single
    cactus (Fig. 9B). Download : Download high-res image (345KB) Download : Download

    In general, the AquaCrop model simulated the different cropping systems efficiently.
    Despite there being no records in the literature of simulations made by the model
    for most forage crops with CAM pathway and under intercropping systems (Vanuytrecht
    et al., 2014), its effectiveness in simulating single crops, and intercrops under
    their respective intercropping conditions, was verified using statistical indices.
    Despite the constant optimisation of the AquaCrop model and the continuous parameterisation
    of new agricultural crops, no parameters have yet been established or published
    for the forage cactus: a need made evident by its agricultural importance and
    the necessity of meeting the forage demand of small livestock producers in the
    semi-arid region. The first approximation carried out in this study is therefore
    important for clarifying the responses of the forage cactus throughout the year
    under different cropping conditions, such as canopy growth and biomass production.
    The results of this study showed that the parameters of the forage cactus adjusted
    well during the cycle, in addition to the different production systems under analysis.
    However, some of the model parameters require adjusting for this crop, due to
    certain characteristics such as its vegetative cycle and physiological metabolism.
    The forage cactus has a long crop cycle, approximately two years under rainfed
    conditions (Lima et al., 2016), but by varying management and climate conditions
    (Amorim et al., 2017; Araújo Júnior et al., 2021), the harvest time can be reduced
    or increased. As a result, the crop presents morphophysiological variations depending
    on the season, age of the plant, cladode order, cultivar, agricultural management
    system, and planting density, in addition to biotic factors (Dubeux et al., 2021;
    Pessoa et al., 2020; Souza et al., 2017). Given these characteristics, such parameters
    as the normalised water productivity proved to be limiting, since their values
    in the model cannot be altered during the cycle. The model parameters, initial
    canopy cover and emergence, are also relative, since harvest management in the
    forage cactus is normally carried out by keeping the basal cladodes, thereby maintaining
    the structural base of the plant between successive cycles (Jardim et al., 2021b;
    Queiroz et al., 2015). The biomass simulations for the cropping systems of the
    forage cactus clones (MIU, IPA and OEM) under different irrigation depths showed
    high statistical indices. The system with an irrigation depth of 120 % of the
    ETc showed the lowest value for R2 (0.87), with the greatest variation in mean
    value throughout the cycle seen in the treatments under rainfed irrigation (0
    % of the ETc) and NRMSE equal to 54.5 %. From this, it can be said that scenarios
    with the greatest water stress, especially a water deficit, negatively affect
    the final results of the biomass simulation. Similar behaviour was found in maize
    and soya by Heng et al. (2009); Sandhu and Irmak (2019), and Shirazi et al. (2021),
    who report that the inhibitory effect seen in the model simulation under water
    stress was greater than that seen in the field. Simulation models have as their
    main characteristic a representation based on perfect physiological growth conditions,
    since these can be directly affected by weeds, pests, diseases and/or other factors
    that are not taken into account Hoefsloot et al. (2012). As a result, even if
    AquaCrop is calibrated based on actual soil conditions, the results may differ
    due to the particular situations arising from different local agricultural scenarios.
    The cultivation systems of the forage cactus under different irrigation frequencies
    showed high R2 values (≤ 0.96) for biomass production, but with a marked difference
    in relation to the mean, represented by the mean value of the RMSE (6.4 g m−1)
    and NRMSE (46.0 %). Such behaviour may be associated with the number of observations
    throughout the cycle, especially in this experiment, fostering the idea of the
    need to increase observations distributed uniformly throughout the cycle. In the
    simulations of forage crops with and without mulching, better adjustments were
    seen for systems with no mulch, with a mean value for R2 of 0.86 and NRMSE of
    32.5 g m−2 for canopy cover, and an R2 of 0.99 and NRMSE of 5.33 g m−2 for biomass.
    The same behaviour was seen by Feng et al. (2022) and Guo et al., (2018), who
    reported the best adjustments for systems with no ground cover, a result of the
    AquaCrop model accelerating canopy senescence under situations of water stress.
    Mulching affords greater efficiency in the use and conservation of soil moisture,
    reducing the water lost to evaporation, and increasing the organic matter content
    of the surface layer. This provides better water conditions and increased productivity,
    as found by Jardim et al. (2021b), who evaluated the biological efficiency and
    competitive ability of intercropping sorghum and forage cactus in the semi-arid
    region, and found that intercropping increased the production of fresh matter
    by 47 % with 3.5 times more dry matter than the single crops. Mupangwa et al.
    (2012) found an increase of 51 % in maize production under ground cover (2 to
    4 Mg ha−1). The AquaCrop model simulates the growth of agricultural crops; however,
    direct simulation of intercropping systems is not yet possible. Various alternatives
    can be adopted to obtain representative information on crop forecasts using this
    system. Firstly, by calibrating and validating each crop individually inside the
    intercropping system and then summing the biomass of both crops. Another option
    is to observe, through calibration, the influence that one crop exerts over the
    other in the intercropping system. This is possible with the ‘Field management/Weed
    management’ module, where the effect of the ground cover of one crop on the growth
    of the other crop can be calculated. 5. Conclusions In our study, we sought to
    calibrate and validate the AquaCrop model for agricultural systems of forage cactus,
    millet and sorghum under different production arrangements (single crops and intercrops,
    with and without the use of mulch) in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Calibration
    and validation of AquaCrop for different production systems of forage plants proved
    to be efficient. The model is limited to simulating the growth of single crops;
    it is however possible to carry out the routine for single crops within an intercropping
    system and then sum the simulated productivity of both crops, for which it is
    necessary to calibrate the parameters for the conditions of the intercropping
    system, verifying the reducing factors of each crop individually. For periods
    of the crop cycle with greater water scarcity, the model displays results with
    more inconsistencies and errors compared to systems under full irrigation. The
    model simulates crop growth and/or cropping systems with no mulch more efficiently
    than under mulched conditions. Finally, the results of this study provide an important
    advance in the use of the AquaCrop model for the forage cactus, both as a single
    crop and intercropped with grasses. There is, however, a need for improvement
    in calibrating conservationist parameters, as well as for changes in the processes
    that simulate the response of cacti to environmental factors and management. Declaration

    croplandRainfed croplandAccuracy assessment 1. Introduction Sustainable agricultural
    water management (AWM) can be informed by accurate mapping of the location and
    extent of croplands (Thenkabail et al., 2010). However, comparative analyses of
    many remote-sensing land use and landcover (LULC) products show high disagreement
    in croplands globally (Fritz et al., 2010, Pérez-Hoyos et al., 2017, Tchuenté
    et al., 2011). Fritz et al. (2010) found that the total cropland area worldwide
    differs by approximately 20 % between remote-sensing LULC products. In a comparison
    of cropland classes from nine LULC products, Pérez-Hoyos et al. (2017) also found
    that in over 30 % of the analyzed countries in Africa and the Americas, there
    was high disagreement whereby only three or fewer LULC products agreed on the
    classification of areas as cropland. Compared to other landcover classes, there
    is higher disagreement in cropland classification, particularly in regions with
    low cropping density and high landscape fragmentation and where major crops have
    similar seasonal development as the surrounding natural landscapes, as is the
    case in the savanna regions of Africa (Pittman et al., 2010). The result of this
    disparity between cropland classes in LULC products is uncertainty in their application
    for various assessments ranging from water accounting to food production anomaly
    studies (Karimi et al., 2013, Patle et al., 2023, Pérez-Hoyos et al., 2017, Thenkabail
    et al., 2010). In addition to the poor correlation between remote-sensing LULC
    cropland classes, many of these products also fail to distinguish between rainfed
    and irrigated agriculture but rather lump them together as one cropland class
    (Buchhorn et al., 2021, Friedl and Sulla-Menashe, 2019, Karra et al., 2021, Latham
    et al., 2014). Yet, agriculture consumes the largest share of freshwater globally,
    and therefore, meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ‘Zero Hunger’
    and other associated SDGs, is helped by understanding of the pathways, fluxes,
    and footprints of water in croplands (Falkenmark and Rockström, 2006, Hoekstra
    and Mekonnen, 2012, Thenkabail et al., 2010). For water pathways, a distinction
    is made between blue and green water to understand the different sources of water
    for their management (Falkenmark & Rockström, 2006). Blue water refers to the
    water resources available from surface and groundwater that is typically made
    available to plants through irrigation, while green water refers to the water
    from precipitation that infiltrates the soil and is naturally available to plants
    for biomass production (Falkenmark and Rockström, 2006, Johansson et al., 2016,
    Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011). The principal water flux, after precipitation, for
    this biomass production by plants is evapotranspiration (ET). Over the continents,
    annual ET volumes are estimated to be over 1.5 times annual runoff (Rodell et
    al., 2015), yet, owing to its gaseous state, ET is relatively difficult to quantify
    directly, even at discrete locations (Senay et al., 2016, Sposito, 2017). As such,
    indirect methods combining satellite-, ground- and model-based methods have been
    applied to investigate blue and green ET fluxes over different land uses and landcover
    (LULC) (Chukalla et al., 2015, Kiptala, 2016, Msigwa et al., 2021, Senay et al.,
    2016, Simons et al., 2016, van Eekelen et al., 2015, Velpuri and Senay, 2017).
    For example, Chukalla et al. (2015) used the AquaCrop model and the global consumptive
    water footprint accounting standard to partition blue and green ET fluxes and
    investigate the water footprint of various irrigation techniques. Velpuri & Senay
    (2017) used two ET models, one based on the energy balance and the other, the
    water balance, to partition annual ET for different LULCs in the United States
    (US). They found that green ET makes up 70 % of total ET while blue ET makes up
    30 %, with the annual green and blue ET proportion for croplands being 87 % and
    13 %, respectively (Velpuri & Senay, 2017). Forests were found to consume the
    highest blue ET among non-water landcover classes, approximately 350 mm/year,
    while for irrigated croplands, annual blue ET was about 250 mm/year (Velpuri &
    Senay, 2017). These findings are comparable to that of Msigwa et al. (2021), who
    concluded that high blue water fluxes were attributed to dense forests and irrigated
    plantations in the Kikuletwa catchment in Tanzania. One of the models used by
    Msigwa et al. (2021) in their study of blue and green water fluxes in the Kikuletwa
    basin was the Budyko model (Budyko, 1974). This model has been applied widely
    at both large and fine scales for water-energy balance studies owing to its parsimony
    and accuracy (Reaver et al., 2022, Sposito, 2017). Examples of such applications
    range from simple estimations of total ET (Gerrits et al., 2009, Zhang et al.,
    2008), to calibration of global hydrological models (Greve et al., 2020), bias-correction
    of precipitation data (Beck et al., 2020) and evaluation of the accuracy of remote
    sensing (RS) derived ET at the basin scale (Weerasinghe et al., 2020). Like Msigwa
    et al. (2021), as well as Patle et al. (2023), who applied the model to partition
    blue and green ET, Singh et al. (2022) also successfully utilized a parameterized
    version in assessing the changes in blue and green ET fractions across India at
    sub-basin scale by introducing the dimensionless shape parameter, ‘ω’. This parameter
    was initially defined by Fu (1981) to account for catchment characteristics. Other
    adaptations to the Budyko model include parameters to represent water storage
    capacity in the root zone (Milly, 1993), vegetation type (Wang and Tang, 2014,
    Zhang et al., 2001), and then the depth and frequency of rainfall events considering
    soil properties (Porporato et al., 2004, Sankarasubramanian and Vogel, 2002).
    Some parameterized versions also aim to account for non-steady state conditions
    when the change in storage becomes substantial due to additional water from irrigation,
    groundwater, or water transfer (Du et al., 2016, Greve et al., 2016, Han et al.,
    2011). The basis of many of these parameterizations is that a basin’s water balance
    is not only affected by climate, as originally derived in the “top-down” Budyko
    model but also depends on catchment conditions such as vegetation, terrain and
    soil properties. However, Wang et al. (2016) highlight the difficulty in determining
    the parameters for each catchment and the small contribution they make to improving
    the efficiency of the Budyko model. Sposito (2017), also concludes that physical
    interpretations of model parameters for parametric Budyko models may be “spurious.”
    This is because applications of these parameterized models are catchment specific
    and cannot be extended beyond these settings or even across different periods
    within the same catchments (Sposito, 2017). They are therefore in agreement with
    Gentine et al., 2012, Greve et al., 2015, Padrón et al., 2017 as well as Reaver
    et al. (2022) who conclude from theoretical analysis as well as empirical tests
    in over 700 catchments that the non-parametric Budyko model provides an “overarching
    framework for understanding catchment hydrology in terms of energy and water balances”.
    In this study, the Budyko model is applied to partition total ET into green and
    blue fluxes and thereby identify rainfed and irrigated croplands in Africa. This
    cropland partitioning is done using remote sensing precipitation (P), actual and
    reference ET, and different LULC products for continental Africa. The specific
    objectives are to (1) assess the level of agreement between different LULC products
    for Africa; (2) generate an alternative composite cropland map which overcomes
    the high disagreement and errors inherent in individual crop masks of LULC products;
    (3) To demonstrate a scalable approach to partition croplands into irrigated and
    rainfed classes using the Budyko model; and (4) To apply this approach in partitioning
    croplands to the individual LULC products and thereby demonstrate its applicability.
    The novelty of this study lies in the scale at which croplands are being partitioned
    into rainfed and irrigated areas using a climate-based approach and remote-sensing
    data inputs. Africa is the second largest continent, extending from latitudes
    37°N to 34°S and longitudes 51°E to 17°W, with diverse agricultural practices
    and climate ranging from Mediterranean to tropical. As a result, it is challenging
    to find approaches suitable for all areas at the continental scale. Yet, knowing
    whether a cropland is irrigated or rainfed is crucial for water use evaluation
    and estimating food production. Accurately distinguishing between the two types
    of croplands therefore has implications on sustainable management of highly variable,
    scarce, and transboundary water resources as well as food security on the continent
    (Chandrasekharan et al., 2021, Li and Troy, 2018). Many of the previous ET partitioning
    studies have been done at relatively small catchment (Msigwa et al., 2021, van
    Eekelen et al., 2015) or country (Gumma et al., 2011, Velpuri and Senay, 2017)
    scales. The methods used in these small-scale studies were considered but were
    ultimately abandoned in preference for the Budyko model mainly due to their data
    requirements. In contrast, the Budyko model requires only three climate variables
    that are readily available at continental scales through remote-sensing products.

    The Budyko model (Budyko, 1974) empirically represents a river basin’s long-term
    water and energy balance under steady-state conditions. Given that long-term changes
    in a basin’s storage are negligible then mean precipitation in that basin is partitioned
    into either discharge or (green) evapotranspiration ( ): (1) From observations
    in several catchments, Budyko (1974) proposed that the mean (green) evapotranspiration
    ( ) of a catchment is a function of the available energy (i.e., potential evapotranspiration
    ( )), and available water (i.e., precipitation ), or more specifically, its aridity
    index (ϕ) where: (2) Budyko thus derived the explicit functional relationship
    between (green) and as: (3) Thus, considering available energy and water in a
    location, it is possible to determine any additional water input (blue ) if the
    measured actual exceeds green as: (4) In cropland areas, these are areas where
    formal or supplemental irrigation exists over the study period. 2.2. Datasets
    2.2.1. Climate variables: P, ET and ETo Partitioning of ET using the Budyko model
    requires only three climatic inputs: precipitation, actual ET and potential ET
    (ETo) (Eqs. (1)–(4)). In this study, the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Rainfall
    (MSWEP) (Beck et al., 2019) precipitation, operational Simplified Surface Energy
    Balance (SSEBop) (Senay et al., 2020) actual ET, and Water Productivity through
    Open access of Remotely sensed derived data (WaPOR) (FAO, 2018) potential ET datasets
    served as inputs to the Budyko model (Table 1). The choice of MSWEP and SSEBop
    was informed by their good performance across Africa in continental-scale reviews
    by Mekonnen et al. (2023) and Weerasinghe et al. (2020) respectively. With respect
    to ETo, WaPOR ETo, which is grounded in the combined temperature- and radiation-based
    Penman-Monteith (Monteith, 1965) equation, was used. The simplified Food and Agriculture
    Organization’s (FAO) version of the Penman-Monteith equation for a reference grass
    surface (Allen et al., 1998) is presented below: (5) Table 1. Remote-sensing climate,

    products. 2.2.2. LULC products Eight common LULC products were used in disaggregating

    climate products were preprocessed by mosaicking, clipping to an Africa extent,
    resampling to 300 m using nearest neighbor method, and then aggregating to the
    annual time step (Fig. 1). The spatial resolution of 300 m was chosen in keeping
    with the median and modal resampled spatial resolution of the eight LULC products.
    The MSWEP data were bias-corrected using the annual bias estimate of 5 % for Africa
    compared to in situ rain gauge observations (Mekonnen et al., 2023). Furthermore,
    an error correction was done on actual ET given that natural landscapes such as
    grasslands should only show green water use. Therefore ET is at most, equal to
    precipitation (ET ≤ P). A mean annual error in grassland pixels (i.e., where actual
    ET > precipitation) at sub-catchment scale was therefore used as a correction
    factor for the SSEBop actual ET data. 2.3.2. Preprocessing – Landcover products
    The specific preprocessing steps, legend translation and maps of the eight LULC
    products used in this study can be found in Appendix B. Generally, this preprocessing
    involved reprojection to the WGS84 geographic coordinate system, resampling to
    300 m resolution using nearest neighbor method, harmonization to the Land Use
    for Water Accounting (LUWA) classification system (Karimi et al., 2013) and then
    the creation of cropland masks (Fig. 1). LUWA is a simple classification system
    with eight main classes that is widely used for water accounting (Karimi et al.,
    2013, Patle et al., 2023). It is based on the FAO’s landcover classification system,
    and it was chosen to simplify the landcover classes and thereby make map interpretation
    and comparison easier. The eight main LUWA classes are Tree-1, Shrub-2, Grass-3,
    Crop-4, Miscellaneous (Misc.)-5, Wetland-6, Water-7, and Barren-8 (Fig. 3). The
    300 m spatial resolution was chosen to minimize the effects of resampling on the
    LULC products as this was the modal and median (rounded up to the nearest 100
    m) resolution of the eight products. The crop masks for the eight landcover products
    are shown in Fig. 4. Appendix C of the supplementary material presents a map (Figure
    C1) showing how each product compares to country level data of cultivated area
    from the FAO Aquastat. The Sentinel cropland area, is generally the smallest relative
    to the other landcover datasets while CCI cropland is the largest. Download :

    cropland masks and derivation of high-confidence cropland map (HCCM) Apart from
    apparent variations in spatial and temporal resolutions of LULC products (Table
    1), these products also differ in the base imagery and ancillary input data, the
    methodology followed in their derivation, as well as the size and quality of training
    and validation data (Thenkabail et al., 2021). The result is high uncertainty
    due to the disagreement between these products (Pérez-Hoyos et al., 2017, Thenkabail
    et al., 2021). To overcome this uncertainty, following an analysis of the level
    of agreement of the eight LULC products for the year 2019, a high-confidence cropland
    mask (HCCM) was created for cropland partitioning (Fig. 1). 2019 was chosen as
    the reference year because it was the most recent year for which six out of eight
    products had data. The most recent year was used for the two products without
    data for that year, GLC-SHARE and GlobCover. In deriving the HCCM, two assessments
    were carried out on the eight crop masks. The first was a point-to-pixel accuracy
    assessment using the independent cropland validation dataset. The second compares
    the area of each crop mask to country-level data on cultivated area from FAO’s
    Aquastat data portal (FAO, 2021). For the first assessment, the validation database
    did not include non-cropland classes, so it was only possible to determine the
    overall accuracy of each crop mask. This is the percentage of correctly predicted
    cropland areas (i.e., true positive (TP)) by the LULC products out of the 955
    validation points. Following confirmation that the Global Cropland-Extent Product
    at 30-m Resolution (GCEP30) was produced using the validation dataset, GCEP30
    was excluded from the derivation of the HCCM (Thenkabail et al., 2021). The top
    three highest-scoring cropland masks from both assessments were used to derive
    the HCCM based on 66 % agreement between them. Note that the HCCM is not considered
    a new product as it is derived simply based on the agreement between three existing
    products. It is used in this study for calibration and validation of the cropland
    partitioning framework to overcome the errors inherent in individual cropland
    products. 2.3.4. Budyko-partitioned cropland product (BPCP) The Budyko model was
    applied to the HCCM to derive green and blue ET for the croplands (Fig. 1). An
    annual blue ET threshold above which cropland was considered irrigated was set
    as the maximum of either the mean blue ET of grassland pixels at the sub-catchment
    scale or an infinitesimal blue ET of 0.01 mm. The mean blue ET of grassland pixels
    threshold caters to ‘natural’ blue ET, for example, from flood waters (Balana
    et al., 2019, Motsumi et al., 2012), whereas the infinitesimal blue ET threshold
    accounts for the evaporative fraction asymptotically approaching unity ( for large
    values of climate aridity (ϕ) in the Budyko model (Carmona et al., 2016). A further
    distinction was then made between irrigated cropland areas with high blue ET (≥100
    mm), i.e., areas under formal irrigation, and then areas with relatively low blue
    ET (<100 mm), i.e., supplemental irrigation. This threshold of at most 100 mm
    for supplemental irrigation was the average value based on research on supplemental
    irrigation for sorghum (Fox & Rockström, 2003) and maize (Gadédjisso-Tossou et
    al., 2018), two crops grown in nearly all ecological zones of Africa. The research
    found that yields in these rainfed crops were stabilized by applying minimal amounts
    of water to bridge dry spells, specifically 60–90 mm for sorghum and 150 mm for
    maize. Note that because annual values are used to identify irrigated areas, both
    ET from double cropping and ET outside the growing season are accounted for. 2.3.5.
    Validation of BPCP Following cropland partitioning of the HCCM using the Budyko
    model, validation was carried out using the same validation database of cropland
    locations, this time differentiated into rainfed and irrigated cropland locations
    (Fig. 1). Out of the 955 validation points, 861 points that fell within the HCCM
    cropland area were used in generating a confusion matrix. For this accuracy assessment,
    a confusion matrix was generated to show both accuracies and errors, thereby providing
    a complete summary of the predictions made by the Budyko model as compared to
    the actual ground truth. Overall accuracy was calculated as the percentage of
    correctly predicted rainfed and irrigated areas (i.e., true negative (TN) and
    true positive (TP), respectively) by the Budyko model, out of the 861 validation
    points. Denoting false negatives and false positives as and respectively, the
    values for precision are the proportion of true positive predictions out of all
    positive predictions made by the model ( ); sensitivity is the proportion of true
    positive (irrigated) predictions out of all actual positive instances ( ); and
    specificity is the proportion of true negative (rainfed) predictions out of all
    actual negative instances ( ). A Cohen’s Kappa score, which is a measure of the
    classification agreement between the Budyko-partitioned cropland map and the validation
    dataset, compared to the agreement that could have been expected by mere chance,
    was also calculated (McHugh, 2012). 2.3.6. Application of Budyko model to individual
    cropland masks Applying the Budyko model to partition a composite cropland mask
    based on highly accurate crop masks, aims to produce an alternative disaggregated
    product that overcomes the errors inherent in individual crop masks of LULC products.
    However, each LULC product has been developed and validated using different approaches
    and databases (Karra et al., 2021, Latham et al., 2014, Tsendbazar et al., 2020,
    Zanaga et al., 2021), and as such, their crop masks may be preferred for specific
    applications or study areas. In such situations, the framework followed in partitioning
    the HCCM can be applied to the crop masks created from any individual LULC product.
    This has been done for the original eight cropland masks of the LULC products
    used in this study (Fig. 1). 3. Results 3.1. Agreement between landcover products
    Following reclassification to LUWA classes, the mean agreement between the eight
    LULC products across all LUWA classes for the reference year 2019 ranges from
    50.9 % to 68.6 % (Table 2). GCEP30 has the lowest agreement with the other products,
    an average of approximately 50.9 % because only three LULC types are classified
    in GCEP30: water, cropland, and a broad class for all non-croplands. WaPOR and
    Copernicus products have the highest average correlation with the other products
    (68.6 % and 67.2 %, respectively). WaPOR’s and Copernicus’ products also have
    a high correlation with each other (87.7 %), possibly because WaPOR landcover
    maps were based on a previous version (version 2) of the Copernicus product used
    in this study (version 3). Excluding their pairwise correlation, the mean correlation
    of WaPOR and Copernicus with the other products is slightly reduced to 65.4 %
    and 63.8 %, respectively. The lowest pairwise similarity was 33.9 % between GCEP30
    and Sentinel LULC products. Table 2. Correlation matrix for each possible dataset

    64.9 54.4 63.0 35.5 67.4 62.9 57.5 Besides the small number of classes used in
    this study, the fair agreement between the LULC products is mainly driven by the
    relatively high agreement (≥62 %) on barren (Sahara and Namib deserts), trees
    (central Africa) and to a smaller areal extent, water (African Great Lakes and
    other permanent lakes) classes (Fig. 5). In contrast, there is a low agreement
    (≤50 %) in the classification of areas as shrubs, grass, cropland and wetland.
    For croplands, the exception to this generally low agreement occurs in small clusters
    across the Nile basin. For reference, a map of administrative regions in Africa

    crop masks of three LULC products, WaPOR landcover (WaPOR), Copernicus Global
    Land Service-Land Cover 100 Version 3 (Copernicus), and Global Land Cover-SHARE
    (GLC-SHARE), were the highest performing products in both assessments, in each
    case scoring more than 80 % (Table 3 and Fig. 6). These three products were therefore
    used to create a high-confidence cropland map (HCCM) with a threshold agreement
    of 66 % used to identify ‘true’ cropland areas. This threshold was chosen so that
    the total cropland area of the HCCM was comparable to the total cultivated area
    in Africa of 2.80 million km2 according to FAO’s Aquastat data for 2019 (FAO,
    2021). Table 3. Results of independent accuracy assessment of crop masks from

    As expected, there is high agreement between the three cropland masks found to
    have the highest accuracies following the twofold assessment (Fig. 7a). Relatively
    large areas of 100 % agreement between these three crop masks occur in the Nile
    basin in Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia; in the North West Coast river basin in Morrocco;
    in the Niger basin in Nigeria; and in the Rift Valley basin in Ethiopia. In contrast,

    is 2.36 million km2, approximately 8 % of the total area of Africa. This area
    is also 84 % of the total cultivated area in Africa of 2.8 million km2, according
    to FAO’s Aquastat data for 2019 (FAO,2021). 3.3. Budyko-partitioned cropland product
    (BPCP) The disaggregated cropland map created by partitioning the HCCM into rainfed
    and irrigated areas using the crop partitioning framework is shown in Fig. 8,
    while the confusion matrix generated after comparison with the independent validation
    dataset is presented in Table 4. An area of 461,000 km2, which is 19 % of the
    HCCM cropland area is identified as irrigated. Distinguishing between cropland
    areas of formal irrigation (i.e., blue ET ≥ 100 mm) and areas with supplemental
    irrigation in this Budyko-partitioned cropland product (BPCP), it is found that
    239,000 km2 (51.9 %) is under formal irrigation. In contrast, the remaining 222,000
    km2 can be classified as areas under supplemental irrigation. Large continuous
    areas where formal irrigation occurs can be found in the North West Coast basin
    in Morocco, the Nile Valley and Delta in Egypt, and the Nile basin in Sudan. Other
    notable areas where irrigation occurs include scattered croplands in the Zambezi
    basin in Malawi and Zambia, the inland delta of the Niger basin in Mali, the Lake
    Chad basin in north-eastern Nigeria, and South Africa. Download : Download high-res

    and intensive irrigated cropland area per country (Fig. 9) and total for Africa
    (Table 5) for the BPCP is presented along with the FAO Aquastat statistics on
    the irrigated area (only) and areas under AWM. The latter FAO data captures areas
    under flood recession agriculture and cultivated inland valley bottoms in addition
    to formal irrigated areas. Additionally, the irrigated areas for the remote-sensing
    products, WaPOR and Landsat-Derived Global Rainfed and Irrigated-Cropland Product
    (LGRIP), are also compared. The continental total irrigated area of BPCP (461,000
    km2), is larger than the FAO irrigated area (101,000 km2), the area under AWM
    (196,000 km2), and WaPOR continental irrigated cropland area (275,000 km2). However,
    the continental total irrigated area of BPCP is comparable to that of LGRIP, which
    is 494,000 km2. The area under formal irrigation for BPCP in Africa is comparable
    to the WaPOR irrigated cropland area. Considering the irrigated area per country,
    Egypt is the only country where all the products agree. For South Africa, the
    total BPCP irrigated area is similar to both WaPOR and LGRIP. Download : Download

    crop masks using Budyko The Budyko model was used to partition the crop masks
    from the original eight LULC products in this study (Fig. 10). A range of 19 %
    to 30 % of the total cropland area in each product was found to be irrigated,
    and approximately half of the irrigated area for each product was under formal
    irrigation (Table 6). After partitioning an undifferentiated WaPOR crop mask (i.e.,
    with irrigated and rainfed areas combined into one (crop) class) using the Budyko
    model, the irrigated area found was 499,000 km2 out of a cropland area of 2.49
    million km2. This is 1.8 times larger than the WaPOR remote-sensing product’s
    irrigated area of 275,000 km2. Download : Download high-res image (817KB) Download

    the level of concurrence between different LULC datasets, create a composite cropland
    map that addresses the challenges posed by the disparities found within individual
    crop masks from LULC products, and demonstrate a scalable approach for classifying
    croplands into two categories: irrigated and rainfed. On the first objective,
    a fair agreement is found between the eight preprocessed LULC products used in
    this study, given that the average similarity of each product compared to the
    other seven was at least 50 %. This fair agreement is primarily observed in barren
    areas, trees, and water classes. In contrast, there was a relatively low overlap
    in shrubs, grasses, and cropland classes. Specifically on cropland classification,
    Pérez-Hoyos et al. (2017) found that a full agreement between nine LULC products
    occurred in only 2 % of Africa, with the highest agreement in northern Morrocco,
    Algeria and Tunisia as well as the Nile Valley in Egypt. These areas of high cropland
    agreement coincide with 100 % of agreement between the top three crop masks (WaPOR,
    Copernicus and GLC-SHARE). Both studies, that of Pérez-Hoyos et al. (2017) and
    this present study, therefore align with the observation that areas of near-perfect
    agreement between cropland classes of LULC products occur in well-developed irrigated
    areas near large reservoirs (Thenkabail et al., 2010, Wei et al., 2020). Conversely,
    Pérez-Hoyos et al. (2017) found that areas of high cropland disagreement of up
    to 61.8 % occurred in Namibia and Angola as well as the Sahelian regions of Mauritania,
    northern Burkina Faso and Niger. These are areas where remote-sensing approaches
    fail to accurately discriminate between croplands and natural vegetation such
    as shrubs and grasses. This is evidenced in the high disagreement and overlap
    between these three LULC classes in this study (Fritz et al., 2010, Pittman et
    al., 2010). The utility of different LULC products needs to be assessed for specific
    applications. However, considering the differences between individual LULC and
    cropland products, using multiple maps or composite maps based on the degree of
    agreement may overcome the uncertainty associated with using one map for continental-scale
    studies. For example, in this study, the HCCM, which was derived based on the
    agreement between three existing products found to have high accuracy, was used
    for calibration and validation of the cropland partitioning framework. Even with
    this approach, legend translation of the original landcover products, especially
    for mosaic classes and the different spatial resolutions of the original datasets,
    introduces errors into the composite product (Fritz et al., 2010, Tchuenté et
    al., 2011). To illustrate, in this study, the LULC products were resampled from
    resolutions ranging from 10 m (Sentinel) to 1000 m (GLC-SHARE) to a uniform resolution
    of 300 m and then reclassified into a condensed eight-class LUWA classification
    system. Such preprocessing involved subjective decision-making based on literature
    as well as the knowledge and judgment of the interpreters (Fritz et al., 2010,
    Pérez-Hoyos et al., 2017, Tchuenté et al., 2011). It was thus subject to errors
    and information loss stemming from a misinterpretation of original classes, propagation
    of the inherent errors and inconsistencies of the original LULC products, and
    oversimplification of landcover characteristics. In particular, the reclassification
    from an average of 17 classes in the eight LULC products to a simple 8-class LUWA
    classification, as opposed to the typically extended 80-class LUWA classification,
    while making it easier to compare the various LULC products, resulted in the relatively
    high average agreement between LULC products. The continental irrigated cropland
    area of BPCP (461,000 km2) is relatively high compared to the FAO statistics on
    irrigated areas (101,000 km2) and areas under AWM (196,000 km2). Furthermore,
    when the Budyko model was applied to partition an undifferentiated WaPOR cropland
    product, the Budyko model identified substantially more irrigated cropland areas
    (499,000 km2) as compared to the actual WaPOR remote-sensing product (275,000
    km2). These findings align with that of Msigwa et al. (2021), who concluded that
    the Budyko model identified high blue ET even for rainfed croplands. However,
    it is likely that the Budyko model is identifying blue ET from informal, farmer-led,
    supplemental irrigation that is widespread across Africa (Adams, 1992, Balana
    et al., 2019, Beekman et al., 2014, Drechsel and Keraita, 2014, Woodhouse et al.,
    2016). As highlighted by Woodhouse et al. (2016), a “blind spot” in the narrative
    and statistics on irrigation in Africa is the failure to recognize that relatively
    minor adjustments made by farmers to supply water, for instance, to cope with
    dry spells in the wet season, qualify as irrigation. As such, between purely rainfed
    agriculture on the one hand and the large-scale, fully irrigated technological
    schemes typically held up as models on the other hand, there is a continuum of
    in-between agricultural water management that is well established across Africa
    (Adams, 1992, Beekman et al., 2014, Woodhouse et al., 2016). Examples of such
    partial irrigation systems may include water collection directly from streams
    to nearby farms using watering cans or motorized pumps in Ghana (Akpoti et al.,
    2022, Drechsel and Keraita, 2014); furrow irrigation through the diversion of
    streams in mountainous regions in southern and eastern Africa (Beekman et al.,
    2014); flood recession agriculture in the floodplains of seasonally flooded rivers
    in the upper Volta basin (Balana et al., 2019); and the use of shallow groundwater
    in valley bottoms all across Africa (Woodhouse et al., 2016). The FAO’s statistics
    on AWM captures two of these informal irrigation types: cultivated inland valley
    bottoms and flood recession agriculture. Still, this official data reported by
    countries to the FAO overlooks other informal supplemental irrigation. The original,
    non-parametric Budyko model is a simple, lumped model for water-energy balance
    studies (Gentine et al., 2012, Gerrits et al., 2009, Greve et al., 2015, Mianabadi
    et al., 2020, Padrón et al., 2017, Reaver et al., 2022, Sposito, 2017, Wang et
    al., 2016). This is so even under anthropogenically induced climate change because
    the co-evolution of landscape conditions and hydrological processes occurs with
    these changes (Mianabadi et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2016). As such, although the
    scatter of data points from the overall trend in the Budyko curve indicates the
    influence of environmental factors beyond climate, climate is seen as the “primary
    control” of long-term water partitioning as soils, plants, and land features are
    themselves connected to climate and ‘co-evolve’ with it (Chen & Sivapalan, 2020).
    This makes the Budyko model especially well-suited for continental-scale studies
    because the peculiar landscape characteristics of each location are accounted
    for in the model. In its application to partition croplands across Africa in this
    study, the high score of 92 % for both precision and specificity implies that
    the Budyko model has a low rate of false positives and is sufficiently accurate
    when identifying a cropland pixel as irrigated. However, there is often a trade-off
    between precision and sensitivity, evidenced by the relatively low sensitivity
    score of 59 %. As such, there is a higher rate of false negatives whereby some
    positive instances (irrigated croplands) are missed and incorrectly labeled as
    rainfed. This trade-off is considered acceptable for this study to ensure that
    the identification of irrigated pixels by the Budyko model is trustworthy and
    precise. Based on the scale established by Landis & Koch (1977) the Cohen’s Kappa
    score of 0.48 in this study is considered moderate. It is worth highlighting that
    some LULC products, such as WaPOR landcover and the recently released LGRIP (Teluguntla
    et al., 2023) use remote-sensing techniques to identify irrigated and rainfed
    cropland. For example, with LGRIP, using the GCEP30 as a base map, machine learning
    models were used to classify global agroecological zones and then identify pixels
    in these classes using ground data, spectral information, and image interpretation
    (Teluguntla et al., 2023). The methodology presented in this study, however expands
    the suite of remote sensing products that can be used for agricultural water studies
    as it makes it possible to derive irrigated and cropland products for the many
    remote-sensing LULC that do not have disaggregated cropland classes but may be
    preferred for certain locations or studies. Despite its good performance in this
    study, applying the Budyko model has limitations. For example, owing to the unfeasibility
    of when , Budyko cannot accurately represent the physical limit in the relation
    between and (Carmona et al., 2016). The uncertainty is also associated with the
    estimation of model parameters such as the aridity index. This study used remote-sensing-based
    climatic inputs that also have their limitations across Africa, partly stemming
    from the unavailability of in situ measurements (Mekonnen et al., 2023, Weerasinghe
    et al., 2020). Furthermore, it is possible that despite a tenfold increase in
    the spatial resolution used in this continental application compared to Msigwa
    et al. (2021), from 30 m to 300 m, steady-state conditions are still not met.
    Studies indicate that a much larger spatial scale of > 10,000 km2 would improve
    the effectiveness of the Budyko model (Mianabadi et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2016,
    Wang et al., 2022). However, the main limitation of this study is the spatial
    scale of input landcover datasets, which at 300 m exceeds the average farm size
    in Africa estimated to be less than 1 ha (Giller et al., 2021). Thus, using even
    larger spatial resolutions would result in further loss of detail and accuracy
    with respect to the applicability of the framework to croplands in Africa. 5.
    Conclusion Understanding the distribution of rainfed and irrigated areas provides
    valuable insights for agricultural water management and food security. However,
    identifying and disaggregating croplands in Africa is complex due to its extensive
    geographical expanse, diverse climates, and agricultural practices. This study
    first evaluated the agreement among eight land use and landcover datasets for
    Africa and then developed a high-confidence cropland map (HCCM) to overcome the
    disparities within individual crop masks of the LULC products. Subsequently, the
    Budyko model was used to distinguish between rainfed and irrigated cropland areas
    for the HCCM and the eight remote-sensing landcover products, demonstrating a
    scalable framework for partitioning cropland. The assessment of agreement between
    all landcover classes of the eight products showed a fair pairwise agreement of
    approximately 50 %, mainly driven by high agreement on the classification of areas
    as barren areas, trees, or water. Alternatively, there was high uncertainty and
    overlap in areas classed as shrubs, grasses, and crops. The results of cropland
    partitioning of the HCCM using the Budyko model show that an area of 461,000 km2,
    approximately 19 % of the total HCCM area of 2.36 million km2, is irrigated. For
    the eight remote-sensing landcover products, the irrigated areas ranged from 19
    % to 30 % of their respective cropland areas. For the HCCM and individual landcover
    products, approximately half of the irrigated areas were identified as cropland
    under formal irrigation, defined in this study as irrigated areas where blue evapotranspiration
    exceeds 100 mm. Compared to FAO’s irrigated area and areas under agricultural
    water management, the area of the HCCM identified as irrigated by the Budyko model
    is relatively large. This is likely due to the Budyko model capturing blue ET
    from all ‘excess’ water applied to crops as part of informal, farmer-led, supplemental
    irrigation widespread across Africa but not well-captured in the formal data reported
    by countries to the FAO. Using an independent validation dataset, the overall
    accuracy of the Budyko model in partitioning the HCCM was 73 %. High precision
    and specificity scores confirm that the Budyko model effectively identifies irrigated
    areas while making relatively few errors in misidentifying rainfed areas as irrigated.
    The Budyko model performs well in partioning between irrigated and rainfed areas
    in Africa, making it a well-suited model for continental-scale water-energy balance
    investigations. The cropland partitioning framework demonstrated in this study
    thus expands the range of landcover products that can be used for studying agricultural
    water management on a continental scale. Ultimately, this contributes to the development
    of sustainable and resilient agricultural systems in Africa by enhancing the understanding
    of irrigation and rainfed patterns. CRediT authorship contribution statement Afua

    regionsYield Prediction 1. Introduction Improving agricultural production is the
    key to reducing food insecurity in developing countries (Christiaensen and Martin,
    2018). Not only does agriculture provide food, but also it is a large source of
    employment. In Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 80% of rural households’ income relies
    on the agricultural industry (Davis et al., 2017). However, this major source
    of income and employment is threatened by environmental stressors such as climate
    change, supply-chain disruptions, and global crises such as COVID-19 that caused
    most developing countries to continue to experience food insecurity (Endris et
    al., 2021; Bedeke, 2022). Climate change and variability have caused most developing
    countries to experience food insecurity in the past few decades due to over-dependence
    on rainfed agriculture (Bedeke, 2022). Meanwhile, adopting Climate Smart Agricultural
    (CSA) interventions can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of climate change
    (Lipper et al., 2014, Okolie et al., 2022). Among these interventions, drought
    and flood monitoring and forecasting systems can help understand the magnitude
    and timing of water shortages. The aforementioned systems hold promise in supporting
    decision-makers with vital information to refine national and regional plans to
    mitigate the consequences of extreme environmental events (UN-Environment, 2017).
    However, these interventions alone are insufficient for a precise assessment of
    food insecurity (Sidikjonovich, 2023). This is because they only provide an indirect
    correlation between water imbalance effects and agricultural yield. On the other
    hand, direct yield estimation methods, which assess the effects of extreme climatic
    events on crop yield, can provide a more effective basis for policymakers when
    considering alternative strategies to tackle food insecurity (Ren et al., 2008,
    Glauber et al., 2021). Yield estimation can be accomplished through several means.
    Conventional forecasting systems heavily rely on field observations such as rainfall
    and temperature data obtained through weather stations or in-situ sensors (Bastiaanssen
    and Ali, 2003). Owing to their science-based physiological explanatory ability,
    process-based models provide the most transparent forecasting systems; however,
    they are data-intensive, rely heavily on field observations, and generally, are
    costly to deploy, operate, and maintain at the national scale (Li et al., 2015).
    Especially in data-scare regions, process-based models are constrained by the
    lack of ground observation to verify their performance. Hence, a vast majority
    of studies in recent years have shifted toward the use of remote sensing data
    for crop yield prediction for different purposes and at different scales (Ilyas
    et al., 2023, Singh and Das, 2022, Khaki et al., 2021). As technology advances,
    remotely sensed products have proved to be reliable, easily accessible, and uniformly
    available even in the most remote areas. The use of recently developed remote
    sensing satellite imagery allows the production of high-resolution data, which
    is readily available and not constrained by geographical or environmental factors.
    This approach overcomes the limitations inherent in traditional data acquisition
    processes that can be hindered by such parameters (Sui et al., 2018). As these
    products continually improve in quality and frequency, there is a high probability
    that the predictability of forecasting models using these products can revolutionize
    agricultural and water resources management (Sheffield et al., 2018). Traditional
    remote sensing-based yield estimation techniques typically rely on a single parameter
    extracted from satellite images to construct a correlation between said parameter
    and crop yield (Panek and Gozdowski, 2020, Lopresti et al., 2015, Meroni et al.,
    2013). Nevertheless, recent research has started to integrate multiple parameters
    in an effort to establish a more comprehensive correlation between these aggregated
    parameters and crop yield (Muruganantham et al., 2022). For instance, Kern et
    al. (2018) formulated a highly precise crop yield prediction model based on multiple
    linear regression for four primary crops in Hungary: winter wheat, rapeseed, maize,
    and sunflower. The parameters encompassed average nitrogen application, temperature
    extremes (minimum and maximum), mean vapor pressure deficit, monthly average Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, average monthly soil moisture levels,
    and potential prediction timeframe. However, traditional linear regression models
    are not effective for all types of crops and regions. Therefore, Cheng et al.
    (2022) leveraged data-driven methods to mitigate this limitation in predicting
    winter wheat yield. The model incorporated factors such as Sentinel-2 and ZY-1
    02D remote sensing images, the greenness vegetation index, and the water index.
    In conclusion, to enhance the accuracy of yield prediction utilizing multi-spectral
    imagery, the integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial dimensions has been
    studied in crop yield estimation research (Qiao et al., 2021). Despite these improvements
    in crop yield estimations, many of these methods have been created for developing
    countries with limited scalability to other regions. In addition, the predictability
    of some previous studies is undermined by incomplete datasets attributable to
    adverse weather conditions. However, advancements in technology have yielded new
    satellite imagery products that can help bridge gaps in data while concurrently
    furnishing more precise and higher-resolution information. Therefore, our goal
    in this study is to use technological advancement in remote sensing to estimate
    crop yield in data-scared regions such as Senegal. The problem is further aggravated
    due to a lack of reliable ground observation data that is usually aggregated at
    a large scale, such as the department (administrative unit) level. In order to
    address these challenges, the following objectives should be considered: 1) examining
    the sensitivity of remotely sensed products to crop yield variabilities in different
    regions and 2) developing the regional crop yield predictive models. The novelty
    of this work is the contribution of sub-seasonal and unaggregated crop information
    in order to improve the overall model predictability in case of data scarcity
    in developing regions of the world. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area This
    study is Senegal, a country in West Africa. Senegal has a dry tropical climate,
    with an average annual rainfall of about 1200 (mm) in the south and about 300
    mm in the arid zones. Between 1991 and 2020, the mean annual temperature was about
    28.91 degrees Celsius (World Bank Group, 2021). The soil type is primarily sandy,
    which allows crops like millet, sorghum, corn, and groundnuts to grow very well
    in most of its agricultural departments. Rice is also grown well in the irrigated
    areas of Senegal. With slightly over 3 million hectares of arable land nationwide,
    only about 2% is irrigated (Global Yield Gap Atlas, 2016). Senegal’s agriculture
    sector is very significant, as it takes up about 43% of the country’s total area,
    contributes about 17% to the GDP, and offers employment to about 70% of its population
    (Feed The Future, 2015). Millet production, like the production of other cereals,
    experiences yearly variability influenced by diverse weather patterns and economic
    pressures (Debieu et al., 2018, Kane et al., 2016). However, as of 2016, millet
    had emerged as the second-largest contributor to the national food production
    system, following groundnuts, and accounting for roughly 20% of the total agricultural
    activities (Feed The Future, 2015). Furthermore, in 2018, it accounted for 30%
    of all cereal production in the country (Kane et al., 2023). 2.2. Modeling overview
    Our research proposes three hypotheses to enhance the accuracy of millet yield
    prediction. The first hypothesis suggests that incorporating soil moisture-based
    indices derived from high-resolution satellite-based soil moisture retrievals
    can improve the prediction. The second hypothesis suggests that a prediction model
    based on individual stages of millet growth will be more effective than a model
    based on the average of all stages. Lastly, we hypothesize that accounting for
    the area of millet production at the department level during different growth
    stages can improve the overall model predictability. To test these hypotheses,
    we introduce a modeling procedure, which is presented schematically in Fig. 1
    and briefly explained in the following section. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Overview of the modeling process.
    Crop yield is affected by both spatiotemporal and physiographical variables. Therefore,
    in the first step, we obtained remotely sensed data on temperature, soil moisture,
    precipitation, as well as vegetation cover to develop different spatiotemporal
    variables. We also utilized physiographical variables derived from a combination
    of remote sensing and ground observations data pertaining to soil characteristics.
    These variables were used to perform Predictive and Exploratory Analysis. Thirty
    eight variables, collected from all Senegal departments, went through an initial
    series of checks to examine their interdependency, validity, and correlation with
    crop yield through the preprocessing stage. This information is then fed to a
    series of machine learning (ML) and nested cross-validation techniques to identify
    the most robust model. In the next step, we are performing variable reduction
    strategies to reduce the burden of future data collection and improve computational
    time. Variables are systematically reduced to identify the best combination of
    variables for the optimal ML model. Finally, the optimal model is subjected to
    permutation importance analysis to determine the significance of each feature.
    This involves shuffling the values of each feature in the validation dataset and
    comparing the model’s performance on the shuffled and original datasets. The importance
    scores of each feature are averaged over multiple iterations for a more reliable
    estimate. 2.3. Data input 2.3.1. Crop yield data Five-year (2016 – 2020) crop
    yield data for millet were obtained for 43 departments in Senegal (Vieira Junior
    et al., 2023). Millet production is predominantly in the western region, with
    the highest production in the southwest and the lowest in the north (Fig. 2.a).
    Fig. 2.b shows the millet production zones clustered using k-means method and
    the country’s average yield value of 43 departments (Fig. 2). The planting period
    of millet across the country ranges from June to July; this is the period between
    the beginning and end of the planting exercise. August is the main growing period
    of millet in Senegal; this is the period that the crop attains most of its vegetative
    growth and achieves maximum canopy cover. The harvesting of millet ranges from
    September to November; this is the period when the crop is removed from the field
    (FAO, 2020). The harvesting period seems spatially longer than the planting and
    growing periods because millet can be harvested from the time the grains mature
    while the crop is still using water and nutrients for its growth-producing fresh
    grains until the crop stops growing and loses water-producing dry grains. Download

    a) average Millet production across Senegal; b) production zones based on annual
    average yield. 2.3.2. Spatiotemporal and physiographical variables The following
    remote sensing products were employed to assess the impact of various environmental
    stressors on crop productivity at different stages of development. The source
    and further details of these remote sensing products are presented in Table 1
    and section A1.0 of the Supplementary Materials. Also, since the reported yield
    data was at the department level while remote sensing data have varying spatial
    scales, it was necessary to upscale the remote sensing products to the department
    level. The upscaling was achieved by averaging all cells of a department using
    the ArcGIS version 10.8.1 zonal statistic tool. Additionally, the remote sensing
    data was only extracted for areas with agricultural land use. Then, all indices
    were calculated/extracted for three millet development stages: planting (June-July),
    growing (August), and harvesting (September to November) periods (FAO, 2020).
    In summary, eight remote sensing products were utilized to estimate yield during
    the planting, growing, harvesting, and development seasons, resulting in 38 predictor
    variables. Table 1. Remote sensing products used for the yield prediction. Index

    The remotely sensed products and observation data used in this study are generally
    categorized into spatiotemporal and physiographical groups (section A1.0 of the
    Supplementary Materials). The spatiotemporal variables were carefully selected
    to capture the environmental stressors that change over time and space. Meanwhile,
    the physiographical variables are limited to those that represent local conditions.
    2.3.3. Data analysis 2.3.3.1. Bias correction After conducting an extensive analysis
    of crop cultivation in every department of Senegal between 2016 and 2020, we found
    that multiple crops were grown in the same department and could not be differentiated
    during data acquisition. As a result, the remotely sensed data, particularly the
    NDVI, which measures the reflectance of vegetation in a given area, did not distinguish
    millet from other crops. This led to elevated NDVI readings, even during millet
    harvesting periods, which were attributed to other crops grown in the same department
    as millet. Moreover, the growing vegetation could have influenced soil moisture
    readings, which are essential in calculating the WDI. To reduce the margin of
    error, we identified the exact size of the cultivated area where millet was grown
    in each department and established a Bias Correction factor (Tables S1 to S3).
    By considering only the area in which millet is grown, we can more accurately
    compute the WDI with respect to the planting, growing, and harvesting periods.
    This correction factor will improve the accuracy of similar calculations and provide
    a more precise understanding of the agricultural conditions in Senegal. 2.3.3.2.
    Exploratory analysis: spatiotemporal and physiographical variable analysis We
    aim to investigate the individual effects of spatiotemporal and physiographic
    variables on millet crop yields as well as the relationships between these variables
    using Spearman’s rank correlation and linear mixed effects model, as they have
    different strengths and weaknesses. With Spearman’s rank correlation, we examined
    the correlation between all remote sensing indices and crop yield to understand
    their annual variabilities. Meanwhile, we statistically identified the most relevant
    indices to crop yield regardless of temporal variability with the linear mixed
    effects model. By investigating the independent effects of these factors, we can
    better understand how they influence millet crop yields. Data were analyzed using
    the R statistical software (R Core Team, 2022). We employed a linear mixed effects
    model to test the effect of independent variables (WDI, SMI, GDDI, VI, SMDI, SRI3,
    SPI3, DSI, sand content, silt content, clay content, nitrogen content, SOC, and
    rainfall erosivity (during the planting, growing, and harvesting stages of plant
    growth) on millet yield using the package ‘lmerTest” (Kuznetsova et al., 2017).
    Independent variables were considered fixed effects, and departments and years
    were considered random effects. All independent variables were continuous, and
    we standardized the variables (mean centered at 0 and standard deviation of 1)
    because the means of some variables were different by many orders of magnitude,
    leading to scaling issues. Model residuals were assessed visually by plotting
    model residuals against predicted values to assess constant variance, and the
    responses were log-transformed to meet the model assumption. Additionally, a QQ-plot
    was used to visually evaluate the normality of the model residuals, and it was
    found that the model satisfied the assumptions of normality. Outliers were identified
    using the function outlierTest (Fox and Weisberg, 2019). Significant mean shifting
    studentized residuals were identified based on Bonferroni adjusted p values and
    were removed from the model. Next, a backward elimination stepwise regression
    was used to identify candidate predictors of millet yield using package “stats”
    (R Core Team, 2022). Starting with the current model including all predictors,
    one predictor was dropped at a time, and AIC values were computed for each model.
    The candidate model with the lowest AIC was used as a final model. Partial residuals
    plotted against each significant predictor suggested that higher-order polynomial
    regression was unnecessary. Each significant predictor of millet yield was then
    categorized into four different categories based on quantiles to assess mean differences
    in millet yield. The model with categorical predictors was subjected to ANOVA.
    Post hoc mean separation tests were performed on significant predictors based
    on tukey adjusted p values at the alpha level of 0.05 using the “emmeans” package
    (Lenth et al., 2023). Finally, back-transformed estimated marginal means are reported.
    2.3.3.3. Predictive analysis: crop yield estimations In this task, we aimed to
    predict millet yield using the spatiotemporal and physiographical features dataset.
    The task started with preprocessing, in which we applied MinMax, Robust, Standard,
    and Power Transformer scaling methods, respectively, to the input and output variables
    to ensure that the differences would not influence our model in the scale of the
    features (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Then, to find the best hyperparameters for
    the ML models and to evaluate their performance, we used nested cross-validation
    with the following configurations: 1) Inner cross-validation loop: This loop is
    responsible for selecting the best hyperparameters for the model and 2) Outer
    cross-validation loop: This loop is responsible for estimating the model’s performance.
    We divided the dataset into multiple, equally-sized folds (in our case, 5). In
    each iteration of the loop, one of these folds was set aside as “test set,” while
    the remaining folds were used for training the model. This process was repeated
    until each fold had been used as the test set once. The average performance across
    all iterations provided an unbiased estimate of the model’s performance. For each
    iteration in the outer loop, we performed another cross-validation process on
    the training data (again using 5 folds). This time, however, we used a grid search
    to try different combinations of hyperparameters for our ML models. The hyperparameter
    combination that resulted in the best average performance was chosen as the best
    set of hyperparameters for that iteration. After finding the best hyperparameters
    using nested cross-validation, we trained the model on the entire dataset and
    saved it for further model evaluation. We compute the error indexes, including
    the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), the coefficient of determination
    (R2), Root mean Square Error (RSME), the normalized root mean squared error by
    variable range (nRMSE), and Willmot’s index of agreement (d) for each iteration
    of the outer loop and then average them for evaluating the model performance.
    We repeat the above-mentioned procedure to select the best unbiased model among
    eight regression models for millet yield prediction. The models that we selected
    with their hyperparameter configurations are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Comparison

    permutation importance analysis Permutation importance is a method for assessing
    the relative significance of features in a ML model by quantifying the change
    in model performance when a particular feature’s values are randomly shuffled
    (Breiman, 2001). The underlying principle is that if a feature is crucial, scrambling
    its values should significantly impact the model’s performance, while shuffling
    an insignificant feature should have minimal or no effect. In some cases, an increase
    in model performance after shuffling a feature’s values may occur, indicating
    that the feature introduces noise to the model, thereby degrading its performance.
    Overall, this technique offers an intuitive way to comprehend the importance of
    each feature in a model by directly examining the consequences of shuffling the
    feature values on the model’s performance. Herein, we employ the Scikit-learn
    library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) to compute permutation importance. Using the
    fitted ML model, we evaluated each feature by randomly shuffling its values and
    then assessing the model’s performance on the shuffled dataset with the same scoring
    function utilized during model training and cross-validation. Subsequently, the
    change in performance is compared to that of the original performance. This process
    was repeated ten times for each feature, and the average performance change was
    calculated and reported as feature importance. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Explanatory analysis: spatiotemporal and physiographical variable analysis 3.1.1.
    Assessing the effect of temporal variability on the relationship between crop
    yield and remote sensing indices using Spearman’s rank correlation The Spearman’s
    Rank correlation coefficients between millet yield and different spatiotemporal
    and physiographical variables for all departments in Senegal are presented in

    image Fig. 3. Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient analysis of millet yield
    and spatiotemporal/physiographical variables across departments in Senegal. 3.1.1.1.
    Planting indices Specific planting indices, namely WDI, SMI, and GDDI, were discovered
    to have a negative impact on millet crop yield due to increased water demands,
    unsuitable vegetation conditions, elevated temperature, and significant soil moisture
    deficits during planting. However, the remaining planting indices exhibited inconsistent
    trends, indicating complex relationships that require further investigation. This
    inconsistency was especially noticeable in 2016 and 2020, which corresponded to
    the rainy planting period as indicated by drought indices. Waterlogging can result
    in yield reduction in some millet species due to disruptions in nutrient uptake
    and gas exchange (Matsuura et al., 2016). 3.1.1.2. Growing indices The association
    between millet crop yield and different growing indices is more intricate and
    diverse than planting indices. Certain indices primarily exhibit a negative correlation
    with crop yield (namely WDI, SMI, and GDDI), whereas others manifest irregular
    patterns, and a few are predominantly positively linked. These findings imply
    that the impact of these indices on crop yield throughout the growing period is
    contingent on specific contextual factors and other pertinent variables. 3.1.1.3.
    Harvesting indices During the harvesting period, there was a lack of a discernible
    p trend in the indices’ correlation. Nonetheless, WDI and SMI exhibited a robust
    negative correlation in the earlier and later years, indicating that increased
    values of these variables could have resulted in reduced yields. This timeframe
    corresponds to the dry harvesting season, as evidenced by the presence of negative
    drought indices. Millet exhibits inherent drought tolerance, and its yield can
    increase with temperature; nonetheless, extreme drought conditions can adversely
    affect its yield (Lee et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2018). Additionally, all drought
    indices (DSI, SMDI, SPI3, and SRI3) displayed a considerable positive correlation
    in 2018 and 2019, implying that elevated values of these variables could have
    contributed to high millet yields. 3.1.1.4. Physiographical indices The correlation
    coefficients between various physiographical indices and millet yield showed fluctuating
    trends from 2016 to 2020 that are harder to explain as the values of these indices
    are constant during the study period. This suggests that it is crucial to account
    for spatiotemporal variations alongside physiographical indices when characterizing
    the anomalies and fluctuations in millet yield. Over the period of three years
    (2018–2020), various indices, such as clay and silt content, soil organic carbon,
    and rainfall erosivity, exhibited predominantly negative correlation coefficients.
    However, there was an exception with sand, which demonstrated a general increasing
    trend between 2016 and 2019, followed by a decrease in 2020. 3.1.1.5. Overall
    summary The study shows that the relationship between indices and millet crop
    yield is complex and varies depending on the stage of crop development. Overall,
    the correlations vary from − 0.56 (Planting SMI) to + 0.40 (Harvesting SRI3).
    However, regardless of the growth stage, all variables describing crop water demands
    (WDI, VI, SMI, and GDDI) are negatively correlated with yield. In contrast, all
    drought indices (DSI, SMDI, SPI3, and SRI3) are positively correlated with millet
    yields indicating no drought conditions. Nonetheless, when examining the temporal
    trends, the results show the occurrence of both wet and dry years during the study
    period. The physiographical parameters are negatively correlated with yield except
    for the sand content. Meanwhile, the temporal element adds more complexity and
    inconsistent trends. Therefore, additional analysis is required to enhance the
    comprehension of these relationships, accounting for other influential factors
    and adopting modeling techniques that accommodate complex and nonlinear relationships.
    3.1.2. Assessing the relationship between crop yield and remote sensing indices
    using Spearman’s rank correlation Stepwise regression through backward elimination
    following a linear mixed effect model showed that VI, GDDI, SPI3, and SRI3 in
    the planting period, VI in the growing period, WDI, VI, SMI, GDDI, SMDI, SPI3,
    and SRI3 in the harvesting period, and rainfall erosivity and soil organic carbon
    unvarying of time had a significant effect on millet yield (Table S4). Below is
    the yield prediction model with the lowest AIC in which 78.6% of the variation
    in the millet yield was explained by the following equation (Eq. 1): (1) ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ
    ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ ꞵ where, all variables were modeled as predictors, and the
    year and department were modeled as random effects. j and k are department and
    year, respectively; N is a normal or Gaussian distribution, α is a random effect
    representing the effect of the department (j) or year (k) on yield, ꞵ is the model
    coefficient, μ is the mean value of the random effects, and δ2 is unaccounted
    variation, which is the overall variance of the random effects not explained by
    the model. In general, some indices have a positive relationship with planting
    SPI3, growing VI, harvesting WDI, harvesting SRI3, and Rainfall Erosivity. In
    contrast, others have a negative relationship, like planting VI, planting GDDI,
    planting SRI3, harvesting VI, harvesting SMI, harvesting GDDI, harvesting SMDI,
    harvesting SPI3, and SOC. The results of our analysis of variance indicate that
    certain variables have a strong correlation with millet yield. Specifically, during
    the planting period, SPI3 and SRI3, and during the growing period, VI, as well
    as SOC, showed a significant correlation with millet yield at the 0.1% significance
    level. SPI3 values above the median indicate above-average precipitation, while
    high SRI3 values indicate high hydrologic runoff, suggesting the absence of drought
    according to both indices. In addition, we observed that high values of planting
    SPI3 and harvesting SRI3 were associated with higher values of millet yields;
    however, the confidence interval for planting SPI3 (0.43 – 1.33) is wider than
    the confidence interval for growing VI (0.15 – 0.50), demonstrating greater uncertainty
    in the effect of planting SPI3 on millet yield. The planting period is crucial
    for millet as it includes plant emergence and early stages of development when
    adequate moisture is necessary for germination and early growth (Nivedita, 1992).
    The young plants are sensitive to dry spells, and high levels of runoff can cause
    erosion, making them fragile. Our findings align with Fall et al. (2021), who
    reported that very high precipitation could cause crop damage when associated
    with runoff, which explains why high values of SRI could be associated with low
    yield, as very high precipitation may have resulted in high surface runoff which
    could easily erode germinating plants. We also found that VI, derived from NDVI,
    had a strong correlation with millet yield during the growing period (August),
    consistent with Fall et al. (2021) and Panek and Gozdowski (2020), who reported
    the highest correlation between NDVI and cereal yield during the early stages
    of crop development. Our findings indicate a relationship between SOC levels and
    millet yields, with moderate SOC levels being associated with higher millet yields.
    Conversely, elevated SOC levels are correlated with reduced millet yields. This
    observation is in agreement with Oldfield et al. (2019), who reported a decline
    in maize yield when SOC concentrations exceeded 2%. The consistency between these
    studies underscores the potential influence of SOC on crop productivity and the
    importance of optimizing SOC levels for various crop types (Oldfield et al., 2019).
    3.2. Predictive analysis: crop yield estimations 3.2.1. Predictive crop yield
    model selection Table 3 outlines the performance of different machine learning
    models evaluated for predicting millet yield with all available remote sensing
    data employed in this study. The nested cross-validation revealed that linear
    models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic
    Net Regression, had moderate predictive power, with Lasso Regression outperforming
    the others with an R2 score of 0.22. Also, the K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
    algorithm performed poorly, suggesting a potential need for future engineering
    or extensive training with better data in these models. Gradient Boosting and
    Support Vector Machine slightly improved, with R2 scores of 0.14 and 0.17, respectively.
    This improvement hints at the benefits of sequential learning and kernel methods,
    yet their moderate scores indicate that the current hyperparameters or data size
    may not suffice, and further data or broader hyperparameter exploration could
    improve outcomes. On the other hand, the Random Forest model stood out, which
    achieved an average R2 score of 0.25 and an RMSE of 0.59. Known for its robustness
    to data variability and ability to capture nonlinear relationships, we selected
    Random Forest as our preferred model for further analysis based on these performance
    metrics. This is also aligned with previous studies, where the Random Forest Regressor
    model performed its robustness in predicting cotton yield (Prasad et al., 2021),
    wheat yield (Jeong et al., 2016), and soybean yield (Sakamoto, 2020). Table 3.

    3.2.2. Predictive crop yield model implementation and evaluation of its performance
    Table 4 and S5 present the results of the Random Forest Regressor models, which
    were trained using different sets of independent variables. The models’ performance
    was evaluated using several statistical indices, including NSE, R2, d, RMSE, and
    nRMSE. The best model was selected based on the highest NSE, R2, and d values
    and the lowest RMSE and nRMSE values. According to these criteria, the best model
    was identified as the one using all independent variables except Department, Harvesting,
    Total, Growing, Physiographical, and Planting SMI, VI, and GDDI (Fig. 4a). This
    model exhibited the highest NSE (0.831), the lowest RMSE (0.308) and nRMSE (0.077),
    and the highest R2 (0.831) and d (0.942) values. Conversely, the worst-performing
    model used all independent variables except Bias Correction factor and Department
    (Fig. 4b), which had the lowest NSE (0.730), the highest RMSE (0.391) and nRMSE
    (0.098), and the lowest R2 (0.730) and d (0.896) values. The exclusion of certain
    variables, including Department, Harvesting, Total, Growing, Physiographical,
    and some climate-related variables (SMI, VI, and GDDI) during the planting period,
    improved the Random Forest performance model. These variables may have had less
    influence on the response variable, or their exclusion may have reduced multicollinearity
    or noise in the data (Schroeder, 1990; Senaviratna and Cooray, 2019). However,
    these findings are dataset-specific and may not necessarily apply to other crops
    and regions. Table 4. The best-performing Random Forest Regressor models for different

    predicted vs. actual millet yield for (a) the best- and (b) worst-performing Random
    Forest Regressor models. Meanwhile, the relatively lower statistical indices associated
    with the average-performing Random Forest Regressor models (refer to Table S5)
    could suggest the presence of other influential factors, currently unaccounted
    for or unidentified, that significantly impact millet yield predictions. These
    factors may not be entirely observable or quantifiable through the remote sensing
    products employed in this study. 3.2.3. Understanding the key predictors for millet
    crop yield using permutation importance analysis Fig. 5 illustrates the relative
    significance of the independent variables contributing to the optimal performance
    of the Random Forest Regressor model. The prominence of the WDI within the optimal
    model underscores the pivotal role of water availability in crop production, particularly
    during the planting phase. This suggests that any alterations in water accessibility,
    whether instigated by climatic extremes, farming management practices, or other
    elements, could profoundly affect millet yields. Singh and Das (2022) also found
    that WDI affected crop yield significantly (Singh and Das, 2022). However, soil
    fertility variations and pervasive striga infestations contribute to significant
    fluctuations in millet production across Asia and Africa (Singh et al., 2017).
    The Bias Correction factor emerged as the second most influential variable. This
    high ranking infers substantial variability in millet cultivation areas across
    different departments, a factor of paramount importance when production data is
    only available in aggregated forms, such as at departmental or district levels.

    Fig. 5. The relative importance of independent variables in the overall performance
    of the optimal Random Forest Regressor model. The combined contribution of the
    indices related to drought and flood conditions (Planting SMI, Planting SPI3,
    Planting DSI, Planting SRI3, and Planting SMDI) accounts for approximately 49%
    of the variance, thereby signifying the substantial impact of extreme events on
    millet yield. Moreover, incorporating SPI3 and SRI3, representing precipitation
    and runoff data over three months, insinuates that recent climatic conditions
    during the planting phase can significantly influence overall crop yields. This
    is in line with other studies that have used these indices, SPI specifically,
    to monitor or predict yield (Mohammed et al., 2022, Tigkas et al., 2018). This
    underlines the necessity of incorporating temporal dynamics into agricultural
    modeling and planning. Consequently, identifying these crucial periods could aid
    in planning interventions or mitigation strategies to optimize yield. In summary,
    these findings emphasize the intricate nature of agricultural yield predictions,
    which are influenced by a multitude of interconnected environmental factors. They
    further underscore the necessity of maintaining comprehensive, spatially and temporally
    explicit data pertaining to these factors to enhance the precision and applicability
    of these predictive models. 4. Conclusion In this study, a systematic examination
    was conducted employing various spatiotemporal remote sensing data to construct
    a millet crop yield forecast model for Senegal using traditional statistical methods
    and more advanced approaches like machine learning based on five-year aggregated
    data at the departmental level. The key findings and subsequent steps are outlined
    as follows: • During the millet planting period, the availability of water has
    a substantial influence on the total crop yield. Consequently, remote sensing
    parameters that capture these factors, such as WDI, emerged as the highest-ranking
    variable in the predictive crop yield model. • The Bisa Correction factor’s relevance
    was underscored by its position immediately following WDI in terms of its ability
    to account for variabilities in crop yields. The emergence of this new Bisa Correction
    factor is encouraging and warrants additional investigation and validation across
    various regions and crop types. • Extreme weather events explain by different
    Severity Index (e.g., DSI) during the planting stage, capture around 50% of millet
    yield. • This study demonstrates the importance of integrating soil moisture-based
    indicators, considering distinct phases of millet development, considering production
    regions at the departmental level, and applying bias correction factors to enhance
    the accuracy of crop yield forecasts. This research focused on forecasting millet
    yields in Senegal, but subsequent studies could broaden the analysis to encompass
    additional crops and locales. Since various crops respond differently to extreme
    weather conditions, exploring these relationships across a spectrum of crops could
    enhance the creation of diverse crop yield prediction models. Moreover, examining
    various regions that experience distinct climate patterns would shed light on
    how well the study’s results apply to different settings and the overall applicability
    of the findings. Moreover, by incorporating socioeconomic information into crop
    yield forecasting models, we can uncover other factors that influence yield fluctuations
    and provide data-driven recommendations for policymaking to bolster food security.

    Groundwater potential delineation is essential for efficient water resource utilization
    and long-term development. The scarcity of potable and irrigation water has become
    a critical issue due to natural and anthropogenic activities in meeting the demands
    of human survival and productivity. With these constraints, groundwater resource
    is now being used extensively in Ethiopia. Therefore, an innovative convolutional
    neural network (CNN) is successfully applied in the Gunabay watershed to delineate
    groundwater potential based on the selected major influencing factors. Groundwater
    recharge, lithology, drainage density, lineament density, transmissivity, and
    geomorphology were selected as major influencing factors during the groundwater
    potential of the study area. For dataset training, 70% of samples were selected
    and 30% were used for serving out of the total 128 samples. The spatial distribution
    of groundwater potential has been classified into five groups: very low (10.72%),

    Gunabay watershed 1. Introduction Surface water is extremely scarce in semi-arid
    and arid regions (Shao et al., 2020). Groundwater is more widespread and abundant
    to tackle water scarcity problem in arid regions compared with surface water (Jaafarzadeh
    et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023). Groundwater reservoirs provide water for domestic,
    irrigation, industry, and many other activities (Adimalla et al., 2020; Verma
    et al., 2021; Tegegne et al., 2023a) to sustain life, particularly for drought
    regions (Moodley et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). Nearly 33.3% of the population
    of the universe is reliant on groundwater (Chen et al., 2022). However, increasing
    the water demand for drinking, agricultural, and industrial sectors have put pressure/depleting
    on this resource (Dar et al., 2021). Furthermore, due to less rainfall, increasing
    anthropogenic activities and climate change (Gautam et al., 2023) insufficient
    water availability is the main constraint in the globe (Yan et al., 2021) including
    Ethiopia. Around 3.5 billion people do not have access to safe household water
    consumption and hygiene (Khatri and Tyagi, 2015). World Health Organization (WHO,
    2017) proposed that accessible, safe, and satisfactory water must be available
    to sustain human life. As a result, identifying groundwater potentiality is the
    most pressing issue (Shi et al., 2021) to be addressed for current utilization
    and future sustainable development preservation (Panahi et al., 2020; Moharir
    et al., 2023). Groundwater potentiality is also known as groundwater occurrence
    or water availability in groundwater reservoirs (Khosravi et al., 2018; Obeidavi
    et al., 2021). Though, the probability of groundwater occurrence varies by area
    and time (Chen et al., 2019; Shao et al., 2020). Groundwater recharge in aquifer
    zones may increase groundwater availability, but groundwater recharge is little
    known for increasing groundwater storage (Souza et al., 2018) in the watershed.
    Recharge of groundwater is termed as the downward movement of water, which reaches
    the water table increasing the storage of reservoir (Dadgar et al., 2020; Hall
    et al., 2020). It is also essential parameter to connect surface water with groundwater
    in the aquifers (Jaafarzadeh et al., 2021). However, the movement of recharge
    is always influenced by changes in such parameters as land cover, geologic conditions,
    hydrology, soil types, climate, slope, and other factors (Pourghasemi et al.,
    2020; Doke et al., 2021; Karki et al., 2021). For example, slope is a critical
    factor that directly affects percolation system, infiltration rate, and runoff
    (Das, 2021). Groundwater storage is governed by the aquifer capabilities such
    as specific capacity, transmissivity, drawdown, pumping rate, static groundwater
    level, storativity, and morphological parameters (Sikakwe, 2018; Rizeei et al.,
    2019). As a result, groundwater potential will be defined by the combined accessibility
    of groundwater recharge and storage. Several traditional and field survey approaches
    have been integrated into spatial modeling to evaluate groundwater resource. But
    they are expensive, challenging, and time-consuming. Recently, groundwater resource
    studies have been integrated with Remote Sensing (RS), and Geographic Information
    System (GIS) techniques (Panahi et al., 2020). RS and GIS provide economic datasets
    that cover entire areas without wastage of time. To recognize the probability
    of spatial groundwater potentiality, several statistical approaches have been
    integrated into GIS: Analytic hierarchy process (Arabameri et al., 2019a,b; Kaur
    et al., 2020; Berhanu and Hatiye, 2020; Shao et al., 2020; Doke et al., 2021;
    Moodley et al., 2022), Catastrophe theory (Kaur et al., 2020), Evidential belief
    function, Frequency ratio (Kim et al., 2018), Index of entropy (Kordestani et
    al., 2019), Logistic regression (Yousefi et al., 2020), Weight of evidence (Kordestani
    et al., 2019; Panahi et al., 2020), Multi-criteria decision making (Arabameri
    et al., 2019a; Yousefi et al., 2020), Shannon''s entropy (Panahi et al., 2020),
    and Dempster Shafer Model (Jaafarzadeh et al., 2021) are some of the terms to
    mention. Superior capability of deep learning algorithms (DLAs) over machine learning
    algorithms (MLAs) and statistical methods integrated within the ArcGIS tool (Saha
    et al., 2022) have been initiated by many scholars. Some researchers have investigated
    the competence of CNN under DLAs in the spatial prediction of groundwater mapping
    (Chen et al., 2019) and determined its superiority over other approaches. Particularly,
    the application of deep learning approach is more acceptable to predict the potential
    of groundwater zone in the mountainous landscape (Pradhan et al., 2021). CNN is
    recently been applied effectively in many groundwater resource, and related studies,
    such as groundwater potentiality (Nguyen et al., 2020; Panahi et al., 2020; Xu
    et al., 2020, 2022; Pradhan et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022;
    Hakim et al., 2022; Tegegne, 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Moughani et al., 2023; Ouali
    et al., 2023), landslide susceptibility detection (Fang et al., 2020; Ngo et al.,
    2021; Sameen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Nikoobakht et al., 2022; Xiong et
    al., 2022; Aslam et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Lin et al.,
    2023; Sreelakshmi and Vinod Chandra, 2023; Zhao and Chen, 2023), land use/cover
    classification (Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Carranza-García et al.,
    2019; Jozdani et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2019; Wambugu et al., 2021; Yu et al.,
    2022), geological properties detection (de Lima et al., 2019; Geng et al., 2019;
    Mohd Razak and Jafarpour, 2020; Li et al., 2020, 2021a; Ren et al., 2021; Di et
    al., 2022; Qin et al., 2023) and prediction of soil properties (Ng et al., 2019;
    Hao et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020; Padarian et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Ronaldo
    et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2021; Lanjewar and Gurav, 2022). Several scientists
    are working to simplify problems using various modeling approaches that have more
    approximations. However, in groundwater studies, there is no universal maximal
    prediction control that works perfectly (Chen et al., 2019). There are, however,
    always optimal and superior predictor techniques. The capability of the spatial
    modeling (machine, deep learning, statistical and correlation coefficients) output
    can be measured using standard approaches (i.e., SVR, Kappa, CNN, ROC and RMSE)
    (Mandal et al., 2021). Many rural towns have been expanding rapidly over Blue
    Nile Basin, and it may increase water demand. Because most river are drying up
    due to anthropogenic activities, and natural phenomenon. Hence groundwater is
    the only critical water supply resource in this situation. Subsurface water is
    drought resistant, less contaminated, and responds slowly to climate change. However,
    the high potential for agricultural land is primarily rain-fed agriculture (Yimere
    and Assefa, 2022). Sustainable crop production does not support by rainfall-dependent
    agriculture due to erratic rainfall, resulting in food insecurity (Duguma and
    Duguma, 2022; Mengistu et al., 2022). Steeper gradient, high relief ratio, and
    ruggedness index, which indicated higher erosion potential (Das, 2021). As a result,
    identifying groundwater potentiality regions is required for selection of productive
    wells, and long-term groundwater management. The application of GeoDetector-based
    CNN models is the innovation point in this study, and filling the research gap
    is the target of this research with significant major influencing factors. For
    example, recharge has been ignored in many research tasks (Pradhan et al., 2021;
    Bai et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). However, few studies have begun with recharge
    (Niway et al., 2022; Gautam et al., 2023) and transmissivity (Dimple et al., 2023;
    Gautam et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023) as major influencing factors for groundwater
    potential prediction. As a result, groundwater recharge and transmissivity have
    been identified as major influencing factors in the Gunabay watershed for mapping
    groundwater potentiality zones. Furthermore, in the previous work, the interaction
    of groundwater potential influencing factors have given little attention. Therefore,
    this study will initiate to improve groundwater potentiality evaluation performance
    by integrating GeoDetector and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The more accurate
    mapping supports deciding the exact location of productive wells for intensive
    uses. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to make more accurate groundwater
    potential map using innovative GeoDetector-based CNN models approach with an effective
    validation for Gunabay watershed, in the data scarce area of upper Blue Nile Basin,
    Ethiopia. Furthermore, this research will serve as important reference line evidence
    to improve groundwater management, and some engineering decisions. It is indispensable
    for local governments, policymakers, decision-makers, human health protection
    agency (i.e., trachoma disease due to lack of water hygiene), and farmers to possibilities
    of groundwater development in the area. 2. Materials and methods In the present
    study, concise procedures and innovative methods have been conducted successfully.
    Fourteen (14) groundwater influencing factors were selected for spatial delineation
    and framed in to six steps (Fig. 3): (i) preparation of groundwater recharge influencing
    factor datasets in the study area, (ii) development of a recharge potential map,
    (iii) preparation of groundwater influencing factor datasets, (v) development
    of a deep learning model, and (vi) mapping groundwater potential. The GIS created
    the factors database. MATLAB programming was used to implement model training
    and validation. Geodetector software was used to quantifying groundwater driving
    forces (i.e., detector of factor and interaction). 2.1. Description of the study
    area The research was carried out in Gunabay watershed of upper part of Blue Nile
    Basin, located in the northwest of Ethiopia. It is located between the latitudes
    of 11°00′20″ N and 11°45′46″ N, and longitudes of 37°23′06″ E and 38°28′24″ E,
    with a total area of 3920.25 km2 (Fig. 1a–c) bounded by Guna Mountain in the north,
    northwest by Tana sub-basin, northeast by the Bashilo watershed, and to the south
    by the Blue Nile gorges. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    watershed. 2.2. Development of datasets for groundwater inventory map The potential
    groundwater inventory map was generated from existing productive wells, and spring
    datasets in this study. Springs are parts of groundwater that emerge from underground
    due to faults (unconfined aquifers) breaking through streams (Manga, 2001; Moughani
    et al., 2023). They are continuous source of flowing water discharged from subsurface
    zone emitting to ground surface in the form of current (Hu et al., 2007) and strong
    sources of groundwater potential (GWP). As a result, a spring inventory and high
    productive wells (>5Lit/s) was created using historical data archived by Anbesame
    water supply district offices, and some of the locations were cross-checked using
    GPS during the field visits. Non groundwater points were extracted and split into
    training and validation datasets using ArcGIS (v10.8) for modeling GWP. 7:3 In
    spatial groundwater prediction, datasets for training and testing are commonly
    used (Wang et al., 2022). 128 wells and springs were identified and classified
    into two types; 70% (90) were chosen at random for model training, while 30% (38)
    were chosen at random for validation (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image

    2.3. Groundwater influencing factor dataset preparations Identifying the most
    important factors is essential for improving model accuracy in mapping groundwater
    potential (Bai et al., 2022). Based on literature review, dataset availability
    and the model criteria, the following fourteen major influencing factors have
    been identified and applied in this study, land cover, temperature, wind speed,
    soil, elevation, slope, evapotranspiration (PET), groundwater depth, rainfall,
    groundwater recharge, lithology, transmissivity, drainage density, lineament density,
    and geomorphology. However, the first nine factors (land cover, temperature, wind
    speed, soil, elevation, slope, evapotranspiration (PET), groundwater depth, rainfall)
    have been used as input datasets to mapping the spatial prediction of groundwater
    recharge zones. Then, six comprehensive groundwater influencing factors (lithology,
    transmissivity, drainage density, lineament density, groundwater recharge, and
    geomorphology) have been prepared depend upon, the literatures review, watershed
    characteristics, and datasets availability. Six methodological steps/procedures
    have been carried out in Fig. 3 to meet the research objectives. Download : Download
    high-res image (896KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Methodological
    framework. 2.3.1. Lithology Lithology has the potential influences directly on
    permeability and porosity of aquifer rocks (groundwater reservoir); thus, the
    condition and origin of groundwater occurrence, and it requires a carefully investigation
    (Doke et al., 2021). The geological survey map of Ethiopia with a scale of 1:500,000
    provided the lithology of the Gunabay. Groundwater conduits supported by faults
    and joints serve as the recharge aquifers. The area dominated by sedimentary rocks
    is a better source of groundwater occurrence due to their high porosity and high
    permeability characteristics in comparison to metamorphic and igneous rocks (Moughani
    et al., 2023) (Fig. 4). Three major geological rocks are presented in the study
    area such as; Qb (quaternary basalts), Qv (quaternary volcanic), and TV (tertiary
    volcanic). This district contains eight different lithological units: Plateau
    basalts, Quaternary volcanics, Ashange, Aiba, Alajie, Guna trachyte, Tuff, and
    Trachyte plug. Download : Download high-res image (662KB) Download : Download

    TV6 (Tuff), TV7 (Guna trachyte), and TV8 (Trachyte plug). 2.3.2. Lineament density
    Lineament is the curvilinear or linear geological features and it can be identified
    on satellite image (Das et al., 2018). Groundwater movement and occurrence through
    joints and fractures is controlled by lineament density, because rock fractures
    and joints have a greater capacity to hold water resulting to higher potentiality
    of groundwater due to higher lineament density (Ajay Kumar et al., 2020). Therefore,
    the lineament has a potential to facilitate the rate of infiltration into the
    groundwater reservoir which plays a great role in the storage of groundwater (Uc
    Castillo et al., 2022). Among extraction approaches, manual extraction is more
    common rather than automatic extraction of lineament using software to trace only
    geological features when the objective is limited (Das et al., 2018) (Fig. 5 and
    Eq. (1)). In this study, manual extraction lineament was applied carefully. (1)
    where, Li = total length of lineaments (km), LD = lineament density (km/km2),
    A = unit area (km2) (Eq. (1)). Lineament density of the area has been prepared
    from Landsat (Band-5) dataset using Arc GIS tool. Download : Download high-res

    the Gunabay watershed. 2.3.3. Transmissivity It is essential for the water transmission
    property of the groundwater reservoir zone. A higher transmissivity value implies
    high potentiality zones in the given watershed (Opara et al., 2021; Dimple et
    al., 2023). Therefore, mapping transmissivity is one of the critical input parameters
    for overlaying groundwater zones. Transmissivity datasets from Anbesame water
    supply district, Amhara Water Well Drilling Enterprise and Ethiopian geological
    survey map were collected for data processing. A standard kriging approach was
    used to create a map. Higher numeral value indicates a greater occurrence of groundwater
    in the Gunabay watershed''s western portion, while lower potentiality is expected
    in the Southeast and Northeast (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image (578KB)

    2.3.4. Drainage density The drainage density defined as the ratio of total length
    by area (the total length of streams/rivers in a basin divided by the drainage
    basin''s total area (km/km2) is proportional to soil permeability (low drainage
    density leads to high infiltration) (Eq. (2)). Rivers are the main essential sources
    of recharge (Trabelsi et al., 2023). The distance from the rivers affects groundwater
    table and the higher water table near the rivers rather than the areas located
    far (Doke et al., 2021). High runoff and low infiltration are caused by high drainage
    density resulting to low groundwater availability (Pinto et al., 2017; Das and
    Pardeshi, 2018; Ajay Kumar et al., 2020; Das, 2021). It is one of the most important
    parameters in determining potentiality of groundwater zones (Fig. 7). The drainage
    density map was prepared using GIS environment and reclassified accordingly. (2)
    where, Di is the total length of the stream (km), and A is the watershed unit
    area (km2). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Drainage density in the Gunabay watershed. 2.3.5. Geomorphological
    units Geomorphology is one the most important parameters for evaluating the spatial
    potential of groundwater districts (Doke et al., 2021). They are topographical
    features of the earth''s surface that regulate groundwater flow. The major geomorphological
    landforms are plains, platforms, hills, and mountains (Weiming et al., 2011).
    Through recharge systems, flat regions and valleys can provide a better groundwater
    potential (Ajay Kumar et al., 2020; Berhanu and Hatiye, 2020). Therefore, geomorphological
    units generated from DEM datasets using the SAGA GIS tool have been used to prepare
    the map (Fig. 8). The study area contains ten geomorphological units (streams,

    watershed. 2.3.6. Groundwater recharge Groundwater recharge is the primary source
    of groundwater that increases the groundwater storage in the groundwater reservoir
    (Dadgar et al., 2020). Furthermore, it is a completely necessary water component
    of the hydrological cycle (Yeh et al., 2009). It was recently estimated using
    WetSpass-M effectively in the data scarcity area (Nannawo et al., 2021; Gelebo
    et al., 2022; Tegegne et al., 2023b) of Ethiopia. Groundwater recharge was evaluated
    in this study using the WetSpass-M model with the following nine major influencing
    factors as model inputs such as; elevation, land cover (crops (57.04%), shrub
    land (36.16%), settlement (4.73%), mixed forests (1.65%), open water (0.39%),
    grassland (0.02%), bare land (0.01%)), groundwater depth, rainfall, evapotranspiration
    (PET), slope, temperature, wind speed, and soil (Tegegne et al., 2023b) and their
    influences have been presented in Table 1. Table 1. Summery of groundwater recharge
    influencing factors. Recharge factors The potential importance of groundwater
    recharge influencing factors Rainfall It has a potential to controls the infiltration
    and percolation of surface water directly to enhancing groundwater recharge (Doke
    et al., 2021). Soil It has a potential influence to determine the capacity of
    water holding through infiltration process (Mehra et al., 2016; Doke et al., 2021).
    Land cover Directly controls the permeability and infiltration process (Doke et
    al., 2021). Elevation It is indicating the terrain ruggedness, and the lower the
    elevation implies the higher the infiltration rate, less runoff generation and
    more rechargeable (Chen et al., 2022). Slope It has a potential directly influences
    on percolation rate, soil infiltration rate, and rainfall runoff (Das, 2021).
    Evapotranspiration It is one of the most important parameters for recharge estimation
    in the water balance components (Kisiki et al., 2023). Groundwater depth It indicates
    the presence of higher groundwater recharge (nearest to the ground surface) (Tegegne
    et al., 2023b). Temperature It has influence on the variability of groundwater
    recharge potential (Hakim et al., 2022; Tegegne et al., 2023b). Wind speed It
    is one of the most important parameters for recharge estimation in the water balance
    components (Kisiki et al., 2023). 2.4. Methodology 2.4.1. GeoDetector model Wang
    et al. (2010) proposed a newly GeoDetector model, which is widely used in many
    fields to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of variables. It comprises four specialized
    detectors: ecological detector, interaction detector, factor detector, and risk
    detector. The general framework of geographical detectors can be proposed to answers
    four specifics research questions (Fig. 10). However, in this study, factor and
    interaction detectors were applied to determine the significance of major groundwater
    potential influencing factors and the interaction between each parameter. Because,
    the majority of groundwater potential studies ignore the examination of predicted
    maps and can be estimated using Eq. (3) (Wang et al., 2022). (3) Where, 2 = the
    target variable''s variance used to measure its dispersion; N = the total number
    of samples and n = the types for the relevant variables. q = the rate of the influencing
    factors, and subscript h = the hth zone (Shrestha and Luo, 2017). 2.4.2. Convolutional
    neural networks (CNN) CNN is one of the well-known deep learning, which was introduced
    by (LeCun et al., 1998). It is specialized in image recognition, efforts as human
    brain patterns (Panahi et al., 2020). There are many deep learning algorithms
    available but CNN is one of the most important deep learning algorithms to estimate
    the regression, prediction, and classification of complex tasks (Nikoobakht et
    al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023; Moughani et al., 2023). Due to its better performance
    abilities, CNN is used for a variety of tasks (Youssef et al., 2022). It is composed
    of five imperative layers; input layers (contain input variables), convolutional
    layers (contain a filter to extract features from input variables), pooling layers
    (reduce the size of feature output from convolutional variables to avoid overfitting
    problem), fully connected layers (which help to integrate the datasets and produces
    the final output in the neural network) (Hakim et al., 2022), and output layers
    (Baghdadi et al., 2022; Zhao and Chen, 2023). Batch normalization layer is essential
    layer, which helps to normalize in to the mean activation values of 0 and 1 (Tegegne,
    2022). A model activated by ReLU has better stability during dataset training
    and testing (Li et al., 2021b). The two-dimensional convolutional neural network
    was developed based on the data features and related literature (Khosravi et al.,
    2018; Panahi et al., 2020; Youssef et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023) (Fig. 11 and
    Table 2). In the process of CNN, the input (primary) datasets must be converted
    into images (Khosravi et al., 2018). The point datasets (128) were extracted from
    the factors and converted into image datasets for CNN process. Table 2. Optimal
    values of convolutional neural network during training process. Hyperparameters

    is 86.84% Initial learning rate 0.001 2.4.3. Evaluation of accuracy Selection
    of input variables (influencing factors) and dataset quality may affect the models
    output significantly (Chen et al., 2019; Ngo et al., 2021). Every modeling approach,
    including optimal models, requires precision evaluation. Generally, ROC (receiver
    operating characteristic) curve, AUC (under area curve) is widely utilized to
    predict model accuracy. The higher value indicates better prediction model accuracy.
    It was constructed by plotting on the X axis the values of specificity and Y axis
    is the values of sensitivity, using the following equations (Arabameri et al.,
    2019b; Chen et al., 2019) (Eqs. (4), (5))). (4) (5) (6) where TP (true positive),
    TN (true negative), FP (false positive), FN (false negative). TP and TN refer
    to the proportion of positive and negative pixels correctly classified into the
    positive and negative classification, while FP and FN are pixels that were incorrectly
    classified in to the negative and positive classification. The accuracy of most
    deep and machine learning algorithms has ranged from excellent (0.9–1.0) to very
    high (0.8–0.9), high (0.7–0.8), moderate (0.6–0.7), and low (0.5–0.6) (Arabameri
    et al., 2019b; Miraki et al., 2019; Khosravi et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2022).
    Therefore, the novel CNN approach has been conducted and has been validated with
    30% of the datasets (which had not been used for training) in this study. The
    validation of CNN was constructed by plotting on the X axis the values of accuracy
    (%) and Y axis is the values of number of iterations (Eq. (6)). 3. Results and
    discussions 3.1. Major influencing factors The prediction of the spatial potentiality
    of groundwater can be improved utilizing the novel approaches and selection of
    their potential influencing factors. Therefore, this study has been performed
    with GeoDetector based convolutional neural network (CNN). The major groundwater
    potential influencing factors (lithology, lineament density, transmissivity, drainage
    density, geomorphology, and groundwater recharge) were selected to identify and
    mapping the spatial groundwater potential zones in the upper part of Blue Nile
    Basin, Ethiopia. Geology (lithology) is the most significant element for groundwater
    potential due to the infiltration through permeability of rock (Aggarwal et al.,
    2019). In this study, the detailed geological lithology can be mentioned as; Plateau
    basalts (1.37%), Quaternary volcanics (5.64%), Ashange (32.06%), Aiba (29.09%),
    Alajie (29.19%), Guna trachyte (1.68%), Tuff (0.84%), and Trachyte plug (0.13%).
    Ashange, Alajie, and Aiba are the major dominant rocks in the Gunabay watershed
    (Fig. 4). Lineament density is one of the most important factors, which helps
    to control the occurrence and movement of groundwater through infiltration. The
    study area of lineament density (in km/km2) is ranges from 0 to 1.36. The lineament
    density of Gunabay watershed was classified into five groups such as; very high
    (0.79–1.36), high (0.53–0.79), moderate (0.32–0.53), low (0.14–0.32), and very
    low (0.-0.14). In this study area, the west and western south parts are dominated
    by moderate to very high lineament density (0.32–1.36 km/km2) (Fig. 5). Due to
    moderate to very high groundwater potentiality, these areas are not suggested
    for construction of engineering structures (i.e., dam construction) (Das et al.,
    2018). Transmissivity is one of the most significant to identify groundwater potential
    zones (Dimple et al., 2023). In the present study area, the transmissivity (m2/day)
    ranges from 0.01 to 1.49 and classified into five classes based on these numerical
    values, namely very high (132.11–175.59), high (101.34–132.11), moderate (75.24–101.34),
    low (53.84–75.24), and very low (5–53.84) (Fig. 6). The west part of the study
    area is presented by moderate to very high transmissivity zones. Drainage density
    is infiltration is inversely proportion, while directly proportion with runoff
    (Ahmad et al., 2023). Generally, due to a higher probability of groundwater recharge,
    the watershed areas with lower drainage density have higher groundwater potential
    (Doke et al., 2021). Therefore, in this study area, the drainage density (km/km2)
    ranges from 5.0 to 175.59 and classified into five classes based on these numerical
    values, namely very low (0.96–1.49), low (0.78–0.96), moderate (0.64–0.78), high
    (0.48–0.64), and very high (0.01–0.48) (Fig. 7). The west part of the study area
    is presented by very high transmissivity zones. Geomorphological units (Fig. 8)
    have impacted on water percolation and groundwater recharge into groundwater reservoirs
    (Abijith et al., 2020). In this study, streams, valley, and plains units have
    higher significant impact on the potential influence of groundwater. Groundwater
    recharge potential vary significantly spatially ana temporarily due to the variability
    of hydrogeology variables, topographic factors, and climate conditions (Jaafarzadeh
    et al., 2021; Dimple et al., 2023). It is one of the most important factors of
    groundwater potential. In this study the major groundwater influencing factors
    (land cover, temperature, wind speed, soil, elevation, slope, evapotranspiration
    (PET), groundwater depth, rainfall) were considered to quantify and mapping of
    groundwater recharge potentiality zones (Tegegne et al., 2023b). As shown in Fig.
    9, based on quantile classification, five classes (very high (83–508 mm/year),
    high (51–83 mm/year), moderate (30–51 mm/year), low (6–30 mm/year), and very low
    (0–6 mm/year)) of recharge potential zones have been presented represented. North
    western and west parts of the study area have receiving higher potential of groundwater
    recharge, while north eastern part receiving lower groundwater recharge potential

    3.2. Variable importance analysis using factor detector During the research, groundwater
    recharge, lithology, lineament density, transmissivity, drainage density, and
    geomorphology were considered as comprehensive groundwater conditioning factors
    to generate the final products of groundwater potentiality (GPM). Groundwater
    recharge is also estimated from elevation, slope, land cover, groundwater depth,
    PET, rainfall, temperature, soil, and wind speed datasets (Tegegne et al., 2023b).
    The factor detector results revealed that all of the input variables considered
    had remarkable sway on groundwater occurrence in the watershed (Fig. 12). Transmissivity
    (0.48) had the greatest influence on groundwater occurrence, followed by recharge
    (0.26), lineament density (0.26), lithology (0.13), drainage density (0.12), and
    geomorphology (0.06). The overall, potentiality of groundwater was strongly related
    to transmissivity, recharge, and lineament density. However, lithology, drainage
    density, and geomorphology have little influence on the occurrence of groundwater.
    Occurrence of groundwater is predominantly available in valley and plain areas

    of influencing factors for groundwater potential. 3.3. Two-fold interaction of
    factors using interaction detector analysis The interaction between transmissivity
    and recharge is greater than the individual influences (Table 3). This conclusion
    may be attributed to that the internal storage of downstream groundwater reservoirs
    gains water through recharged aquifer zones in the area. Table 3. Interaction

    The potential of groundwater was identified and mapped in the data scarce area
    of upper Blue Nile Basin (i.e., Gunabay watershed), Ethiopia. The delineated map
    was classified into five potential zones based on natural breaks (Jenks): very
    high-value ranges (0.66–1.00), high (0.53–0.66), moderate (0.41–0.53), low (0.27–0.41),
    and very low (0.00–0.27). The western part of the area is expected to have very
    high groundwater potential, while the upper (northern) part of Guna Mountain is
    nearly free from any groundwater occurrence (Fig. 13). However, Mountainous areas
    are the source of spring waters. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    Zones belonging to very high and high spatial groundwater potentiality correspond
    to transmissivity and, to a lesser extent, recharge and lineament density (Fig.
    5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Generally, the spatial distribution of groundwater availability
    is classified and ranked as moderate (31.62%), low (25.68%), high (19.93%), very
    high (12.05%), and very low (10.72%) (Table 4). Table 4. Summery of land characteristics
    and its groundwater potential. Characteristics of the land in the study area Potentiality
    of groundwater Remarks Water bodies, forest, sandy, sandy loam soils, flat, areas
    having high rainfall, high recharge, lower runoff, ridge/hills and rocky benches,
    very low drainage density, very high lineament density, and very high transmissivity
    Very high This land zone has high groundwater potential. This area is required
    an intensive water resources management to keep safe from constructing of engineering
    structures, landfill and industrial linkages. Agricultural lands, gentle, loam,
    mixed forests, low drainage density, high lineament density, and high transmissivity
    High This watershed is highly potential zone for groundwater. It requires intensive
    water resource management to keep safe from landfill and industrial linkages.
    Mild, crop lands, grassland, silty loam, sandy clay loam, moderate drainage density,
    moderate lineament density, and moderate transmissivity Moderate This land has
    moderate groundwater potential but there is need to afforestation and some proper
    water control activities. Shrub land, silty clay loam, steep, high drainage density,
    low lineament density, and low transmissivity Low This land has slight groundwater
    potential zone. It requires soil and water conservation practices. Settlement
    (towns, cities, paved roads, asphalt …), clay loam, steep to extra steep slopes,
    barren land, very high drainage density, very low lineament density, and very
    low transmissivity Very low This land has not groundwater potential zone. It is
    not considered for groundwater. It requires soil and water conservation practices.
    3.5. Discussion Groundwater resource is overexploiting due to low recharge potentiality
    in climate changing environment and anthropogenic activities (Masroor et al.,
    2023). Therefore, the knowledge of mapping of spatial groundwater recharge zones
    should be given priority to addressing sustainability through better management
    of water resources (Jaafarzadeh et al., 2021). Hereafter delineation of groundwater
    potential is extremely important in data scare area of upper Blue Nile Basin (i.e.,
    Gunabay watershed). Identification and mapping of groundwater potentiality zones
    is precondition for planning and sustainable water resource development. Based
    on natural break the spatial potential of the area has been classified in to five
    major groups such as very low, low, moderate, high and very high zones (Fig. 13).
    The results of environmental influencing factors revealed the areas having that
    flat pain, valley topography, lower slope, forestry, water bodies, higher capacity
    of permeability and porosity (sandy soil) zones have high to very high groundwater
    distribution (Dar et al., 2021). Very high groundwater potentiality zone is located
    in western part of the study area. Hence nearby Bahir Dar city, this area should
    be protected from linkage of landfill sites and any wastage of factories. On the
    other hand, very poor to moderate zones of groundwater potential are found in
    the mountainous areas, hills with steeper slopes, ridges, presence of silty soil,
    less water infiltration and low storage due to high runoff potential is majorly
    dominated in this study area. Combined approach of GeoDetector (GD) and convolutional
    neural network (CNN) was showed best performance with in a complex flow process.
    Convolutional layer has many filters that perform convolution operation to extracts
    feature maps from images. Every image is considered as a matrix of pixel values.
    Therefore, the hidden layer compromises convolution and pooling operations (Zhao
    et al., 2018). The pooling layer is a down-sampling (subsampling) operation that
    selects the most significant features and reduces the dimensionality of feature
    image maps from the convolution layer. In the pooling operations, maximum is the
    most popular rather than minimum and average (Fig. 11). Flattening is the process
    of converting all the resultant two dimensional arrays from pooled feature maps
    into a single long continuous linear vector (Zhao et al., 2018; Panahi et al.,
    2020). Interaction and factor detectors were very important for identification
    of groundwater potential. The validation process also more acceptable results
    (Fig. 14, Fig. 15). Download : Download high-res image (592KB) Download : Download

    Testing (validation) dataset accuracy processing results. 3.6. Groundwater potentiality
    validation The scientific significance of spatial model is evaluated by validation
    system (Dimple et al., 2023). With the help of test datasets, the spatial prediction
    of the groundwater potentiality map was evaluated. The result showed an accuracy
    of 86.84%, which was more reliable and acceptable (Fig. 14, Fig. 15). Therefore,
    the performance of the model was very high and in the range of 80% and 90% (Arabameri
    et al., 2019b; Miraki et al., 2019; Khosravi et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2022).
    Generally, convolutional neural network with Adam optimizer has an advantage of
    automatically decay the learning rate, and their convergency rate is faster on
    datasets with sparse features, but inferior generation and likely to converge
    to sharp minimum (Liu et al., 2021b). Therefore, CNN-based spatial model is providing
    the highest precision results (Ngo et al., 2021) and it gives a better fitness
    for image processing of classification, regression and prediction (Tegegne, 2022).
    3.7. Limitations All environmental factors have been considered with scientific
    standards carefully. However, major limitations cannot be ignored (Doke et al.,
    2021). Therefore, lack of informative existing water borehole dataset (specific
    yields, vertical lithology layers, and well recovering time) is one of the limitations.
    Random generating of non-groundwater training and testing datasets may often lead
    to having models with less generalization capacity. Groundwater well discharge
    and borehole history may add more informative output. Lack of sufficient previous
    works in the study area that may not be enough for discussion and comparison.
    Furthermore, to provide better spatial information in the study area, it requires
    higher spatial resolution of groundwater influencing factors (<30 m resolution).
    4. Conclusions Groundwater potential assessment approaches have progressed significantly
    in recent days; however, the groundwater recharge effect is not well-investigated
    as the main influencing factor. Therefore, based on WetSpass-M modeling criteria,
    nine major groundwater recharge influencing factors (land cover, temperature,
    wind speed, soil, elevation, slope, evapotranspiration (PET), groundwater depth,
    rainfall) were utilized in the first stage. Hence, the study contributes to fil
    the gaps which enhancing the accuracy of groundwater availability prediction by
    investigating the groundwater recharge. Then, based on literature review and dataset
    availability, groundwater recharge, lithology, transmissivity, drainage density,
    lineament density, and geomorphology were considered for spatial modeling of groundwater
    potential. Groundwater recharge is the second major influencing factor followed
    by transmissivity and equivalently with lineament density. The contribution of
    geomorphology was low on the groundwater occurrence next to lithology and drainage
    density. The result revealed that the spatial and temporally distribution of groundwater
    is low due to the prevalence of rainfall runoff in the study area. With this connection,
    very low to moderate groundwater potentiality zones are more dominant in the area
    rather than zones of high to very high. Therefore, the spatial distribution of
    groundwater potential is presented as very low (420.27 km2), low (1006.58 km2),
    moderate (1239.74 km2), high (781.44 km2), and very high (472.22 km2). Thus, constructing
    artificial recharge, afforestation, soil and water conservation may recommended
    in the area. The performance of the newly innovated detector-based CNN model under
    the training and validation dataset scenarios for GWPM was high. The overall result
    showed that the accuracy level accrued from GD-CNN model can be accepted. The
    main challenges in GWPM are having limited recorded well yields to generate accurate
    groundwater inventory data. Because of the limited number of groundwater wells
    (springs) locations, deep learning models can be affected. However, the geographical
    detector has been evaluated as a better quantifier of the groundwater index and
    it has an advantage in the dataset dependence without further personal judgment.
    Finally, the delineated map of groundwater potential will provide multiple usages
    as the baseline for water sectors, and researchers, policy makers, environment
    protection agency, for better and sustainable water resources management. Groundwater
    potential delineation is also important for water hygiene activities to protect
    trachoma disease. Credit author statement Asnakew Mulualem Tegegne: Conceptualization,

    Chapter © 2020 1 Introduction Due to the water scarcity that many countries around
    the world are currently facing as a result of climate change, it was necessary
    to reduce water consumption, especially in agriculture. One of the best solutions
    for reducing water losses in agricultural irrigation is to determine the crop
    water requirements accurately. Evapotranspiration (ET) is considered as the main
    ingredient in crop water demand calculations.ET is the process of mislaying water
    from both the soil surface and the plant.in reality, the ET value for a specific
    crop can be estimated by using the corresponding crop coefficient (KC) with ET0
    which can be estimated using different climate data under conventional underlying
    surface conditions (Wu et al. 2021a, b, c). ET0 is the fundamental component of
    water resource management for increasing water productivity (Hu et al. 2022).
    The availability of a precise instrument for calculating ET0 is essential for
    irrigation managers and water researchers (Tikhamarine et al. 2020). The Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been suggested that the FAO Penman–Monteith
    (PM) model is the most widely used method for estimating ET0 (Nema et al. 2017;
    Wu et al. 2021a, b, c). The PM model is applied to different climates and environments
    without any adjustments being made, and the resulting estimates are reliable.
    That''s why it''s regarded as a standard for checking other models against (Wu
    et al. 2021a, b, c). However, there are significant drawbacks for using the PM
    method because it needs access to a variety of meteorological data, such as air
    temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed as shown in Fig.
    1 as model inputs (Chen et al. 2020; Yamaç 2021). Fig. 1 Meteorological factors,
    including sunshine duration, wind velocity, humidity, and air temperature, have
    an impact on evapotranspiration, which refers to both transpiration and evaporation.
    This process involves the loss of water from both the soil surface and plant Full
    size image Many studies have adopted a variety of empirical techniques to compute
    ET0 including temperature-based, radiation-based, humidity-based, water budget-based,
    mass transfer-based, and pan-based techniques when all meteorological parameters
    are not available (Chen et al. 2020; Yamaç 2021). However, because of complex
    and dynamic processes, it is challenging to estimate ET0 using empirical equations,
    and to do so, high-quality, site-appropriate meteorological data are required
    (Yamaç 2021).Therefore, a simplified model must be developed in order to estimate
    ET0 with high precision while using fewer meteorological data. Due to the above
    constraint, researchers developed modeling methodologies to estimate ET0 over
    the world when meteorological data is restricted or insufficient (Laaboudi and
    Slama 2020; Valipour et al. 2019). When it came to estimating ET0, machine learning
    took into consideration more than any other method. In order to model ET0, several
    researchers have switched from empirical modeling to black-box modeling utilizing
    machine learning tools where, the use of machine learning to estimate, predict,
    and forecast ET0 related indicators has been the subject of hundreds of research
    articles published in the past ten years (Chia et al. 2021). In the agricultural
    domain, big data analytic technologies such as generalized neuro-fuzzy models,
    artificial neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, multi-layer
    perceptron neural network (MLPNN), extreme learning machine, M5 tree model, least
    square-support vector regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines have
    been provided for ET0 estimation (Saggi and Jain 2019). Despite the fact that
    Big Data analysis plays an important role in data management in digital agriculture,
    most countries find it difficult to adopt digital agriculture due to a lack of
    essential technologies, such as effective mobile cellular infrastructure and facilities
    (Wanniarachchi and Sarukkalige 2022). Over the past twenty years, diverse artificial
    intelligence models have been utilized across multiple scientific and engineering
    domains to address a range of scientific challenges, including modeling, optimization,
    and prediction. This is due to the capacity of artificial intelligence to effectively
    address non-linear relationships between variables (Tikhamarine et al. 2020).
    In order to precisely estimate ET0 scientists have turned to artificial intelligence
    methods like neural networks and fuzzy logic because they can handle large amounts
    of data, performs calculations quickly and accurately, and delivers high accuracy.
    However, these techniques can have complex architectures and structures that make
    simulation challenging (Ehteram et al. 2019). Despite the increasing popularity
    of utilizing AI methods for estimating ET0, these techniques are often implemented
    without considering the fundamental physical processes that govern ET. This oversight
    may lead to imprecise outcomes. Moreover, based on current understanding, endeavors
    to estimate ET0 using AI models have revealed that optimal input combinations
    do not consistently remain the same, even when subjected to identical climatic
    conditions. This is attributed to the stochastic and indeterminate selection of
    meteorological parameters (Yu et al. 2020). Enhancing prediction accuracy and
    developing models that give more accurate results is one of the main problems
    of machine learning but, this can be done by giving the model more data to train
    on, introducing large architectures, and providing more computer resources (Ravindran
    et al. 2021). Researchers studying evapotranspiration have recently become interested
    in ensemble based approaches since these systems are typically more reliable,
    perform better, and require less computing power (Martín et al. 2021). For the
    purpose of forecasting ET0 in a variety of climate zones across the globe, it
    has been suggested that various machine-learning ensemble models be utilized (Salam
    and Islam 2020). The main goals of using ensembles are to decrease prediction
    variance, bias, and/or enhance performance where, the major advantages of it are
    that it can be carried out either through parallel or sequential approach, and
    it has historically shown a good behavior dealing with outliers and the negative
    impacts of imperfect data (Kar et al. 2021; Martín et al. 2021). Ensemble learning
    techniques are commonly categorized into three main types: bagging, boosting,
    and stacking/blending. The ensemble technique of bagging involves the process
    of sampling from the training data with replacement, also known as bootstrap,
    and subsequently performing averaging or voting over the class labels; Boosting
    produces ensemble by merging low-performing learners in order to have the possibility
    that later models would compensate for mistakes made by previous models; In stacking,
    one learning algorithm uses the results of the others to make predictions about
    the correct values in the test set. Every approach possesses its own set of advantages
    and disadvantages. Bagging is known to primarily reduce variance as opposed to
    bias. However, it may not be as effective when applied to relatively simplistic
    models. Boosting, on the other hand, aims to reduce both bias and variance by
    iteratively combining weak learners. It is important to note that boosting is
    sensitive to noisy data and outliers, and may result in over-fitting. Lastly,
    stacking is a technique that aims to reduce both variance and bias by addressing
    errors made by base learners. This is achieved by fitting one or more meta-models
    on the predictions made by the base learners (Shahhosseini et al. 2022). In the
    domain of ensemble learning, it is important to note that Bagging and Boosting
    are commonly recognized as homogeneous ensembles, while Stacking stands out as
    a heterogeneous ensemble. Homogeneous ensembles are characterized by the inclusion
    of models constructed using a singular machine learning algorithm. On the other
    hand, heterogeneous ensembles encompass models derived from a diverse range of
    algorithms. In the context of performance prediction, it has been observed that
    a heterogeneous ensemble holds a distinct advantage over a homogeneous combination
    (Li et al. 2021; Mienye and Sun 2022). Stacking technique shows the capability
    of combining the benefits of various fundamental models and has been demonstrated
    to be superior in the domains of intrusion detection, short-term electricity consumption
    prediction, and automatic cataract detection and grading. To date, there has been
    no additional progress in utilizing stacking and blending techniques to estimate
    daily ET0 in the context of ensemble models (Wu et al. 2021a, b, c). The stacking
    approach typically involves a set of base learners at (level 0), along with a
    Meta learner at (level 1). The base learners generate outputs that are then utilized
    as inputs for the Meta learner. The super learner methodology is an extension
    of the stacking technique, which generates an ensemble model through cross-validation.
    The super learner is constructed by combining a variety of potential learners,
    which have been created utilizing multiple algorithms, through a weighted combination
    (Lankford and Grimes 2021). This approach has been investigated by theoretical
    examination and has been recommended by scholarly research. The super learner
    has the potential to outperform the constituent algorithms that were employed
    in its construction by minimizing a cross-validation loss function (Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi
    et al. 2021). The utilization of the super learner offers numerous advantages
    due to its ability to provide flexibility in terms of the variety and quantity
    of predictive models employed for constructing the super learner. Additionally,
    it takes into consideration the variations in the predictive capabilities of each
    individual model. Furthermore, this article outlines a strategic methodology to
    effectively mitigate the risk of over-fitting during the training process. This
    is achieved by using cross-validation (Kabir and Ludwig 2019; Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi
    et al. 2021).In addition it is highly suitable for the field of parallel programming.
    The various candidate estimators can perform their respective tasks independently,
    and the utilization of these estimators on distinct training sets can also be
    isolated (Hastie et al. 2009). However, when dealing with large or streaming data,
    the current super learning approach is constrained by the computational cost of
    conducting cross-validated estimator selection from scratch for every incoming
    batch of data (Benkeser et al. 2018). From this viewpoint, this paper represents
    high performance ensemble learning method which has the ability to overcome the
    complexity of the PM model and the drawbacks of other ensemble learning methods
    where, limited meteorological data will be used as input for the proposed model.
    The objectives of this work clarify on the following points: Employing the super
    learner ensemble learning approach in conjunction with the cross validation theory
    employing 12 folds to estimate ET0. This will be carried out by utilizing various
    combinations of limited meteorological data as inputs, thereby addressing the
    limitation of the PM model which requires a diverse range of meteorological data
    that may not be readily available in different regions across the world. The PM
    model and four machine learning models were compared to the suggested model. Our
    framework''s output was compared to competitors to assess our model''s ability
    to estimate ET0 accurately with little meteorological data. 2 Related work Predicting
    ET0 accurately is important in many areas like irrigation planning and scheduling,
    plant water requirements, hydrology, water resource allocation and drainage planning
    (Chia et al. 2022). For the importance of this variable many researchers have
    made great time and effort to find solutions to overcome the obstacles that face
    the estimation of it, especially, in the case of insufficient meteorological data.
    Many papers have been published to find solutions for the difficulties facing
    the estimation of ET0. Seifi and Riahi (2020) have been used three hybrid models
    called least square support vector machine-gamma test (LSSVM-GT), artificial neural
    network-gamma test (ANN-GT) and Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system- gamma test
    (ANFIS-GT) which have been evaluated and compared with each other to estimate
    ET0 under arid conditions of Zahedan station, Iran where the results indicated
    the ability of the developed LSSVM-GT approach to predict ET0 accurately rather
    than other approaches and can be utilized to generate efficient irrigation strategies
    with the purpose of preserving available water sources. Zhu et al. (2020) employed
    the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to effectively ascertain the parameters
    of the extreme learning machine (ELM) model. Consequently, a pioneering hybrid
    PSO-ELM model was introduced to estimate the daily evapotranspiration. In comparison
    to equivalent empirical models using the same inputs, the results showed that
    machine learning models provided more accurate ET0 estimates. It was advised to
    use the PSO-ELM model, which outperformed other machine learning and empirical
    models, to predict daily ET0 in the dry Northwest China region with few inputs.
    Wu et al. introduced three hybrid models that combine the extreme learning machine
    model (ELM) with biological heuristic algorithms: the Particle Swarm Optimization
    algorithm (PSO), the Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
    For daily ET0 forecasting across China''s varying climate zones, the result showed
    the ability of PSO-ELM to estimate the ET0 with high precision using limited meteorological
    data. Wu et al. (2019) used a five-fold cross-validation approach to assess the
    performance of four bio-inspired algorithm optimized extreme learning machine
    ( ELM) models for predicting daily ET0 across China: ELM with genetic algorithm
    (ELM-GA), ELM with ant colony optimization (ELM-ACO), Elm with cuckoo search algorithm
    (CSA), and ELM with flower pollination algorithm (ELM-FPA). The findings supported
    the ability of bio-inspired optimization algorithms, particularly the FPA and
    CSA algorithms, to enhance the daily ET0 prediction accuracy of the traditional
    ELM model in China’s various climates. Mokari et al. (2022) compared four machine
    learning (ML) models, extreme learning machine (ELM), genetic programming (GP),
    random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR), for estimating daily
    ET0 with different limited climatic data as inputs in New Mexico using ten fold
    cross-validation method where, the results showed that SVR and ELM were the best
    ML models for all input scenarios in the analyzed climate zones, showing the best
    stability in testing. Mangalath Ravindran et al. (2022) proposed an innovative
    approach to estimating daily ET0 through the implementation of an Automated Machine
    Learning (Auto ML) solution. This is the first instance in which such a methodology
    has been applied to ET0 prediction in a scenario characterized by limited input
    parameters, representing a significant contribution to the field of ET0 estimation
    research. The study implemented two distinct Auto ML frameworks, namely Auto Gluon-Tabular
    (AGT) and H2O Auto ML, which are automated machine learning tools designed for
    tabular data. AGT is a novel open-source AutoML methodology developed by Amazon
    Web Service, while H2O AutoML is built on the scalable and open-source H2O ML
    platform. The study utilized daily meteorological data from a humid tropical climatic
    region in Kerala, India, and assessed the performance of these frameworks against
    radiation-based empirical methods and conventional ML methods. Where, the results
    showed the AGT’s superiority in ET0 prediction at all weather stations. Wu et
    al. (2021a, b, c) used the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, the differential
    evolution (DE) algorithm, and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm
    to calibrate the Hargreaves model, commonly referred to as HG, is widely acknowledged
    as the most efficient and uncomplicated method for estimating ET0 where, PSO-HG
    model was found to have the most accurate ET0 estimation on daily and monthly
    scales, and it can be recommended as the preferred model to predict ET0 in humid
    regions in southwest China. Mattar and Alazba (2019) involved the modeling of
    ET0 as a significant component of hydrological applications, utilizing diverse
    combinations of climatic variables through two distinct methodologies: gene expression
    programming (GEP) and multiple linear regression (MLR).The findings suggest that
    the GEP and MLR models have a more significant impact on the mean relative humidity
    and wind speed at a height of 2 m than other variables. Incorporating temperature
    data into models, solar radiation exhibits a marginal impact on enhancing the
    precision of ET0 estimation. Furthermore, the GEP models'' lower statistical error
    criteria values have substantiated their superior performance in comparison to
    MLR models and other empirical equations. Ehteram et al. (2019) developed a new
    approach for modeling monthly ET0 at Indian weather station by employing a modified
    support vector machine (SVM) based on the cuckoo algorithm (CA). The SVM-CA results
    were compared with those from empirical models, genetic programming (GP), a tree
    model (M5T), and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) where, a positive
    outcomes proved that the suggested SVM-CA model outperforms the GP, M5T, and ANFIS
    models in predicting ET0. This study (Feng and Tian 2021) aimed to explore the
    ability of the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN) as a data mining technique for
    estimating ET0 in a semi-arid region of China, despite the limited availability
    of climatic data. Furthermore, an ET0 forecast model based on the KNN algorithm
    was evaluated in comparison to the PM-56 equation. Where, the results indicated
    that KNN model was shown to have the highest accuracy in case of using max, min
    temperature and relative humidity as inputs. Zhang et al. (2022) proposed six
    machine learning algorithms for the estimation of daily ET0. Data pertaining to
    meteorological conditions, encompassing the uppermost and lowermost temperatures,
    radiation levels, relative humidity, and wind velocity, spanning the temporal
    range from 1960 to 2019, were procured from a total of eighteen monitoring stations
    situated in the northeastern region of Inner Mongolia, China. Three different
    combinations of inputs were used to train and test the proposed models. These
    combinations were compared with corresponding empirical equations, which included
    two equations based on temperature, three equations based on radiation, and two
    equations based on humidity. The results indicated that when the characteristics
    of radiation or humidity were added to the given temperature characteristics,
    all of the proposed machine learning models were able to estimate ET0. Furthermore,
    the accuracy of these models was higher than that of the calibrated empirical
    equations that were external to the training study area. This suggests that it
    would be feasible to construct an ET0 prediction algorithm for cross-station information
    with similar meteorological characteristics, in order to achieve an acceptable
    ET0 estimation for a specific station. This study (Dong et al. 2022) examined
    the spatiotemporal fluctuations in ET0 (evapotranspiration) in China and enhance
    the precision of ET0 estimations across several spatiotemporal dimensions. In
    this study, three machine learning models, namely convolutional neural nets (CNN),
    extreme learning machines (ELM), and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS),
    were evaluated alongside seven empirical models calibrated using the mind evolutionary
    algorithm (MEA). The objective was to determine the most appropriate models for
    estimating ET0 across various spatiotemporal scales in China. The findings indicate
    that machine learning models had superior performance compared to empirical models
    across various spatiotemporal scales. CNN demonstrated superior performance in
    terms of both model correctness and stability when calculating ET0. The objective
    of this study (Abdallah et al. 2022a) was to assess the efficacy of a D-vine Copula-based
    quantile regression (DVQR) algorithm for estimating daily evapotranspiration (ET0)
    in two hyper-arid locations, specifically the Atbara and Kassala stations, located
    in Sudan. The study focused on the period from 2000 to 2015 and examined the performance
    of the DVQR model using different input structures. Additionally, the DVQR model
    was compared to other statistical models including Multivariate Linear Quantile
    Regression (MLQR), Experimental Models (EMMs), Bayesian Model Averaging Quantile
    Regression (BMAQR), and Classical Machine Learning (CML). In addition, many computational
    intelligence models were utilized in this study, namely random forests (RF), support
    vector machines (SVM), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), extreme gradient booster
    (XGBoost), and M5 Models Tree (M5Tree). The findings indicate that the first EMMs
    exhibited subpar performance, but demonstrated improvement following the implementation
    of calibrating methodologies. The DVQR, MLQR, & BMAQR models exhibited superior
    performance in comparison to the calibrated EMMs. In comparison to the MLQR &
    BMAQR models, the DVQR model demonstrated superior accuracy across both study
    sites. The M5Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting
    (XGBoost) models exhibited superior performance compared to the Extreme Learning
    Machine (ELM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms at both testing sites. The objective
    of this study (Elbeltagi et al. 2023) was to develop a model for estimating evapotranspiration
    (ETo) in Egypt''s key agricultural governorates, namely Al Buhayrah, Alexandria,
    Ismailiyah, and Minufiyah. This was achieved through the utilization of four machine
    learning (ML) algorithms, namely a linear regression approach (LR), random subspace
    (RSS), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree),and additive regression (AR). The
    study identified maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), and solar
    radiation (SR) as the three input variables that exerted the most significant
    influence on the results of subset regression and sensitivity analysis. The outcome
    achieved through the process of performing an action or task. The results of a
    comparison investigation of machine learning models demonstrated that REPTree
    exhibited superior performance compared to its competitors, as evidenced by reaching
    the highest values across multiple performance metrics in both the training and
    evaluation stages. The integration of the forecasting models of the top estimation
    techniques is one of the most efficient methods to provide accurate predictions;
    this is called ensemble learning approach (Roy et al. 2020). Ensemble learning
    combines weak learners to develop a new strong model to decrease deviation, lowering
    variance, or enhance predictive accuracy where, bagging, boosting, and stacking
    are popular ensemble learning approaches (Wu et al. 2021a, b, c). Ponraj and Vigneswaran
    (2020) used employed various machine learning algorithms (i.e. multiple linear
    regression, random forest, and gradient boost regression) to estimate ET0 with
    and without preprocessing approaches, and the findings show that the preprocessed
    gradient boost model outperformed the other two models. Wu et al. (2020a, b) assessed
    the potential usability of the random forest (RF) prediction model, which is used
    to replicate daily ET0 where, the results demonstrate that the RF model is a superior
    way to predict ET0 for the dry oasis area with fewer data. Huang et al. (2019)
    investigated the capability of CatBoost algorithm for effectively forecasting
    daily ET0 with minimal meteorological data in humid parts of China, where, CatBoost
    performances were compared with random forest (RF) and support vector machine
    (SVM) performances. The results indicated that CatBoost data processing took less
    time and memory than RF and SVM also; it improved accuracy, stability, and computational
    cost over RF but, SVM produced the best prediction accuracy and stability with
    partial meteorological parameter combinations, whereas CatBoost performed best
    with complete combinations. Wu et al. (2020a, b) evaluated and compared the efficiency
    of five Boosting-based models, namely Adaptive Boosting (ADA), Gradient Boosting
    Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting
    Decision Machine (LGB), and Gradient boosting with categorical features support
    (CAT), in the estimation of daily ET0 across ten stations situated in the eastern
    monsoon zone of China. Where, the result showed the utilization of CAT models
    is highly advisable for the estimation of ET0 and can be advocated to enhance
    the efficiency of the model with restricted meteorological parameters in the eastern
    monsoon region of China. In this research (Başakın et al. 2023) the authors employed
    stochastic gradient boost (SGB), a widely utilized soft computing technique, for
    estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0) in the Adiyaman region of southeastern
    Turkey. The ET0 (reference evapotranspiration) was calculated using the FAO-56-Penman–Monteith
    technique. Subsequently, we approximated the ET0 using the SGB (Simplified Surface
    Energy Balance) approach, incorporating maximum and minimal temperature, wind
    speed, solar radiation, and relative humidity data received from a meteorological
    station. The findings indicate that the hybrid SSA-SGB method produced more precise
    results in comparison to the predictions made using the stand-alone SGB method.
    This work (Heramb et al. 2023) aimed to optimize various machine learning techniques,
    including random forest model (RF), intense gradient boosting (XGB), & light gradient
    boost (LGB), using the grey wolf optimizer (GWO), specifically GWORF, GWOXGB,
    and GWOLGB for ET0 estimation. The findings indicate that the hybrid machine learning
    (ML) models outperformed traditional and empirical models in accurately predicting
    outcomes at all stations. Additionally, the random forest (RF) models demonstrated
    significantly better accuracy when utilizing the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) compared
    to the LightGBM (LGB) and XGBoost (XGB) models. The objective of this study (Jayshree
    et al. 2023) was to examine the efficacy of four ensemble strategies in accurately
    estimating the daily ET0 values at chosen locations in 10 agro climatic regions
    in Karnataka, India, spanning the time period from 1979 to 2014. The evaluation
    of these models was conducted by employing various combinations of meteorological
    variables as inputs through the use of tenfold cross-validation. The results demonstrated
    that the ensemble models, including all climatic variables, yielded the most precise
    estimates of ET0 when compared to alternative input combinations. Additionally
    the random forest regressor demonstrated superior performance compared to the
    other three models across all evaluated metrics. Nevertheless, the model in question
    resulted in the most significant computational expenditure, while the computational
    cost associated with the bagging approach for the linear regression was the most
    minimal. The performance for the extreme gradient-boosting algorithm was shown
    to be the most stable when trained on a modified dataset. On the other hand, evapotranspiration
    studies have ignored other ensemble methods, such as Stacking, despite the significant
    benefits, which include the ability to simultaneously develop ensembles from a
    variety of learning models and benefit from each one’s advantages while avoiding
    its drawbacks. Furthermore, when dealing with outliers and noise, Stacking ensembles
    have typically performed well (Martín et al. 2021). The term \"stacked ensemble\"
    refers to a specific type of ensemble approach in which multiple machine learning
    models are assembled in layers, with data moving from the input to the outcome
    (Petinrin and Saeed 2019; Vidyarthi et al. 2020). Wu et al. (2021a, b, c) presents
    the initial assessment of stacking and blending ensemble models for the purpose
    of estimating daily ET0. The stacking and blending models utilized a two-tiered
    architecture. The first layer, or level-0, consisted of basic models such as random
    forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron neural network
    (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbor regression (KNN). The second layer, or level-1,
    produced the ultimate outcome through linear regression (LR). The findings suggest
    that the stacking and blending models exhibited superior performance compared
    to the basic and empirical models, irrespective of the input combination. In contrast
    to basic models, the stacking and blending models exhibited greater portability
    across stations situated in diverse climate zones. Regarding computational expenses,
    stacking and blending models outperformed basic models in terms of accuracy within
    a reasonable time frame and with a smaller training dataset. However, blending
    models were able to achieve comparable high accuracy to stacking models in less
    time after expanding the size of the training dataset. Hence, the utilization
    of stacking and blending ensemble models is highly recommended for the estimation
    of ET0, particularly in cases where the training dataset or meteorological variables
    are restricted. Even though the performance of an ensemble or combining learners
    in multiple ways performed much better than a single-candidate learner, there
    is concern that these methods may over fit the data and may not be the best way
    to combine the candidate learners (Kabir and Ludwig 2019). From the previous literature
    review, it''s evident that researchers have tried to improve ET0 prediction approaches,
    and that work in this field is currently in progress. This study introduces the
    super learner technique, an ensemble approach to get over the limitations of the
    PM model and other machine learning models to estimate ET0 precisely. 3 Materials
    and methods The study area and dataset, the meteorological input combinations,
    the proposed model''s flowchart, the super learner technique''s structure, the
    machine learning models employed in this investigation are all included in this
    section, model evaluation metrics and PM model. 3.1 Study area and data collection
    In light of recent climate changes and population growth in Egypt, the country
    is facing a significant water shortage. Consequently, it is imperative to devise
    solutions to address this issue. The Egyptian government is currently focused
    on improving water resource management, particularly by mitigating water loss
    in the agricultural sector. This research aims to assist the government in developing
    an accurate model for estimating reference evapotranspiration, particularly in
    regions lacking sufficient meteorological data. The Arab Republic of Egypt has
    a landmass of approximately 1,002,000 square kilometers and a location in the
    northeastern part of the African continent. Its latitudes range from 22 to 32
    degrees north, while its longitudes range from 25 to 37 degrees east. The 32 Egyptian
    weather stations that contributed to the dataset utilized in this investigation
    are depicted in Fig. 2. These stations are part of the United Nations Food and
    Agriculture Organization''s (UN-FAO) CLIMWAT database, which has been used in
    the vast majority of ET0 estimation research (Smith et al., 1993). the dataset
    covers the period from 1971 to 2000 and includes Long-term monthly mean values
    of maximum and lowest air temperature (Tmax, Tmin) [°C], relative humidity (RH)
    (%), solar radiation (Rs) (MJ/m2/day), wind speed (U) at 2 m height (km/day),
    sunshine hours (H) as inputs and ET0 (mm/day) estimated with the PM model as target.

    maximum, and standard deviation, respectively. Additional to this, Fig. 3 depicted
    the boxplot which illustrated the distribution of each variable in the dataset
    employed in the current study. Table 1 Characteristics of the datasets as described
    by descriptive statistics Full size table Fig. 3 Box plot illustrates the distribution
    of each variable employed in the current study''s dataset Full size image 3.3
    Proposed model workflow The stages involved in the application of the suggested
    model to this research, beginning with the creation of the dataset and ending
    with the prediction of ET0, are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 The proposed model workflow
    involves generating a dataset by combining meteorological data and ET0, which
    is calculated using PM model data. The dataset is then split into training and
    testing sets, comprising 80% and 20% of the data, respectively. A super learner
    model is trained using the training set, and the proposed model is evaluated using
    five statistical indices, namely \\({R}^{2}\\), RMSE, MAE,MAPE and MSE, on the
    testing set Full size image 3.4 Super Learner model (SL) The concept of stacking
    was introduced by David Wolpert in the past 15 years. The implementation details,
    which were previously considered an \"art\" by Wolpert in 1992, were transformed
    into a scientific approach in 1996 by Leo Breiman. Breiman showcased the effectiveness
    of non-negative least squares (NNLS) regression in amalgamating predictions from
    algorithms that were fitted to the same dataset, also known as meta-learning.
    The theory proposed by Mark van der Laan, Sandrine Dudoit, and Aad van der Vaart
    in 2007 was further expanded to demonstrate that, in the case of large samples,
    the stacking approach is an optimal method for acquiring knowledge about two variables.
    The aforementioned algorithm acquired an alternative terminology, namely \"Super
    Learner\" (Phillips et al. 2023). SL model, commonly known as the model ensemble,
    is a loss-based learning system developed and studied by Lin et al. (2019). The
    present model is categorized as a stacking ensemble learning methodology, which
    amplifies the accuracy of the model by means of selecting and amalgamating multiple
    models (Lee et al. 2022). The SL model will asymptotically outperform all other
    candidate learners, according to theoretical findings where a Meta learner is
    learned using the outcomes of a number of base learners. Utilizing cross-validation,
    the outputs from base learners, also known as the level-one data, can be produced
    (Kabir and Ludwig 2019). Consequently, this methodology not only delineates the
    associations between predictors and the modeling outcomes generated through penalized
    regression, but also possesses the capability to depict the non-linear connections
    and interplay through the utilization of spline algorithms or decision trees (Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi
    et al. 2021). The framework of SL model according to Lee et al. (2022) that used
    in this study is illustrated in Fig. 5, where, it demonstrates the SL model''s
    workflow, as well as the base learners that were employed in this study. The MLEns
    (Flennerhag & jlopezpena 2018) (http://ml-ensemble.com) module was used to create
    the SL model. Fig. 5 Super Learner''s Architecture which involves partitioning
    the entire dataset into folds, with each fold being further divided into a training
    set and a verification set (V). Four base learner models, namely ETR, SVR, KNN,
    and ADA, are then trained on the training set and evaluated on the verification
    set for each fold to generate predictions. These predictions are used to create
    a new dataset consisting of both Z and V, which is then used to train the Meta
    learner and ultimately generate predictions Full size image The methodology for
    constructing the SL model as illustrated in Lee et al. (2022) can be succinctly
    outlined as follows. The objective of analyzing a dataset through observation
    Dn = (Xn, Yn), n = 1, 2, 3… k, is to make an estimation of the regression Ψ0 (X) = E
    (Y|X) where X is a vector of the variables that go into the model, and Y is the
    outcome that is of interest to us. The SL method comprises a set of distinct principles,
    which are outlined as follows: (1) Minimizing the predicted loss E [L (D, \\(\\Psi
    \\))] is a good way to think about the regression problem as follows: $${\\Psi
    }_{0} (X) = arg min E [L (D,\\Psi )]$$ (1) with L being a loss function. (2) The
    entire data set χ is divided into k subsets using a k-fold cross-validation approach.
    Each subset is comprised of verification and training samples V(v) (v = 1,2,3,….,n),
    T(v) (v = 1,2,3,….,n), correspondingly. Consider a set of algorithms that produce
    j base learners denoted by \\(\\widehat{\\Psi}\\) i (i = 1, 2, 3… j).In the v-th
    iteration, every base model is trained on the training set T(v). Additionally,
    the predictions for the respective verification sample can be determined by: $${\\widehat{\\Psi}}_{\\mathrm{i},\\mathrm{T}\\left(\\mathrm{v}\\right)
    }(\\mathrm{V}\\left(\\mathrm{v}\\right),(\\mathrm{i}=1, 2, 3\\dots \\mathrm{ j}))$$
    (2) (3) The individual predictions generated by each base learner are aggregated
    through a stacking process, resulting in the formation of a prediction matrix
    Z = \\({\\widehat{\\Psi}}_{\\mathrm{i},\\mathrm{T}\\left(\\mathrm{v}\\right) }(\\mathrm{V}\\left(\\mathrm{v}\\right)\\).
    The proposed approach involves a set of candidate base learners that are combined
    using a weight vector α to form a family of weighted combinations which can determine
    by: $$\\mathrm{m}(\\mathrm{z}|\\mathrm{\\alpha })=\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{j}}{\\mathrm{\\alpha
    }}_{\\mathrm{i }}{\\widehat{\\Psi }}_{\\mathrm{i},\\mathrm{T}\\left(\\mathrm{v}\\right)
    }(\\mathrm{V}\\left(\\mathrm{v}\\right), \\quad \\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{j}}{\\mathrm{\\alpha
    }}_{\\mathrm{i }}=1$$ (3) (4) The weight vector α is determined by minimizing
    the cross-validated errors between the permissible weight vector combinations
    and the actual output Y. This is achieved through the calculation of: $$\\widehat{\\mathrm{\\alpha
    }}=\\text{ arg min }\\sum_{\\mathrm{c}=1}^{\\mathrm{n}}{\\left({\\mathrm{Y}}_{\\mathrm{c}}-\\mathrm{m}({\\mathrm{z}}_{\\mathrm{c}}|\\mathrm{\\alpha
    })\\right)}^{2}$$ (4) (5) The final super learner is produced by combining the
    optimal weight vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{\\alpha }}\\) with \\(\\widehat{\\Psi}\\)
    i (X) according to\\(\\mathrm{m}(\\mathrm{z}|\\mathrm{\\alpha })\\), where: $${\\widehat{\\Psi
    }}_{\\mathrm{SL}}(\\mathrm{X})=\\sum_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{j}}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{\\alpha
    }}}_{\\mathrm{i }}{\\widehat{\\Psi }}_{\\mathrm{i }}(\\mathrm{X})$$ (5) 3.5 Base
    learners Base learners refer to algorithms that are not completely specified but
    establish a specific learning approach. It''s best to consider a variety of base
    learners and create various versions of the same base learner with different tuning
    criteria. Incorporating a low-performing learner in the library setting does not
    pose any detrimental effects, as their performance will be assigned a value of
    zero (Phillips et al. 2023). It has been decided to use the machine learning algorithms
    Extra Tree Regressor (ETR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors
    (KNN), and AdaBoost Regressor (ADA) as base learners in the Super Learner''s model,
    where the Scikit-learn package (Pedregosa et al. 2011) (https://scikit-learn.org)
    in Python 3.8 was used to implement the models that were employed in this study.
    The selected machine learning algorithms can be described as follows: (1) Extra
    Tree Regressor (ETR) As first proposed by Geurts et al., the Extra Tree Regressor
    (ETR) method is a refined strategy that expands on the strengths of the Random
    Forest model (Hameed et al. 2021). Extra-Trees are appealing due to their computational
    efficiency during learning and their ability to compete with other set approaches
    in terms of accuracy, all while being extremely quick thanks to their extreme
    randomness (Berrouachedi et al. 2019). ETR''s greatest advantage is that it does
    not necessitate intensive focus on the choice of hyper parameter values while
    implementation (Saeed et al. 2021). There are primarily two significant differences
    between the ETR and Random Forest systems. First, the ETR uses every possible
    cutting point and randomly selects one to use for dividing nodes. Two, it grows
    trees using the complete training set (Hameed et al. 2021; Jamei et al. 2021).
    Figure 6 provides an illustration of the architecture of ETR. With a dataset in
    hand, ETR chooses a split rule at the root node at random, using a combination
    of feature selection and cutoff point selection. Until you reach a leaf node,
    this process will be repeated in all of the nodes below the current one. More
    specifically, the number of trees in the ensemble, the number of attributes/features
    to randomly choose, and the minimum number of samples/instances required to divide
    a node are the three most critical parameters of ETR (Saeed et al. 2021). Fig.
    6 The architectural design of the ETR is the subject of discussion. Upon obtaining
    a dataset, ETR employs a randomized approach to select a split rule for the root
    node, utilizing a combination of feature selection (N) and cutoff point selection.
    The aforementioned procedure will be iterated in all nodes situated beneath the
    present one, until a leaf node is reached Full size image (2) Support Vector Regressor
    (SVR) Vapnik was the one who initially suggested using a support vector machine,
    also known as the SVM approach (Üne et al. 2020; Yamaç, 2021). Owing to its high
    ability to focus on the complex nonlinear relationships between inputs, SVM is
    employed for regression and classification issues (Chia et al. 2020; Üne et al.
    2020; Yamaç 2021). However, according to current studies on SVM model implementation,
    the key difficulty is optimizing internal parameters (Ehteram et al. 2019). For
    the ET0 prediction, which is more likely to be a regression problem than a classification
    problem, the support vector regression (SVR), which is a version of the support
    vector machine, is the type of model that is typically utilized (Chia et al. 2020).
    The accuracy of SVR models is determined by the appropriate selection of kernels
    and their corresponding parameters. Typically, the radial basis function (RBF)
    is the preferred kernel due to its superior efficiency in estimating ET0, as supported
    by prior research findings (Abdallah et al. 2022b; Hebbalaguppae Krishnashetty
    et al. 2021; Svm et al. 2022). (3) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Cover and Hart (1967)
    created the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) approach, which is widely used in data mining
    models today (Yamaç 2021). As a result of its efficiency, ease of use, adaptability,
    and performance, this technique is capable of addressing issues with classification
    and regression (Yamaç, 2021; Yamaç and Todorovic 2020). The KNN approach does
    have certain drawbacks, despite the many benefits that were just discussed. Due
    to the need to calculate the distance between each query example and all training
    samples, the KNN algorithm might have a slow running time when dealing with large
    training datasets. Nevertheless, kd-trees can be utilized to improve KNN searches
    for large amounts of data (Feng and Tian 2021; Yamaç and Todorovic 2020). Choosing
    the appropriate \"K\" value is an important step in applying the KNN algorithm.
    If the K value is low, the algorithm will become increasingly difficult to understand
    and will be vulnerable to overfitting. On the other hand, if the K value is high,
    the model is going to be quite easy to understand (Liu et al. 2021).The steps
    of KNN technique (Qaddoura and Younes 2022) can be summarized in the following
    as shown in Fig. 7: (1) Determine the value of k, as shown in the figure k = 3
    (2) Using Euclidean distance, calculate the distance between the aqua-colored
    point and each red-colored point. (3) Based on k = 3, the three dots with red
    color inside the circle represent the three nearest neighbors. (4) The predicted
    value can be determined by taking the average value of the three red point values.

    between the aqua-colored point and each red-colored point Full size image (4)
    AdaBoost Regression (ADA) The ADA model quickly rose to prominence as one of the
    most effective ways to machine learning recognition (Asadollah et al. 2021; Wang
    et al. 2022; Yamaç and Todorovic 2020). AdaBoost is well recognized as the first
    effective boosting algorithm, wherein the base learners consist of decision trees
    that possess a solitary split. Decision trees that consist of only a few nodes
    and branches are commonly referred to as decision stumps (Mienye and Sun 2022).
    In the present study, decision tree regressors are utilized as the base learners
    of ADA model. ADA''s key benefits are that it is more stable with noisy data and
    has a low impact on the overfitting problem (Jin et al. 2020). In addition to
    this, the ADA is a well-liked boosting strategy due to the high estimation precision
    it offers and the ease with which it can be implemented in code (Yamaç and Todorovic
    2020). The ADA is a meta-estimator that fits a regression to the entire data and
    then fits multiple copies of the regression to the corresponding dataset, adjusting
    the weight of the instances based on the errors of the current prediction as presented
    in Fig. 8 (Jin et al. 2020). Fig. 8 Schematic of AdaBoost Regression, where all
    data points in the dataset denoted as (Dm) are assigned uniform weights. The determination
    of whether a sample will be taken or not is contingent upon the weight of the
    sample. Sampling with replacement is employed to generate a training set (Dm1)
    from the dataset (Dm) based on weight considerations. The training set is subsequently
    utilized to train a regressor. The objective of conducting a prediction loss evaluation
    is to assess the efficacy of the trained regressor and ascertain an appropriate
    weight (w1) for the regressor Full size image For the sake of clarity, we will
    refer to the data set as (Dm). As can be seen, each of the data in (Dm) is given
    an equal weight to begin with. The weight is what determines whether or not a
    sample will be taken. In accordance with the weight, we take a sample from the
    dataset (Dm) using replacement in order to produce a training set (Dm1), and we
    then make use of the training set in order to train a regressor. The purpose of
    a prediction loss evaluation is to evaluate the trained regressor and determine
    a weight (w1) for the regressor, as is illustrated in Fig. 8 (Min and Luo 2016).
    3.6 Meta learner A meta-learner is an algorithm with a defined set of inputs that
    has been taught to make predictions about a new collection of variables. Therefore,
    the meta-learner is a learner that learns from the knowledge of other learners.
    Dataset used to fit the meta-learner, including cross-validated prediction values
    and validation set outcomes from base learners (Van Der Laan et al. 2007). The
    Multilayer Perceptron, sometimes known as MLP, is a popular artificial neural
    network (ANN) architecture that is frequently employed in the field of hydrological
    modeling (Achite et al. 2022). MLP model has been extensively utilized in the
    examination of diverse complicated problems (Wu et al. 2021a, b, c). MLP is inspired
    by neurons in the human central nervous system. It also features straightforward
    coding and, in most situations, accurate ET0 calculations (Bellido-Jiménez et
    al. 2022). Due of the aforementioned benefits, MLP will be utilized as a Meta
    learner in the current investigation. The parameter configurations for the base
    learners, Meta learner, and Super Learner models employed in the current study
    are presented in Table 2. Table 2 Model parameters of base learners, meta learner,
    and super learner models Full size table 3.7 Penman–Monteith FAO 56 equation (PM
    model) The FAO Penman–Monteith model has served as the foundation for numerous
    prior comparative evaluations due to its wide applicability across geographic
    regions with little to no modification of its parameters. The Penman–Monteith
    (P-M) model was initially formulated by Monteith to approximate the rate of evapotranspiration.
    This model takes into consideration the potential evaporation that occurs over
    water surfaces and the transpiration process, while assuming that the vegetation
    canopy functions as a single uniform cover or \"big-leaf\". The P-M model got
    standardization by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) (Abeysiriwardana et al. 2022). The PM model is presented in
    Chen et al. (2020), Hu et al. (2022), Üneş et al. (2020), Wu et al. (2021a, b,
    c) and Zhu et al. (2020) as: $${ET}_{o}= \\frac{0.408\\Delta \\left({R}_{n}-G\\right)+\\gamma

    further information regarding the computation of each of the variables listed
    above (Allen et al. 1998). 3.8 Input combinations As stated in Table 3, this study
    examined six different combinations of meteorological data as inputs for the suggested
    model. Table 3 Different input combinations used in this study Full size table
    3.9 Model performance evaluation All of the models'' performances were assessed
    with using five well-known metrics: root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute
    error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) (Vaz
    et al. 2023),and coefficient of determination (\\({R}^{2}\\)) (Sharma et al. 2022)
    as the following: (1) $$RMSE = { }\\sqrt {\\frac{1}{N}{ }\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i
    = 1}^{N} \\left( {ET_{i}^{act} - ET_{i}^{pred} } \\right)^{2} }$$ (7) where \\(ET_{i}^{act}\\)
    and \\(ET_{i}^{pred}\\) are ET0 values estimated by FAO-56 PM and models respectively.
    (2) $$MAE = { }\\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} \\left| {ET_{i}^{act}
    - { }ET_{i}^{pred} } \\right|}}{N}$$ (8) where \\(ET_{i}^{act}\\) and \\(ET_{i}^{pred}\\)
    are ET0 values estimated by FAO-56 PM and models respectively. (3) $$R^{2} = {
    }\\frac{{\\left[ {\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} \\left( {ET_{i}^{act}

    values estimated by FAO-56 PM and models and \\(\\overline{{{\\text{ET}}_{{\\text{o}}}^{{{\\text{pred}}}}

    are ET0 values estimated by FAO-56 PM and models respectively. 4 Experimental
    results This section relies on the experiment results obtained from the proposed
    model to assess its effectiveness in utilizing diverse restricted meteorological
    data as inputs. Subsequently, a comparative analysis is presented between the
    results obtained from our proposed model and the base learners. Ultimately, a
    comparative analysis is presented between the results obtained from our proposed
    model and those of other models in the same field. The present investigation utilized
    five distinct statistical metrics, namely RMSE, MAE, MSE, MAPE and \\({R}^{2}\\),
    in conjunction with diverse input meteorological variables to assess the study''s
    objectives. The \\({R}^{2}\\) is a statistical measure utilized to assess the
    correlation and concurrence between the actual and predicted daily ET0. \\({R}^{2}\\)
    value of 1 is considered to be excellent and indicates a positive correlation.
    While the metrics of MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and MSE are utilized to quantify the level
    of error that is linked with the estimated models. These metrics are characterized
    by a numerical range that spans from 0 to ∞, with the ideal value being 0 (Vaz
    et al. 2023). Initially, a correlation analysis was conducted utilizing a seaborn
    heatmap (Waskom 2021) to examine the relationship between meteorological input
    parameters, specifically maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax and Tmin), relative
    humidity (RH), solar radiation (RS), wind speed (U), sun shine hours (H), and
    the output variable, namely reference evapotranspiration (ET0). As indicated in
    Fig. 9, the results of the correlation analysis demonstrate that RS exerts the
    most substantial impact on ET0, whereas U exhibits the least significant effect.
    This justification is also supported by previous investigations (Yildirim et al.
    2023). Fig. 9 Correlation analysis of selected variables and ET0, where the result
    demonstrate that RS exerts the most substantial impact on ET0, whereas U exhibits
    the least significant effect Full size image Additionally, the correlation between
    relative humidity and ET0 was found to be strong and negative. The observed negative
    correlation indicates that there exists an inverse association between ET0 and
    relative humidity. As per the given information, an increase in relative humidity
    would result in a decrease in the reference evapotranspiration variable. This
    phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that increased relative humidity results in
    reduced water loss from both the Earth''s surface and plant cells to the atmosphere.
    This is due to the presence of elevated atmospheric humidity, which is supported
    by the findings of study (Seifi & Riahi 2020). 4.1 Performance analysis of super
    learner The study compared the performance of the SL model with that of the PM
    model during testing period, using various combinations of meteorological data.
    The findings as shown in Table 4 indicated that the model with complete meteorological
    variable inputs (M1) demonstrated the best performance of RMSE, MAE and MSE (0.0512,
    0.0358 and 0.0026 mm/day), and MAPE of 0.9148% across all input conditions. Previous
    research provides support to this argument as well (Wu et al. 2021a, b, c; Yu
    et al. 2020). In cases where the solar radiation variable is substituted with
    sunshine hours (M2), the statistical indicators exhibit lower performance (0.2717,
    0.2239 and 0.0738 mm/day for RMSE, MAE and MSE, respectively), and MAPE of 5.6145%
    compared to the M1 inputs. However, the performance is higher than the other combination
    models (M3, M4, M5, and M6) inputs. Table 4 Testing set results of super learner
    and machine learning models applied at 32 weather stations dataset where the statistical
    indexes of the models that perform the best under each input combination are highlighted
    in bold. (M1: Tmax, Tmin, RH, Rs, and U, M2: Tmax, Tmin, RH, H, and U, M3: Tmax,
    Tmin, RH, and U, M4: Tmax, Tmin, U, and Rs, M5: Tmax, Tmin, and U, M6: RH, Rs,
    and U) Full size table Furthermore, in the context of reducing input variables,
    there exists a degree of similarity between the model that employs input combinations
    of temperatures, wind speed, and humidity (M3) inputs and the model that utilizes
    combinations of humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed (M6) inputs. The former
    model yields RMSE, MAE, and MSE values of 0.4141, 0.3338, and 0.1715 mm/day, respectively
    and MAPE of 8.1670%, while the latter model produces RMSE, MAE, and MSE values
    of 0.4186, 0.3345, and 0.1753, respectively, and MAPE of 8.0131%. Conversely,
    the utilization of solely temperature and wind speed (M5) inputs resulted in the
    least optimal performances in comparison to all other input combinations, with
    respective RMSE, MAE, and MSE values of 0.5735, 0.4575, and 0.3289 respectively,
    and MAPE of 11.5706%. The \\({R}^{2}\\) values for various super learner models
    utilizing distinct meteorological data as inputs are presented in Figs. 10, 11
    and 12 as per the analysis. The most optimal SL was executed in the M1 inputs,
    exhibiting a high coefficient of determination (\\({R}^{2}\\) = 0.9994), while
    the least favorable SL was conducted in the M5 inputs, demonstrating a relatively
    lower coefficient of determination (\\({R}^{2}\\) = 0.9279). Furthermore, it can
    be observed that there is a certain level of resemblance between the \\({R}^{2}\\)
    values obtained for SL when utilizing M3 (temperature, humidity, and wind speed)
    and M6 (humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) inputs, with \\({R}^{2}\\)
    values of 0.9624 and 0.9616, respectively. Furthermore, the study found that substituting
    Rs in M1 inputs with sunshine hours (M2) inputs resulted in a decrease of 1.56%
    in \\({R}^{2}\\) values. Specifically, the \\({R}^{2}\\) values were 0.9994 and
    0.9838 for M1 and M2, respectively. Fig. 10 Scatter plots comparison based on
    statistical metric \\({\\mathrm{R}}^{2}\\) between predicted ET0 values by employed
    models against ET0 estimated by standard PM model for M1 and M2 input combinations

    comparison based on statistical metric \\({\\mathrm{R}}^{2}\\) between predicted
    ET0 values by employed models against ET0 estimated by standard PM model for M5
    and M6 input combinations Full size image Additionally, incorporating Rs variable
    into M5 inputs (M4) led to an improvement of 3.09% in \\({\\mathrm{R}}^{2}\\)
    values. The \\({\\mathrm{R}}^{2}\\) values were 0.9575 and 0.9279 for M4 and M5,
    respectively. Finally, replacing Rs in M4 inputs with RH variable (M3) resulted
    in a slight improvement of 0.5% in \\({\\mathrm{R}}^{2}\\) values. The \\({\\mathrm{R}}^{2}\\)
    values were 0.9575 and 0.9624 for M4 and M3, respectively. The preceding findings
    indicate that RH has a substantial impact and are more effective in approximating
    ET0 using SL models. Previous results demonstrated that RH have significant influence
    on ET0 estimation (Ferreira et al. 2019). 4.2 Comparison of performance analysis
    of SL and base learners across Input Combinations Table 4 demonstrates that the
    base learners'' performance varied depending on the input conditions. Specifically,
    the models utilizing complete meteorological variables (M1) exhibited the best
    performance in terms of RMSE, MSE, MAE, and MAPE across all input conditions,
    with the exception of the ADA model for M6 inputs, which included RH, Rs, and
    U, and outperformed the other ADA models in terms of MAE and MAPE. Moreover, the
    models using M5 inputs demonstrated lower performance across all input conditions
    for RMSE, MSE, MAE and MAPE, except for the ADA model using M3 inputs, which exhibited
    lower RMSE and MSE than the M5 inputs, and the KNN model using M6 inputs, which
    exhibited lower MAE and MAPE than the M5 inputs. Furthermore, Table 4 showed that
    among the various base learners, SVR models exhibited the most superior performance
    in terms of RMSE, MSE, MAE and MAPE across M1 inputs, which utilized complete
    meteorological data, and this finding is in agreement with prior research (Yu
    et al. 2020), M2 inputs, which replaced the Rs in M1 inputs with H, and M3 inputs,
    which included temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity. Specifically, the
    RMSE values were 0.1025, 0.2994, and 0.4416 mm/day for M1, M2, and M3, respectively.
    The MSE values were 0.0105, 0.0896, and 0.1950 mm/day for M1, M2, and M3, respectively,
    and the MAE values were 0.0442, 0.2382, and 0.3696 mm/day for M1, M2, and M3,
    respectively. Finally, the MAPE values were 1.2088, 6.3108 and 9.4351, respectively.
    However the observation of a larger root mean square error (RMSE) compared to
    the mean absolute error (MAE) in the support vector machine (SVM) models suggests
    the presence of outliers or significant errors, but to a lesser degree than in
    the other base learner models. This finding is consistent with previous research
    (Chia et al. 2020). Additionally, SVR model is effective in addressing the intricate
    nonlinear association between ET0 and meteorological factors. Furthermore, it
    demonstrates notable precision and computational efficiency when estimating ET0
    (Hou et al. 2023). Additionally, The ETR models shown enhanced performance when
    incorporating the Tmax, Tmin, and U (M5) inputs, except for the MAPE metric, which
    revealed lower values compared to SVR. Furthermore, the M4 inputs, which encompassed
    the M5 inputs and Rs, in conjunction with the M6 inputs, comprising the RH, Rs,
    and U combinations, also yielded favorable results. RMSE and MSE values obtained
    were 0.4515 and 0.6313, and 0.4747 mm/day for RMSE, and 0.2039, 0.3986, and 0.2253
    mm/day for M4, M5, and M6, respectively. The MAE values yielded the highest performance
    for the M4 and M5 inputs, with respective values of 0.5128 and 0.3769. Furthermore,
    the MAPE values obtained from the M4 input combinations were 9.2724, which were
    lower than the MAPE values obtained from SVR model when utilizing the M5 and M6
    input combinations. Specifically, the MAPE values for the ETR were 13.4573 and
    9.5639 for M5 and M6, respectively, while the MAPE values for the SVR model were
    13.4412 and 9.1261 for M5 and M6, respectively. The ETR model demonstrated superiority
    in terms of accuracy compared to the KNN and ADA models. This advantage can be
    attributed to the ETR model''s ability to effectively simulate outlier values,
    which is a challenging task for any AI model (Hameed et al. 2021). The ADA and
    KNN models exhibited inferior performance across all input combinations, as evidenced
    by their lower RMSE, MSE, MAE and MAPE results as shown in Table 4 relative to
    the other base learner models. However, ADA outperformed KNN, which demonstrated
    the poorest results in comparison to the remaining base learner models. The K-nearest
    neighbors (KNN) model exhibits the least favorable performance compared to the
    other base learners, indicating a limited capacity to effectively capture nonlinear
    relationships between weather conditions and ET0 (Zhang et al. 2022). In contrast,
    the results depicted in Figs. 10, 11 and 12 indicate that the \\({R}^{2}\\) value
    of SVR models ranged from 0.8926 to 0.9977. Notably, the SVR approach exhibited
    superior performance compared to all other base learner models when utilizing
    complete meteorological data as inputs (M1), as well as when using M2, M3, and
    M6 inputs. Conversely, the \\({R}^{2}\\) value of ETR models ranged from 0.9127
    to 0.9570, with ETR demonstrating the best performance among all base learner
    models when using M4 and M5 inputs. Furthermore, it was observed that KNN models
    exhibited the least \\({R}^{2}\\) outcomes compared to all other fundamental learner
    models. The \\({R}^{2}\\) values ranged from 0.5592 to 0.7629. Based on the preceding
    outcomes of the base learner models in contrast to the results of the SL models,
    it can be concluded that the SL models exhibited superior performance across all
    input combinations. The evaluation metrics, namely RMSE, MSE, MAE, and \\({R}^{2}\\),
    ranged from 0.0512, 0.0026, 0.0358 mm/day, and 0.9279 to 0.5735, 0.3289, 0.4575
    mm/day, and 0.9994, respectively. Furthermore, the MAPE exhibited a range of values,
    spanning from 0.9148 to 11.5706. The superiority of SL models over other base
    learner models in estimating ET0 can be attributed to their smaller values of
    RMSE, MSE, MAE, and MAPE, as well as their higher \\({R}^{2}\\) values. Moreover,
    it possesses the capability to provide precise outcomes even with restricted meteorological
    information, such as M3, M4, M5, and M6. 4.3 Comparison with related work To evaluate
    the effectiveness of our proposed model, we employed performance metrics on the
    testing set and compared its results with those of other techniques that have
    been applied to the same dataset. The objective of the aforementioned research
    (Mattar 2018) was to create and assess a gene expression programming (GEP) model
    that could estimate the average monthly evapotranspiration (ET0) with limited
    climatic data. The dataset utilized in the analysis was sourced from the CLIMWAT
    database comprising of data, collected from 32 weather stations located in Egypt.
    A comparative analysis has been conducted between our proposed model and the GEP
    model, utilizing four distinct input combinations, namely Tmax, Tmin, and U, Tmax,
    Tmin, RH, and U, Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and U, RH, Rs, and U. The comparison has been
    evaluated based on two metrics. The statistical metrics \\({R}^{2}\\) and RMSE
    are commonly used in data analysis and modeling to evaluate the accuracy and goodness
    of fit of a given model. Table 5 displays the RMSE and \\({R}^{2}\\) outcomes
    of our proposed model and the GEP model results shown in Mattar (2018) for all
    input combinations utilized in the comparison. The results indicated that our
    proposed model''s RMSE values achieved the lowest errors than those of the GEP
    models. Specifically, our proposed and GEP model''s RMSE values were 0.582 and
    0.573 mm/day when utilizing Tmax, Tmin, and U inputs, 0.430 and 0.414 mm/day when
    using Tmax, Tmin, RH, and U inputs, 0.476 and 0.440 mm/day when using Tmax, Tmin,
    Rs, and U inputs, and 0.546 and 0.418 mm/day when using RH, Rs, and U inputs,
    respectively. The lowest RMSE values indicate a superior fit and serve as a metric
    for the precision of our proposed model in forecasting ET0. Table 5 Performance
    comparison between our proposed model and GEP models in (Mattar 2018) study based
    on \\({\\mathrm{R}}^{2}\\) and RMSE across different input combinations, where
    the statistical indexes of the models that perform the best under each input combination
    are highlighted in bold Full size table On the contrary, Table 5 displays \\({R}^{2}\\)
    values indicating slight variations in performance between the utilization of
    Tmax, Tmin, and U inputs, Tmax, Tmin, RH, and U inputs and Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and
    U. The \\({R}^{2}\\) values for our proposed model and GEP models were marginally
    different, with 0.9279 and 0.929 for Tmax, Tmin, and U inputs, 0.9624 and 0.962
    for Tmax, Tmin, RH, and U inputs, and 0.9575 and 0.953 for Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and
    U respectively. However, when considering alternative input combinations utilizing
    RH, Rs, and U as inputs, the \\({R}^{2}\\) values for our proposed model exhibited
    a 2.45% increase. Specifically, the \\({R}^{2}\\) values for our proposed model
    and the GEP model were 0.9616 and 0.938, respectively. Overall, our proposed model
    exhibited superior performance compared to the GEP models across all input combinations
    utilized in the comparison, except for the Tmax, Tmin, and U inputs, where the
    \\({R}^{2}\\) value of the GEP model was marginally higher than that of our proposed
    model. The present findings suggest that the proposed model exhibits a high degree
    of accuracy and can be effectively utilized for the purpose of modeling ET0. A
    different methodology (Mattar and Alazba 2019) which employed multiple linear
    regressions (MLR) to model reference evapotranspiration (ET0) using the identical
    dataset that we employed, and its performance was compared to that of our proposed
    model using two statistical metrics: RMSE and MAE utilizing four distinct input
    combinations, namely Tmax, Tmin, and U, Tmax, Tmin, RH, and U, Tmax, Tmin, Rs,
    and U, RH, Rs, and U. Table 6 displays the RMSE and MAE results of both our proposed
    model and the MLR model, as reported in (Mattar & Alazba 2019), across all input
    combinations that were compared. The findings suggest that the RMSE and MAE values
    of our proposed model exhibited superior performance compared to the MLR models,
    as they yielded the lowest errors. The RMSE values of our proposed MLR model were
    determined to be 0.573 and 0.701 mm/day when incorporating Tmax, Tmin, and U inputs.
    When utilizing Tmax, Tmin, RH, and U inputs, the RMSE values were found to be
    0.414 and 0.502 mm/day. Similarly, when using Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and U inputs, the
    RMSE values were determined to be 0.440 and 0.668 mm/day. Lastly, the RMSE values
    were found to be 0.418 and 0.685 mm/day when utilizing RH, Rs, and U inputs. The
    MAE values of our proposed MLR model were computed to be 0.457 and 0.503 mm/day
    when utilizing Tmax, Tmin, and U inputs. When using Tmax, Tmin, RH, and U inputs,
    the MAE values were 0.333 and 0.411 mm/day. Similarly, when using Tmax, Tmin,
    Rs, and U inputs, the MAE values were 0.320 and 0.478 mm/day. Lastly, when using
    RH, Rs, and U inputs, the MAE values were computed to be 0.334 and 0.528 mm/day.
    The superior fit of our proposed model in forecasting ET0, as compared to MLR,
    is evidenced by the lowest RMSE and MAE values obtained across all input combinations
    utilized in the comparison. These values serve as a metric for the precision of
    our model. Table 6 Performance comparison between our proposed model and MLR models

    The objective of this work is to examine the utilization of the SL approach for
    estimating reference evapotranspiration. There are a wide range of standard and
    non-traditional techniques that can be employed for the estimation of ET0. Several
    research have also demonstrated that machine learning methods outperformed conventional
    empirical formulas, such as temperature-based and radiation-based approaches,
    for ET0 estimating (Chia et al. 2020; Rahman et al. 2020). The accuracy of machine
    learning models in predicting ET0 is primarily determined by the combination of
    input climatic variables (Zhu et al. 2020). Ensemble modeling is highly appealing
    due of its ability to improve model performance with low exertion (Chia et al.
    2021). The three primary categories of ensemble learning methods are bagging,
    stacking, and boosting. It is essential to have a comprehensive understanding
    of each technique and to take them into account while conducting any kind of predictive
    modeling (Jayshree et al. 2023). The Penman–Monteith approach is considered the
    most accurate among conventional methods for estimating ET0, while it requires
    a high level of parameterization. Due to the unavailability of some characteristics
    and stations in certain regions, it is not feasible to estimate ET0 using this
    approach for all regions (Fan et al. 2018a; T R et al. 2023). To address this
    problem, this study utilized a heterogeneous ensemble method known as the super
    learner. This method is a version of the stacking technique and offers flexibility
    in terms of the range and number of predictive models used to construct the super
    learner. At the first part of the current study, the results of SL model have
    been compared to the results of the four base learner models over different input
    combinations wherein the outcomes of all models are compared to those of the PM
    model. The results based on five statistical indexes: RMSE, MAE, R2, MAPE and
    MSE demonstrated that the Super Learner model outperformed the four base learner
    models across six different input combinations. The results of this study indicate
    that the utilization of stacking models for ET0 estimate is superior, which aligns
    with the findings of earlier research and further strengthens this conclusion
    (Wu et al. 2021a, b, c). Furthermore, the utilization of all possible input combinations
    yielded the most optimal performance across all other input combinations. This
    finding supports previous research indicating that the accuracy of the model improves
    as the number of inputs increases (Fan et al. 2018b; Heramb et al. 2023; Jayshree
    et al. 2023). In addition, the models which utilized four input combinations,
    produced adequate estimates of ET0 that align with the findings reported in reference
    (Jayshree et al. 2023). Furthermore, the suggested model, which utilized three
    input combinations (namely RH, Rs, and U), shown a higher level of accuracy in
    estimating ET0 compared to the model that employed four input combinations (Tmin,
    Tmax, Rs, and U). This finding suggests that the former model exhibits superior
    accuracy in estimating ET0 while utilizing a reduced set of meteorological data.
    This finding is consistent with the studies conducted by previous scholars (Fan
    et al. 2018a). Also, the findings of the study indicate that the inclusion of
    relative humidity (RH) and solar radiation (Rs) significantly affect the estimation
    of ET0.The argument has been strengthened by previous research (Zhang et al. 2022).
    This is evident in the results of the SL model, which demonstrate a decrease in
    performance when replacing Rs in M1 inputs with H in M2 inputs. Specifically,
    the SL model''s performance decreased by 81.15% based on RMSE metric, by 84.01%
    based on MAE, by 4.69% based on MAPE and by 1.56% based on \\({R}^{2}\\). Furthermore,
    upon the removal of RH and Rs from M1 resulting in M5 inputs, the performance
    of the SL model exhibited a decrease of 91.07% in terms of RMSE, 92.17% in terms
    of MAE, 10.65% in terms of MAPE and 7.15% in terms of \\({R}^{2}\\). Additionally,
    the inclusion of relative humidity (RH) as an input parameter alongside temperature
    and wind speed resulted in a 27.79% improvement in the performance of the SL model
    as determined by RMSE. MAE and MAPE also showed a 27.03% and 3.4% improvement,
    respectively, while \\({R}^{2}\\) increased by 3.58%. Furthermore, the inclusion
    of Rs to M5 inputs, specifically temperature and wind speed, resulted in a 23.20%
    improvement in the performance of the SL model as measured by RMSE, a 30.01% and
    3.17% improvement as measured by MAE and MAPE, respectively, and a 3.09% improvement
    as measured by \\({R}^{2}\\). These findings suggest that the variables used are
    effective in estimating ET0. In the second section of the study, a comparative
    analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model. Specifically,
    the proposed model was compared to two related works, namely the GEP model utilized
    in Mattar (2018) and the MLR model employed in Mattar and Alazba (2019). This
    comparison aimed to determine the superiority of the proposed model over its counterparts.
    The initial study involved a comparison between our proposed model and the GEP
    model. The results indicated that our model exhibited a performance improvement
    of 2.45% in terms of \\({R}^{2}\\) and 23.44% in terms of RMSE when utilizing
    RH, Rs, and U inputs. Furthermore, the model we have put out has demonstrated
    an enhancement in performance by 0.46% in terms of \\({R}^{2}\\) and by 7.56%
    in terms of RMSE, specifically when utilizing Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and U inputs. Furthermore,
    the model we proposed exhibited an enhancement in performance of 0.04% in terms
    of \\({R}^{2}\\) and 3.72% in terms of RMSE, when utilizing inputs of Tmax, Tmin,
    RH, and U inputs. On the other hand, the utilization of Tmax, Tmin, and U inputs
    in the GEP model resulted in a performance enhancement of 0.11% in terms of \\({R}^{2}\\)
    and 1.54% in terms of RMSE. The results of this study indicate that the proposed
    model demonstrates a significant level of precision and can be efficiently employed
    for the purpose of ET0 modeling. Conversely, in the second study, a comparison
    was conducted between our proposed model and the MLR model. The results demonstrated
    that SL outperformed MLR in terms of minimizing errors, as determined by the RMSE
    and MAE metrics, across all input combinations utilized in the analysis. The performance
    of SL was enhanced by 18.25% and 9.14% for RMSE and MAE, respectively, when utilizing
    Tmax, Tmin, and U inputs. Similarly, when incorporating Tmax, Tmin, RH, and U
    inputs, the performance of SL was improved by 17.52% and 18.97% for RMSE and MAE,
    respectively. Furthermore, the utilization of Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and U inputs resulted
    in a 34.13% and 33.05% improvement in RMSE and MAE, respectively. Finally, the
    incorporation of RH, Rs, and U inputs led to a 38.97% and 36.74% improvement in
    RMSE and MAE, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate the efficiency
    of the SL model in enhancing the accuracy of ET0 estimation with restricted meteorological
    data by minimizing the discrepancies between the projected and observed ET0 values.
    Subsequently based on the above findings, the optimal result for estimating ET0
    was observed when using the M1 input combination. The argument is additionally
    strengthened by previous research (Wu et al. 2021a, b, c; Yu et al. 2020). This
    observation is supported by Fig. 13, which illustrates the optimal structure of
    the SL models suggested in this study for ET0 estimation. Furthermore, we proposed
    the utilization of the M3 model, which encompasses temperatures, humidity, and
    wind speed. Additionally, we recommended the adoption of the M6 model, which incorporates
    humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed. Moreover, we suggested the implementation
    of the M4 model, which comprises temperatures, solar radiation, and wind speed,
    as it has demonstrated superior performance in accurately estimating ET0. These
    models were chosen due to their exceptional performance and ability to reduce
    the number of input combinations required for estimation. Fig. 13 The optimal
    configuration of SL models for estimating ET0 Full size image 6 Conclusions and
    future work The Penman–Monteith (PM) method requires a greater amount of meteorological
    observation data for the estimation of ET0, rendering its application challenging
    in countries or regions where the necessary observation equipment is not readily
    accessible. Scholars have initiated research into the integration of intelligent
    algorithms with conventional estimation techniques to enhance the accuracy and
    efficiency of ET0 estimation, in light of the proliferation of machine learning
    technology. For these reasons this study was implemented to offer a high performance
    ensemble learning model that has been suggested for daily ET0 estimation using
    limited meteorological data. The ensemble method which called Super Learner technique
    is based on the cross-validation theory and includes four base learner models
    ETR, SVR, KNN, and ADA. According to the preceding, the Super Learner model is
    a preferred technique for ET0 estimation, particularly in the situation of insufficient
    meteorological data, which may be lacking in some parts of the world. However,
    it is crucial to take into account the time cost associated with big datasets
    when considering the cross-validation theory. This is particularly relevant when
    employing multiple levels of base learners, especially if these base learners
    are complicated. The aforementioned factors can potentially restrict the effectiveness
    of the suggested model. we still need to improve the results, and this can be
    done in a number of ways: Employing various input combinations in an attempt to
    attain the optimal input combination that results in a precise estimation of ET0.
    Exploring alternative base learner models or scaling up their quantity to improve
    the accuracy of the model is being attempted. The utilization of hyper parameter
    tuning techniques enables the attainment of optimal parameters for individual
    base learners, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the model. The utilization
    of data preparation techniques has the potential to improve the overall performance
    of the model. Furthermore, the exploration of various cross-validation folds has
    the potential to enhance the ultimate accuracy of the model. Investigating the
    impact of varying dataset sizes on the performance of the super learner model.

  description: Spatial recharge estimation uncertainty is directly proportional to
    uncertainty in input precipitation data Thus, the main objective of this study
    was to investigate the recharge uncertainty by using improved spatial rainfall
    observations. The physically based fully distributed hydrological model WetSpa
    was used to simulate 20,000 possible combinations of parameters for two model
    setup. The M1 model setup was developed based on the rainfall measurements obtained
    from rain gauge stations scattered in and around the Tikur-Wuha watershed in Ethiopia,
    while M2 model setup was developed using bias-corrected satellite rainfall estimates
    (SREs) based on Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRP) merged with
    relevant ground station records. The required parameter combinations were generated
    using Monte Carlo simulation stratified by applying Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).
    One hundred best performing parameter combinations were selected for each model
    to generate spatial recharge statistics and assess the resulting uncertainty in
    the recharge estimates. The results revealed that enhanced spatial recharge estimates
    can be produced through improved CHIRP-based SREs. The long-term mean annual recharge
    (218.29 mm) in the Tikur-Wuha watershed was estimated. Model parameter calibration
    performed using discharge measurements obtained from the Wosha rain gauge station
    located in the subcatchment area of the Tikur-Wuha watershed had a Nash-Sutcliffe
    efficiency of 0.56. Seventy percent of the watershed showed a coefficient of variation
    (Cv) < 0.15 for M2, while 90 % of the area exhibited a Cv < 0.15 for M1. Furthermore,
    the study findings highlighted the importance of improving evapotranspiration
    data accuracy to reduce the uncertainty of recharge estimates. However, the uncontrolled
    irrigation water uses and the total recharge coming from the irrigation fields
    scattered across the Tikur-Wuha watershed were not considered in the study, which
    is a limitation of the study. Future studies should consider the contribution
    made by irrigation water to the total recharge of the watershed.

    Keywords GroundwaterRechargeUncertaintyWetSpaTikur-wuha 1. Introduction Sustainable
    water resources management requires the modeling of hydrological cycle components
    with minimum error. One key component of the water cycle is the estimation of
    groundwater recharge. However, in hydrogeological modeling, various sources can
    cause estimation uncertainties. The main sources of estimation uncertainties are
    the input, structure, and the parameters of the model used [1]. Groundwater recharge,
    variable both spatially and temporally, is highly influenced by climate variables,
    land use/cover, and soil distribution [2]. Among the three influencing factors,
    climate variables and land use/cover, considered as direct inputs in most hydrological
    modeling approaches, are temporal variables, and thus an in-depth assessment of
    their contribution to uncertainties in groundwater recharge estimation has become
    necessary. Considering the significant contribution made by input data to groundwater
    recharge estimation uncertainties, Ampe et al. (2012), investigated recharge estimation
    uncertainties using two land-use classification methods [3]. Their study findings
    revealed that the recharge estimates produced for the Woluwe river catchment in
    Belgium based on pixel-based land-use classifications are more uncertain compared
    with those produced using region-based classifications [3]. Abraham et al. (2022)
    who studied the wetland-dominated Tikur-Wuha watershed explored the uncertainty
    and sensitivity associated with land-use maps [4]. In their study, wetland parameter
    was introduced in the Soil Water Assessment Tool with Calibration and Uncertainty
    Program (SWAT-CUP), a hydrological model, through which the uncertainties because
    of land-use maps were quantified using the sequential uncertainty fitting interval
    algorithm SUFI-2. The study proved that the quality of groundwater recharge estimation
    can be improved by considering multiple land-use maps to ensure that land use/cover
    changes are incorporated. Ampe et al. (2012) and Zomlot et al. (2017) also made
    similar conclusions [3,5]. The uncertainty of recharge from irrigation fields
    and canals along with six other parameters was investigated by Baker et al. (2022)
    [6]. The findings indicated that 91 % of the aquifer recharge was contributed
    by irrigation water from rice fields and leakage from canals. The impact of the
    evapotranspiration time series on the uncertainty in recharge was studied by Xie
    et al. (2018) [7]. The study revealed that recharge uncertainty can be reduced
    by up to 50 % for improved evapotranspiration observations and that an insignificant
    reduction in recharge estimation could be obtained by using distributed soil moisture
    time-series data. Other hydrological simulations can also be performed using satellite-based
    evapotranspiration estimates [8]. Dile, Yihun T et al. (2020) emphasized that
    data scarce areas could particularly benefit from using satellite estimates because
    of reduced errors [8]. Duan et al. (2019) showed that the performance of satellite-based
    estimates are low when compared to performance of evenly and adequately collected
    temperature and precipitation ground records [9]. Spatial recharge estimation
    uncertainty is directly proportional to the uncertainty in precipitation data
    used in the estimation process [7,10,11]. The statistical characteristics of rainfall
    and reference evapotranspiration dataset used in recharge estimation were studied
    by Turkeltaub and Bel (2023) for the semiarid climate regions in China and Israel
    [12]. The findings indicated that spatial local rainfall and the reference evapotranspiration
    dataset can significantly influence recharge estimation [12]. Thus, improved spatial
    precipitation estimates can minimize the uncertainties in recharge estimations.
    The availability of improved spatial precipitation data, such as those obtained
    through radar, rain gauge observations, satellite observations, and reanalysis
    products, is increasing significantly [13,14]. The importance of using satellite
    rainfall products for minimizing hydrological modeling errors has been assessed
    in previous studies [15,16]. Such assessments are particularly important for complimenting
    the scanty observation made in developing countries [17]. Rainfall records are
    scarce in Ethiopia and are mostly available for locations along the main road
    routes [17,18]. Development activities requiring quality rainfall records are
    hindered in rural areas because of the scarcity or unavailability of accurate
    rainfall records [18,19]. Satellite technology developments in the past few decades
    have contributed for improving the observation and measurement of several meteorological
    parameters. Nevertheless, eliminating the errors in most meteorological measurements
    is challenging. However, merging multiple sources of records will help capture
    the merits of each source and thereby reduce the errors in groundwater recharge
    estimations [20]. Previous studies [4,21,22] have shown that agricultural land
    use/cover of the Tikur-Wuha watershed has increased significantly. This once wetland-dominated
    watershed is now losing its coverage to grasslands and agriculture. A recent study
    by Abraham et al. (2022) showed that median annual recharge in Tikur-Wuha has
    reduced from 506.25 to 483.34 mm [4]. Thus, urgent changes to water resources
    management regulations and practices supported by accurate estimates of groundwater
    recharge have become necessary. Multiple studies [21,[23], [24], [25], [26]] have
    quantified the recharge to the aquifers of the Hawassa watershed. However, the
    discrepancies in the recharge estimates presented in those studies show a high
    level of uncertainty in the recharge estimations. Thus, the main objective of
    this study was to assess the uncertainty in the recharge estimation using improved
    spatial rainfall observations. In the study, a bias-corrected satellite rainfall
    product based on Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRP) was used
    along with ground observations, and the rainfall records available were converted
    to areal rainfall records using the conventional Thiessen polygon method. 2. Study
    area description 2.1. Location and topography The Tikur-Wuha watershed covers
    an area of 670 km2. It is the only perennial river flowing into Lake Hawassa.
    Steep mountain ranges cover the northeastern and southeastern parts of the watershed,
    while gently sloping land covers the north–west to south–west parts of the watershed.
    Nine perennial streams feed the wetland located at the center of the watershed
    and the Tikur-Wuha river drains to Lake Hawassa through that wetland (Fig. 1).

    Fig. 1. Location map of the study area. The Tikur-Wuha watershed is located at
    6°48′00″–7°10′00″N latitude and 38°26′30″–38°43′00″E longitude. It is at an elevation
    between 1643 and 2976 m above mean sea level. According to Mohammed et al. (2020),
    54 % and 21.6 % of the Tikur-Wuha watershed have slopes ranging from 8 % to 30
    %, and 3 %–8 %, respectively, while 3 % and 19 % of the watershed have slopes
    <3 % and >30 %, respectively [27]. 2.2. Climate and hydrology 2.2.1. Climate The
    Tikur-Wuha catchment has a tropical subhumid climate (Moist Weyna Dega). Its mean
    annual rainfall ranges from 954.5 mm in its western and northwestern parts (low
    lands) to 1152.5 mm in its southeastern part (mountainous section of the catchment).
    As reported by Belete et al. (2017), up to 70 % of the annual rainfall in Ethiopia
    occurs when the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) lies over northern and southern
    Ethiopia from June to September [28]. The seasonal rainfall cycle, characterized
    as a bimodal cycle [29], is mainly controlled by the movement of the ITCZ [28].
    The seasonal rainfall in the watershed can be quantified as follows: Thirty percent
    of the annual rainfall occurs between March and May with the seasons from June
    to September and October to February contributing 50 % and 20 % of the rainfall,
    respectively [28]. The average maximum and minimum temperatures of the watershed
    range from 11 to 20 °C, and the hottest dry month of the watershed is March [30].
    2.2.2. Hydrology Tikur-Wuha subwatershed is located within the geographically
    closed watershed of Lake Hawassa, where uncontrolled irrigation practices are
    on the increase. The Tikur-Wuha river feeds Lake Hawassa and the water from the
    Tikur-Wuha watershed meets the water requirements of households, livestock, irrigation,
    industries, and the environment. Nine streams, namely Bele-Lango, Wesha, Werka,
    Hallo, Shenkora, Gomesho, Wedesa, Abosa, and Gelchacha, flow through the Tikur-Wuha
    watershed, which drains to the Cheleleka wetland [31]. The aggravated land cover
    changes have resulted in the disappearance of one lake within the Cheleleka wetland
    [32]. The Cheleleka wetland exhibits flow stabilizing properties by serving as
    an intermediary between the upper catchments of the nine rivers, where the water
    flow is rapid, and the Tikur-Wuha river, where the water flow is slow. The wetland
    receives the water from the nine streams and channels it to one outlet to feed
    the Tikur-Wuha river, which then drains into Lake Hawassa. The watershed outlet
    is located at the Tikur-Wuha bridge. The watershed covers an area of 645.75 km2,
    and the estimated average annual flow of the river for the period between 1987
    and 1996 is 132.6 mm, calculated by dividing the average annual stream flow volume
    by the total area of the watershed [4,29]. 2.3. Land use and soil Studies focusing
    on land use/cover classifications have shown that since the year 2000 -, a majority
    of the watersheds have become cropland used for small scale plantations, rain-fed
    crop fields, and perennial cash crops. According to Wondrade et al. (2014), between
    1973 and 2011, the cropland coverage has increased by 12.8 % [32]. Other major
    types of land use/cover in the watershed includes grasslands, wetland, forests,
    urban areas, and shrub land. Most of the forest cover is in the escarpments, and
    the rift floor is covered with wet land, grasslands, and cropland. A significant
    change that has occurred in the land use/cover dynamics is the disappearance of
    Lake Cheleleka, which covered 1300 ha [32]. The disappearance of Lake Cheleleka
    can be attributed to environmental degradation due to extensive deforestation,
    climate change, and other anthropogenic stressors [32]. However, no studies have
    been conducted to particularly investigate the real causes that led to the disappearance
    of the lake. In general, 73.4 % of the watershed has experienced land use/cover
    changes between the years 1972 and 2017 [33]. The soil map of the watershed (Fig.
    3) indicates that sand, clay loam, sandy loam, and silt soil cover 17.24 %, 24.78
    %, 51.01 %, and 17.10 % of the watershed, respectively. According to Mohammed
    et al. (2020), Leptosol, Vertic cambisol, Vertic Luvisol, Vitric Andosol, Haplic
    Luvisol, and Eutric Cambisol are the major types of soil found in the Tikur-Wuha
    watershed with Vertic Luvisol and Haplic Luvisol dominating 39.6 % and 39.2 %
    of the watershed, respectively [27]. The geological map of the study area (Fig.
    2) shows the presence of densely populated normal faults in the southeastern part
    of the watershed. The drainage pattern of the study area (Fig. 1) overlaid on
    its geological map showing fault lines (Fig. 2) indicates that most of the fault
    lines intersect the main drainage lines to form point recharges, which have the
    potential to increase surface flow interception. Ayenew and Tilahun (2008) argued
    that simulations conducted during severe faulting should consider fractured volcanic
    aquifers as porous mediums, enabling the heavily fractured regions to exhibit
    high hydraulic conductivities [23]. Their study also highlighted that the existing
    fault structures and newly emerging cracks have the potential to create point
    recharges. Download : Download high-res image (523KB) Download : Download full-size

    has as its inputs such as land-use map, soil map, digital elevation model (DEM)
    and hydrometeorological data. Because the aim of this study was to assess the
    recharge estimation uncertainties associated with rainfall data, two sets of rainfall
    records were used. The first rainfall record set contained point observations
    made using rain gauges located in and around the watershed, whereas the second
    rainfall record set was obtained by combining the satellite rainfall product CHIRP
    with station data and available ground station records. Table 1. Input data sets

    3.1.1. Meteorological data The required meteorological parameters were gathered
    from the stations located near the Lake Hawassa watershed. Daily meteorological
    records of two synoptic meteorological stations, two ordinary meteorological stations,
    and eight rain gauges were obtained from the National Ethiopian Meteorological
    Agency. Synoptic meteorological stations measure precipitation, wind speed, sunshine
    duration, maximum and minimum air temperatures, and relative humidity, at 15 min
    intervals. Alternatively, ordinary meteorological stations record only the precipitation,
    and maximum and minimum air temperatures. The remaining stations provide only
    the precipitation records. The freely available CHIRP was downloaded from https://data.chc.ucsb.edu.
    It is a satellite rainfall product that provides daily rainfall estimates at a
    grid scale of 0.05° [34]. A merged rainfall dataset was prepared based on the
    records obtained from 11 stations [35]. However, records from only five stations
    were available for the year 2005, while records from only eight stations were
    available for the year 2006. Furthermore, for estimating the areal rainfall in
    the Tikur-Wuha watershed using the conventional Thiessen polygon method, the records
    from only four stations located in and around the watershed were used. Grubbs
    and Beck test, Mann–Whitney test, Wald-Wolfowitz test, and double mass analysis
    were used to assess the outliers, homogeneity and stationarity, independence and
    stationarity, and consistency, respectively, of the meteorological data records.
    The rainfall data obtained from the Hawassa and Shashemene stations exhibited
    only slight deviations from the historical record, whereas the rainfall data obtained
    from the Wateraresa station exhibited significant deviations from the historical
    record requiring corrections for consistency. Other quality tests were also conducted
    on sample data obtained from each station to ascertain the daily maximum air temperatures,
    and their annual values. The tests conducted for independency, homogeneity, and
    stationarity indicated that the data obtained were homogeneous and independent.
    The arithmetic mean method was used to fill missing data records. Moreover, based
    on the results of analyzing the quality of rainfall data obtained from different
    stations, rainfall records obtained from the Shashemene station were not considered
    in the modeling process. Evapotranspiration time-series data were also required
    by the WetSpa model used to simulate stream flow. The assessment results of the
    meteorological records of the stations in and around the watershed indicated that
    temperature-based evapotranspiration estimates would effectively represent the
    spatial variability of evapotranspiration. Accordingly, a simple temperature method
    (Eq. (1)) developed by Enku and Melesse (2014) was used to estimate evapotranspiration
    [36]. However, because of the differences in the time periods over which the data
    from different stations were recorded, only temperature data obtained from the
    Hawassa, Wateraressa, and Kofele stations were used in the estimation. (1) where
    is the reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), is the maximum daily temperature
    (oC), n is a coefficient equal to 2.5, and k is a coefficient, equal to 48*T_mm-330,
    73*T_mm-1015, and 38*T_mm-63 for dry and wet seasons combined, dry seasons, and
    wet seasons, respectively. is the long-term daily mean maximum temperature for
    the seasons under consideration (oC), where is calculated by taking the maximum
    of long-term daily mean temperature records for a specified season. 3.1.2. Spatial
    datasets A 30-m resolution DEM was sourced from http://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/gdex/and
    resampled to a 32-m resolution to be fed to the WetSpa model. The other spatial
    inputs fed to the model included the soil and land use/cover maps of the watershed.
    The soil map of the Tikur-Wuha watershed (Fig. 3) was obtained from the Ethiopian
    Institute of Geological Surveys. The land use/cover map was prepared using LandSat-8
    images for 2014 and classified using Google Earth Engine. Although the land-use
    map of the watershed has significantly changed since 2014, it was assumed to be
    applicable to the simulation period from 2005 to 2014. The pixel resolution of
    the land use/cover raster map and reference systems of all spatial datasets were
    kept constant. A pixel resolution of 32 m was used in the land use/cover raster
    map and a Universal TransverseMercator (UTM) Zone 37 N was used as the reference
    system for the land use/cover spatial datasets. 3.1.3. Stream flow datasets As
    already explained, the Tikur-Wuha watershed has nine streams feeding the Cheleleka
    wetland. However, only two hydrological gauging stations are available at the
    Tikur-Wuha watershed. Two gauging stations are located at the Tikur-Wuha river,
    downstream of the Cheleleka wetland. The first Tikur-Wuha river gauging station
    is stationed at the bridge near the inlet of Lake Hawassa and the second Tikur-Wuha
    river gauging station, called Dato-village station, is located upstream of the
    bridge. The rainfall records of the first gauging station are available for the
    year preceding 2005. During peak flood periods, the back flow from the lake affects
    the stream flow records. Currently, the area where the bridge is located is completely
    covered with vegetation, making the gauging station nonfunctional. However, the
    back water flowing from the lake during peak flood seasons does not reach the
    Dato-village station. Thus, the back flow will have no effect on the records maintained
    at the Dato-village station. The physical inspection of the station location and
    analysis of the back water effects, which is not presented here, indicate that
    the Dato-village station has not been affected by back water during flooding seasons.
    Thus, the discharge records of the Dato-village station were used in this study
    for calibration purposes. Discharge records were also available at the Worka and
    Wosha stations situated in the Tikur-Wuha subwatershed. The discharge measurements
    have been made at the Worka station only in the year preceding 2005, and thus
    had to be disregarded. Thus, the records maintained at the Wosha station (Fig.
    4) were used for the calibration of parameters along with the records of the Dato-village
    station. Download : Download high-res image (494KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Discharge time-series data. Although the Wosha River is a tributary
    of the Tikur-Wuha river, the flow patterns of the two rivers vary, determined
    by comparing their flow records. The in-depth observation of the discharge time
    series (Fig. 4) revealed that the peak and low flows are not similar in some sections
    of the records, as indicated by the red circles in Fig. 4. Additionally, the sharp
    fall of the falling limb and sharp rise of the rising limb, of the Tikur-Wuha
    river hydrograph makes the modeling challenging to capture the flow pattern fully.
    3.2. Methods 3.2.1. General method Uncertainties of the rainfall data were first
    quantified by creating two separate model setups. This quantification was achieved
    by having similar inputs to the selected hydrological models and by changing the
    input rainfall time series. The input time series to the first model setup (M1),
    prepared from the available rain gauge records, was subsequently converted into
    areal rainfall by using the Thiessen polygon. The rainfall data fed to the second
    model setup (M2) were prepared by applying first-order bias correction (using
    empirical parametric quantile mapping) to the CHIRP-based SREs followed by their
    merging with the available rain gauge data using a conditional merging technique.
    In the next step, the global parameters of the two hydrological models were set
    based on prior watershed knowledge and literature review findings. Monte Carlo
    simulation in conjunction with Latin Hypercube Hampling was conducted to generate
    10,000 possible parameters (i.e., WetSpa model parameters) using R programming.
    A second semidistributed model simulation using all possible parameter combinations
    in each model setup was performed to determine model performance in terms of root
    mean squared error (RMSE) and percent error of volume (PVE). In the third step,
    the long-term mean recharge was quantified for each accepted model realization
    followed by analysis of the statistical long-term mean recharge distribution.
    Only daily time-step simulation could be conducted for 10 consecutive years (2005–2014)
    because of the scarcity of overlapping hydrometeorological data. From the accepted
    model realizations, 100 best parameter combinations were selected and a distributed
    model simulation was performed using each model setup. The 100 recharge maps obtained
    from each model setup were then used to obtain spatial statistics and related
    uncertainties of the recharge estimations. A fully distributed simulation model
    was expected to run 1,113,264 analyses for a 32-m resolution map. A computer with
    128 GB RAM and 9 processors took 24 h to complete a single run. Thus, the number
    of simulations that could be performed was limited owing to computer capacity
    constraints. Furthermore, Xie et al. (2018) shows that 10,000 simulations run
    with each model setup would ensure acceptable variability in parameter combinations
    [7]. The simulations run with each semidistributed model setup were automated
    using Python programming, whereas only manual simulations were run with the fully
    distributed model. The semidistributed model simulation produced water balance
    components at a daily time step, whereas the fully distributed model simulation
    produced a gridded recharge map for a 10-year simulation period. Thus, the long-term
    mean annual recharge had to be determined for each semidistributed model simulation
    by first aggregating the daily recharge for each year and then averaging it, for
    the fully distributed model simulation, each cell was divided by the length of
    the simulation period to obtain the mean annual recharge for each simulation.
    3.2.2. Land use/cover classification From the LandSat-8 image of the study area,
    the land-use map of the area was developed for the year 2014 by employing supervised
    classification using Google Earth Engine, freely available at https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/classification.
    The supervised classification procedure involves screening images for cloud cover,
    correcting them for surface reflectance, identifying training points (ground truth
    points) for each land-use type, and finally classifying the land use. The selected
    training points were randomly split into two sets as calibration and validation
    sets, and the SMILE Random Forest classifier [37] provided in the Google Earth
    Engine was used for land-use classification. The adopted code used used to compute
    the training and validation accuracies. A confusion matrix representing substitution
    accuracy was produced and the Kappa coefficient was calculated to assess the land-use
    classification accuracy [38]. 3.2.3. WetSpa model A hydrological simulation was
    conducted using a physically based distributed hydrological model and the water
    and energy transfers between soil, plants, and atmosphere (WetSpa) were predicted
    at a daily time step. The WetSpa extension [39], a GIS-based distributed watershed
    model, was employed in this study. WetSpa simulates the hydrological processes
    (precipitation, interception, snowmelt, depression, infiltration, evapotranspiration,
    percolation, surface runoff, interflow, and groundwater flow) for each grid cell
    by dividing the hydrological system into four control volumes: plant canopy, soil
    surface, root zone, and groundwater aquifer [39]. The hydrological simulation
    performed using the WetSpa extension can generally be achieved in three stages.
    The first stage involves the determination of the local variables based on gridded
    DEM, soil map, and land-use map. This step was conducted using ArcView 3.2 software.
    All local variables were predetermined based on the information provided in the
    three base maps. Liu and De Smedt (2004) provide a detailed description of the
    preparation and running of the WetSpa extension [39]. In the second stage, the
    external executable is run with the extension providing a choice of fully distributed
    and semidistributed models. The point rainfall records required by the WetSpa
    model were obtained from the rain gauge stations located in and around the targeted
    watershed. The point rainfall records were converted to areal rainfall estimates
    using the Thiessen polygon method. When running the fully distributed model, the
    developed Thiessen polygon map is converted to a raster map, where the station
    number is the cell value. In this study, for the M1 model setup, a similar procedure
    was followed to create the Thiessen polygon map using the available rain gauge
    stations. In the M2 model setup, each grid cell center was assumed to represent
    a rain gauge station and the grid map was considered the Thiessen polygon. 3.2.4.
    WetSpa parameter range WetSpa simulations (Fig. 5) are conducted at cell level,
    and thus for each cell, all local parameters have to be determined. A 32 x 32
    resolution produced a grid mesh area with 859 columns and 1296 rows for the watershed.
    Default local parameters were determined by the WetSpa extension based on the
    input soil texture class, land-use type, and physiographic characteristics of
    each cell. All default parameters were retained except for the root depth of the
    forest, which was changed from 1 to 5 m considering the dominant presence of Eucalypts
    in the watershed forest cover. Similar changes were made by Yenehun et al. (2022)
    and Yenehun et al. (2020) when they applied WetSpass simulations to the Lake Tana
    basin and Gilgel Abay watershed, respectively [40,41]. Download : Download high-res
    image (296KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. WetSpa simulation at
    grid cell level [39]. Eleven global parameters (Table 2) were used to calibrate
    the model that simulated runoff hydrograph at Tikur-Wuha watershed outlet [39].
    Three of the parameters, namely base snowmelt temperature (To), temperature degree-day
    coefficient (k-snow), and rainfall degree-day coefficient (k-rain), were used
    to control the snow melt [42]. For regions with no snowing, each of these parameters
    can be set to −1.0 [39]. Similar adjustments were made by Kidanemariam et al.
    (2021) presuming that no significant snow formation occurred in the targeted basin
    [43]. The ability to adjust slightly sensitive or insensitive parameters comes
    as an added advantage when narrowing down the feasible parameter range [44]. The
    initial soil moisture condition (K-s), which affects only the initialization period
    of the simulation, is also a slightly sensitive parameter [42]. Table 2. WetSpa
    global parameter ranges. Parameter Range Description Ki 1.5–2.2 Seasonally vegetated
    farm lands and commercial mixed forest are the dominant land covers Kg 0.0001–0.0003
    Based on the recession curve of observed hydrograph K-s 1.0–1.2 Assuming up to
    20 % influence of initial soil moisture condition K-ep 0.65–0.95 Based on the
    assumption that can represent seasonal variability g0 1000–1900 Based on the observed
    annual rainfall amount g-max 1000–5100 Based on the assumed maximum root depth
    k-run 7.5–10.5 The observed hydrograph has low noises P-max 100–200 Based on the
    maximum observed rainfall and error factors Other parameters can also be assigned
    to the model, based on the physical and meteorological characteristics of the
    targeted watershed [44]. Accordingly, the base flow recession curve coefficient
    (Kg) can be determined from the slope of the master curve of the recession limbs;
    observed precipitation can be used to determine the feasible range of the correction
    factors used for maximum precipitation (P-max), potential evapotranspiration (K-ep),
    and surface runoff exponent for a zero rainfall intensity (k-run). Moreover, the
    cumulative flow curve can indicate the feasible maximum groundwater level (g-max),
    while the annual rainfall can indicate initial ground water storage (g0) [42].
    Finally, the scaling factor for the inter flow (Ki) could be set by considering
    the most dominant land-use class of the watershed [42]. 3.3. Performance measures
    Choosing statistical performance indicators in a study is highly subjective and
    should be orientated based on the intended purpose of the study [45]. The performance
    of each simulation model was determined using the daily stream flow at the watershed
    outlet. The estimated evapotranspiration was also used as a performance measure.
    The two statistical performance measures RMSE and PVE were also used. The range
    of the PVE is from –∞ to +∞. The results falling within the range between −10
    % and +10 % indicate satisfactory performance, whereas the results falling outside
    that range indicates poor performance, with 0 representing perfect performance.
    PVE (Eq. (2)), which considers the computed volume, does not account for the peak
    magnitude as indicated below. (2) where: PVE is the percentage error in volume,
    is the observed volume, and is the simulated volume. The error variation between
    raw and bias-corrected SREs and ground observation can be indicated by the RMSE,
    which falls within the range between 0 and ∞. If the RMSE (RMSE; Eq. (3)) is close
    to zero, performance would be quite satisfactory and vice versa. The mathematical
    representation of the RMSE is as follows: (3) where are the simulated results
    and ground based observations, at day i, respectively; and n is the total number
    of available data pairs. After calculating the performance measures for each model
    iteration (10,000 iterations for each of the model setups M1 and M2), model realizations
    having a PVE less than 10 % were accepted for further analysis. The errors introduced
    by factors such as human errors, during stream depth measurements are unavoidable.
    Thus, a 10 % error margin, which makes model realization with ±20 % PVE for discharge
    is acceptable, was considered. Additional cut-off criteria were set because the
    RMSEs of some model realizations were as high as 110 % of the minimum RMSE. Calibration
    procedures can help to narrow down the parameter range applicable to a given watershed.
    Thus, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE; Eq. (4)) was implemented during model calibration.
    When NSE is 1, it indicates a perfectly fitting model [45]. (4) where −  is the
    observed value during the time interval; is the simulated value during the time
    interval; is the mean of the observed parameter; and n is the total number of
    observations. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Meteorological data analysis A meteorological
    data analysis was conducted for the study duration, which was from 2005 to 2015.
    A preanalysis of the obtained meteorological time-series dataset indicated that
    the mean annual rainfalls at the Hawassa, Wendo-Genet, Kofele, and Wateraressa
    stations are 954.54, 1069, 1074, and 1152 mm, respectively. The temperature records
    of the Hawassa station reveal that the mean daily maximum temperature at the station
    is more than the corresponding temperatures at the Kofele and Wateraressa stations,
    located within mountain ranges, by up to 10 °C. The evapotranspiration calculated
    from the available temperature data (Table 3) show a mean annual evapotranspiration
    (Fig. 6) of 1608.5, 721.5, and 953.5 mm at the Hawassa, Kofele and Wateraressa

    evapotranspiration from the study area. The conventional methods used in previous
    studies [4,21,41] to represent the spatial distribution of rainfall have mainly
    depended on the Thiessen polygon. These conventional methods are prone to error
    propagation in areas within a watershed that are sparsely represented by rain
    gauge stations, as is the case with the Tikur-Wuha watershed. As Fig. 7 shows,
    the map prepared from the merged product obtained by combining CHIRP and rain
    gauge records (Fig. 7(A)) is considerably different from the areal rainfall map
    created employing the Thiessen polygon (Fig. 7(B)) for the four rain gauge stations.
    This type of map discrepancies can have a huge impact on hydrological simulations.
    Improved spatial rainfall records or representations would significantly enhance
    the accuracy of recharge estimations, recharge being directly proportional to
    rainfall. The improvement is indicated by the sharp edges of the recharge map
    (Fig. 13), similar to the grids of CHIRP-based SREs and the rainfall zones produced
    by the Thiessen polygon (Fig. 7). The sections that follow provide additional
    details on the effects of each model input. Download : Download high-res image

    the sensitivity of recharge estimations can be influenced by land-use maps has
    been the subject of several previous studies [3,4], which have found that the
    careful consideration of land-use map could enhance the sensitivity of recharge
    estimations. Hence, after considering the influence of the sensitivity of recharge
    estimations on land-use maps, a land-use map of the study area (Fig. 8) was developed
    for the year 2014. The training and validation accuracies achieved for land-use
    classification were 0.965 and 0.864 respectively. Download : Download high-res

    21.35 % of this area is covered by mixed forest. According to the land classification
    performed by Mohammed et al. (2020), in the year 2017, 46.6 % and 23.6 % of the
    total area of the watershed were cultivated land and forest cover, respectively
    [27]. Abraham et al. (2022) found that in the year 2017, 58.62 % and 25.5 % of
    the watershed area were covered by cultivations and forest [4]. Table 4. Confusion

    model calibration was performed at the Dato-village and Wosha stream gauge stations.
    A widely accepted practice is to calibrate a given model using multiple gauge
    data. Stream gauge data are available at the outlet of the Tikur-Wuha river and
    its tributaries. Hence, in this study, the model calibration was performed using
    the gauge records of the Tikur-Wuha river outlet and the data collected from a
    tributary located downstream of the Wosha subwatershed. Nevertheless, the NSE
    (0.28) of the calibration performed at the Dato-village station was poor. To improve
    the calibration results of the Dato-village station, possible parameter combinations
    were explored. Additionally, the implementation of strategies such as removing
    peak values from the observed discharge time-series data and changing the simulation
    time periods were investigated. However, the maximum NSE obtained was 0.28. By
    contrast, the NSE of the calibration made at the hydrological station, located
    downstream of Wosha, was 0.56. Despite the calibration discrepancies, no attempt
    was made to transfer the calibration results obtained from the Wosha subwatershed
    gauge station to the Tikur-Wuha watershed gauge station. The estimated long-term
    mean annual recharge obtained from the semidistributed simulation model with parameters
    calibrated for the Wosha subwatershed, was 218.29 mm. The long-term mean annual
    recharge obtained using the fully distributed simulation model with similar parameters
    ranged from 0.24 to 579.96 mm. In Fig. 4, a significant mismatch can be observed
    between the measured stream records obtained from the two discharge gauging stations.
    Another significant variation is difference in the range of recharge obtained
    from model parameter calibration using the two discharge records. The runoff in
    the study area increases as the recharge rate decreases (Fig. 9) according to
    the results of the model calibrated using Wosha discharge data; the mean discharge
    is three times the mean discharge measured at the Dato-village station. Ayenew
    and Tilahun (2008) argued that fault structures significantly enhance the recharge
    at the floor of a caldera [23]. Another argument is that the contribution made
    by the wetland to watershed water balance cannot be disregarded when assessing
    the recharge [4]. In depicting the effects of various land-use classes on water
    balance component modeling, implementing separate values for the local parameters
    of each land-use class would be helpful. The WetSpa model uses permanent wetland,
    a main land cover class, to calculate the local parameter values. Thus, the impact
    of wetland on the simulated recharge was properly considered. The WetSpa model
    does not considers point recharge and/or wetland contribution to recharge as concentrated
    seepage through existing fault structures. This limitation can cause recharge
    estimation challenging. Download : Download high-res image (526KB) Download :

    obtained using Wosha station records. The discrepancies between the recharge magnitudes
    obtained from the two models calibrated using the Wosha and Dato-village records
    can be attributed to several factors. However, while the magnitude of recharge
    rises in an effort to match the discharge size at Dato-village, it falls as the
    flow rate at Wosha station is more accurately estimated. Because fault structures
    exist between the two record stations, point recharges can therefore be considered
    the primary sources of recharge. 4.4. Recharge uncertainty 4.4.1. Semidistributed
    model simulation As already explained, the difference between the M1 and M2 model
    setups is in their input rainfall datasets. Thus, land-use local parameters, soil
    hydraulic parameters, meteorological input datasets used in each model run are
    same except for the rainfall time-series data. In obtaining the merged rainfall
    dataset, the original cell size of the CHIRP-based SRE was considered for all
    rainfall regions. The resulting map had 37 raster cells (0.05° x 0.05°) with own
    rainfall records. Each grid cell center was assumed to have its own station record,
    which was fed to the simulation model. The M1 model set up that simulated 10,000
    parameter combinations, produced a mean annual recharge in the range of 392.03–549.3
    mm, whereas semidistributed M2 model simulating 10,000 parameter combinations
    produced a mean annual recharge in the range of 316.4–474.9 mm. The results indicate
    the impacts of input rainfall estimation uncertainties. The large difference between
    the minimum and maximum simulated recharge values indicates the uncertainty of
    recharge estimates. The iteration results obtained from the M1 model setup demonstrated
    that both RMSE (Fig. 10(d)) and model volume error (MVE) (Fig. 10(c)) increased
    as the mean annual recharge increased (Fig. 10). The iteration results of the
    M2 model set up show that RMSE (Fig. 10(b)) increases and MVE (Fig. 10(a)) decreases
    as the mean annual recharge increases; condensed values can be seen in the middle
    sections of the plots. The RMSE values obtained for 10,000 simulations performed
    using the M2 and M1 setups were in the ranges of 0.8–2.57 m3/s and 0.8–3.27 m3/s,
    respectively. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size

    M1 (c & d) and M2 (a & b) model setups. The results obtained from both model setups
    indicated that the long-term mean annual recharge was in the range of 370–430
    mm. The RMSE values obtained from the M1 model setup are densely distributed at
    low values of the long-term mean annual recharge, while the RMSE values obtained
    from the M2 model setup are dispersed at the beginning and end of the X-axis depicting
    long-term mean annual recharge values. An exhaustive search of random parameter
    combinations that will ensure performance measure convergence, guided by a literature
    review and expert knowledge of the hydroclimatic characteristics of the watershed
    have helped to explore the global ranges of each parameter. This predefined ranges
    of the parameter values were used at the start to randomly generate possible parameter
    combinations. The use of Monte Carlo simulation in conjunction with Latin Hypercube
    Sampling to generate possible parameter combinations has helped to ensure that
    the parameters were properly distributed in the given parameter space. The plot
    of evapotranspiration coefficient (K-ep) against recharge (Fig. 11) shows an inverse
    correlation between the mean annual recharge and K-ep; that is, the mean annual
    recharge decreases as K-ep increases. As K-ep increases, PVE also increases. This
    correlation indicates the importance of obtaining accurate evapotranspiration
    estimates. Thus, we can conclude that improved estimates of evapotranspiration
    can reduce the uncertainty of recharge estimations. Download : Download high-res

    distributed simulation The fully distributed simulation model available with the
    WetSpa extension generates the recharge accumulated in a targeted basin over the
    simulation period, taken as 10 years in this study. The average of the long-term
    recharge obtained from 100 best spatial recharge maps produced by the M1 model
    set up (Fig. 12 (A)) is significantly different from that generated using the
    M2 model setup. The model outputs depend on the input rainfall maps. Additionally,
    the highest and lowest long-term mean recharge is different for M1 and M2, where
    recharge estimates of M2 are greater than M1. CHIRP-based SREs are noted for their
    overestimated rainfall values [13,17], which have been reflected in the highest
    recharge estimate produced by the M2 model setup. According to Beyene et al. (2023),
    the raw CHIRP rainfall estimates show a false alarm ratio as high as 50 %, indicating
    a noticeable increase in the depth of estimated rainfall values. Various bias
    correction techniques can be applied to reduce the inaccuracies present in volume
    estimations. A multistage bias correction strategy [35] has improved the PVE of
    CHIRP-based SREs by up to 70 %. The overestimation can be decreased by using other
    bias correction techniques available. The two images shown below indicate the
    substantial spatial heterogeneity of the two standard deviation (STDEV) maps (Fig.
    12). Download : Download high-res image (684KB) Download : Download full-size

    : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Long-term mean annual recharge map of M1 (A)
    and M2 (B) model setups. Another strategy used to analyze the uncertainty in recharge
    estimations was to observe the STDEV of the selected 100 model realizations obtained
    from each model setup. A low STDEV indicates low uncertainty, while a high STDEV
    indicates high uncertainty in the estimations. The results show that merged SREs
    produce recharge maps with low uncertainty. The plots pertaining to the M1 model
    setup shown on the left (Fig. 12(A)) indicate a maximum STDEV of 1156.25 mm with
    most of the areas in the study area having high STDEV values. The plots pertaining
    to the M2 model set up (Fig. 12(B)) exhibit the highest STDEV in a small part
    of the watershed. The M1 model setup plots indicate that most areas of the watershed
    have high values of uncertainty. By dividing the long-term average recharge by
    10, the number of years in the simulation period, the mean annual long-term recharge
    map of the study area can be obtained (Fig. 13). From the maps, the impact on
    recharge magnitudes and spatial distributions due to rainfall and evapotranspiration
    can be observed. Fig. 13 shows a pattern similar to the Thiessen polygon map (Fig.
    6) developed using the evapotranspiration records obtained from monitoring stations.
    The pattern indicates that evapotranspiration has a significant impact on recharge
    estimation. From the long-term mean annual recharge maps shown in Fig. 13, the
    continuous impact caused by evapotranspiration can be observed. The western flat
    lands (Fig. 8), dominated by crop land, of the watershed, exhibited a low recharge
    magnitude (Fig. 13 (A, B)), whereas eastern mountain ranges exhibited high recharge
    magnitudes. According to previous studies where similar procedures were followed
    [7], model calibrations performed to determine possible parameter ranges can decrease
    the uncertainty in recharge estimations. However, this study relied on uncalibrated
    parameter ranges, determined based on literature and prior information related
    to the watershed. Thus, the output recharge map would not indicate the true or
    near true values of the recharge in the watershed. Nonetheless, the results have
    illustrated the important role played by spatial rainfall distributions in recharge
    estimations. The coefficient of variation (Cv) values obtained from the 100 best
    recharge maps produced by the M1 model set up (Fig. 14) indicated more consistent
    recharge estimations compared with the corresponding values obtained by the M2
    model setup. The highest uncertainty in recharge estimations was observed in the
    wetland-dominated part of the watershed. Abraham et al. (2022) also observed a
    similar high recharge variability in the wetland-dominated part of the watershed
    [4]. Seventy percent of the watershed showed a Cv < 0.15 for the M2 model setup
    (Fig. 14(B)), while 90 % of the watershed exhibited a Cv < 0.15 for the M1 model
    setup (Fig. 14(A)). Download : Download high-res image (502KB) Download : Download

    by Abraham et al. (2022) using the calibrated soil water assessment (SWAT) tool
    SWAT-Cup, and the median recharge for the year 2017 was found to be in the range
    of 397–575 mm [4]. Despite the differences in the model setups, simulation periods,
    and model structures, significant variations can be observed between the recharge
    zone results of Abraham et al. (2022) and those of this study. According to Abraham
    et al. (2022), the wetland-dominated central part of the watershed exhibited a
    high median recharge, whereas this study showed that it had a low median recharge
    [4]. The estimated median recharge was low in the eastern mountainous parts of
    the watershed [4]. The semidistributed simulation performed in this study using
    the M1 model setup produced a mean annual recharge between 392.03 and 549.3 mm.
    5. Conclusions Accurate modeling of all hydrological cycle components is necessary
    to ensure sustainable water resources management. The developments in satellite
    technology throughout the past few decades have played a significant role in the
    observation and measurement of several meteorological parameters. Additionally,
    the benefits of merging different techniques to gain advantage of the merits of
    each technique are increasing. Considering the direct relationship between recharge
    and rainfall records, the uncertainties in recharge estimations due to rainfall
    data uncertainties were assessed in this study. The physically based distributed
    hydrological model WetSpa was used to simulate over 20,000 possible model parameter
    combinations. Ten thousand of these simulations were run using rain gauge-based
    records, while the remaining simulations were run using CHIRP-based SREs that
    had been bias corrected and combined with the available rain gauge records. All
    other meteorological data and physiographical data used as model inputs were kept
    constant except for rainfall data. The results demonstrated that improved spatial
    representation of the rainfall increases the accuracy of spatial recharge estimations.
    Additionally, the results showed that the spatial representation of evapotranspiration
    can have a significant impact on the estimations of long-term recharge distribution.
    Limitations were encountered in examining point recharges through faults and direct
    recharge from uncontrolled irrigation fields dispersed throughout the watershed
    along with their respective water uses. The use of a customized look-up table
    for local variables of the WetSpa model was assumed sufficient to overcome the
    effects of these limitations. Additionally, a literature review revealed that
    few studies have explored the effects of geological faults on groundwater flow
    patterns [4,23], groundwater abstraction by large-scale farm lands in the Tikur-Wuha
    watershed [23], and the total amount of water abstracted for traditional or uncontrolled
    irrigation practices [46]. However, no previous studies have particularly focused
    on the quantification of recharge from irrigation fields or point recharges in
    the fault zones. Hence, the recharges estimated in this study does not reflect
    the actual recharges of the watershed. Hence, future studies should consider the
    direct recharge from irrigation fields, which can be estimated either through
    field level measurements or by introducing representative parameters to existing
    hydrogeological models. Additionally, the determination of point recharges through
    fault structures using methods such as modified chloride mass balance approach,
    could be considered in future studies. Furthermore, precise spatial evapotranspiration
    estimation should be explored in future to reduce its influence on recharge estimation
    uncertainty. 6. Data availability Statement Data can be made available on request.

  description: Rapidly inverting soil salinity is crucial to the soil water and salt
    migration for the prevention of the secondary salinization. However, the accuracy
    and efficiency of soil salinity inversion models are hindered to the coupling
    relationship between water and salt in soil, particularly for time-consuming and
    labor-intensive soil collection. This study aims to reduce the interference of
    soil moisture for obtaining better sample diversity and further improving the
    robustness of soil salinitu inversion models by using spectral technology. A total
    of 113 normal and 115 saline soil samples were collected in the Xinjiang cotton
    fields. These samples were further subjected to different levels of wetting treatment.
    and subsequently 467 soil samples with varing salt and moisture contents were
    obtained. Soil salt content was calibrated using the conductivity of soil leaching
    solution. Spectral data of samples was captured using an ASD ground object spectrometer
    (400-1000 nm) and a near-infrared spectrometer (960-1693 nm). The soil moisture
    was also corrected using the external parameter orthogonalization (EPO). Additionally,
    deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) with different transposed
    convolution stride strategies were designed to evaluate the sample set using Fréchet
    Inception Distance (FID) scores. Machine learning models were employed to invert
    the soil salinity, including partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest
    (RF), and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) models using VGG
    (VNet), EfficientNet (ENet), and ResNet (RNet) architectures. The results demonstrated
    that the EPO can effectively reduce the interference of moisture on the salinity,
    indicating the better prediction performance of different models. RNet out performed
    PLSR, RF, VNet, Enet, RNet, and exhibited the best performance to predict the
    soil salinity in cotton fields. The lightweight residual neural network without
    attention mechanism was more suitable for one-dimensional hyperspectral data.
    There was an increase in the convolution stride and kernel length of the deep
    convolutional adversarial generative network. The better samples were obtained
    for the hyperspectral data with long sequences. The superior FID scores were achieved
    in the generated augmented sample set using Generator B (designed with the larger
    convolution stride and kernel size), compared with the rest. Specifically, the
    FID scores were reduced by 7.9% and 13.4%, respectively, compared with GA and
    GC. The weight distribution of attention was optimized after expanding the training
    set by DCGAN. The stability and accuracy of the model were further enhanced to
    predict the soil salinity under certain constraints on training samples. The EPO-DCGAN(GB)-RNet
    (called EPO-DCGAN-RNet) model was achieved in the superior RMSE and R2 values
    of 136.472 μS/cm and 0.910, respectively, on the validation set, compared with
    the EPO-SG-RNet (using SG filtering denoising) and EPO-RNet (without sample augmentation).
    Furthermore, 1D-CNN with Grad CAM was employed to identify the characteristic
    bands of soil conductivity in the soil leaching solution of cotton field. In summary,
    an accurate inversion model EPO-DCGAN-RNet was constructed for inversing soil
    salinity in the cotton fields using spectral technology. Water correction and
    sample augmentation were incorporated for the soil salt composition. The improved
    model has the promising potential to the salt-tolerant cotton varieties and irrigation
    strategies using slightly salty water in cotton fields.

    资源附件 摘要: 棉田土壤盐分的精准反演对于棉花的种植管理具有重要意义。水分和盐分作为主要环境因素，共同影响棉田土壤的波谱特征，两者之间的耦合关系直接影响土壤盐分的检测分析。为了提高基于光谱技术构建的模型对棉田土壤盐分信息解析的准确性与可靠性，该研究联用可见/短波近红外（400～1
    000 nm）和长波近红外（960～1 693 nm）技术，采集不同含水率与含盐量的新疆地区土壤样本的光谱；结合外部参数正交法（external parameter
    orthogonalization，EPO），校正不同标样集与不同波段光谱中的土壤含水率干扰信息；引入基于不同卷积步幅的深度卷积对抗网络（deep convolutional
    generative adversarial networks，DCGAN），进行样本增广与质量评估；参考三层残差神经网络设计一维卷积神经网络RNet，最终构建基于EPO-DCGAN-RNet的优化模型，用于棉田土壤盐分的反演。结果表明，与传统机器学习方法和基于VGG或EfficientNet结构一维卷积神经网络相比，该研究提出的EPO-DCGAN-RNet方法能够有效地滤除水分对盐分反演的影响、提高模型对特征波段的挖掘能力、降低深度学习算法对样本量的依赖性，并能得到更优的模型预测性能。EPO-DCGAN-RNet的建模集R2和均方根误差分别为0.942、115.420
    μS/cm，验证集R2和均方根误差分别为0.910和136.472 μS/cm。研究结果可为新疆棉田土壤盐分快速精准检测提供理论指导和技术支持，有助于促进盐碱地区棉花种植的水肥科学管理。

    estimation of leaf water concentration in winter wheat under different nitrogen
    treatments and plant growth stages Article 23 December 2022 Introduction Chickpea
    (Cicer arietinum L.) is a staple protein source for much of the world’s population,
    particularly in the Indian subcontinent, the Mediterranean basin, and East Africa
    (Bar-El Dadon et al., 2017). It also drawn the attention of the alternative meat
    industry as a substitute for animal-based protein (Boukid, 2021). Global chickpea
    cultivation currently occupies ~ 13.7 million hectares, producing 14 million tons
    of grain annually (FAO stat 2021). In modern Mediterranean practice, chickpea
    is a winter-sown crop, such that, in most cases, the vegetative stage benefits
    from the precipitation of the wet winter season (Bonfil et al., 2007). Low water
    availability and high temperatures during the reproductive stage are major factors
    limiting chickpea grain yield (Kumar & Abbo, 2001; Oweis et al., 2004). Supplemental
    irrigation can dramatically increase chickpea grain yield, especially when applied
    during the reproductive stage (Singh et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge,
    supplemental drip irrigation for chickpea is applied mainly in Israel, likely
    contributing to the relatively high grain yields in the country, ~ 3.6 tons/ha
    (FAO stat, 2021). In several crops, including chickpea, irrigation scheduling
    is managed based on plant water status determined by physiological measurements
    (Jones, 2004). Leaf water potential (LWP) is a common measure of plant water status
    (Boyer, 1967). LWP represents the physiological state of the plant (Ennahli &
    Earl, 2005; Turner et al., 1986) and tightly correlates with crop production (Chastain
    et al., 2016). The common practice in Israel to determine chickpea irrigation
    timing is based on LWP destructive data collection but there is no official irrigation
    protocol (based on communication with Israeli agricultural guides and farmers).
    However, LWP measurements are highly time- and labor-consuming, and in practice,
    if used, farmers usually acquire only a few measurements from the entire field.
    Therefore, LWP measurements hardly capture spatial field variability. In addition,
    integrating LWP measurement within automatic irrigation systems is challenging
    due to the destructive nature of the technique (Steppe et al., 2008). Remote sensing
    platforms covering the entire field may provide a rapid and non-destructive alternative
    for LWP measurements while capturing in-field variability. The potential of using
    spectral data to assess LWP has already been studied in several crop species,
    including cotton (Kakani et al., 2007), wheat (Elsayed et al., 2011; Gutierrez
    et al., 2010) and soybean (Wijewardana et al., 2019). Canopy spectral reflectance
    properties are affected by the pool of morpho-physiological plant traits (Jetz
    et al., 2016). Canopy reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR; 700–1300 nm) and
    the shortwave-infrared (SWIR; 1300–2500 nm) regions is strongly affected by water
    absorption features centered at 970, 1200, 1450, 1950, and 2250 nm (Curran, 1989).
    LWP can be estimated using the spectral range of 400–2500 nm but is sparsely used
    in comparison to thermal imagery, which is a well-established technique (Zhou
    et al., 2021). Spectral data can be used to estimate several morpho-physiological
    traits simultaneously using one sensor to address various agronomical issues such
    as water and nutrient status, biomass estimation, phenology, and pest as well
    as disease identification (Homolova et al., 2013). Vegetation indices (VIs) are
    mathematical transformations of reflectance values in two or more spectral bands
    that were developed to estimate plant traits or status. Stimson et al. (2005)
    found a linear relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI; [R680-R1240]/
    [R680 + R1240]; R stands for reflectance in a specific band defined in nm) acquired
    at the leaf level, and LWP in two tree species (Table 1). In addition, Wang et
    al. (2020) showed that the three bands index ([R1740-R2370]/[R1740-R1750]), at
    the leaf level, was highly correlated with LWP of white poplar (Populus alba L.).
    Although visible-range (VIS; 400–700 nm) spectral bands are not directly related
    to plant water status, they can contribute to LWP assessment. Gamon et al. (1992)
    used the 531 nm band, which is sensitive to de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll
    pigments, to calculate the well-known photochemical reflectance index (PRI; [R550-R531]/[R550 + R531]),
    which was found to be a good leaf-level indicator of water stress and LWP. On
    the canopy level, PRI proved a good proxy for LWP in both peach and citrus orchards
    (Suárez et al., 2010; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). The water balanced index (WABI;
    [R1500-R531]/ [R1500 + R531]) leverages leaf spectral reaction to the xanthophyll
    steady state and water content to detect water stress, as demonstrated in grapevine
    (Rapaport et al., 2017). Canopy reflectance of wheat (Triticum aestivum), acquired
    throughout three growing seasons, was used to calculate the normalized water index
    (NWI; [R970-R880]/ [R970 + R880]), which correlated with LWP in different germplasms
    (Gutierrez et al., 2010). While in some cases, VIs using the visible, NIR, and
    SWIR regions, were good predictors for LWP, in other cases, they were site- and
    cultivar-specific or straggled to capture most of the variation in LWP values
    (Zhang et al., 2021). Using all hyperspectral bands to develop LWP estimation
    models may overcome the VIs limitations (Mariotto et al., 2013; Virnodkar et al.,
    2020; Cohen & Alchanatis, 2018). Rallo et al. (2014) calibrated a partial least
    squares regression (PLS-R) model to estimate LWP in olive trees (Olea europaea)
    from leaf and canopy spectra (350–2500 nm). Spectral data were acquired throughout
    the day, which minimized the phenology effect due to short measurement intervals
    while maintaining a wide range of LWP values. Machine learning (ML) methods can
    be used to analyze hyperspectral data as well as multiple VIs together. ML algorithms
    can handle the high colinear nature of hyperspectral data so as to capture more
    complex and non-linear relations between spectra and predicted variables (Caicedo
    et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2021). Development of a robust ML trait estimation model
    requires the generation of a large dataset that represents a broad range of ground
    truth measurements coupled with spectral data. Pôças et al. (2020) assessed pre-dawn
    LWP in grapevine using hyperspectral (400–1000 nm) canopy scans collected over
    three years to calculate VIs and showed that both Gaussian process regression
    and random forest accurately retrieved LWP, regardless of site and year. Despite
    the high spatiotemporal potential and spectral resolution of handheld and unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted spectroradiometers, their ability to cover large
    areas is limited (Rossini et al., 2013). Satellite-based imagery is a valuable
    platform for rapid and simultaneous LWP assessment on multiple fields and regions.
    Lin et al. (2020) examined the use of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to assess
    cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) stem water potential in fields subjected to four
    irrigation treatments. Among twenty known spectral VIs, a normalized index using
    the red and red-edge bands demonstrated the highest ability to assess stem water
    potential. Using random forest with all nine spectral bands slightly improved
    the assessment quality. In grapevine, a Bayesian ridge model with all Sentinel-2
    bands performed better than tree-based algorithms, support vector machine regression
    (SVM-R), and VIs in assessing stem water potential (Laroche-Pinel et al., 2021).
    Helman et al. (2018) calibrated a multiple linear regression model to estimate
    the stem water potential of vines using Planet scope satellite constellation imagery
    based on VIs time-series. Space-borne spectral data (VIs and spectral reflectance
    of bands) is becoming more common in agricultural research and applications (Hank
    et al., 2019), and the most common remote sensing application is related to plant
    water status (Berger et al., 2022). Airborne thermal imagery is well studied and
    found to be an efficient tool to assess LWP (Cohen & Alchanatis, 2018) the upscaling
    to satellite level resulted in a lower spatial resolution. On the other hand,
    multispectral space-borne imagery can provide a better spatial resolution, thus,
    its use for LWP estimation may be considered for remote sensing-based irrigation
    management (Table 1). Long-term irrigation regimes can influence crop biomass
    accumulation, which positively relates to leaf area index (LAI) values affecting
    spectral properties of the canopy (Ahlrichs & Bauer, 1982). Thus, it remains to
    be determined if canopy spectra-based LWP estimation models are sensitive to LWP
    variability or are mainly influenced by morphological changes. Furthermore, to
    the best of our knowledge, no previous work assessed chickpea LWP using ground
    or space-borne spectral sensors (Table 1). The current study aimed to assess the
    ability of ground and space-borne canopy spectral reflectance data to assess LWP
    in field-grown chickpea. To this end, several VIs and ML algorithms were applied
    and compared for their ability to estimate field-grown chickpea morpho-physiological
    traits in four year-sites. To explore the validity of the developed spectral LWP
    estimation models, the in-season relations between LWP and LAI were examined under
    variable irrigation regimes. To the best of our knowledge, the in-season relation
    between LWP and LAI has not been published (Table 1) or studied yet in the context
    of LWP spectral estimation. Table 1 Studies using spectral data to assess leaf
    water potential (LWP) from ground and space sensors Full size table Materials
    and methods Study sites and experimental design Data were collected in four year-site:
    two field experiments with a defined experimental design and two large observational
    studies in commercial fields. Field experiments were conducted at the Gilat Research
    Center, Agricultural Research Organization (ARO), Israel (31° 21′ N; 34° 42′ E)
    over two growing seasons (2019 and 2020). The site is located in an arid environment
    (average annual precipitation 230 mm) with sandy-loam soil. The experiments were
    conducted in a complete randomized block design with six replicates. Each plot
    was three-beds-wide (1.93 m each) and 25-m-long (Fig. 1). A marked area of about
    2-m-long was used for data acquisition in the central bed. In the commercial fields,
    six sampling points were selected in each treated area, with a minimal distance
    of 20 m between points. The points were marked in the field to enable measurements
    of the same area every week. Differential irrigation regimes were applied once
    a week, as commonly applied in Israel, during the reproductive stage, using irrigation
    factors (If) 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.25, and 1.4 for the five irrigation regimes (Avneri
    et al., 2023a). This coefficient represents the fraction of the weekly cumulative
    evapotranspiration and was used to determine the amount of water to be applied
    at each irrigation session. In addition, two observations in commercial fields
    were conducted in Or HaNer (31° 33′ N; 34° 35′ E) in 2019 and in Kedma (31° 41′
    N; 34° 46′ E) in 2020. A part of each commercial site was divided into five 0.7–1.1
    hectares irrigation zones, with the same If as applied in the Gilat 2019 experiment,
    in the Gilat 2020 experiment a rain-fed regime was added. Each irrigation zone
    was a least 30-m-wide to ensure at least one row of pure pixels per treatment,
    as dictated by the Vegetation and Environment monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite
    (VENµS) spatial resolution (5.3 m × 5.3 m). Within each irrigation zone, six points
    were selected for the acquisition of physiological and ground spectral data throughout
    the season (Fig. 1). All four year-sites were sown during the second half of January
    and harvested in July with chickpea Kabuli cultivars. Gilat and Or HaNer sites
    were sown with the cultivar Zehavit, while Bar’am cultivar (Hazera Ltd., Israel)
    was sown in Kedma. Fig. 1 Year-sites locations and experimental setup in Gilat

    and colored rectangles symbolize the irrigation treatment. In Gilat (20,219 and
    2022), data were acquired around the colored rectangle in the middle bed, while
    in the commercial fields (Or HaNer 2019 and Kedma 2020) yellow crosses indicate
    the measurement points Full size image Physiological traits measurements LWP and
    LAI measurements were acquired weekly, or as close as possible to it, at each
    site from the beginning of flowering to maturity. In the Gilat experiments, measurements
    were conducted nine times throughout the 2019 season [60, 65, 73, 79, 86, 93,
    99, 107, and 114 days after emergence (DAE); emergence occurred on January 29,
    2019] and six times through the 2020 season (60, 67, 74, 81,88, 95 and 102 DAE;
    emergence occurred on February 16, 2020). At Or HaNer 2019, seven acquisitions
    were carried out (67, 72, 81, 88, 95, 102, and 109 DAE; emergence occurred on
    January 28, 2019), and Kedma 2020 data were acquired on six dates (57, 64, 71,
    78, 85, and 92 DAE, emergence occurred on January 13, 2020). The areas from which
    the physiological measurements were acquired throughout the experiment were marked
    in each plot or measurement point. A pressure chamber (PMS 600D, PMS, Albany,
    OR, USA) was used to conduct LWP measurements. One main stem from the center of
    the central bed at every plot was cut at the fifth or fourth node from the apex
    of the plant at midday (12 − 2 PM) and immediately inserted into the pressure
    chamber. LAI estimations were performed by a ceptometer (AccuPAR LP-80, Decagon
    Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) in the same area in which the LWP data were collected.
    In each plot, the LAI was calculated from one measurement above the canopy and
    the average of three measurements perpendicular to the bed below the canopy, with
    the sensor measuring the entire area between the two stem lines on the central
    bed. All LAI measurements were conducted 2 h before or after solar noon, under
    clear-sky conditions. Ground hyperspectral data collection Spectral data was acquired
    at the same day as LWP and or LAI data acquisition. To reduce the atmospheric
    effect, canopy reflectance was acquired by a dual field of view system containing
    two spectroradiometers, both with a spectral range of 350–2500 nm and a spectral
    resolution (after in-sensor interpolation) of 1 nm. The Fieldspec4 (Malvern Panalytical,
    Worcestershire, UK) was used to collect canopy reflectance with a bare fiber optic
    approximately 1.5 m above the ground in nadir position, generating a field of
    view radius from 17 to 33 cm, depending on canopy height. The spectral data was
    acquired from the 2-m-long marked area in the central bed and included five files
    per plot, each file was an average of 10 spectra. The Labspec3 (Malvern Panalytical,
    Worcestershire, UK) was positioned at the edge of the field to measure a white
    reference Lambertian panel (Spectralon Labsphere, North Sutton, NH, USA), and
    programmed to acquire data in 1 s intervals. Time stamps were used to relate the
    canopy reflectance to the closest white reference panel measurement (no more than
    1 s difference). To calibrate the two spectroradiometers, both acquired at least
    30 measurements of white reference panel reflectance simultaneously. This process
    was performed every 20 min to maintain reliable spectral data. A correction factor
    (Rc) was calculated from the spectral reading of the reference panel collected
    by the two spectroradiometers, as described in Eq. 1: $$ {R}_{c}=\\frac{{DN}_{field}*{IT}_{field}}{{DN}_{lab}*{IT}_{lab}}$$
    (1) where DNfield and DNlab are the averages of 30 digital number readings of
    the Fieldspec4 and Labspec3 spectroradiometers, and ITfield and ITlab are the
    integration time of both instruments, respectively. Each reading from the canopy
    was then multiplied by the Rc to obtain the canopy reflectance for further analysis.
    All spectral data were acquired under a clear sky, starting two hours before solar
    noon and no more than two hours after. The hyperspectral data and the physiological
    data were acquired at the same location. The main atmospheric water absorption
    spectral regions (1350–1420 nm, 1800–1960 nm, and 2400–2500 nm), as well as the
    bands below 400 nm, were removed from the spectral data. Space-borne imagery collection
    To explore LWP and LAI spectral estimation in the commercial fields, VENµS imagery
    was used. VENµS is an Israeli French research satellite launched in 2017. This
    sun-synchronous satellite is equipped with a 12-spectral-band push broom sensor,
    providing a spatial resolution of 5.3 m per pixel and a revisit time of 48 h with
    the same view angle. Four VENµS spectral bands located at the red-edge spectral
    region (venus.cnes.fr/en/VENUS/index) proved to be important for crop canopy reflectance
    analysis (Herrmann et al., 2011; Salvoldi et al., 2022). Top-of-canopy reflectance
    spectra obtained from radiometrically and atmospherically corrected (L2 level)
    VENµS images, were acquired on the same day as the ground measurements of crop
    traits or one day before or after crop traits measurements. Each ground measurement
    point was located by a global positioning system (GPS) device, and a 4–6-pixel
    polygon was created based on that location, to avoid overlapping spectral data
    between different points. The average reflectance spectrum of each of the polygons
    was used as the spectral data for each of the measuring dates and was assigned
    to the traits acquired values in that measuring point for that day. Chickpea traits
    estimation using vegetation indices For the ground hyperspectral data, 1 nm bands
    were used to calculate 11 VIs known from the literature to be associated with
    plant physiological status and LWP (Supplementary Table S1). Five known VIs were
    calculated from the satellite images (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, the
    normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) approach was applied using all two
    band combinations (Thenkabail et al., 2000; Inoue et al., 2008). The VIs with
    the highest Pearson correlation coefficient (r) with each trait in the full datasets
    (i.e., four year-sites for ground data and two year-sites for space-borne data)
    were selected for the development of linear regression models. The ground and
    satellite datasets were divided into calibration (CAL) and validation (VAL), in
    a 60:40 ratio, respectively. To make sure that the traits values distributions
    were kept between the CAL and VAL, random sample selections were performed for
    each date and for each treatment separately. The ground dataset contained 732
    LWP and 914 LAI records and the satellite dataset contained 348 LWP and 408 LAI
    records. All linear models and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were developed using
    JMP ver.15 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). These CAL and VAL samples
    distribution (i.e., ground and satellite datasets) were used also for the ML analysis.
    Chickpea traits estimation models using spectral data and machine learning For
    the satellite-based traits assessment models, 11 out of 12 VENµS bands; band 6
    was excluded since it is the same wavelength as band 5 and expected to mainly
    be used for 3-dimensional modeling. To gain a better sample to predictors ratio,
    the hyperspectral data were resampled by selecting every fifth band, resulting
    in 352 predictors (wavelengths). Data were converted to first derivative by the
    Savitzky-Golay filter (Savitzky & Golay, 1964) with second-order polynomial, and
    then mean-centered. A 10-fold Venetian-blind cross-validation was performed to
    optimize the model parameters, with a sampling size of 10 samples per fold. Three
    well known algorithms were used to estimate LWP and LAI. (1) PLS-R, which is a
    multivariate non-parametric method commonly used for hyperspectral plant trait
    estimation due to its ability to deal with high dimensionality and collinearity
    of the spectral data (Cho et al., 2007). In PLS-R the predictors, which in this
    study were wavelengths, were converted into several non-correlated principal components
    (Wold et al., 1987) and then a linear regression was performed to estimate the
    response variable (Xie et al., 2021; Mokhtar et al., 2022), i.e., LWP and LAI.
    (2) Artificial neural network (ANN) was used to capture non-linear relations between
    a set of predictors and a response variable (Caicedo et al., 2014). Here a standard
    multilayer model with one hidden layer was used. (3) SVM-R is an extension of
    the SVM classification algorithm, used to solve non-linear problems by transforming
    them into linear problems. This method has a strong learning ability from relatively
    small datasets (Zhang et al., 2021). PLS-R, ANN, and SVM models were generated
    using the PLS_TOOLBOX 9.1 (Eigenvector, Manson, WA, USA) used in a MATLAB R2019a
    (Math Works Inc, Natick, MA, USA) environment. The same datasets were used for
    both VIs and hyperspectral to allow comparison between models. R2 of CAL and VAL,
    as well as the root means square error (RMSE) of CAL and VAL. Further, the relative
    RMSE (rRMSE), which refers to the percentage of the error from the measured data,
    was used as described by Feilhauer et al. (2010). Results and discussion Temporal
    pattern of morpho-physiological traits To characterize the seasonal patterns of
    LWP and LAI and their responses to irrigation regimes, those traits were measured
    on a weekly basis. At all year-sites, a sharp increase in LWP was obtained after
    the first irrigation. Katerji et al. (2001) described a similar fluctuating reaction
    of pre-dawn chickpea water potential to irrigation throughout the season in all
    year-sites, LWP response to differential irrigation was faster and more dramatic
    than LAI. Differences were already observed in LWP on the first measurement after
    the application of differential irrigation (Fig. 2a). The high-rate irrigation
    treatments (If = 1, 1.25, 1.4) resulted in higher values of LWP relative to the
    low-rate treatments (If = 0.5, 0.7), throughout the differential irrigation period.
    On some days, differences in LWP were also found between 0.5 and 0.7 If as well
    as between 1, 1.25 and 1.4 If treatments. These differences were more dramatic
    in the Gilat 2019 and 2020 experiments. Due to environmental effects, the average
    seasonal pattern of LWP values was not consistent for each treatment between year-sites
    and ranged between − 1.1 MPa and − 2.2 MPa. LWP is extremely sensitive to climatic
    factors, such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and radiation (Ortuño et al., 2006;
    Schmidhalter et al., 1998). The seasonal LAI dynamics exhibited a classic pattern
    (Saha et al., 2015; Tesfaye et al., 2006), which was similar between the four
    year-sites. The LAI response to the differential irrigation was detectable at
    least one week after the capture of the LWP response. The measured LAI values
    were higher in the high-rate irrigation treatments as compared to the low-rate
    irrigation treatments due to the long-term effect of water shortage. Maximal measured
    LAI varied between year-sites, and in some of the sites, a decline in LAI was
    observed during senescence. For example, in Gilat 2019, the maximum LAI values
    were ~ 6, while in Gilat 2020, the maximum LAI values were ~ 4.5 (Fig. 2b). Avneri
    et al. (2023a) found that the temperature in Gilat 2019 was lower during the vegetative
    stage compared with Gilat 2020, additionally, an extreme eight days heat wave
    in 2020 (88–96 DAE) affected plants’ growth and development. In Kedma 2020, a
    severe heat wave at ~ 90 DAE caused a sharp decrease in both LWP and LAI (Fig.
    2). Reductions in LAI values before the seasonal maximal LAI are not common. It
    is assumed that a turgor loss in response to the high VPD caused wilting, which
    temporally decreased the LAI, as described for cereals by Singh and Singh (1995).
    A similar phenomenon but with a smaller amplitude, was also observed in Gilat
    2020 (Fig. 2). At all year-sites, a sharp increase in LWP was observed a week
    after the first differential irrigation, while LAI response was slower (two weeks
    or more pending the site; Fig. 2b). In contrast to the inconsistent seasonal pattern
    of LWP, seasonal LAI trends were similar in all four year-sites. Fig. 2 Leaf water
    potential (a) and leaf area index (b) seasonal patterns in Gilat 2019, Gilat 2020,
    Or Full size image Hanner 2019, and Kedma 2020. Data from each irrigation factor
    are presented in a different color. Each point represents the average of all samples
    collected for each treatment on that date, and the bars represent the standard
    errors. The black dashed arrow marks the date of the first differential irrigation.
    In Or HaNer 2019, the first irrigation, on 88 DAE, was equal for all treatments,
    first deferential irrigation was applied on 95 DAE. Assessment of morpho-physiological
    traits by vegetation indices To select the most suitable VIs for trait assessment
    by simple linear regression, a correlation between LWP and LAI and all VIs determined
    using the full ground and space spectral datasets was assessed. The VIs with the
    highest r absolute values for each trait were selected for further analysis. All
    the correlation coefficients and their significance level are listed in Supplementary
    Table S2. The newly developed NDSI, which uses bands at 1600 and 1730 nm (NDSI(1600,1730)),
    showed the highest correlation (r = -0.76) to LWP calculated from the ground hyperspectral
    data. It is assumed that broader (i.e., non-narrow) bands can be used to calculate
    NDSI(1600,1730) while resulting in a similar correlation with LWP. Supplementary
    Figure S1 demonstrates that a wider region around those bands was found to be
    closely related to LWP. Amongst the VIs known from the literature selected for
    the current study, PRI and Water Index (WI; R900/R970) resulted in the highest
    correlation (r = 0.58 and 0.56, respectively) to LWP. Even though PRI is known
    to be a good proxy for LWP in trees (Suárez et al., 2008; Zarco-Tejada et al.,
    2012), it is also sensitive to canopy structure and within-canopy shadowing/illumination
    (Hilker et al., 2008; Suárez et al., 2008), which might affect its ability to
    assess chickpea LWP when irrigation regimes resulted in significant changes in
    LAI throughout the season (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 3–5). WI is affected
    by canopy structure as well, due to its integration of reflectance at 900 nm.
    On the other hand, the NDSI (1600,1730) found in this work was determined based
    on two SWIR bands (i.e., 1600 and 1730 nm), which are less sensitive to changes
    in LAI than the NIR bands (Supplementary Table S2; Asner, 1998). The narrow-band
    VIs selected to assess LAI (i.e., WI, FWABI and MSI) showed similar performances
    in terms of R2 and RMSE (Table 2). All slopes and intercepts of the measured vs.
    predicted LAI regressions were significantly different from one and zero, respectively
    (Supplementary Table S4). Chickpea canopies can be dense, with LAI values higher
    than 5 (Fig. 2), thus, less light reaches the low canopy levels. Roberts et al.
    (1997) and Asner (1998) showed that solar radiation in spectral regions that are
    less absorbed by plant tissue (i.e., NIR and SWIR) penetrates deeper into the
    canopy, and thereby interact with additional leaf layers in comparison with radiation
    in the visible region. VIs calculated using NIR or SWIR bands solely without any
    band from the visible region, showed higher correlation to LAI (Supplementary
    Table S2). These findings are in agreement with several previous studies that
    showed the importance of NIR-SWIR regions over the visible range for LAI spectral
    assessment (Brown et al., 2000; Schlerf et al., 2005; Darvishzadeh et al., 2009).
    Neinavaz et al. (2016) demonstrated that water absorbance features around 970
    nm are deeper and more obvious in high LAI values. Both WI and FWABI are making
    use of this feature and showing a high prediction ability for LAI in our study.
    Scatter plots of the measured vs. predicted trait of the best preformed VIs can
    be found in Supplementary Figure S2. Table 2 Leaf water potential and leaf area
    index models’ performances based on selected vegetation indices driven from ground
    and space canopy spectral reflectance Full size table The ability to determine
    LWP using rapid and non-destructive remote sensing could be advantageous in various
    agronomical processes, such as commercial field irrigation scheduling (Jones,
    2004) for the entire or sub-field areas, and large population screening in early
    breeding cycles in both control conditions and field experiments (Araus & Cairns,
    2014). For spectral LWP assessment to be used in practice, it should be easy to
    implement, non-site- and non-cultivar-specific and must also be able to capture
    fast changes in LWP per se. Plant response to differential irrigation (variable
    water availability) can be manifested by biomass and LAI accumulation, as well
    as by other biophysical properties which affect the spectral canopy reflectance
    (El-Hendawy et al., 2017). Thus, the ability to estimate LWP using spectral tools,
    might be more affected by LAI or biomass, in that case, the estimation will be
    an artifact and won’t be sensitive to changes in LWP before changes in canopy
    density. The LWP, LAI and NDSI (1600,1730) trends between treatments before and
    after differential irrigation were explored for each of the year sites. As expected,
    before the first differential irrigation (i.e., 73 DAE), there were no inter-treatment
    differences in LWP, LAI or NDSI (1600,1730) in Gilat 2020 (Fig. 3). One week later
    (i.e., 81 DAE), LWP of the high-rate irrigation region was significantly higher
    than in the low-rate irrigation region. On the same date, the NDSI (1600,1730)
    values showed the opposite trend, while no trend was identified for LAI. On 88
    DAE, the same trends were maintained for LWP and NDSI (1600,1730), while LAI values
    started showing differences between irrigation treatments. Similar patterns for
    LWP, NDSI (1600,1730), and LAI were recorded on the other three year-sites (Supplementary
    Figures S3, S4, and S5). These patterns might suggest that NDSI (1600,1730) is
    sensitive to variations in LWP within a few days following exposure to accumulated
    water deficit, regardless of changes in LAI. In Cabernet Sauvignon grapevine leaves,
    the WABI index exhibited a seasonal pattern similar to that of stem water potential
    and was successfully used to schedule irrigation (Rapaport et al., 2017). In the
    current study, WABI was less sensitive to changes in LWP than NDSI (1600,1730).
    The upscale from leaf- to canopy-level measurements in grapevines and chickpeas,
    respectively, may have led to these differences. NDSI (1600,1730) also differentiated
    between chickpea plants under high vs. low irrigation treatment as early as one
    week after application of the differential irrigation. Several studies demonstrated
    that the relationship between VIs and plant water status changed under different
    irrigation regimes (El-Hendawy et al., 2017; Elsayed et al., 2011; Garriga et
    al., 2017). Fig. 3 Boxplots showing the median and range of leaf water potential
    (LWP), NDSI (1600,1730) and leaf area index (LAI) before first irrigation (73
    DAE), and 8 and 15 days after first irrigation (i.e., 81 and 88 DAE) in the Gilat
    2020 field. The black dashed vertical line indicates the transition from uniform
    to differential irrigation. DAE: days after emergence. Treatments are indicated
    along the X-axis and represented by different colors. Different letters indicate
    significant differences in multiple comparisons using the Tukey-HSD test (P ≤ 0.05),
    and n.s. indicates non-significance between treatments for that day Full size
    image To explore the ability to determine LWP from space-borne spectral measurements,
    the red-edge inflection point (REIP) and normalized difference red edge (NDRE)
    were selected for models’ calibration based on their relatively high correlation
    to LWP in the full dataset (Supplementary Table S2). The REIP performed slightly
    better than the NDRE model. Although VAL RMSE was lower in the REIP-based model,
    the R2 and the slopes of both models were low, indicating its poor performance
    in determining LWP (Table 2; and Supplementary Table S4). Estimation of LWP based
    on VIs from satellite images was less reliable relative to the ground-based VIs
    that used SWIR bands (Table 2). Interestingly, the REIP resulted in a similar
    r to LWP from both ground and space sensors (Fig. 4). For Or HaNer 2019, the r
    values were lower (-0.39 and − 0.41 for ground and space images, respectively)
    than those of Kedma (-0.61 and 0.60 for ground and space images, respectively).
    The slopes of the regression lines were similar for ground and space at each of
    the two sites. These findings indicate the robustness of REIP in capturing LWP
    variations, regardless of the sensor and spatial resolution, showing an additional
    advantage of REIP for agricultural applications in comparison to various VIs (Herrmann
    et al., 2011; Salvoldi et al., 2022). Mezera et al. (2022) proposed that VIs derived
    from both ground-based data and satellite images exhibit comparable sensitivity
    to the winter wheat response to nitrogen fertilization, as evidenced by their
    linear correlation with LWP. Similar behavior was observed for NDREs and NDVIs
    of vineyards at different phenological stages (Darra et al., 2021). In peach orchards,
    NDRE was used to calibrate a model for stem water potential using high spatial
    resolution images (2 m) driven from the WorldView2 satellite (Van Beek et al.,
    2013). The VENµS-driven REIP and NDRE models performed similarly to the other
    studies that used satellite imagery to obtain LWP (Table 1). Such models can be
    used for LWP assessment in chickpea. All ground-level VIs that ranked highly in
    LWP estimation contain at least one SWIR band, as shown in previous studies (El-Hendawy
    et al., 2019; Kandylakis et al., 2020; Rapaport et al., 2015). The best VI for
    LWP determined based on images collected by VENµS, which does not have a SWIR
    band, was REIP (Table 2). REIP uses VIS and NIR bands and maintained LWP estimation
    quality when using ground images (Fig. 4). Sentinel-2 bands are similar to those
    of VENµS, but with two additional SWIR bands, which, due to their relatively high
    relation to plant water status, are expected to improve the LWP estimation and
    will be tested in future studies. Cavalaris et al. (2021) found a correlation
    between NDWI, determined using SWIR and NIR bands of Sentinel-2, and wheat LWP,
    while in pomegranate orchards, NDWI was found to be a good predictor of stem water
    potential (Borgogno-Mondino et al., 2022). With the recent technological advances
    more hyperspectral satellites, such as PRISMA and EnMAP, are expected to advance
    prediction models, which may further improve the ability to assess LWP from space.
    Thermal imaging is a well-known predictor of crop water status, but low spatial
    resolution of commercial satellite sensors currently limits its use for LWP assessment
    (Berni et al., 2009). Furthermore, Zarco-Tejada et al. (2013) pointed out that
    the normalized PRI was significantly related to both LWP (R2 = 0.77) and the thermal
    crop water stress index (R2 = 0.75). These findings suggest that canopy reflectance
    data might be a viable alternative to thermal imaging in plant water status assessment.
    For LAI assessment based on VENµS imagery, REIP, and NDRE were found to be the
    best predictors, with minor differences in RMSE and R2 values (Table 2). This
    agrees with Brantley et al. (2011), who suggested that VIs with red-edge bands
    are more sensitive to changes in high LAI values (> 4) than VIs with NIR bands
    only. When using RapidEye imagery, wheat LAI was better estimated by NDRE than
    NDVI (Ali et al., 2015). Similarly, REIP and NDRE determined based on VENµS images
    outperformed NDVI for wheat LAI estimation (Bonfil et al., 2021). Resampled ground
    spectra to VENµS bands also demonstrated the advantage of REIP over NDVI in estimating
    LAI in wheat and potato (Herrmann et al., 2011). LAI is an important physiological
    trait with various applications in precision agriculture based on field phenotyping;
    it is a good proxy for total plant biomass (Dong et al., 2020) and plays an important
    role in modeling radiation use efficiency (Sinclair et al., 1992). Combining LAI
    estimated by space-borne VI with soil-water-atmosphere-plant models was found
    to decrease yield prediction error for wheat and barley (Mokhtari et al., 2018).
    In maize, adding LAI to meteorological data improved crop evapotranspiration assessments
    (Tang et al., 2018). The spatial resolution of VENµS (5 m) is adequately to capture
    within-field variability, while the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (10–20 m)
    is coarser but can still do the same and can be fused with PlantScope imagery
    to produce LAI maps with 3 m pixel size (Sadeh et al., 2021). This data fusion
    and sharpening might be more suitable for management of zones within commercial
    fields or field experiments with treatments wider than three Sentinel-2 pixels.

    traits assessment To improve VIs-based plant traits assessment, three ML algorithms
    (PLS-R, SVM, ANN) were explored. The spectral data included all spectral bands
    available for hyperspectral ground data and space-borne imagery. The CAL and VAL
    datasets contained the same samples as the VIs analyses. For ground hyperspectral
    data, the use of ML slightly improved the LWP assessment relative to the best
    VIs. The RMSE of VAL in the NDSI (1600,1730)-based linear model (0.19 MPa; Table
    2) was slightly higher than the RMSE of the PLS-R, SVM, and ANN models (0.18 Mpa,
    0.16 Mpa, and 0.15 Mpa, respectively; Table 3). The ANN algorithm outperformed
    the PLS-R and SVM algorithms, with the highest R2 and the lowest RMSE values in
    both CAL and VAL datasets. ANN is widely used for plant water status estimation
    (Virnodkar et al., 2020), mainly to determine vineyard stem water potential. Poblete
    et al. (2017) used multispectral UAV images and ANN to assess stem water potential
    in one vineyard over two seasons using five bands in the visible-NIR range. In
    an additional study in vines, ANN was used to assess stem water potential using
    an input layer of ten different VIs retrieved from multispectral UAV images over
    one growing season and yielded a validation RMSE of 0.15 Mpa. The authors developed
    a pattern-recognition ANN model to estimate the stress level of the entire vineyard
    for irrigation scheduling purposes (Romero et al., 2018). The slope between measured
    and predicted LWP obtained using ANN was closer to one than that of the PLS-R
    and SVM algorithms, respectively. It is worth mentioning that all the slopes were
    significantly different from one based on a T-test (supplementary Table S5). In
    addition, the intercept of both CAL and VAL in the ANN model was the lowest (Table
    3) but all were significantly lower than zero (supplementary Table S5). Even though
    the differences between the ML models seem minor, for irrigation scheduling, such
    differences can be critical in improving decision accuracy. ANN might better capture
    the LWP variance due to its ability to capture complex non-linear relationships
    between predictors and predicted variables (Hsu et al., 1995), such as seasonal
    LWP trends (Fig. 2). The day of measurement did not affect the models or generate
    point clusters of certain days, suggesting an actual spectral ability to assess
    LWP (Fig. 5a-c). Despite its high assessment ability, ANN has some limitations
    and disadvantages, such as high computational demand and a high risk of overfitting.
    In addition, this algorithm’s ‘black-box’ nature cannot provide a high explanatory
    of models compared to PLS-R. This feature might be critical when designing more
    affordable spectral sensors using the wavelengths important for LWP estimation
    only. Table 3 Leaf water potential and leaf area index assessment by machine learning
    methods based on ground and space spectral images Full size table ANN was the
    most suitable method for LWP assessment from VENµS bands and yielded a lower RMSE
    (0.17 Mpa) compared to the other two methods (0.23 Mpa). The R2 (0.79) and the
    slope of the regression line (0.86) in the ANN-based model were the highest among
    all models from both ground and space data. This demonstrates the advantage of
    using ANN for LWP estimation from satellite imagery. It is worth mentioning that
    the rRMSE of the ANN model was slightly lower when using the ground spectral measurements
    than when using the satellite-based model (Table 3). The VENµS dataset contained
    two year-sites (two seasons and two cultivars), while in the ground-based model,
    additional two year-sites (two seasons and two cultivars) were included in the
    dataset. In addition, ANN models, in comparison with PLS-R and SVM, showed a better
    assessment of plants with relatively low LWP (<-2 Mpa; Fig. 5d-f). A very limited
    number of studies have implemented ML algorithms to assess LWP from satellite
    imagery; none were found for chickpea. This may have been due to the difficulty
    of gathering a reasonable number of ground truth measurements in large sites suitable
    for space-borne monitoring. In the current work, 355 measurements of LWP were
    collected throughout the two seasons from the experiments in commercial fields
    and were coupled to VENµS spectra. Laroche-Pinel et al. (2021) aimed to assess
    stem water potential in vines acquired over three years and different cultivars,
    with a total of 349 samples. They used Bayesian ridge regression and all Sentinel-2
    bands with a spatial resolution of 10 and 20 m as predictors (Table 1). The performance
    of their model was similar to the ML models in the current study. Cohen et al.
    (2019) validated a multivariable linear regression for vineyard stem water potential
    with similar errors as in the current study. They suggested that this workflow
    might be further used for in-season irrigation management. The high spatial and
    temporal resolutions of VENµS render it ideal for spectral estimation of plant
    traits. The disadvantage of VENµS is that it acquires imagery from selected sites
    only. To generate an applicative global tool, a LWP estimation model based on
    VENµS imagery should be converted into a publicly open satellite with similar
    spectral, spatial, and temporal properties such as Sentinel-2. Manivasagam et
    al. (2019) developed a bands transformation function for VENµS to Sentinel-2 that
    can assist in this task. Furthermore, a high correlation between VIs from these
    two satellites was already reported (Bonfil et al., 2021). The current use of
    LWP for chickpea to schedule drip irrigation is common, mainly in Israel. It is
    expected that in the near future, farmers from other countries will adopt this
    irrigation approach since it can boost grain yield while improving water use efficiency
    (Avneri et al., 2023a). Fig. 5 Scatter plots of measured and predicted leaf water
    potential values of the validation dataset from ground hyperspectral data using
    PLSR (a), SVM (b) or ANN (c) and for satellite-based images using PLSR (d), SVM
    (e) or ANN (f). The different symbols indicate different sites. The solid line
    is the regression line between measured and predicted LWP values and the 1:1 line
    is dashed Full size image For LAI assessment, there was no benefit of ANN over
    PLS-R in terms of all quality parameters for both CAL and VAL, except for the
    intercept, which was a bit lower in the VAL of the PSL-R model. The SVM-based
    model showed slightly lower assessment ability relative to the other two methods
    (Table 3). All three algorithms resulted in balanced CAL and VAL R2 and RMSE values
    indicating model stability and robustness. The use of PLS-R to estimate the LAI
    of soybean from five environments with a full-range (350–2500 nm) hyperspectral
    dataset resulted in RMSE and rRMSE values of 1.3 and 22%, respectively (Chiozza
    et al., 2021). A SVM model used to assess soybean LAI of 20 cultivars over one
    season resulted in R2 and RMSE values of 0.58 and 0.51, respectively, in the validation
    dataset (Zhang et al., 2023). To the best of our knowledge, no published works
    have assessed chickpea LAI using hyperspectral data and ML approaches. The current
    results showed that chickpea LAI can be assessed with similar accuracy to other
    major field crops using ML. An additional paper published by our group used several
    VIs obtained from UAV-borne RGB imagery as input for LAI assessment and found
    that SVM was significantly better than PSL-R for chickpea LAI assessment (Avneri
    et al., 2023b). These predictors, based on the three RGB bands only and had a
    high spatial resolution, were much different from the spectral data used in the
    current study. When comparing prediction ability, all ML methods outperformed
    the narrow-band VIs (Tables 1 and 2). Using the full spectral range instead of
    VIs was assumed to capture a higher portion of the variation in LAI, resulting
    in a higher R2 (percentage of explained variation) in the ML models. This finding
    agrees with other studies that showed higher estimation accuracy of LAI using
    full-range hyperspectral ground scans and ML relative to VIs (Darvishzadeh et
    al., 2008; Ma et al., 2022). The LAI estimation models based on multispectral
    VENµS imagery resulted in relatively higher RMSE values in comparison to the models
    based on ground hyperspectral data (Table 3). Comparisons between hyperspectral
    data and simulated VENµS bands driven from it found no differences in the LAI
    and nitrogen content prediction accuracies (Cohen et al., 2010; Herrmann et al.,
    2011). In these studies, the same ground measurement data were used for both hyperspectral
    and synthetic VENµS band, which could have contributed to the similarity of the
    results. Even though the datasets in the current study were different in sample
    size and the number of sites, the rRMSE values of the satellite-based models were
    still higher than the ground hyperspectral models (Table 3). Assessment of cotton
    LAI by SVM using Sentinel-2 bands, resulted in independent validation R2 and RMSE
    values of 0.80 and 0.78, respectively (Mao et al., 2019), while an analysis of
    winter wheat data using ANN yielded R2 and RMSE values of 0.61 and 1.34, respectively
    (Xie et al., 2019). The ability to assess chickpea LAI from satellite imagery
    can be applied for field and regional crop monitoring throughout the season and
    can be integrated into yield-prediction models, as it was found to improve model
    accuracy in several crops (Lambert et al., 2018; Segarra et al., 2022; Zhou et
    al., 2020). LAI assessed by satellite imagery might also be a useful proxy for
    crop evapotranspiration (Yebra et al., 2013), and together with assessed LWP,
    present a broad toolbox to improve irrigation precise and efficiency, as well
    as gas exchange modeling. Water potential assessment per se Unlike other plant
    traits of agronomical importance, such as pigment content (Mulero et al., 2022),
    LWP cannot be measured at a specific wavelength. As most traits are related to
    chemical compounds or associated with canopy structures such as biomass or LAI,
    LWP is more of a thermodynamic trait that reflects plant water status (Elfving
    et al., 1972). Long-term irrigation regimes affect chickpea LAI (Fig. 2) and additional
    morpho-physiological traits that influence the canopy spectra. In turn, skeptics
    doubt the ability to assess LWP based on spectral data rather than an assessment
    of additional plant trait that is affected by the long-term differential irrigation
    treatments related to LWP. The seasonal pattern of LWP did not follow the LAI
    seasonal pattern in any of the sites (Fig. 2). The r values between LWP and LAI
    in each of the four year-sites ranged between 0.08 and 0.44, while in the full
    dataset, r was 0.29. These findings indicate that LAI affects LWP spectral assessment,
    but a nice portion of the variability in LWP values was not affected by LAI. The
    differential irrigation eventually resulted in significant differences in LAI
    between the irrigation treatments, but only after changes in LWP as well as in
    spectral data (i.e., NDSI (1600,1730)) were observed (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figures
    S3, S4, and S5). Short-term changes in LWP followed by a decrease in turgor pressure
    impact leaf inclination angle and morphology (Wenkert et al., 1978). These changes
    in leaf and canopy properties affect the spectral signature across the electromagnetic
    spectrum. Thus, ML methods using all spectral bands capture factors related to
    both short and long-term effects of variation in LWP. Variability in LWP values
    was captured by VIs in leaves of wheat and maize grown in controlled environments,
    in which only the light intensity was changed for a short time, causing a gradient
    of LWP without a long-term effect on plant biomass (Elsayed et al., 2011). These
    findings support the hypothesis that LWP per se can be assessed using canopy spectral
    reflectance of field-grown plants, as done in the current study. Spectral-based
    remote sensing for precision irrigation The growing global population and climate
    change are intensifying the demand for freshwater, posing a threat to water resources
    and food security. Precision irrigation proves to be an effective method for conserving
    water, optimizing crop yield, and delivering water precisely to meet the spatially
    specific needs of plants in the field. Based on our results, further research
    may need to examine the applicability of both ground and satellite-based models
    to support precision irrigation in chickpea. Lacerda et al. (2022) showed that
    the use of dynamic irrigation management zones determined by predicted plant height
    using green NDVI (GNDVI) improved both water use efficiency and yield. They suggested
    that an estimation of stem water potential from spectral data might further improve
    the performance of their method. Rapaport et al. (2017) and Romero et al. (2018)
    showed the potential of spectral data in vineyards’ irrigation scheduling. Satellite
    platforms such as Sentinel-2 are freely accessible and could be affordable for
    farmers worldwide to use for chickpea LWP assessment. Our result showed the NDSI1600,1730
    is highly sensitive to LWP changes (Fig. 3) thus, a sensor with those bands maintained
    on a tractor, airplane or satellite with adequate spatial resolution might be
    used to generate LWP maps. Similar maps of stem water potential in peach orchard,
    based on thermal imagery, were found sensitive enough for irrigation decision
    making (Katz et al., 2023). The ability to remotely estimate LWP and stem water
    potential can be achieved both, spectrally and thermally. Cohen and Alchanatis
    (2018) concluded that a combined analysis of both methods, spectral and thermal,
    can improve plant water status estimation. For future work, it is hypothesized
    that combining spectral and environmental information will lead to improved irrigation
    decision making in chickpea based on higher estimation accuracy of LWP. Conclusions
    A rapid and high throughput method for chickpea LWP assessment will benefit farmers.
    The current study used spectral reflectance acquired from ground hyperspectral
    sensors and satellite multispectral imagery in both farm and commercial field
    experiments to calibrate and validate LWP and LAI estimation models. LWP and LAI
    were estimated using both VIs and ML techniques. The NDSI using the 1600 and 1730
    nm bands demonstrated the highest LWP assessment ability compared to all examined
    ground-based VIs. It showed similar or better performance than VIs used in previous
    studies in other crops (Table 1). The use of the SWIR region only reduced model
    sensitivity to changes in canopy color and structure. Differences in LWP and NDSI
    (1600,1730) values, reflective of structural changes in canopy density, were detected
    between the irrigation regimes before changes in LAI. These findings, together
    with the low correlation between LWP and LAI values, demonstrated the sensitivity
    of NDSI(1600,1730) to actual LWP. The use of ML improved the assessment accuracy
    of LWP and LAI compared to linear regression using VIs from ground hyperspectral
    and space-borne multispectral imagery. ANN was superior to SVM and PLS-R in assessing
    LWP, especially when using satellite data. The current study promises to set the
    stage for the development of a high-throughput, non-destructive tool to improve
    irrigation scheduling in chickpea fields, with the potential to improve variable
    rate irrigation management. Physiologists and breeders may also use this tool
    to screen for drought-tolerant genotypes. References Ahlrichs, J. S., & Bauer,

    Lower variability among replicates is associated with greater reliability for
    recommending irrigation timing. Eight metrics were presented for variability comparisons
    independent of sensor types and calibration accuracy. One neutron thermalization
    type tended to be less variable than six dielectric types in a comparison at 0.3
    m depth. One granular matrix type tended to be less variable than one dielectric
    type in a comparison across the top 1 m of soil. Abstract. Much of the research
    on irrigation scheduling sensors, especially soil water sensors, assesses and
    refines the accuracy of sensor calibrations. However, a sensor with an accurate
    calibration but high variability among replicates may require a larger-than-acceptable
    number of replicates for informing recommendations of optimal irrigation timing.

    revealed that, on the weekly scale, the hybrid CEEMDAN-RF model (NSE:0.924, LMI:0.811,

    Article 18 March 2024 1 Introduction Researchers, organizations, and policymakers
    face unprecedented challenges in this developing world, such as natural systems,
    environment, agriculture, and water infrastructure systems. They are increasingly
    strained and under threat since the future is uncertain and high stakes. Hazardous
    catastrophic globally events such as recent Covid-19 pandemic, climate related
    disasters, flood, droughts, bushfires, severe storms, are all very tangible crises
    which all threatens the human''s life and have long-lasting effects on economic
    and social aspects. One of the most dangerous events is a flood; the flood may
    cause lots of damage to different sectors of society and humans. Therefore, managing
    streamflow and surface water resources has been one of the goals of water resources
    engineering. So, streamflow forecasting at various time steps has engineering
    purposes such as effective and sustainable water management (flood protection
    and alerts), optimal design of water storage, and water structures like hydropower,
    dams (long term water storage) (Tyralis et al. 2021). Accurate streamflow prediction
    requires detailed knowledge of streamflow dynamics (Tongal 2013; Arriagada et
    al. 2021). In recent years, advancements in data science in hydrology show that
    complex dynamics do not necessarily need to be an outcome of many variables. Therefore,
    scientists use recorded observational and historical data to illuminate their
    understanding of mathematical models also called \"data driven\" techniques (Modarres
    et al. 2014; Zounemat-Kermani et al. 2021). Data-driven models are common because
    of their straightforwardness and robustness (Zuo et al. 2020; Bilgili et al. 2023).
    Hydrologists around the world traditionally use these deterministic and conceptual
    models. Most of the times using data-driven methods for streamflow forecasting
    resulted in nonlinear equations between output streamflow and input features.
    Thus, this issue shed light on using time series models in stream flow forecasting.
    Streamflow forecasting has been a subject of extensive research, and numerous
    methods have been applied to this end. Traditional linear time series models,
    such as autoregressive (AR), AR moving average (ARMA), AR integrated MA (ARIMA),
    and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) have been extensively studied in the literature (Kaur
    et al. 2023; Yap and Musa 2023). However, streamflow, like many other hydrological
    processes, is characterized by dynamic, nonlinear, non-stationary, and highly
    complex behaviors (Attar et al. 2020; Giri and Devercelli 2023). Such intricacies
    necessitate the employment of more powerful tools capable of capturing these complexities.
    In recent years, machine learning (ML) models, which inherently accommodate nonlinear
    behaviors, have emerged as promising tools for streamflow forecasting. Examples
    include support vector machine (SVM) (Katipoğlu et al. 2023), support vector regression
    (SVR) (Fu et al. 2023), gene expression programming (GEP) (Najafzadeh and Anvari
    2023), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) (Sharma et al. 2023), artificial
    neural networks (ANN) (Oad et al. 2023), Bayesian regression (BR) (Moknatian and
    Mukundan 2023), and fuzzy inference systems (FIS) (Asaad et al. 2022). Moreover,
    ensemble techniques such as classification and regression trees, including boosted
    regression trees (BRTs) (Latif and Ahmed 2023), classification and regression
    trees (CART) (Yeoh et al. 2023), random forest (RF) (Islam et al. 2023), M5 tree
    (Merufinia et al. 2023), and reduced error pruning tree (REP) (Mohamed et al.
    2012), have gained traction for their efficacy in forecasting hydrological variables.
    Though sole models of ML may not be enough for modelling non-stationary streamflow
    time series with many noise components without preprocessing techniques, researchers
    are searching for better, tranquil, less time-consuming, and accurate techniques.
    To increase models '' accuracy, they use different models in different ways, such
    as de-noising or hybridizing techniques. Prior to applying machine learning techniques
    to streamflow data, preprocessing, particularly de-noising, can be an essential
    step. Through the use of these preprocessing techniques, we can simplify the multiscale
    features of the data, allowing machine learning algorithms to operate more efficiently
    and to produce more accurate results. Preprocessing techniques include the following:
    1. Data filtering: Streamflow data can be smoothed out by using techniques such
    as moving averages or median filters. 2. By using the wavelet transform, a signal
    is broken down into its constituent scales or frequencies, which can be used to
    reduce noise in a targeted manner. 3. A number of statistical methods can be used
    to stabilize variance, including outlier detection and Box-Cox transformations.
    4. A signal can be decomposed into its intrinsic mode functions. Preprocessing
    can be beneficial to a variety of machine learning techniques, however, some preprocessing
    techniques might be particularly useful for certain machine learning models. To
    maximize performance, it is important that the preprocessing technique and the
    machine learning model are paired appropriately. For instance, many decomposition
    ensemble methods such as continuous wavelet transform (CWT), maximum entropy spectral
    analysis (MESA) (Cui and Singh 2016), singular spectrum analysis (SSA), Fourier
    transform (FT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), ensemble empirical mode decomposition
    (EEMD), Fast Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (FEEMD), Regularized Extreme
    Learning Machine (RELM), intrinsic Time-scale decomposition (ITD), variational
    mode decomposition (VMD), single model forecasting (SF) were commonly used as
    a time series preprocessing techniques to forecast streamflow in which they decompose
    the original observation data into some simpler sub-signals. Wu and Chau (2011)
    developed a modular artificial neural network (MANN) model coupled with SSA preprocessing
    methods for rainfall-runoff modelling in two river basins, Daning and Lushui,
    in China. They found that SSA could significantly improve model accuracy. Feng
    et al. (2020) predicted runoff time series on a monthly scale utilizing VMD (for
    decomposing original series), SVM, ELM, and ANN models, and the quantum-based
    practical swarm optimization methods. They used the streamflow data as the output
    of the models from two reservoirs in China''s Yangtze Valley. They found that
    the hybrid models had better forecasting results than the other models. Li et
    al. (2020) proposed four preprocessing techniques, including CWT, cross wavelet
    transform, wavelet coherence, and wavelet cross-correlation, for exploring the
    relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought. They tried to find
    the best distribution function for streamflow of Shaying River Basin in China.
    Niu et al. (2020) considered modelling annual runoff data using a hybrid model
    of evolutionary extreme learning machine (EELM) and VMD (as a preprocessing method).
    Time series of three substantial hydropower reservoirs in China were selected
    annually for this purpose. They declared that hybrid models outperformed the stand-alone
    models. Zuo et al. (2020) implemented VMD as a decomposition and single-model
    forecasting (SF) along with long short-term memory (LSTM) models to predict streamflow
    on a scale of 1–7 days ahead in Han River and Jing River, China. They addressed
    that the hybrid SF-VMD-LSTM method is a convenient model for predicting streamflow.
    Apaydin et al. (2021) investigated the potential of SSA, Seasonal-Trend decomposition
    using Loess (STL), and conducted feature selection models along with the neural
    network (NN) methods in predicting monthly streamflow. The results showed that
    the SSA decomposition increased the monthly streamflow prediction accuracy between
    5.11% and 24.11% based on NSE. Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition
    with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) was successfully applied to precisely decompose
    the original input/output variables into some Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)
    for instance Ahmadi et al. (2022) utilized Random Forest (RF) as a primary model
    and then proposed two hybrid models by integrating RF with complete ensemble empirical
    mode decomposition (CEEMDN) and wavelet analysis (WA) on estimating monthly inflow
    to the Maroon Dam reservoir. Spectral separation of intrinsic mode functions is
    the important advantage of IMFs with a few mathematical calculations. This study
    proposes a new uncertainty quantification-based forecasting method in different
    daily streamflow data sets by reducing noise and hybridizing with different tree
    models. Since this algorithm can reduce the non-stationary characteristics of
    the time series, CEEMDAN is also get over the non-stationary data problem by decomposing
    original input data into sub-series called IMFs. Therefore, to the authors'' knowledge
    and related literature review, there are no published studies related to applying
    tree models coupling with the data-decomposing algorithm (i.e., CEEMDAN) for modelling
    streamflow time series. For this, daily streamflow data of Gazvin city in Iran
    is considered and aimed to recommend different state of the art findings such
    as (1) Considering data cleaning techniques along with preprocessing tests, 2)
    Assessing noise reduction techniques as one of the data preprocessing techniques
    which they remove useless noise from data and channel smoothed-out data to the
    model, 3) Presentation of new practical noise-tree hybrid models for accuracy
    increasing, 4) Assessing the effect of weekly and fortnight scale on the modeling
    performance, 5) Forecast horizons: streamflow forecasting at different time-steps
    based on the requirements. The prediction time-steps should be carefully considered
    because of the variable properties of the time series, such as trend, cyclical,
    seasonal, and random components of data models affected by the scales. Here, streamflow
    was forecasted at weekly and biweekly horizons with the novel mentioned above
    model, considering daily data. 2 Material and Methods The study area and flowchart,
    the first phase of data preprocessing approaches and specific tests with their
    methodologies, the second phase of data preprocessing methods with noise reduction
    techniques here, and Tree-based models including M5 tree, random forest, and REP
    tree methodologies are covered in this section. 2.1 Study Area The study area,
    Gazvin watershed (49° 50′ 1′′ to 50° 3′ 33′′ E and 35° 42′ 52′′ to 35° 52′ 57′′
    N) is located in the southern part of Gazvin Province, Iran. Haji Arab hydrometric
    station over Haji Arab River (located in the west of Bouin-Zahra city) at the
    watershed outlet used to record and collect the streamflow data. Figure 1 shows
    the study area. Fig. 1 The location of the selected rivers and hydrometric station
    Full size image Based on the mean annual rainfall of the watershed (316 mm/year)
    and the annual average temperature (14 °C), the climate of the watershed based
    on the Domarten method is classified as cold and semi-arid (http://qazvinmet.ir/)
    while the most portion of the rain falls in winter. Haji Arab river flows from
    south to north, and it initiates from the central mountains to Sagz Abad. Haji
    Arab river is a permanent river and flows in all seasons. It also has an annual
    flow of 28 MCM (Naderi et al. 2021). The river is the primary source of irrigation
    of nearby agricultural lands, supplies water of the whole watershed, and reaches
    salt marsh in the Gazvin watershed (Khakestari et al. 2021). More information
    about Gazvin plain with water resources characteristics can be found at Naderi
    et al. (2021). 2.2 Used Data Daily streamflow data recorded at Haji Arab station
    from 1969 to 2020 was used in the present study. Data sets were separated into
    two groups: weekly data (averages of data in weeks) and fortnight (averages of
    data in two weeks). The statistical parameters of the data are shown in Table
    1. These parameters include minimum, first quartile, median, mean, third quartile,
    maximum, skewness, and kurtosis of data. All the calculations were done in R software
    with \"summary\", \"skewness,\" and \"kurtosis\" functions. As shown in Table
    1, the maximum streamflow is 19.8 m3/s for the weekly scale and 17.45 m3/s for
    the fortnight scale. Table 2 illustrates the model formulation details of data,
    which consists of model inputs, output, the number of runs, and the number of
    train and test data. The data were separated into two parts: training and testing
    series. For weekly data in the training phase, 80% of streamflow data were used
    (2154 raw data), and the remaining part (539 raw data) was applied for testing
    data. Besides, for fortnight data in the training phase, 1078 raw data (80% of
    the data) and 270 raw data (20%) were considered for model training and testing,
    respectively. Four weeks ahead forecasts were performed for weekly data, while
    two weeks ahead forecasts were considered for fortnight data. Table 1 Basic descriptive
    statistics of streamflow characteristics in two different scales of weekly and
    fortnight-separated data Full size table Table 2 Model formulation details (Inputs,
    output, number of train and test data) Full size table 2.3 Study Flowchart The
    flowchart of streamflow forecasting is summarized in the following steps and presented
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Schematic flowchart of the study (structure of stand-alone tree
    models and hybrid CEEMDAN-tree models) Full size image Step 1) Daily streamflow
    data were collected from Haji Arab hydrometric station. Step 2) Streamflow time
    series data were divided into two weekly and fortnight scale subsegments. Step
    3) The first phase of data preprocessing consisting of the Run test, Mann Kendal
    test, Pettitt test, and Bartels test was conducted on raw data to find the randomness,
    trend, stationary (sudden changes in data series), and randomness in trend for
    streamflow time series data respectively. Step 4) Streamflow signal data is divided
    into a training set (80% of data) and a testing set (which is the remaining portion,
    20% of the data). Although there are no common rules for dataset division, 80:20
    is the most used ratio for training and testing datasets by researchers and data
    scientists (Khosravi et al. 2021). Step 5) Decompose streamflow training set into
    different signals IMFs using CEEMDAN algorithms. Step 6) Partial autocorrelation
    function (PACF) plots were examined to find the best predictors for the hybrid
    model trees (RF, REP tree, and M5 tree). Step 7) The prediction power of sole
    models was compared to the hybrid models (CEEMDAN-RF, CEEMDAN-M5 tree, CEEMDAN-REP
    tree). 2.4 Data Preprocessing Approaches-First Phase (Data Cleaning) In this research,
    R scripts were employed for data preprocessing of streamflow datasets. We utilized
    the DescTools package for the Run test and the Trend package for the Mann-Kendall,
    Pettitt, and Bartels tests (Mateus and Caeiro 2014). Table 3 illustrate diverse
    preprocessing techniques applied to weekly and fortnightly data. The Run test
    assesses data randomness and autocorrelation non-parametrically. It tests the
    correlation of streamflow data with its lagged values. The results in Table 3
    indicate the rejection of the null hypothesis at a 95% significance level, signifying
    distinct distributions between the two series (Razmkhah 2017). The Mann-Kendall
    trend test, also non-parametric, identifies positive or negative trends over time.
    As shown in Table 3, significant trends (upwards) in both weekly and fortnightly
    data. Pettitt''s non-parametric test detects shifts in the central tendency of
    time series. Table 3 reveals the rejection of the null hypothesis within a 95%
    confidence interval for both weekly and fortnightly data. Bartels test, a non-parametric
    counterpart of von Neumann''s ratio test, examines randomness versus non-randomness.

    with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) The CEEMDAN was developed from the empirical mode
    decomposition (EEMD) method. The EEMD method is an adaptive approach that treats
    the mean as the final result by sifting white noise data. EEMD is a time-space-based
    analysis technique, and the white noise is averaged based on some trials. This
    added white noise affects the frame in time and space and gathers the portion
    of the incomparable signal scale in each IMF. EEMD is given by the popular EMD
    method. The EMD technique is a self-adaptive decomposition algorithm without initial
    knowledge about IMFs and their count. This method has some drawbacks in terms
    of mode mixing. EEMD is a method that overcomes the mode mixing issue. EEMD also
    has disadvantages, such as the Gaussian white noise not being canceled after error
    construction, the high cost of computational processes, and many siftings (trials).
    The CEEMDAN enhances this issue, declines the number of trials, and considers
    the mode mixing problem. The formula for the calculation of CEEMDAN is as follows
    steps: 1. The collection of white noise series was added to the signal like: $${S}^{i}\\left(n\\right)=S\\left(n\\right)+{\\varepsilon
    }_{0}{V}^{i}(n)$$ (1) In which i is the number of trials, \\(S\\left(n\\right)\\)
    is the original signal, and the white Gaussian noise series is demonstrated as
    \\({V}^{i}(n)\\) 2. The first IMF is calculated as: $${IMF}_{1}\\left(n\\right)=\\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^{I}{IMF}_{1}^{i}(n))}{I}$$
    (2) 3. The first residue \\({r}_{1}\\left(n\\right)\\) and k-th residuals are
    calculated by: $${r}_{1}\\left(n\\right)= S\\left(n\\right)-{IMF}_{1}\\left(n\\right)$$
    (3) $${r}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\left(n\\right)= S\\left(n\\right)-{IMF}_{k}\\left(n\\right)$$
    4. The (k + 1)-th IMF can be calculated as Eq. 4: $${IMF}_{k+1}\\left(n\\right)=\\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^{I}{E}_{1}({r}_{k}\\left(n\\right)+{\\varepsilon
    }_{k}{E}_{k}({V}^{i}(n))}{I}$$ (4) In which \\({E}_{k}(0)\\) is the k-th mode
    of the EMD model. 5. These steps continue until all the IMFs are found (Liu et
    al. 2018). 2.6 Tree Models Based on (Papadopoulos et al. 2017), tree-based models
    gained significant interest from researchers between ensemble learning methods,
    which combine both ML and statistical characteristics of data simultaneously.
    They are broadly applicable and reliable models. This study uses the M5 tree,
    random forest (RF), and REP tree as three important methods. 2.6.1 M5 Tree Model
    The M5 tree model was first introduced by Quinlan (1992). This model is one of
    the data-driven methods that subsets data based on recursive partitioning inputs
    into space principal utilizing the entropy measurements. This model splits the
    space into subsets and builds an ordinary linear regression model with each. M5
    tree functions as a decision tree with linear functions at the leaves, which this
    feature helps to predict continuous numeric characteristics. The M5 tree model
    can challenge high-dimension problems. M5 tree model structure is as follows:
    Consider having a collection of T training examples, each of which has its output
    value. The aim is to build a model that relates the output value of training examples
    with their input attributes. \"Divide-and-conquer\" is the base method of tree
    models. The T set is associated with the leaf or splits into subsets to test the
    results. This splitting is based on each node''s standard deviation reduction
    (SDR). The equation for SDR is: $$\\mathrm{SDR}=\\mathrm{SD}(\\mathrm T)-{\\textstyle\\sum_i}\\frac{\\left|T_i\\right|}{\\left|T\\right|}sd(T_i)$$
    (5) In which T shows a set of examples that reaches each node, \\({T}_{i}\\) show
    the subsets at the ith of potential sets, and sd represents the standard deviation.
    All possible splits were examined, and M5 picked the one which maximizes the error
    reduction. When all examples reach a node, splitting M5 stops. The smoothing process
    is accomplished at the final step to compensate for sharp cutoffs of linear models
    at the leaves of the pruned tree. The flowchart of the M5 tree method is demonstrated
    in Fig. 3. For more information (Quinlan 1992) is an excellent resource. Fig.
    3 The flow chart of the M5 tree model Full size image 2.6.2 Random Forest Model
    The random forest model is one of the user-friendly, unsupervised learning ML
    techniques used for prediction and was first introduced by Breiman et al. (1984).
    Target values are predicted by a group of classification and regression trees
    with binary splitting. As shown in the flowchart (Fig. 4), this model has some
    steps: 1) some samples with the bootstrap method are selected, 2) an unpruned
    tree for each bootstrap sample is grown, 3) the predictors at each node are randomly
    chosen, 4) the best split is selected among all predictors (Zounemat-Kermani et
    al. 2020). The number of trees and variables are the most crucial parameters in
    the RF model, which the user defines. Further information about the RF model can
    be found in (Breiman et al. 1984). Fig. 4 The flow chart of the random forest
    model Full size image 2.6.3 Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REP Tree Model) Reduced
    Error Pruning Tree is one of the simple forms of decision tree based on \"if-then\"
    rules between inputs and outputs, and the model considered Numeric attributes.
    This model was first introduced by Breiman et al. (1984). REP tree is a fast learning
    model that creates a regression tree with variance and prunes it by reduced error.
    It is also effective when much data is available for training and testing sets
    (Mohamed et al. 2012). The flowchart of the model is represented in Fig. 5. Fig.
    5 The flow chart of the REP tree model Full size image 2.7 Statistical Performance
    Criteria The acceptance and reliability of proposed models need to be evaluated
    and assessed models'' performance. Therefore, several statistical criteria were
    implemented as Eqs. (6–10). 1. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) gives the standard
    deviation of errors. This criterion has the range of (0, +∞), and the ideal value
    should be 0 or near 0. $$RMSE=\\sqrt{\\frac1n{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^n}{\\lbrack
    Q_{obs}-Q_m\\rbrack}^2}$$ (6) 2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) provides information
    about average variances between modeled and historical data. This criterion has
    the range of (0, +∞), and the ideal value should be 0 or near 0. $$MAE=\\frac1n{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^n}\\left|Q_{obs}-Q_m\\right|$$
    (7) 3. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) is used to find the best fit between modeled
    and historical data. This criterion can be positive or negative; negative means
    the model performs poorly compared to the arithmetic mean. NSE has a range of
    (0, 1), and the ideal value should be 1. $$NSE = 1- \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{[Q}_{obs}-{Q}_{m}]}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{[Q}_{obs}-\\overline{{Q
    }_{obs}}]}^{2}}$$ (8) 4. Willmott''s Index of agreement (WI) is a criterion that
    measures the error in the model. It has a range of (0, 1), and the ideal value
    should be 1. $$WI = 1-[ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({Q}_{obs}-{Q}_{m})}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(\\left|{Q}_{m}-\\overline{{Q
    }_{obs}}\\right|+\\left|{Q}_{obs}-\\overline{{Q }_{obs}}\\right|)}^{2}}$$ (9)
    5. Legates-McCabe''s Index (LMI) ranges between (-∞, 1), and the ideal value is
    1. This criterion gives variances and errors with appropriate weights. $$LMI =
    1-[\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|{Q}_{m}-\\overline{{Q }_{m}}\\right|}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|{Q}_{obs}-\\overline{{Q
    }_{obs}}\\right|}$$ (10) In which \\({Q}_{obs}\\) and \\({Q}_{m}\\) are observed
    and modeled Q values, respectively, \\(\\overline{{Q }_{obs}}\\) and \\(\\overline{{Q
    }_{m}}\\) represent the mean of observed and modeled Q values, respectively, and
    N is the number of streamflow time series. 3 Results and Discussion In this study,
    sole tree models (M5 tree, RF, and REP tree) are implemented on two different
    time scales of streamflow data, and the results were compared to brand new hybrid
    forecasting models (i.e., CEEMDAN-M5 tree, CEEMDAN-RF, and CEEMDAN-REP tree).
    The hybrid models are designed to eliminate the stationarity and randomness of
    sole models. 3.1 Sole Model Implications Results The efficiency of sole models
    on Haji Abad River was investigated by time series figures shown in Fig. 6. The
    figure demonstrates observed values and the results of the sole M5 tree, RF, and
    REP tree models versus time for both weekly and fortnight time scales. As shown
    in this figure, the x-axis demonstrates the time with respect to month and the
    y-axis shows the observed streamflow values (m3/s) without any preprocessing techniques.
    The blue line, purple pink and black lines shows the M5T, RF, REP Tree models
    and observed streamflow values respectively. Fig. 6 Haji Arab Station sole tree

    Full size image 3.2 Preliminaries for De-noising with Complete Ensemble Empirical
    Mode Decomposition Results CEEMDAN method decomposes the original streamflow time
    series into IMFs and residuals. To achieve IMFs, the number of local extrema must
    be equal to one. Figure 7 shows the local extrema of weekly and fortnight streamflow
    time series. The main aim of calculating local extreme is to create the first
    IMF. CEEMDAN method also decomposes original data for N different positive and
    negative pairs of white noises to generate complementary IMFs (Wu et al. 2020).
    Fig. 7 Weekly and fortnight local extrema of streamflow time series with the unit
    of days Full size image In the first step, streamflow data were separately decomposed
    into subseries of training and test. The decomposition of all weekly and fortnight
    data was demonstrated in Figs. 8 and 9, which are 10 IMFs for weekly data and
    9 IMFs for fortnight data, and each has one residual. Next, each tree model (M5
    tree, RF, and REP tree) was employed on each IMF and a residual component. To
    model, the ACF and PACF functions (Table 4) were applied to data to find the optimum
    lag for modeling data series. Finally, all the estimated models were summed up
    to generate a modeled Q time series. As shown in Table 4, by utilizing the pacf
    function, each IMF has its lag for modeling with tree models. Fig. 8 IMFs and
    residual for weekly streamflow using the CEEMDAN method Full size image Fig. 9

    Full size table 3.3 Stand-alone and Hybrid Tree Models The findings of tree models
    and hybrid CEEMDAN-tree models were demonstrated in Table 5 for both weekly and
    fortnight scales. The metrics of MAE, RMSE, NSE, LMI, and WI have been given in
    each table. From Table 5, for sole models on a weekly scale, it can be understood
    that the sole M5 tree model has the best performance among the other two methods
    based on six statistical metrics. Another important point is that based on RMSE,
    R2, MAE, NSE, LMI, and WI metrics; the hybrid CEEMDAN-RF has the best accuracy
    between hybrid models. At the weekly scale, Haji Arab streamflow modeled values
    have the MAE = 0.14 (m3/s), RMSE = 0.309 (m3/s), NSE = 0.924, LMI = 0.811 and
    WI = 0.905. This study aims to determine which hybrid model has better results
    than its sole model. Considering random forest model as a stand-alone model for
    streamflow forecasting, it has MAE = 0.254 (m3/s), RMSE = 0.740 (m3/s), NSE = 0.611,
    LMI = 0.558 and WI = 0.771 while considering hybrid CEEMDAN-RF has the results
    of MAE = 0.140 (m3/s), RMSE = 0.309 (m3/s), NSE = 0.924, LMI = 0.811 and WI = 0.905
    in testing phase. In brief, de-noising has the best result on the random forest
    method on the weekly scale because it decreases the error while increasing the
    NSE, LMI, and WI index coefficients. Table 5 Statistical performance of sole and
    hybrid CEEMDAN-tree models on the weekly and fortnight scales Full size table
    As demonstrated in Table 5, considering stand-alone tree models in modeling streamflow
    at a fortnight scale, the M5 tree model has the lowest error (MAE = 0.247 m3/s,
    RMSE = 0.636 m3/s) and highest LMI and WI (LMI = 0.565, WI = 0.766). Thus, the
    M5 tree has the highest performance compared to the other RF and REP tree models.
    Also, considering the hybrid model, the CEEMDAN-M5 tree gave more accurate results
    than the other two CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMDAN-REP tree models with MAE = 0.321 (m3/s),
    RMSE = 0.586 (m3/s), NSE = 0.714, LMI = 0.504, and WI = 0.728. In brief, the hybrid
    CEEMDAN-M5 tree has the best performance and accuracy for modeling streamflow
    on a fortnight scale. Taylor diagrams are utilized in this study to compare the
    performance of models. It is a visualization technique that helps cluster models
    based on their standard deviation and correlation (Taylor et al. 2012). Taylor’s
    diagram for both weekly and fortnight scales was demonstrated in Fig. 10a, b.
    Table 5 show that all stand-alone models and hybrid were compared with observed
    points (observed streamflow data). The closest point to the reference point indicates
    the highest-performing models. On a weekly scale, CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMDAN-REP were
    the highest performed. The CEEMDAN-M5 tree is closer to the observed point on
    a fortnight scale. The represented points of the M5 tree, CEEMDAN-RF, are close
    to each other, showing their performance was similar. Fig. 10 Model performance
    and comparison through Taylor diagram for a weekly scale and b for fortnight scale
    Full size image 4 Discussion Streamflow forecasting is a critical concern in the
    contemporary era, given its role in identifying patterns and mitigating extreme
    events such as floods. Achieving accurate predictions in light of the stochastic
    and complex nature of hydrological data, especially streamflow data, has compelled
    researchers to explore novel approaches. Despite these efforts, there is currently
    no comprehensive and universally accurate model, algorithm, or guideline for streamflow
    prediction. Researchers worldwide have utilized data-driven and machine-learning
    techniques to model streamflow in various river stations, often incorporating
    preprocessing and data cleaning techniques. In this study, we focused on streamflow
    prediction in Iran''s Gazvin watershed, specifically at Haji Arab river. We applied
    three notable standalone tree models: Random Forest (RF), M5 tree, and REP tree,
    for streamflow forecasting over one-week and two-week time scales. We then combined
    denoised streamflow data series with these tree models to address the non-linearity
    and non-stationarity inherent in streamflow data. The integration of the Complete
    Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm
    significantly enhanced the accuracy of our streamflow modeling. 5 Conclusions
    The key findings of this study can be summarized as follows: Standalone tree models,
    particularly the M5 tree model, demonstrated remarkable efficiency and accuracy
    in streamflow forecasting for both weekly and fortnightly scales. The CEEMDAN
    method effectively tackled the issue of mode mixing, ensuring physically meaningful
    and statistically robust Independent Mode Functions (IMFs) for improved data decomposition.
    The optimal number of IMFs varied with the time scale of the data, with 10 IMFs
    for weekly data and 9 IMFs for fortnightly data, highlighting the need for tailored
    decomposition strategies. The choice of lags in time series modeling, determined
    by Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), significantly influenced model performance.
    A specific lag, such as ''a 5-day lag,'' was identified as optimal, ensuring that
    recent changes had the most significant impact on streamflow predictions. Hybrid
    models, specifically CEEMDAN-RF for the weekly scale and CEEMDAN-M5 tree for the
    fortnight scale, outperformed all other models, demonstrating their effectiveness
    in streamflow prediction. Overall, the results highlight that CEEMDAN-integrated
    tree models exhibited the highest accuracy when considering five critical statistical
    criteria. Nonetheless, it is essential to acknowledge the complexity and implementation
    challenges associated with this model. Expert staff is required for the model''s
    use in the basin, which may not align with the practical needs of surface water
    resource managers. Future studies should focus on improving model accuracy through
    additional preprocessing or feature selection techniques. The exploration of two-phase
    decomposition may further enhance denoising accuracy and optimize IMFs with high
    frequency while reducing modeling time. The findings of this study have practical
    applications for water resources scientists, policymakers, and managers in Iranian
    water resource organizations, particularly in the realm of flood forecasting and
    management. Data Availability Data are available on request due to privacy or

  description: Crop modeling is a valuable tool in agricultural research for studying
    the response of plants to environmental parameters. The purpose of this study
    was to assess the precision of the SALTMED model in simulating the growth and
    yield of rapeseed under different levels of irrigation water and soil salinity
    in a semi-arid region. The normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe
    efficiency coefficient (EF), and index of agreement (d) for grain yield simulation
    were 0.052, 0.917, and 0.96, respectively, at the calibration stage of the model,
    and 0.054, 0.881, and 0.96, respectively, at the validation stage. The results
    showed that the accuracy of the model was satisfactory and acceptable in simulating
    the grain yield and dry matter of rapeseed, as well as the soil water content
    and soil salinity. Therefore, the results of this study can be used for modeling
    the effect of climate change and abiotic environmental parameter variations such
    as terrain, climate, and soil and water properties on agricultural production
    systems. However, there were some discrepancies observed between the measured
    and estimated data for soil water content simulation. Some possible defects in
    the model theory that may contribute to its inaccuracy were discussed.

    SALTMED Model and Its Application on Field Crops, Different Water and Field Management
    and Under Current and Future Climate Change Chapter © 2017 Introduction The world’s
    population and demand for food have increased significantly in recent decades,
    leading to a corresponding increase in agriculture. However, this increase has
    had many environmental effects. On the other hand, changes in environmental parameters
    caused by climate change, such as rising temperatures and water scarcity, have
    led to changes in crop yields and agricultural production. Therefore, understanding
    the two-way interaction between agriculture and the environment is crucial (Ahmed
    and Ahmad 2020; Ahmed 2022; Islam et al. 2020). Plant modeling is one of the most
    useful tools for achieving this goal (Kumar et al. 2017; Sunil et al. 2021), but
    the accuracy of these models is impressive. Researchers are continuously working
    to improve the accuracy of plant models to better understand the complex interactions
    between plants and their environment. After cereals, oilseeds have the second-highest
    rank based on food reserves in the world. Rapeseed is one of the oilseed crops
    used for producing edible oil, with approximately 40% oil content, it ranks second
    among oilseed crops in the world (Rabiee et al. 2021). Over the past decade, rapeseed
    production in Iran has witnessed a significant increase, as the country imports
    more than 90% of its edible oils. As a result, rapeseed production has increased
    2.7 times (Shadidi et al. 2022). Rapeseed is cultivated in different regions in
    Iran with various climate conditions such as Isfahan, Khuzestan, Khorasan, Golestan
    and Mazandaran. These regions experience a range of climates, from hyper-arid
    and arid to semi-arid, Mediterranean, and humid conditions (Shadidi et al. 2022).
    Increasing rapeseed cultivation as an autumn crop in Iran is due to its compatibility
    with different meteorological conditions, use of winter rainfall, high oil content
    and quality, and no competition with summer crops. There is a great hope that
    rapeseed cultivation will result in self-sufficiency and sustainable production
    of edible oils in Iran (Amiri et al. 2019). Proper irrigation scheduling is essential
    for providing sufficient soil water content to support normal growth and development
    of rapeseed during the growing season (Poddar et al. 2021; Soleymani 2022). Drought
    and salinity stress decrease plant height, leaf area, leaf photosynthesis, shoot
    growth, and ultimately grain yield of rapeseed (Rehman et al. 2022; Wang et al.
    2021; Ahamed et al. 2021). Previous studies have shown that deficit irrigation
    saves water, increases water productivity, and is an effective irrigation management
    strategy (Safi et al. 2019; Katuwal et al. 2020; Pathak and Stoddard 2018). However,
    in the arid and semi-arid climatic regions, deficit irrigation leads to an increase
    in soil salinity due to salt accumulation. Salinization and alkalinization are
    major threats in dry and range land degradation. They are also a major process
    of loss of agricultural land and crop yield that threatens food security in Iran
    (Barati et al. 2015; Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi et al. 2014). To ensure the quality
    and sustainability of soil, it is essential to adopt appropriate irrigation management
    strategies (Ding et al. 2020). Under salinity conditions, quantifying water depletion
    from the root zone of the plant to determine the precise time of irrigation and
    amount of irrigation water is crucial. The soil water budget has been applied
    to quantify water depletion from the plant root zone (Amer 2010). Determining
    root zone depletion of water typically involves conducting field experiments,
    which can be both time-consuming and expensive. Alternatively, crop growth models
    can be used to simulate this process (Ahmadi et al. 2022). The effects of salinity
    on the soil and environment, on the other hand, are gradual and long-term, and
    may not be immediately apparent. For this reason, models are employed alongside
    field and greenhouse experiments to predict the long-term effects of salinity
    on soil and the environment, plant performance, and soil water content and salinity
    under various irrigation management and leaching requirements. The SALTMED is
    one of the models used by researchers, irrigation engineers, and agronomists to
    assess irrigation practices for increasing crop water productivity under water
    and soil salinity conditions (Ranjbar et al. 2015; Noshadi et al. 2020). SALTMED
    is a water-driven, physically-based, and user-friendly crop growth model (Präger
    et al. 2019; Soothar et al. 2019). This model estimates the crop biomass and yield
    based on a relationship between water uptake and biomass by simulating evapotranspiration,
    plant water uptake, water, nitrogen, and solute transport in the root zone (Flowers
    et al. 2005). The SALTMED model has been used for different crops such as maize
    (Karandish and Šimůnek 2019), wheat (Noshadi et al. 2020), tomato (Alkhasha and
    Al-Omran 2019), potato (Al-Omran et al. 2020), quinoa (Peyghan et al. 2020), etc.
    It has also been used for different water application strategies such as different
    irrigation water levels and deficit irrigation at different crop growth stages,
    soil types, rainfed and irrigated agriculture, presence or absence of shallow
    groundwater, irrigation systems, and various water qualities (El-Shafei and Mattar
    2022; Alghamdi et al. 2022; Noshadi et al. 2020). The above studies report that
    the SALTMED can successfully and precisely simulate the yield of different crops
    practically under saline water irrigation. However, using SALTMED to simulate
    the yield and growth of rapeseed has received no attention. Therefore, this study
    aims to model the growth and yield of rapeseed using the SALTMED model under different
    levels of irrigation water and salinity. The results of this study can be used
    for modeling irrigation management and finding proper irrigation scheduling to
    mitigate the negative effect of co-occurring drought and salinity stresses on
    rapeseed yield by SALTMED. Material and methods Field experiment The data used
    in this study were gathered from two field experiments carried out in the 2009–2010
    and 2010–2011 growing seasons (Shabani et al. 2013a, b) at the Experimental Research
    Station in the School of Agricultural, Shiraz University, Islamic Republic of
    Iran (29◦ 36′ N, 52◦ 32′ E) at 1810 m above sea level (Fig. 1). The experimental
    site has a semi-arid climate condition. Due to the groundwater depth of more than
    100 m and proper natural drainage, there is no risk of waterlogging in the soil
    of the studied area (Ahmadi et al. 2022). Minimum, mean, and maximum daily temperature
    and relative humidity, reference evapotranspiration, and rainfall in two growing
    seasons are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Tables 1 and 2 provide detailed information
    on the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil and water used in this
    study (Shabani et al. 2013a). Rainfall and other meteorological data during the
    period of the study were collected from a meteorological station close to the
    experimental field (about 400 m and 20 m in the first and second year, respectively,
    Fig. 1). The accumulated rainfall was 298 and 258.3 mm for the first and second
    year, respectively. Fig. 1 Location of the two experimental fields Full size image

    water used in the experiment Full size table In the second year, the experiment
    was repeated in a nearby field that had similar soil and water characteristics
    as the first year''s field. The experimental design followed a split-plot arrangement
    within a randomized complete block design, with the irrigation regime as the main
    factor and the salinity levels of water as the sub-factor in three replications.
    The study involved three different irrigation regimes, including full irrigation
    (crop water requirement + 20% leaching fraction, FI), as well as deficit irrigation
    at 75% (0.75FI) and 50% (0.5FI) of FI in 2009–2010, and at 65% (0.65FI) and 35%
    (0.35FI) of FI in 2010–2011. The irrigation water salinity treatments consisted
    of 0.6 (well water), 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 dS m−1 in the first year and 0.6, 4.0,
    8.0, and 12.0 dS m−1 in the second year. Saline water was prepared by adding sodium
    chloride and calcium chloride to the well water with the same equivalent proportion.
    Plot dimensions for individual sub-plots were 3 × 4 m2. To prevent water from
    one plot invading another, a distance of one meter was maintained between adjacent
    plots. Rapeseed (cv. Talaieh) seeds were sown in each plot in 5 rows with 50 cm
    row spacing and an 8.0 kg ha−1 seed planting rate on September 27, 2009, and September
    28, 2010. To ensure sufficient nitrogen fertility, 150 kg urea ha−1 was applied
    in three equal splits. The first application was done during plowing, followed
    by another application before the stems began to elongate, and finally, a third
    application was done during the flowering stage. Every plot was also given 100
    kg of triple superphosphate per hectare. The method described by the U.S. Salinity
    Laboratory Staff (USDA 1954) was used to determine the electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturated extract. Soil samples were collected from each plot four
    times during the growing season in the first year (149, 189, 223, and 255 days
    after planting) and three times in the second year (186, 226, and 255 days after
    planting). The samples were taken at intervals of 0.3 m, reaching a depth of 0.9
    m. The SALTMED model simulates soil salinity based on the electrical conductivity
    of soil water solution. However, to obtain the electrical conductivity of soil
    saturated extract, the following calculation was performed (Smedema and Rycroft
    1983): $${\\theta }_{s}\\times {EC}_{e}={EC}_{sw}\\times {\\theta }_{m}$$ (1)
    where ECsw is the electrical conductivity of soil water solution (dS m−1), ECe
    is the electrical conductivity of soil saturated extract (dS m−1), θs is the soil
    water content at saturation (cm3 cm−3) and θm is the soil water content at which
    ECsw is derived (cm3 cm−3). Before harvest, dry matter and leaf area index and
    after harvest seed yield and whole dry matter were determined. To determine dry
    matter during the growing season, three plants were randomly cut at ground level
    and placed in an oven at 72 C (48 h) to determine dry weight. At harvest, the
    seed yield and total dry matter were determined by harvesting plants from the
    three central rows of each plot. Irrigation performance The plots were regularly
    watered every 10 days and 7 days during the winter and spring seasons, respectively.
    Prior to each irrigation event, the neutron scattering method was used for measuring
    soil water content at depths of 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 m. Based on measured
    soil water content in full irrigation treatment, the amount of net irrigation
    water was calculated as follows: $$d_{n} = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\left(
    {\\theta_{fci} - \\theta_{i} } \\right)\\Delta z_{i} }$$ (2) where dn represents
    the net irrigation water depth (m), Өfci and Өi represent the volumetric soil
    water content in layer i at field capacity and before irrigation, respectively
    (m3 m−3), Δz is the thickness of the soil layer (m) and n is the total number
    of soil layers. The root depth, which varied during the growing season, was estimated
    as follows: (Borg and Grimes 1986): $$Z_{r} = R_{DM} \\left[ {0.5 + 0.5\\sin \\left(
    {\\frac{{3.03D_{as} }}{{D_{tm} }} - 1.47} \\right)} \\right]$$ (3) where Zr is
    the root depth (m), RDM is the maximum root depth (0.9 m), Das is the number of
    days from planting, Dtm is the number of days from planting to maximum effective
    root depth (214 d). A leaching fraction of 20% was used to reduce salt build-up
    in the root zone. Irrigation water depth was determined as follows: $${d}_{g}=\\frac{{d}_{n}}{(1-{L}_{f})}$$
    (4) where dg is the gross irrigation water depth, dn is the net irrigation water
    depth and Lf is the leaching fraction. To compute the irrigation water volume,
    the irrigation water depth (dg) was multiplied by the plot area. Irrigation was
    carried out using a flexible hose, and the volume of water received by each plot
    was controlled using a volumetric flow water meter. To ensure uniform seed germination
    and vegetation stands, the first three irrigation events in all treatments were
    similar and equivalent to the amount of water applied in the FI treatment, which
    was irrigated with non-saline well water. Brief introduction of the SALTMED model
    As a generic model, the SALTMED model has been developed to simulate crop water
    uptake, distribution of salinity in the soil profile, plant growth, and yield
    for a variety of crops, soil types, irrigation systems, irrigation water management,
    nitrogen fertilizer application, and water qualities. Ragab (2002), Ragab et al.
    (2005a,b), and Ragab et al. (2015) provide detailed descriptions of the model
    in their respective works. The SALTMED model can be downloaded from http://www.icid.org/res_tools.html
    at the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage. Yield is obtained
    in the SALTMED model as follows: $$AY=RY\\times {Y}_{max}$$ (5) where AY is the
    actual yield, Ymax is the maximum yield that can be obtained under optimal conditions
    without any stress. RY is the relative crop yield and calculated as follows: $$RY=\\frac{\\sum
    S(x,z,t)}{\\sum {S}_{max}(x,z,t)}$$ (6) where S is the actual root water uptake
    (mm day−1), Smax is the maximum water uptake under no water and salinity stress
    conditions (mm day−1), x, z and t are the horizontal and vertical coordinates
    of each grid cell and root depth, respectively. The value of S is determined in
    SALTMED by the equation developed by Cardon and Letey (1992) as follows: $$S\\left(z,t\\right)=\\left\\{\\frac{{S}_{max}\\left(t\\right)}{1+{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha
    \\left(t\\right)h+\\pi }{{\\pi }_{50}\\left(t\\right)}\\right)}^{3}}\\right\\}\\lambda
    (z,t)$$ (7) where $$\\lambda \\left(z\\right)=\\frac{5}{3L}\\; for \\;z\\le 0.2L$$
    (8a) $$\\lambda \\left(z\\right)=\\frac{25}{12L}\\times \\left(1-z/L\\right)\\;
    for\\; 0.2L<z\\le L$$ (8b) $$\\lambda \\left(z\\right)=0.0\\; for\\; z>L$$ (8c)
    Smax(t) is the maximum root water uptake at the time t, z is the vertical depth,
    λ(z,t) is the depth and time-dependent fraction of total root mass, L is the maximum
    rooting depth, π is the soil osmotic pressure head, h is the soil water pressure
    head, π50(t) is the soil osmotic head at which Smax(t) reduces to 50% and α(t)
    is a weighing coefficient that relate to different response of a crop to matric
    and osmotic pressure (Ragab 2015). Functions of van Genuchten (1980) are used
    in this model to describe the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity K(h) and the
    soil water head (h) based on the volumetric soil water content (θ). Reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo), crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and differentiate between
    soil evaporation and plant transpiration are determined using the Penman–Monteith
    equation and crop coefficients as described in FAO-56 methodology (Allen et al.
    1998). In the SALTMED model, increasing the root depth during the growing season
    was assumed to be similar to the change process of the plant crop coefficient
    and was described as follows (Ragab 2002): $$Rd\\left(t\\right)={Rd}_{min}+\\left[{Rd}_{max}-{Rd}_{min}\\right]\\times
    {K}_{c}(t)/{K}_{c max}$$ (9) where Rd(t) is the root depth at the time t, Rdmin
    is the minimum root depth, Rdmax is the maximum root depth, Kc max is the maximum
    crop coefficient and Kc(t) is the crop coefficient at the time t. Richards and
    diffusion dispersion-convection equations are used for determining water flow
    and nutrient transport in the soil, respectively (Hillel 1977). Calibration and
    validation of the SALTMED model Since many of the parameters in the simulation
    of plant growth and yield are dependent on the climatic conditions of a region
    and the type of plant, it is necessary to calibrate the model based on the climatic
    conditions of the studied area. The accuracy of the model calibration should then
    be tested by validating the results. If the results of calibration and validation
    of the model are acceptable, it can be used widely. The SALTMED model''s parameters
    were calibrated using a trial-and-error method to achieve the best agreement between
    the measured and simulated data for soil water content, dry matter, and crop yield.
    The measured data from the first-year experiment was used for the calibration.
    In-situ weather station data for rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, relative
    humidity, sunshine and wind speed were collected to estimate reference evapotranspiration.
    Required soil data for calibration were saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat = 557
    mm/d), saturated soil water content (θsat = 0.43 cm3 cm−3), residual soil water
    content (θres = 0.05 cm3 cm−3), n = 1.53 and α = 0.06 (cm−1) as the parameters
    of functions of van Genuchten (1980). The initial soil water content and salinity
    were determined using soil samples collected from the field. Other soil parameters
    including transvers dispersivity (40 mm), longitudinal dispersivity (40 mm), and
    diffusion coefficient (0.67 cm2 day−1) were fine-tuned to obtain close matching
    between the observed and simulated parameters during the calibration stage. Crop
    parameters including crop coefficient (Kc), leaf area index (LAI) and maximum
    yield were determined based on the observed data in the field and photosynthesis
    efficiency, harvest index and CO2 factor were determined by a fine-tuning process
    in the calibration stage. Table 3 summarizes the crop parameters used in the model.
    Other necessary parameters such as basal crop coefficient (Kcb), pore size distribution
    index (lambda), and bubbling pressure were obtained from the model’s database
    as default values. Table 3 Crop parameters used in the SALTMED model Full size
    table Statistical evaluation The most commonly used statistical indices for comparing
    the observed and simulated data during the model evaluation process are Normalized
    Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), Mean Residual Error (MRE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency
    coefficient (EF), Index of agreement (d), and the coefficient of determination
    (R2). These parameters are calculated as follows (Willmott et al. 1985): $$NRMSE={\\left[\\frac{{\\sum
    }_{i=1}^{n}{({P}_{i}-{O}_{i})}^{2}}{n{O}_{ave}^{2}}\\right]}^{0.5}$$ (10) $$MRE=\\frac{{\\sum
    }_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{({P}_{i}-{O}_{i})}{{O}_{i}}}{n}$$ (11) $$EF=1-\\frac{{\\sum
    }_{i=1}^{n}{({P}_{i}-{O}_{i})}^{2}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({O}_{i}-{O}_{ave}\\right)}^{2}}$$
    (12) $$d=1-\\frac{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{({P}_{i}-{O}_{i})}^{2}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{\\left(\\left|{P}_{i}-{O}_{ave}\\right|+\\left|{O}_{i}-{O}_{ave}\\right|\\right)}^{2}}$$
    (13) $${R}^{2}=\\frac{{\\left[{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}\\left({O}_{i}-{O}_{ave}\\right)\\left({P}_{i}-{P}_{ave}\\right)\\right]}^{2}}{{\\sum
    }_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({O}_{i}-{O}_{ave}\\right)}^{2}{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({P}_{i}-{P}_{ave}\\right)}^{2}}$$
    (14) where Pi and Oi are the simulated and observed values, respectively. Oave
    and Pave are the average of observed and simulated values, respectively, and n
    is the numbers of data. A simulation of the model is considered more accurate
    when the values of d, EF, and R2 are closer to 1.0, and the values of NRMSE and
    MRE are closer to 0.0. According to Jamieson et al. (1991), a simulation is rated
    as excellent, good, fair, or poor based on the NRMSE values being less than 0.1,
    between 0.1 and 0.2, between 0.2 and 0.3, and greater than 0.3, respectively.
    An R2 value greater than 0.80 (Ma et al. 2011), 0 < EF < 1 (Moriasi et al. 2007),
    and d > 0.7 (Saseendran et al. 2010) is acceptable for crop simulation in agronomy.
    A value of EF that is close to zero or negative indicates that the mean of the
    observed data is a more accurate predictor than the simulated data, which suggests
    that the model is unsuitable for crop modeling purposes (Adeboye et al. 2021).
    Also, F-test analysis was done to compare the slope and intercept of the linear
    relationship between the observed and simulated values and line 1:1. Since the
    intercept value was not statistically significant at the 5% level of probability,
    it was excluded from the equation. Interpreting model results solely based on
    the indices mentioned above, which are sensitive to significant errors, outliers,
    and extreme values, can be challenging, particularly when working with small datasets.
    Therefore, to accurately interpret model results, it is recommended to consider
    a combination of these indices. (Ahmadi et al. 2022). Results Grain yield The
    measured and simulated values of the grain yield for the calibration and validation
    stages of SALTMED model are shown in Fig. 4. The statistical analysis of the results
    obtained from the model is given in Tables 4 and 5. The F-test at a 5% level of
    probability showed that there is no significant difference between the simulated
    and measured values in the calibration and validation stages of the SALTMED model.
    The values of NRMSE and d are 0.96 and 5.2% for calibration, respectively, and
    0.98 and 5.4% for validation. According to the results of F-test analysis, d,
    and NRMSE, it can be said that the accuracy of the SALTMED in simulating the amount
    of grain yield is excellent. These statistical ranges correspond to those reported
    by Kaya et al. (2015) for quinoa, by Soltani et al. (2021) and El-Shafei and Mattar
    (2022) for wheat, by Karandish and Simunek (2019) and Hassanli et al. (2016) for
    maize. However, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 5, the SALTMED model has slightly
    overestimated the grain yield. The value of MRE at the applied water level of
    0.35FI and salinity water of 12 dS m−1 was higher than FI and 0.6 dS m−1, respectively.
    Therefore, higher levels of salinity and drought stress resulted in a higher overestimation
    of the model. In addition, the values of NRMSE, d, EF and R2 in Table 5 showed
    that the model''s accuracy was slightly decreased by increase in salinity of irrigation
    water and decrease in applied water and increase in stress levels. Fig. 4 Relationship
    between the measured and simulated grain yield for calibration (a) and validation

    al. (2015) reported similar results about overestimation and decrease in accuracy
    of plant models such as AquaCrop and SALTMED under high salinity and drought stress
    conditions for sorghum. Razzaghi et al. (2011) and Peyghan et al. (2020) reported
    similar results for quinoa, Alkhasha and Al-Omran (2019) for tomato, Chauhdary
    et al. (2020) for corn, and Ahmadi et al. (2022) for potato yield. This decrease
    in accuracy may be due to the simplification of the growth process in these models
    and not considering the complexities of the plant in response to the combined
    effect of salinity and drought stress in water balance-based models. More details
    are provided in the Discussion section. Dry matter The measured and simulated
    values of the dry matter for the calibration and validation stages are shown in
    Fig. 5. Results of the statistical parameters to evaluate the accuracy of the
    SALTMED model are given in Tables 4 and 5. Based on the F-test results, there
    is no significant difference between the simulated and measured dry matter in
    the calibration and validation stages of the model at the 5% level of probability.
    According to the results of F-test analysis, d, and NRMSE, the accuracy of the
    SALTMED model in simulating the amount of dry matter is acceptable. However, as
    shown in Fig. 5 and Table 5, like for the grain yield, the model has slightly
    overestimated the dry matter. The accuracy of the model and statistical ranges
    obtained in this study are in agreement with those reported by Abdelraouf and
    Ragab (2018) for maize and by El-Shafei and Mattar (2022) for wheat. We have not
    found a similar study on the use of SALTMED model for the simulation of rapeseed
    dry matter to compare its results with the findings of the current study. As mentioned
    for grain yield, the values of MRE, NRMSE, d, EF and R2 in Table 5 showed that
    the model''s accuracy was slightly decreased with an increase in the salinity
    of irrigation water and a decrease in applied water and generally with an increase
    in stress levels. Fig. 5 Relationship between the measured and simulated dry matter
    for calibration (a) and validation (b) Full size image Soil water content The
    simulated soil water content versus those measured value at different applied
    water and combination of all treatments for the calibration and validation steps
    are shown in Fig. 6. The SALTMED model performed well in simulating the soil water
    content during both the calibration and validation stages. Results showed that
    the accuracy of the SALTMED model to simulate soil water content over the rooting
    zone is good. With the exception of 0.35FI, the NRMSE values ranged lower than
    10% and R2 and d values were greater than 0.8 and 0.7, respectively, at different
    applied water and combination of all treatments. Based on values of R2, NRMSE
    and d indices, it can be observed that the SALTMED model has slightly lower accuracy
    in 0.35FI (R2 = 0.72, NRMSE = 10.5% and d = 0.91) compared with FI (R2 = 0.87,
    NRMSE = 7.3% and d = 0.96). Therefore, the soil water content has been simulated
    less accurately by SALTMED at severe water deficiency. Our results are in accordance
    with those reported by earlier studies by Kaya et al. (2015) in Turkey, Pulvento
    et al. (2013) in Italy, and Hirich et al. (2012) in Morocco for quinoa, Silva
    et al. (2013) for chickpea in Portugal and Hirich et al. (2014) for sweet corn
    in Morocco. We could not find any study on the use of the SALTMED model to simulate
    the soil water content for rapeseed. Fig. 6 Relationship between the measured
    and simulated soil water content (SWC) for calibration (left side charts) and
    validation (right side charts) at different levels of applied water and all treatments
    Full size image Linear relationships were obtained between the measured and predicted
    soil water content at different levels of applied water by regression analysis
    (Table 6). The F-test results for differences between the observed and simulated
    soil water content showed that the slope of this linear equation was not statistically
    different from 1.0 (1:1 line) at the 5% level of probability. However, the intercept
    was statistically different from zero for these relationships in validation stages.
    According to the results of F-test analysis, d, and NRMSE, the accuracy of the
    model in simulating the soil water content is acceptable. Table 6 The performance

    of applied water Full size table Soil salinity Results of simulated electrical
    conductivity of soil saturation extract (ECe) versus those measured values at
    different soil layer depths and whole root zone soil profile for the calibration
    and validation steps are presented in Fig. 7. Statistical indices (0.1 < NRMSE < 0.2
    and d > 0.9) showed that the performance of model to simulate soil salinity was
    good for both calibration and validation steps. According to the ANOVA tables
    (not shown) related to the regression analysis between the measured and simulated
    ECe, the P-value of the intercept of the equations was greater than 5% in the
    steps of calibration and validation for all three soil layers. Therefore, the
    equations without the intercept are presented in Table 7. Results of the F-test
    for differences between the simulated and measured ECe confirmed the appropriate
    accuracy of the model to estimate the soil salinity. Table 7 The performance assessment
    of SALTMED in simulating electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract at
    different soil layer depths Full size table Fig. 7 Relationship between the measured
    and simulated electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract (ECe) for calibration
    (left side charts) and validation (right side charts) at different soil layer
    depths and soil profile Full size image Discussion So far, the SLTMED model has
    been used to simulate the growth of many plants, especially cereals (Karandish
    and Šimůnek 2019; Noshadi et al. 2020; Alkhasha and Al-Omran 2019; Al-Omran et
    al. 2020; Peyghan et al. 2020). The investigators declared the accuracy of this
    model is acceptable and good. However, using SALTMED to simulate the yield and
    growth of rapeseed has received no attention. Results of this study showed that
    the accuracy of this model for simulating the yield and growth of rapeseed is
    in accordance with those reported by earlier studies for cereal crops. Statistical
    indices showed that the performance of the model to simulate seed yield, dry matter,
    soil water content, and soil salinity was acceptable for both calibration and
    validation steps. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, similar to other crop models
    such as AquaCrop (Ahmadi et al. 2022) and ET-HS model (Soleymani 2022), the accuracy
    of this model decreases under the conditions of severe salinity and water stresses.
    The greatest discrepancy between the measured and estimated data was observed
    for the soil water content simulation. Following this, it reduces the accuracy
    of the model to simulate evapotranspiration, dry matter, and yield. Part of this
    disagreement may be due to spatial variability, uncertainties, and measurement
    errors of soil water content by the neutron scattering method. Some possible defects
    of the model theory that may contribute to this inaccuracy are discussed below.
    In this model, grain yield is obtained from the product of the maximum yield value
    (Ym) by the yield ratio (RY) based on Eq. (5). The fact that the maximum yield
    is one of the input parameters of the model has both an advantage and a disadvantage.
    If the maximum yield data is available, its advantage is an increase in the accuracy
    of the model for simulating the bred cultivars at each region and local climatic
    conditions. Its disadvantages are (1) this parameter is not available in all regions;
    (2) the maximum crop yield obtained in a region cannot be used for other regions.
    Based on Eq. (6), the yield ratio (RY) is equal to the ratio of water absorbed
    from the root zone in the simultaneous presence of salinity and drought stresses
    to water absorbed in non-stress conditions. In the SALTMED model, the amount of
    transpiration is considered equal to the water absorbed by the plant. Water uptake
    under stress conditions is obtained from Eq. (7). Equation (7) is known as the
    reduction function of water uptake. There are three categories of reduction functions,
    namely additive, multiplicative, and conceptual combined functions (Homaee et
    al. 2002; Minhas et al. 2020; Balkhi et al. 2023). The type of Eq. (7) is an additive
    function. Based on a comprehensive study by Homaee and Feddes (1999), the additivity
    and multiplicative models cannot well explain the interaction effect of osmotic
    and matric potentials on water absorption by plant roots. Even though, the total
    soil water potential is calculated by summing the individual contributions of
    gravimetric, osmotic, and matric potentials. Homaee and Feddes (1999) and Babazadeh
    et al. (2017) proposed Eq. (31) and Eq. (32), respectively that differ conceptually
    from additive and multiplicative theories. They mainly tried to consider the physiological
    response of the crop under the simultaneous influence of salinity and drought
    stress in their equations. $$\\alpha \\left(h,{h}_{0}\\right)=\\frac{h-\\left({h}_{4}-{h}_{0}\\right)}{{h}_{3}-\\left({h}_{4}-{h}_{0}\\right)}\\times
    \\left[1-\\frac{b}{360}\\left({h}_{0}^{*}-{h}_{0}\\right)\\right]$$ (31) $$\\alpha
    \\left(h,{h}_{0}\\right)=\\frac{h-\\left({h}_{4}-{h}_{0}\\right)}{\\frac{{h}_{3}}{1+{\\left(\\left({h}_{0}-{h}_{0}^{*}\\right)/{h}_{050}\\right)}^{n}}-\\left({h}_{4}-{h}_{0}\\right)}\\times
    \\left[1-\\frac{b}{360}\\left({h}_{0}^{*}-{h}_{0}\\right)\\right]$$ (32) where
    h is the soil water pressure head, h0 is the osmotic head, h4 refers to the soil
    water pressure head at which plants are no longer able to extract water from the
    soil, known as the wilting point, h3 is the soil water pressure head threshold
    value under water stress and without salinity stress conditions, h0* is the osmotic
    head at the water uptake reduction threshold value, h050 is the soil osmotic head
    at which the reduction in water uptake due to salinity has reached 50% of its
    maximum value, The coefficient “n” is a shape parameter that is dependent on the
    crop species and soil type and b is the percentage reduction in water uptake per
    unit increase in soil salinity. Based on the studies conducted by Azizian and
    Sepaskhah (2014), Eq. (31) resulted in more accurate results compared to additive
    and multiplicative water uptake reduction functions. The models mentioned above
    consider two cases that are not considered in Eq. (7). First, in Eqs. (31) and
    (32), each unit increase in soil salinity (dS/m) decrease the soil water pressure
    head at the wilting point (h4) by 360 cm of water pressure head. In a study by
    Pereira et al. (2007), a similar analysis was conducted to correct the soil water
    content at the wilting point under saline conditions. These researchers found
    that the soil water content at the wilting point was higher for soils with higher
    salinity levels compared to non-saline soils. As a result, they derived a new
    equation that can be used to calculate the soil water content at the wilting point
    under saline conditions (Minhas et al. 2020). Second, the reduction function of
    Eq. (32) shows that under increasing salinity, not only root water uptake is reduced
    but the soil water pressure head threshold also is decreased nonlinearly. Readers
    can refer to Babazadeh et al. (2017) for more details. Therefore, using Eqs. (31)
    and (32) in the SALTMED model can result in a more accurate simulation. However,
    there are still complexities related to the interaction of salinity and water
    stress on water uptake by crops, which need further studies. Recent studies have
    shown that both soil matric and osmotic potentials are affected by soil salinity.
    Hu et al. (2023) discussed a coupling effect between soil matric potential and
    osmotic potential, where dissolved salt decreases matric potential at high suction
    ranges, and increases matric potential at low suction ranges. This indicates that
    the relationship between soil water content and soil water potential is influenced
    by salinity, and highlights the importance of considering salinity effects on
    soil properties when modeling plant water uptake and soil water dynamics. The
    next subject that can affect the accuracy of SALTMED to simulate the soil water
    content, evapotranspiration, salt, water, and nutrient transport in the soil,
    and ultimately, dry matter and yield estimation is root growth pattern. In SALTMED,
    the increase of root depth is determined by Eq. (9). In Eq. (9), root growth is
    related to the crop coefficient. The trend of crop coefficient variation from
    the initial stage to development and mid stages is incremental and S-shape. After
    that, at the end growth stage, the crop coefficient trend decreases (Allen et
    al. 1998). Therefore, based on Eq. (9), the root growth changes during the growing
    season are similar to crop coefficient variations and it is reduced at the end
    growth stage. Meanwhile, other researchers reported the process of root growth
    in the whole growing season in an S-shape. In other words, according to these
    researchers, the root depth at the end growth stage of a plant is equal to the
    maximum root depth and remains constant (Borg and Grimes 1986; Hartmann et al.
    2018). Therefore, like the HYDRUS model, using this pattern of root growth may
    result in better findings by the SALTMED model. Furthermore, under drought stress,
    to maintain the water uptake, the commonly adaptive response of the root system
    is the primary root elongation and inhibition of the horizontal root development
    in the topsoil (Franco et al. 2011). Also, the effect of other environmental parameters
    such as biotic and abiotic stress on root growth is not considered in Eq. (9)
    and can affect the accuracy of model simulation. The major patterns of water uptake
    in plant models are based on stress-free conditions, where maximum water uptake
    occurs in the surface soil layer and is reduced at deeper layers. Drought stress
    not only affects the growth pattern of plant roots but also alters the way in
    which water is taken up by the roots. In other words, the contribution of deeper
    roots to supply the whole crop water requirements increases when the topsoil matric
    potential decreases (Hodge 2009; Yanagawa and Fujimaki 2013; Katuwal et al. 2020).
    Additionally, plants adjust their root growth and water uptake pattern to local
    variations of soil salinity (Minhas et al. 2020). Incorporating the effects of
    drought and salinity stress on the pattern of root water uptake can improve the
    realism and accuracy of simulations of plant water use. By accounting for the
    changes in root growth, morphology, and physiology that occur under stress conditions,
    models can better capture the complex interactions between plants and their environment,
    and provide more reliable predictions of plant water use and productivity. This
    is especially important in regions where drought and salinity stress are common,
    as accurate water management strategies are critical for sustainable agricultural
    production. The last parameter that is simulated in plant models is grain yield.
    Many reasons are attributed to the discrepancy between observed and simulated
    grain yield in literature. One reason is the cumulative effect of errors that
    can occur throughout the modeling process, including data collection, parameterization,
    and mathematical formulation. Therefore, to improve the accuracy and reliability
    of crop models, it is crucial to identify and minimize these sources of error.
    For instance, the SALTMED model relies on input data on soil hydraulic properties,
    such as soil hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention. These parameters
    are critical for accurately predicting the transport of water and solutes in the
    soil and their uptake by plant roots. However, measuring these parameters in the
    field can be costly and time-consuming, so laboratory methods are often used instead.
    However, the accuracy of these measurements can be affected by the scale and sample
    size of the measurement, which can be a challenge. To ensure logical and accurate
    outcomes, it is crucial to calibrate and validate models for field conditions.
    By validating models in this way, researchers can have greater confidence in the
    model''s ability to accurately represent the complex interactions between plants,
    soil, and the environment. It is important to note that water-driven models such
    as SALTMED may not fully incorporate the complex physiological responses of plants
    to salinity and drought stress, which can lead to discrepancies between simulated
    and observed results. For example, the tolerance of plants to salinity is influenced
    by a range of chemical processes, including the presence of high levels of sodium
    on exchange complexes, soil pH, and the relative abundance of chloride, which
    are not explicitly considered in this model. Other factors that can affect salinity
    tolerance include soil texture, agro-climatic conditions, the specific ionic constituents
    of the soil solution, and the management strategies used for soil, irrigation,
    and crop cultivation (Minhas et al. 2020). Therefore, while water-driven models
    can provide useful insights into the behavior of soil water dynamics and plant
    growth under different salinity and drought conditions, they must be used with
    caution and validated against observed data to ensure that their predictions are
    reliable and accurate. Conclusion This study attempted to utilize the SALTMED
    model to simulate the growth and yield of rapeseed under different levels of irrigation
    water and soil salinity. The data utilized in this study were obtained from a
    two-year field experiment that was conducted in a semi-arid region in Iran. During
    the calibration stage of the model, the grain yield simulation showed promising
    results with NRMSE, EF, and the index of agreement (d) values of 0.052, 0.917,
    and 0.96, respectively. Similarly, during the validation stage, the grain yield
    simulation continued to perform well with NRMSE, EF, and the index of agreement
    (d) values of 0.054, 0.881, and 0.96, respectively. Like the grain yield, the
    values of statistical indices demonstrated that the model''s accuracy experienced
    a slight decrease as the stress levels increased. Generally, results showed that
    the SALTMED model has a satisfactory and reliable performance in simulating soil
    water content, the electrical conductivity of soil saturated extract, dry matter,
    and seed yield of rapeseed under different irrigation water management and water
    qualities. Therefore, the results of this study can reliably help experts, farmers,
    farm managers, and researchers to schedule and manage irrigation water, assess
    the responses of rapeseed crop to drought and salinity, and choose appropriate
    strategies to reduce the effects of water and salinity stresses on rapeseed. Using
    more realistic and conceptual root water uptake patterns and root growth function
    can improve simulations of yield and growth of crops by SALTMED. References Abdelraouf

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    recommendation. Full size image A confusion matrix is an illustrative format that
    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Coastal ecosystems face increasing risks from rising sea levels, climate
    change, and pol-lution. These factors dissatisfied the vulnerable balance of these
    ecosystems, affecting water quality and general environmental health. Traditional
    coastal monitoring approaches have problems with spatial coverage, flexibility,
    and real-time data-gathering limitations. Effective monitoring measures are critical
    for understanding and mitigating the impact on these sensitive ecosystems, which
    function as key buffers against environmental changes. The proposed UAV-enabled
    Wireless Sensor Network solution addresses these issues by providing a dynamic
    method to improve monitoring capabilities and contribute to the long-term sustainability
    of coastal ecosystems. This research intends to change the understanding and management
    of these crucial ecological zones. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are provided
    with a wide range of sensors that provide a dynamic option for obtaining comprehensive
    data over large and different coastal ecosystems. The objective of this technology
    is to overcome the spatial limitations of standard fixed sensor networks, allowing
    monitoring of inaccessible or dangerous locations. The research aims to provide
    real-time, high-resolution data on critical water quality metrics by integrating
    UAVs with WSN nodes. The assessment of temperature, salinity, and pollution indicators
    is particularly significant in determining the vulnerability of coastal water
    resources. The proposed method not only addresses the shortcomings of current
    monitoring techniques, but also enhances the capacity to recognise and respond
    to rapid environmental changes. This work concept allows new possibilities for
    the long-term management of water resources in vulnerable coastal ecosystems.

    welfareDairy cows 1. Introduction In recent decades, livestock husbandry has undergone
    considerable changes. In the dairy industry, increasing farm sizes and the accompanying
    automation are posing challenges to the monitoring of cow welfare, health and
    production, because farmers are less often present on the farm and lack the time
    to examine each individual cow on a daily basis (Barkema et al., 2015, Berckmans,
    2014, Norton et al., 2019). These changes in livestock farming therefore demand
    the adoption of novel strategies to monitor and manage dairy cows on farms. This
    demand has led to the rise of precision livestock farming (PLF) i.e., the “application
    of process engineering principles and techniques to livestock farming to automatically
    monitor, model and manage animal production” (De Montis et al., 2017, Wathes,
    2010). PLF technologies enable the continuous automatic monitoring of animals
    and thereby offer support to farmers in the control and management of their animals
    (Berckmans, 2017, Halachmi et al., 2019, Rutten et al., 2013). Several of these
    technologies have already been adopted in commercial systems for the dairy industry
    (Lee and Seo, 2021, Riaboff et al., 2022), e.g., accelerometer-based sensors for
    oestrus detection (Saint-Dizier and Chastant-Maillard, 2012) and automated milking
    systems for monitoring milk production and udder health (Jacobs and Siegford,
    2012). Economic evaluations of various automated detection technologies have estimated
    that investing in these technologies increases the annual profit of a farm (Adenuga
    et al., 2020, Drach et al., 2017, Rutten et al., 2014). Accordingly, the application
    of such systems on commercial farms is becoming ever more prevalent (Abeni et
    al., 2019). Ideally, automatic monitoring of farm animals focuses on providing
    a complete overview of the state of the animal, including its production, reproduction,
    and its welfare status. The welfare of dairy cows is multifaceted (Fraser et al.,
    1997, von Keyserlingk et al., 2009) and encompasses many welfare issues, such
    as lameness, mastitis, heat stress, reproduction disorders, metabolic disorders,
    pain, and the disruption of their social environment (Leliveld and Provolo, 2020,
    Rushen et al., 2008). The diverse and complex nature of these issues can be accurately
    captured only by integrating information from multiple sources to get a complete
    picture of a cow’s welfare status (Frost et al., 1997, Leliveld and Provolo, 2020,
    Wisnieski et al., 2019). Indeed, the performance of automatic detection systems
    improves as the number of measured parameters increases (Dolecheck et al., 2015,
    Dominiak and Kristensen, 2017, Jensen et al., 2016). Despite the advantages of
    data integration in farm applications, many existing systems measure only one
    or a few indicators (Lee and Seo, 2021) and offer only limited conclusions regarding
    the state of an animal. Moreover, to our knowledge, there are currently no commercial
    systems that integrate measurements of the barn environment (e.g., barn climate
    and air quality) with cow-based measurements, even though the barn environment
    is an important determinant of cow welfare (Schauberger et al., 2020). A major
    hurdle in the practical implementation of data integration is that this requires
    a complex system architecture to handle the various types of data from heterogenous
    sources and to unify and process them in one place. It requires an efficient (wireless)
    communication system that prevents data collision (which results in data loss)
    and also prevents transmissions of redundant data (Firner et al., 2010, Khaleghi
    et al., 2013). The use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies supports data
    management by connecting sensors, controllers, operators and objects to communication
    technologies such as local networks or the internet to form an information-based,
    automatic, and intelligent network (Zhang et al., 2021). This provides the opportunity
    to remotely handle and integrate data from multiple sensors through data fusion
    (Zhang et al., 2021). IoT technology is a central component of “smart farming”,
    which uses cloud-based platforms to analyse data from multiple sources and provide
    decision support (Akbar et al., 2020, Fountas et al., 2020). The main components
    of data processing in smart farming are data collection, data preparation, data
    processing, decision making and the provision of services to the end user (Amiri-Zarandi
    et al., 2022). Integration of data should be ensured on the data preparation level
    by standardizing the data to a predefined format, as well as identifying and deleting
    duplicated data, addressing gaps in generated data, and validating data sources
    and contents (Amiri-Zarandi et al., 2022). Thereby, it is vital that the data
    collected on a farm are reliable (i.e., valid and stable), because incorrect decisions
    based on unreliable data could result in high costs to the farm (Amiri-Zarandi
    et al., 2022). While several technologies have been developed for data integration
    in agriculture (Alonso et al., 2020, Cruz et al., 2022, Symeonaki et al., 2022),
    there is still a need for integrated systems that are open and customizable and
    therefore are suited for research purposes as well as for commercial use. This
    paper describes a prototype of an open and customizable integrated automated system
    to monitor barn environment and cow behaviour simultaneously. Because a major
    obstacle in data integration is providing a suitable architecture that can handle
    large data sets from various heterogenous sources, the aim of this study was to
    establish a system architecture with a suitable communication network to collect,
    transfer, process and visualize data from multiple sources continuously and in
    real time. This system was developed in the framework of the project “Integrated
    Environment Management System in Dairy Barns to Improve the Welfare and Productivity
    of Cows (GALA)” an Operational Groups of the Rural Development Programme 2014–2020.
    Using IoT technology, the resulting system integrates data from multiple diverse
    sensors that measure barn climate (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed), air
    quality (e.g., CO2 concentration), water use and temperature, the moisture and
    temperature of litter and, equally important, cow behaviour (e.g., lying, standing,
    eating, ruminating) to present a real-time comprehensive overview of the conditions
    in the barn and the state of individual cows to a farmer. We first describe the
    architecture of the system (sensors, nodes, gateway and backend) and its communication
    network, the data processing and the delivery of information to the user through
    a dashboard. We then document the system’s performance on three commercial dairy
    cattle farms. Finally, we evaluate the system’s performance and draw conclusions
    about the feasibility of open and customizable data integration in the automatic
    monitoring of dairy cows in a commercial setting, as well as about the opportunities
    and challenges that it presents. It is believed that the results of this project
    will help promote research-driven data integration in the automatic monitoring
    of livestock, thereby improving the management of cow welfare, health and production.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Architecture of the system 2.1.1. Overview The GALA
    system was designed to make measurements at three different locations (outside
    the barn, inside the barn and on individual cows) and to collect, process and
    analyse the measured data before ultimately presenting it to the user. Outside
    the barn, measurements included ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed
    and direction, and rainfall. Inside the barn, the measurements consisted of ambient
    temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, black globe temperature, water
    temperature and use, litter temperature and humidity, CO2, NH3, H2S, sound pressure
    level, and wind speed and direction. On the cow, measurements consisted of acceleration.
    The system architecture is shown in Fig. 1. The system consists of four main elements:
    the sensors, the nodes, the gateways and the cloud backend (for data processing
    and analysis and subsequent presentation to the user via a dashboard). The sensors
    are standard, off-the-shelf components that constitute the elements of transduction
    of physical quantities either into analog information (voltage or current) or
    digital data and are physically connected to a node. The nodes are specifically
    designed hardware/software systems that are physically connected to one or more
    sensors and are powered either by batteries or by low voltage mains electricity
    (12VDC). Download : Download high-res image (421KB) Download : Download full-size

    registration as purple boxes. Solid lines indicate wired connections and dotted
    lines indicate wireless connections. BGT = black globe temperature, AT = ambient
    temperature, RH = relative humidity, T = temperature, NAS = network attached storage.
    (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the web version of this article.) The nodes are small, embedded
    devices that integrate all the necessary electronics and implement the firmware
    to perform three main functions: 1. raw sensor measurements, 2. local data processing,
    and 3. data transmission. The gateways are larger hardware/software systems that
    are powered by mains electricity (220VAC; indoor gateway) or by a solar panel
    and a backup battery (external gateway). They collect data from the nodes through
    the local wireless communication channel and provide connectivity to the backend
    cloud infrastructure using the MQTT (message queue telemetry transport) protocol
    over a standard 4G cellular network. The backend system is a software component
    based on a commercial platform that collects, stores, processes and displays sensor
    data. Access to these data is provided by means of a complex and complete dashboard
    presenting all sensor data in full detail for scientific purposes (e.g., research
    use), or via a simpler, compact dashboard that provides a summary of the data
    meant for immediate viewing by a farmer. 2.1.2. Nodes hardware The nodes are structured
    according to the general architecture shown in Fig. 2 in which a main board (indicated
    as GALA-NX), which is specific for each type of node or group of nodes, hosts
    the analog and/or digital interfaces towards the sensors, the internal sensors,
    the power supply and battery charger circuitry and the 35 x 45 mm GALA-SOB (system-on-board;
    Fig. 3). All nodes in this project were built by enhancing this basic design with
    specific features. In total there were nine different types of nodes created based
    on the basic GALA-SOB. Of these, seven nodes are used for data collection (N1,
    N2, N3, N4, N5, N6 and N9), one node (GALA-RF868) is integrated in the indoor
    gateway and acts as interface from the local wireless 868 MHz network to the cellular
    network, and one node (GALA-EOL, which is and end-of-line board) was used for
    programming and testing the GALA-SOB in the laboratory, before deploying it into
    the specific nodes. Two further nodes (N7 and N8) were developed to read digital
    inputs and drive digital outputs but these were not installed on the test farms.
    The specifications of the different node types are listed here: • GALA-N1. The
    N1 node is connected to an ambient temperature and relative humidity sensor, a
    light intensity sensor, and a black globe temperature sensor (Table 1). The temperature
    and relative humidity sensors are integrated in the node and connected via an
    I2C bus to the GALA-SOB. The light intensity sensor is also integrated in the
    node, even if it is mounted on a separate small board, and is placed close to
    the top of the case enclosing the node to be better exposed to the light. The
    black globe temperature sensor is externally connected to the board and consists
    of a standard plastic black globe and an NTC analog sensor. The power supply of
    the node consists of two C-size primary batteries, connected in series (3 V, 7800mAh).
    The node is fixed in an opaque case (55 x 80 x 160 mm) with a transparent front
    for light intensity measurements. Table 1. Sensors that are integrated in the

    in detail by Lovarelli et al., 2022, integrates one triaxial accelerometer. The
    electronics of the device are enclosed in a 100 x 75 x 22 mm plastic case having
    an IP67 rating, which is mounted on a neck collar with a weight at the bottom
    to keep the node in place on the upper-left side of the cow’s neck (Lovarelli
    et al., 2022). This position enables the detection of ingestion-related behaviours,
    such as eating and ruminating. For further protection, initially duct tape and
    later a rubber coating was fixed around the case. The N2 nodes are powered by
    a single AA-sized, high energy–density, lithium-thionyl chloride battery (3.6
    V, 2600mAh). • GALA-N3. The N3 node is externally connected to pulse-launching
    flow meters with different sections (1/2in, 3/4in or 1in) to measure water use
    and waterproof Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) sensors to measure the water
    temperature. Each GALA-N3 node can support up to two flow meters and two NTC probes.
    The power supply of the node consists of two C-size primary batteries, connected
    in series (3 V, 7800mAh). The case dimensions are the same as for the GALA-N1
    nodes, but N3 cases have an opaque front instead of a transparent one. The node
    can measure both sprinkler and drinking water use and temperature. In the study
    reported here, the temperature sensors were activated only in the nodes that measured
    drinking water. • GALA-N4. The N4 node is connected via an SDI-12 bus to a digital
    sensor measuring litter temperature and humidity. This sensor is designed for
    measuring the temperature and water content of soil, which has granulometric and
    electrical characteristics different from those of litter material. For this reason,
    experimental measurements were carried out with litter material to develop a calibration
    curve for obtaining the litter humidity value. The power supply and the case are
    the same as described for the N3 nodes. • GALA-N5. The N5 node is connected to
    different types of air quality sensors and to a sound pressure sensor, all integrated
    in the node. Since the CO2 sensor is based on non-dispersive infrared technology,
    the power consumption by these sensors is relatively high and cannot be supported
    by batteries in the long term. Therefore, the N5 nodes are powered by low-voltage
    mains (12VDC). The N5 node is fitted in an opaque case (55 x 146 x 252 mm) which
    has a filtered opening to allow the passage of gases for measurement. • GALA-N6.
    The N6 node is connected to an external sensor measuring wind speed and direction
    inside the barn. The sensors transfer the information to the node via two signals:
    a digital pulse signal for speed measurement and an analog (resistive) signal
    for direction measurement. The power supply and the case are the same as described
    for the N3 nodes. • GALA-N9. The N9 node is essentially a weather station that
    measures the environmental conditions outside the barn. The node is based on legacy
    modules directly connected through a Modbus channel to the external gateway and
    powered by a common power line on a DIN rail system. The DIN rail backplane consists
    of 5 lines: +12 VDC, ground, lines A and B of the half-duplex RS485 bus, and a
    generic digital signal used for bus contention and synchronization. The weather
    station is powered by a solar panel backed-up by a rechargeable battery (12 V,
    12 Ah). The GALA-H2O-POWER module controls the power supply for the other modules
    and the recharging of the battery via the solar panel. Sensor reading is performed
    by two I/O legacy modules, namely the GALA-H2O-DIGITAL and GALA-H2O-ANALOG boards.
    The former reads digital data such as windspeed and rainfall pulsed output, while
    the latter reads and converts analog data, such as the variable resistance (through
    a voltage divider) produced by the wind direction sensor. • GALA-RF868. The module
    GALA-RF868 acts as the interface between the wireless network in the barn (868
    MHz) and the cellular network towards the cloud. This node collects all data from
    the barn nodes and makes them available through a queue on a standard serial interface
    (UART) using a Modbus remote terminal unit protocol. Through this interface, the
    indoor gateway reads data for packing and transmitting it to the cloud. The GALA-RF868
    board has the same mechanical structure as the GALA-H2O boards and is also connected
    to the DIN backplane. • GALA-EOL. A GALA-EOL board was created as a support for
    testing and diagnostics of the GALA-SOB. This board was not installed on the farms
    but rather used as a support tool in a laboratory. It was used during the development
    of the system and for debugging during the testing phase. Download : Download

    Fig. 3. Simplified schematic of the GALA-SOB. The interfaces for connecting with
    the specific “host” boards for the different types of sensors are indicated. A
    simple user interface (UI) controls a status LED and receives input from a pushbutton.
    The “JTAG interface” is used for the first programming of the device. Digital
    outputs (DO) are either used as simple digital signals (e.g., to drive relays)
    or for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) sensors. The digital inputs (DI) are
    used to read isolated dry contacts. Analog inputs (AI) are used for voltage or
    current sensing, depending on the specific front-end on the host board. Finally,
    the board exposes standard digital buses: UART, I2C and SPI. The core of the module
    is the Silicon Labs EFR32BG13 Blue Gecko SiP, featuring two radio channels (868
    MHz and 2.4 GHz) with integrated power amplifier and balun and a 40 MHz Cortex
    M4 core with 512 KB of flash memory and 64 KB of RAM. (For interpretation of the
    references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
    version of this article.) 2.1.3. Sensors A list of the sensors and their description
    is provided in Table 1. Selection of the parameters that are relevant for the
    monitoring of cow welfare, health and production was based on a review of relevant
    literature (e.g., Hoffmann et al., 2020, Rushen et al., 2008, Dittrich et al.,
    2019; reviewed in Leliveld & Provolo, 2020). For the selection of the sensors,
    literature research was performed to understand the range and accuracy requirements
    for measuring all included parameters in a dairy cattle barn environment. The
    sensors were then selected by evaluating their capability to provide accurate
    measurements in the desired range and their compatibility with the rest of the
    system, whilst aiming to keep costs, power consumption, and complexity low. As
    shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, the sensors are externally or internally connected to
    the nodes. The external connection can be relatively close to the node (e.g.,
    the black globe thermometer that is built on top of the node case) or remote.
    For instance, the water flow sensors and the associated thermocouples that measure
    water use and temperature were mounted on the water distribution pipes of the
    drinking troughs and/or sprinklers for cooling the cows and connected to the nodes
    via long cables. 2.1.4. Node firmware The node firmware collects the data from
    the sensors, pre-processes the raw sensor readings (see Section 2.3.1) and sends
    data to the gateway. The collection of data from the sensors is done through standard
    protocols for those sensors that directly expose a digital interface such as SPI,
    SDI or I2C, or by reading the sensor’s output voltage or current through an analog-to-digital
    converter and transforming it into the target physical measure according to specific
    mathematical models. To optimize the performance of the nodes and increase reliability
    and battery life, the firmware was developed to maximize the idle time of the
    system (during which time the microcontroller and, if possible, the sensors are
    switched to low-power mode or turned off) and to obtain the best trade-off between
    local computation and data transmission. Like the hardware of the nodes, the firmware
    was also developed in a modular way with the support of an embedded operating
    system, generic drivers for the sensors, data acquisition functions, Bluetooth
    communication protocol and local wireless communication protocol that are common
    to all sensors. On top of this common layer, each node implements a specific application
    layer. 2.1.5. Gateways Both the indoor and external gateway act as a connection
    between the local network and the internet. The indoor gateway connects the local
    RF868 network and the global cellular network. It obtains data from the nodes
    in the barn via the local radio interface module (GALA-RF868) and communicates
    them to the backend infrastructure (cloud). The gateway hardware consists of a
    NAS (network attached storage), which is also used for video recording (Synology
    DS210j, Synology, Banciao, New Taipei, Taiwan). The gateway software continuously
    polls the GALA-RF868 module to verify whether new data from the nodes are available
    and, if so, copies such data to a large temporary buffer that has the capacity
    to store data for a few days. Periodically, the gateway software merges data in
    the buffer into a single, compact MQTT binary packet and sends it to the cloud.
    The external gateway is implemented by the legacy GALA-H2O-MAIN module which acts
    as Modbus master for collecting data from the other modules of the N9 sensor node,
    combining such data in a single packet for optimization, buffering individual
    packets in case of network absence and, eventually, sending the stored data packets
    to the cloud backend via a 3G/4G cellular module. 2.1.6. Video recording system
    The internet protocol video cameras that are used for video recording are compatible
    with the Open Network Video Interface Forum specifications and are powered via
    PoE (Power over Ethernet). This solution allowed a single Ethernet cable per camera
    to be used for power supply, as well as video streaming and remote control. As
    shown in Fig. 1, the cameras are connected via ethernet cables through a PoE switch
    to the NAS where specific commercial software acts as a network video recorder.
    Remote access to the video recording system is granted, through a 4G modem, and
    locally via a wired ethernet connection and a WiFi network. A remote web-based
    interface provides visualization of the barn and control of the system, both for
    configuration and diagnostics. 2.1.7. Backend The backend is a custom cloud software
    application, partly built on top of the commercial platform Thingsboard (v.3.2.2PE),
    that collects, stores, and processes data that is received from the gateways.
    As Fig. 4 shows, messages are not sent directly to the Thingsboard MQTT broker,
    but first to a custom-built intermediate MQTT Broker that performs several transformations,
    both on the upstream telemetry data flow and on the downstream bidirectional remote
    processing calls and attribute data flows. Considering the telemetry data flow,
    the following list describes the operations that the intermediate server performs:
    1. A component called “Splitter” is subscribed to the MQTT topic where packed
    telemetry messages are received and it unpacks these messages into individual,
    node-level messages. This process is agnostic with respect to the structure and
    contents of the messages. Unpacked messages are then published, as binary packets,
    to the same intermediate broker on a second topic. 2. A component called “Decoder”
    is subscribed to the second topic created by Splitter. Decoder is aware of the
    internal structure of the messages and has the task of interpreting the content
    of the individual binary messages and publishing it back to the broker in Java
    script object notation (JSON) format on a third topic. 3. The Thingsboard hub
    is subscribed to the JSON telemetry topic of the intermediate MQTT broker and
    allows transmitting data from different devices (all the nodes connected to a
    specific gateway) through a single connection using a unique key related to the
    gateway (rather than to the single nodes). Then, the Thingsboard hub associates
    each logic device (i.e., the logical entity that is needed to represent the data
    on the Thingsboard platform) with the corresponding physical node based on the
    node name specified in the JSON telemetry message. 4. The telemetry is published
    to the Thingsboard internal broker, where it is saved in the database in the form
    of a timeseries and enters the processing chain. The Thingsboard was customized
    using a graphical (NodeJS) and programmatic (Javascript) formalism, referred to
    as “rulechains”, to perform medium–low complexity processing (see Section 2.3.2)

    2.2. System communication network To minimize power consumption and to support
    a large number of devices, a custom-TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) wireless
    communication protocol was developed on the raw physical 868 MHz GFSK modulation
    scheme provided by the EFR32BG13 core used in the GALA-SOB. The 868 MHz carrier
    was chosen to minimize signal attenuation due to the presence of animals. This
    protocol allows bidirectional communication between the nodes (master) and the
    gateway (slave). A time-slotted approach is used for data transmission to avoid
    packet collision from different nodes transmitting at the same time. This approach
    reduces the need to retransmit, thereby reducing energy consumption at the nodes
    and maximising battery life. Based on an autonomous initial negotiation scheme,
    each node is assigned a specific timeslot of 1 s within the global communication
    period (called an “epoch”), which is set to 10 min (600 s, as described in Supplementary
    Material 2, Figure S1). The network synchronization is centralized and is performed
    by the gateway. At the end of the initialization phase, the gateway starts receiving
    messages from the nodes, nominally every second. The actual timing of each node,
    though, is based on its own clock, which unavoidably drifts over time with an
    approximate speed of 50 s per million seconds. This means that approximately every
    a node leaves its nominal slot and transmits either in the previous or the next
    one. To compensate for this drift, the gateway, upon receiving a message from
    a given node, determines the difference between the nominal time at which the
    message was expected and the actual time at which the message was received. This
    allows computing the exact actual time until the next transmission of that node.
    This information is sent back to the node, which can thus adjust its timing and
    compensate for the clock drift. This way, the drift is compensated at each period
    of 600 s and its worst-case value is . To avoid overlapping, a silence guard time
    is respected at the beginning of each time slot. The maximum size of each transmitted
    packet is 250 bytes (including the communication “overhead”), which, with a bandwidth
    of 26 Kbit/s, requires a maximum time of 80 ms. At the end of transmission, each
    node remains active for a short period of time (20 ms in the current implementation)
    to wait for the answer from the gateway containing synchronization and other control
    information. After receiving the gateway response, if any, the node enters its
    deep-sleep mode. During the initial negotiation phase, the following procedure
    is used. Each node, which has a unique numeric identifier, transmits (at a random
    time) an initial packet containing the data and its identifier to the gateway.
    In case of collision with other packets, the same transmission will be repeated
    after a short interval, which is also random. The gateway, knowing the node identifier,
    computes the delay the node must wait for the next transmission to fall in its
    correct slot and indicates the waiting time until the start of the node’s next
    slot in the response message to the node. For example, if node 35 transmits for
    the first time 330 ms after the beginning of time slot 250, the gateway assigns
    the new node slot 35 and indicates that the delay to the next transmission is
    384.67 s (computed as [600 – 250.330] + 35 = 384.67 s; i.e., the time till the
    beginning of the next epoch, plus the delay from the beginning of the next epoch
    to the correct slot). In this case, therefore, the gateway indicates the retransmission
    time as 350 + 35 = 385 s. This mechanism simultaneously guarantees two important
    properties: on the one hand – except for an initial transient of 20 or 30 min
    – it eliminates packet collisions, and, on the other hand, it synchronizes the
    time of all nodes with that of the gateway. Data from the nodes are encoded in
    binary packets to reduce size, transmission time and energy consumption. Two different
    basic packet structures were defined: one with a 16-bit mask, suitable for encoding
    up to 16 different measures, and a larger one, with a 32-bit mask, which extends
    the allowed measures up to 32. The structure of these packets is shown in Figure
    S2 (Supplementary Material 2). The gateway transmits the data periodically to
    the backend infrastructure in the cloud on the internet using a MQTT protocol
    (MQTT version V3.1 protocol, configured with quality of service “1″; OASIS, 2023).
    In addition to the RF868 and global protocols, a Bluetooth protocol (Bluetooth,
    2023, Smart Farm Information Processing, xxxx) is used for the local connection
    between the individual nodes and a service mobile application (app). To achieve
    this, each node implements a Bluetooth channel for local and short-distance communication
    and an app was developed to connect to this channel via a smartphone. This app
    is used for data collection, sensor configuration, diagnostics, and software updates
    of the nodes. The app and the Bluetooth channel were also used to collect combined
    accelerometer data and behavioural observations for the development of an algorithm
    to categorize cow behaviour (for details see Lovarelli et al., 2022). 2.3. Data
    processing Data processing is distributed across the system and is partly performed
    on the nodes and partly on the cloud. The gateways do not perform any processing,
    being only responsible for buffering of the packets coming from the nodes and
    packing them into larger packets to minimize communication overhead. 2.3.1. Data
    processing on the nodes The processing performed by the nodes on signals that
    change slowly over time is relatively simple and includes basic statistical analysis,
    filtering, and transformations, such as scaling and offsetting. Statistical analyses
    include the calculation of the mean and, for some measurements such as wind speed
    and sound level, also minimum and maximum values within a 10-minute interval.
    Some “noisy” quantities (e.g., signals that change rapidly over time and signals
    affected by electronic or thermal noise) are sampled at a rate higher than needed
    and then are filtered using a moving average or Butterworth digital filter and,
    in some cases, decimated. The processing on the cow nodes (N2) is much more complicated
    and computationally intensive than that on the other nodes. Details on the processing
    of the behavioural data and the development of the algorithm have been published
    in Lovarelli et al. (2022). In short, acceleration in the three dimensions is
    sampled at a frequency of 25 Hz and processed in 5-second windows to compute data
    features to be used to classify the dominant behaviour over each 10-minute interval.
    Each 10-minute interval consists of (600 / 5 = ) 120 windows, and thus 120 samples
    per each of the 10 features are computed. The behavioural classification algorithm
    was developed by applying machine learning on the features that were extracted
    from accelerometer data, which were collected during 108 h of observations from
    32 cows on three farms. This algorithm, which is based on a decision tree model,
    was shown to correctly classify the cow behaviour into six different classes,
    i.e., “standing”, “lying down”, “standing and ruminating”, “lying down and ruminating”,
    “eating” and “other”, with an average accuracy of 85.12 % (Lovarelli et al., 2022).
    2.3.2. Data processing on the cloud On the cloud, the data go through a processing
    flow implemented within the Thingsboard platform. On this platform, data are characterized
    according to the farm, the sensor identifier, the sensor type, the type of measure,
    the timestamp and the value (i.e., the actual measurement made by the sensor).
    As mentioned in Section 2.1.7, the processing that occurs on the Thingsboard platform
    is based on rule chains, which graphically represent the paths and the different
    processing steps for the different types of data. Rule chains are activated either
    by the arrival of new data or by the triggering of a periodic timer. When data
    arrive in the cloud, they are first processed by the root rule chain (see Supplementary
    Materials, Figure S3). This rule chain basically sorts the data towards secondary
    rule chains for each specific node type. An overview of the input timeseries,
    computed timeseries, and computation process is provided in the Supplementary
    Material 1 (Table S1). Many values are obtained by combining the same type of
    data collected in the same time interval by several sensors (e.g., combining the
    temperature measurements of the different N1 sensors to calculate the mean temperature
    in the barn). Other values are obtained by combining multiple measurements in
    the same time interval from the same sensor node (e.g., combining the temperature
    and humidity measurements to calculate the temperature-humidity index [THI]).
    Some other values are obtained by combining the same measurement over a certain
    time interval. Indeed, for all values, hourly and daily averages, as well as more
    complex statistical values, are calculated. For example, the “standing rate” is
    calculated as the fraction of time spent standing during the last hour or day,
    and the “daylight exposure” is based on the time having a mean light intensity
    greater than 40 lx. A specific node of the rule chains is used to raise alarms.
    For environmental barn sensors data, the alarm uses fixed thresholds (e.g., if
    the mean barn THI increases above 72, the first level of alarm is raised and visualized
    on the dashboard). For the behavioural data, a more complex dynamic threshold
    is used in which the deviation of a measurement from the average of the same measurement
    over the last 30 days is calculated. 2.4. Dashboard The dashboard in this project
    served two purposes. First, it was developed to present the collected data to
    the end user (usually a farmer) in a concise and accessible manner with the aim
    to provide quick and clear support in the farmer’s decision-making processes.
    Secondly, because the project described herein concerns a pilot system that also
    serves scientific purposes, the dashboard also needed to present all data gathered
    by the individual sensors in a detailed and complete manner that allowed verification
    of the system’s functionality and accuracy of the recordings. The dashboards were
    developed within the Thingsboard platform and were made accessible via hypertext
    transfer protocol to make it readable both using a computer’s browser and a mobile
    device. The home page shows the list of the three commercial farms and their location
    on the map (see Supplementary Material 2, Figure S4). The detailed (diagnostic)
    and simplified (farm) overviews for each farm can then be accessed by clicking
    on the respective icon next to the farm name. A description of the detailed overview
    is provided in the Supplementary Material 2. The farm main page shows a series
    of synthetic alarm graphs that display the alarm level, ranging from green (safe)
    to red (danger) for different monitored aspects of the farm, together with a needle
    that indicates the current alarm level (Fig. 5). The thresholds for the different
    alarm levels are shown in Table S2 (Supplementary Material 2). Alarm graphs are
    shown for the barn environment of the last hour and the last 24hrs, cow activity
    in the last hour and last day, cow behaviour in the last day and rumination in
    the last hour and day. The level indicated on the barn environment graph is based
    on a summary from different individual measures, such as THI. Pop-up overviews
    show the values of individual measures and the level of alarm for each. The farm
    main page also provides access to more detailed pages on the barn environment,
    cow behaviour and water and litter. The page dedicated to barn environment displays
    graphs (with the same features as for the previously described graphs) of means
    from N1, N5, N6 and N9 sensor nodes (e.g., temperature, ammonia concentration),
    as well as other computed values (e.g., THI, total daylight exposure and differences
    in these values between inside and outside the barn). The page dedicated to cow
    behaviour displays a table with the data gathered on individual cows. This table
    includes for each cow, the collar identifier, the cow identifier, and the percentage
    of time spent standing, lying down, eating, ruminating, and in other behaviour,
    as well as the mean activity level in the last 24 hrs (see Supplementary Material
    2, Figure S6). The percentages are given in colours ranging from green to red,
    which indicate the alarm level for each individual cow and behaviour. The cow
    identifier can be manually entered and changed if the collar switches owner. This
    page also provides access to pages for individual cows. On these pages, there
    is a radar chart showing the average time the cow spent exhibiting the different
    behaviours, a list showing the dominant behavioural category during the most recent
    10-minute intervals, and a graph showing the mean activity of the cow for a selected
    period. The layout of the page dedicated to water and litter is similar to the
    page on barn environment, with all data (e.g., global drink water use, mean litter
    temperature, and mean litter humidity) displayed in graphs. Download : Download

    farm main page with the alarm graphs shown for the different aspects of the farm
    (e.g., barn environment in last hour). Needles indicate the current alarm level,
    ranging from green (safe) to red (danger). For activity and rumination (the four
    graphs on the right of the screen) any strong deviation from the normal level
    is considered cause for alarm, hence the middle is green (safe) and yellow and
    red levels are shown on each side. The icons in the lower left section of the
    screen provide access to more detailed information on all measurements related
    to barn environment, cow behaviour and water and litter. Below: example of a graph
    displaying the values of different climate parameters (THI, humidity and temperature)
    over the last 7 days (at the time the graph was made). Different y-axes are given
    for THI and humidity (on the left) and temperature (on the right). Time is shown
    on the x-axis. Because the dashboard was designed to be understandable to Italian
    farmers, the information is provided in Italian. (For interpretation of the references
    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) 2.5. Functionality assessment on commercial farms 2.5.1. Farms
    The installation of the system on the test farms, which included the mounting
    of collar-based sensors on the cows, was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
    University of Milan (n. 25 of 1 March 2022). The system was installed on three
    commercial dairy cattle farms in the province of Cremona (Lombardy) in Northern
    Italy. These farms have been described in detail by Lovarelli et al. (2022). Briefly,
    the monitored barns host Italian Holstein dairy cows in a loose-housing system
    with free stalls and straw or solid digestate as litter. In the first farm, the
    system was installed in a barn area having a floor area of 1020 m2 with an outdoor
    loafing area of 47 m2 that had two lines of cubicles and housed on average 120
    lactating cows. One side of the barn was open, while the other three sides had
    walls. In the second farm, the monitored barn area had an area of 1324 m2, was
    open on all sides, contained two lines of cubicles, and housed on average 145
    cows. In the third farm, the system was installed in a barn that had an area of
    920 m2 that was open on all sides. The area consisted of three cubicle lines and
    housed on average 115 lactating cows. All monitored areas had fans above the lying
    area and sprinklers above the feeding area (on farm 3, sprinklers were installed
    in July 2021). Cows were milked twice a day and feed was provided once per day
    on all farms. 2.5.2. Installation Before installation on farms each sensor node
    was first tested in the laboratory under controlled conditions and then “commissioned”,
    i.e., it was assigned its type (e.g., N1, N2), received a unique identifier and
    was assigned to a farm. The number of sensors, their locations and the method
    of installation varied between farms depending on the barn structure. Table 2
    shows the number of sensor nodes that were installed on each farm. In the case
    of multiple sensors of the same type, care was taken to position the sensors in
    the barn in a way that assured mean values of sensor readings would best reflect
    the situation of the entire barn. Therefore, the positions of the sensors were
    dispersed and covered different areas of the barn as much as possible (see Supplementary
    Material 2 Figure S7 for an example of an installation plan on one farm). Pictures
    of some mounted sensors are shown in Figure S8 (Supplementary Materials). The
    N1 nodes were placed at an approximate height of 2.5 m above the floor, which
    is just out of reach of the cows. The nodes on the outer columns were directed
    to face inside the barn to avoid direct sunlight exposure. Where possible, sensors
    were mounted on the walls using magnets. In other cases, they were mounted on
    3-m long poles that were fixed to the cubicle barriers. The N3 sensors were installed
    to monitor sprinkler and drink water (depending on the accessibility of the water
    pipelines) on a group level (i.e., group of cows). On farm 1, it was not feasible
    to install N3 sensors to measure drink water, because the only accessible water
    supply pipeline served the entire farm. On the other farms, the number of installed
    drink water sensors depended on where they could be installed. On farm 3, the
    sensors (and their nodes) were installed at every drinking trough (four in total),
    while on farm 2, one sensor node was installed at the central pipeline to measure
    drink water use and two sensors were installed at the drinking troughs to measure
    the temperature. The litter sensors (N4) were only installed on farm 3, because
    the structure of the cubicle floors in the other two farms was not suitable for
    burying the sensors. On farm 3, the sensors were buried in the middle of the cubicle,
    deep in the litter in a compartment that was protected by rubber walls. The node
    was buried in a similar compartment in the litter between two adjacent cubicles
    and the connecting cable was also buried (see Supplementary Materials, Figure
    S8). The air quality sensor nodes (N5) were, like the N1 sensors, installed about
    2.5 m high on the walls of the barn or on metal poles that were fixed to the ceiling.
    The wind sensors nodes (N6) were, like some N1 sensors, fixed on poles that were
    either fixed between cubicle barriers, on the feeding alley, or attached to the
    walls of the barn (2.5─3 m high). The weather station (N9) was positioned in a
    field adjacent to and about 50─120 m from the monitored barn area. The N9 node,
    sensors and solar panels were all fixed to a large iron pole (2–4 m high) that
    was fixed in the ground using a concrete slab. The number of video cameras that
    was installed depended on the size of the monitored area (two at farm 3 and four
    at the other farms). The cameras were mounted on a wall, close to the ceiling
    to maximize the area that could be monitored. The indoor gateway was installed
    just outside the monitored area, about midway on the longer side (to minimize
    the distance to all nodes). At each farm 60 collar-mounted N2 sensors were put
    on semi-randomly chosen cows, preferring cows that were early in lactation. Whenever
    a cow was removed from the monitored area (e.g., due to drying off) the collar
    was put on a fresh cow. Table 2. The sensor nodes and other elements of the system

    weekly via the online dashboard, using the diagnostics page. Gaps in energy supply,
    unusual measurements and incidences of packet rolling number errors and resets
    were recorded in a spreadsheet file. The farms were also visited at intervals
    of 1─2 weeks to check and clean the sensors (with a damp cloth). If any problems
    with a sensor could not be resolved on the farm, the sensor was taken to the laboratory
    for closer inspection and repair or replacement. Spiderwebs were removed from
    the cameras using a dry cloth on a long wooden pole. 2.5.4. Data collection and
    processing Data were downloaded from the dashboard and saved in a database (in
    spreadsheet/ database format). After downloading the data, they were filtered
    to exclude outliers. The filter that was used and the acceptable ranges for each
    parameter are included in the Supplementary Material 2 (Table S3). To understand
    how much variation in a specific parameter across a barn could be expected, correlations
    were calculated between different sensors of the same type using the CORR procedure
    (Spearman, Fisher [using Fisher''s z-transformation for correlation statistics])
    in the statistical software SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). In addition
    to the data that were collected by the system, data for milk yield and quality
    (where possible from individual cows), health and fertility events, IDs, birth
    date and calving dates of the monitored cows, and events in the monitored areas
    that could affect cow behaviour (e.g., veterinarian visits) were recorded by the
    farm personal. These data were obtained either from an installed commercial monitoring
    system (Afimilk Ltd, Kibbutz Afikim, Israel; farm 1) or from the Regional Association
    of Farmers in Lombardy (ARAL; farms 2 and 3). 3. System performance 3.1. System
    operation The integrated monitoring systems were operational on the three farms
    for one year. This period served not only to verify the suitability of the system
    to collect data in a barn environment and to collect data for analyses, but also
    for problem solving and fine-tuning. Therefore, not all nodes were continuously
    installed and functioning on the farms during this period. The number of sensor
    nodes that were installed and functioning in each month are shown in the Supplementary
    Material 2 Table S4. Some problems encountered, such as loss of sensors, water
    damage and case damage, were due to the prototype nature of the system. In addition,
    the entire system on each farm was affected by power outages. Delays in turning
    on of a system occurred because the system had to be turned on manually on site
    after a power outage. In total 24 days on farm 1, 26 days on farm 2 and 33 days
    on farm 3 were missed due to this problem. The accelerometer nodes (N2) had an
    average lifetime (i.e., time until the node stopped working or had to be removed
    due to malfunctioning) of 340 days, and 141 out of 180 installed nodes (including
    replacements) were still functioning at the end of the test period. Consequently,
    the lifetime of these nodes can be expected to be much higher than what could
    be assessed in only one year. Of the 256 battery powered sensor nodes (including
    replacements), 11 nodes needed a battery replacement, meaning that the majority
    of the nodes could correctly function at least for one year on their initial batteries.
    3.2. Data stability Table 3 shows the percentage of data (10-min data points)
    that were actually collected out of the total data that could potentially have
    been collected, based on the calculation of the total number of 10-min intervals
    in which each node was installed and functioning without evident problems (e.g.,
    due to identified hardware or software malfunctioning, batteries getting loose)
    and in which there was no general power outage. These results give an indication
    of the data collection stability of the system. As Table 3 shows, the percentage
    of data collected for most sensors exceeds 90 %. Exceptions were the weather stations
    on all three farms, which often experienced problems with collecting temperature
    and humidity data. These problems were due to the communication channel of the
    temperature and humidity sensor which proved unreliable under long-term external
    weather conditions. The somewhat lower data collection percentage for the N2 nodes
    can be largely ascribed to temporary removal of the cows from the monitored areas
    during milking. Because the milking parlours were not located in the monitored
    section and because they were enclosed by walls, the data transmission from the
    collars to the gateway was slightly impaired when the cows were in the parlour.
    The calculated percentages concern the 10-min data points collected from all installed
    sensor nodes. However, for purposes of monitoring and analyses, hourly data and
    data based on means from different nodes of the same type is more suitable than
    using 10-min data or data from individual nodes in most cases. Therefore, the
    percentage of usable data in such cases is still higher than displayed in Table
    3, since for calculating means (from sensors and/or per hour), some missing data
    points could be acceptable, depending on the data type. Table 3. Percentage of
    collected 10-min data points of the total data points that could potentially have
    been collected per farm. The potential data points were calculated as 6 x 10-min
    intervals x 24 h x days on which the sensor node was installed and functioning
    without diagnosed problems. The total data points are sums of the data collected
    by all sensor nodes per farm. Empty Cell Total collected (N) Total potential (N)

    Table 4 shows the number of outliers that were excluded based on the acceptable
    data ranges (which are shown in the Supplementary Material 2 Table S3). Any data
    point that did not fall within the accepted range was considered an outlier and
    excluded. Table 4 shows that the number of outliers for most sensor nodes was
    less than 1 %. Nevertheless, the deviations of the outliers from the accepted
    data range were considerably large on several occasions (resulting in clear changes
    in the mean values, as can be seen in Supplementary Material 2 Table S5) and therefore
    would have considerable effects on any analyses based on the data. The percentage
    of outliers was larger for the N1 nodes than for other nodes, which was due to
    the humidity sensors often measuring 100 % humidity. Although this value may indeed
    be accurate on some occasions, this value was disproportionally measured by the
    sensors, likely due to droplets gathering on the humidity sensor (a problem that
    was later solved by fixing a special polytetrafluoroethylene polymer on the sensor).
    Therefore, to exclude these erroneous values, relative humidity values above 99.9
    % were filtered out. Indeed, from February 2022 (when the problem was solved)
    onwards, the percentage of outliers in the humidity data was below 1 %. Table

    correlation between different sensors of the same type, which gives an indication
    of the variation in a certain parameter across a barn and may help to determine
    the number of sensors required for obtaining a good representation of an entire
    barn. These correlations were not performed on the N2 nodes because for determining
    individual cow welfare it is necessary to measure the behaviour of individual
    cows. Table 5 shows that the correlations are very high for the measures collected
    by the N1 nodes, showing that the climate is relatively homogeneous within each
    of the monitored barn sections. An exception to this conclusion is humidity, which
    may indicate that some areas of the barn (e.g., close to sprinklers) may be more
    humid than others. However, the differences may also be due partly to difficulties
    with the humidity sensors (as detailed in Section 3.3). In contrast to those for
    N1 nodes, measures of air quality, wind, litter and drink water have much lower
    inter-sensor correlations. Some of this variation might on some occasions be the
    result of problems with individual sensors. Specifically, from April 2022 the
    NH3 measurements by one N5 sensor at farm 3 seemed to have “drifted” and suggest
    that the sensor needs recalibrating. Also, problems with cows digging out the
    (N4) litter sensors may have affected the measurements of these sensors. However,
    apart from these specific effects, most of the variation between sensors is likely
    due to the variability in the conditions in each monitored barn section. Consequently,
    for these parameters it is important to obtain measures from different areas across
    the barn. Interestingly, the degree of variation does not seem to depend on the
    size of the monitored areas, because the variation in the smallest area (farm
    3; 920 m2) was similar to that of the largest area (farm 2; 1324 m2). Therefore,
    the characteristics of the barn structure, its orientation, and characteristics
    of the environment surrounding the barn may be more important than the size of
    the barn in determining the homogeneity of the barn environment. It must also
    be noted that, although variation across the barn was small for some climate measures,
    such as temperature and THI, the relative importance of these measures on cow
    welfare warrants the use of multiple sensors to accurately determine the climatic
    conditions in different areas of the barn. The decision on the number of sensors
    per parameter that should be installed should therefore be based on a careful
    consideration of the costs and benefits. Table 5. Correlations between different
    barn sensors of the same type. If more than two correlations were calculated (which
    was the case if there were more than two sensor nodes), the range from lowest
    to highest correlation coefficient is shown. “Max. p” indicates the maximum obtained
    p-value across all correlations between sensors of the same type (spearman correlation
    with Fisher’s z-transformation). THI = temperature-humidity index, BGHI = black

    of the data obtained from the integrated monitoring system can enable different
    types of analyses for cow welfare assessment. On a basic level, the values of
    individually measured parameters can be used to detect situations of reduced welfare,
    e.g., increased daily lying time as an indication of lameness (Dittrich et al.,
    2019, Tucker et al., 2021). However, because an integrated system can measure
    simultaneously many different parameters that are relevant to cow welfare, such
    a system can potentially detect many different types of causes of reduced welfare
    (including lameness, mastitis and heat stress), provided that relevant indicators
    are measured (Leliveld and Provolo, 2020). This feature provides advantages over
    systems that only measure a single or only a few parameters, because an integrated
    system reduces the need to install multiple systems, each with its own architecture
    and supporting software (and thereby reducing the costs of purchase and installation).
    However, even better insight into a cow’s welfare status can be obtained by combining
    different simultaneous measurements (Frost et al., 1997, Leliveld and Provolo,
    2020, Wisnieski et al., 2019). Fig. 6a illustrates the benefits of combining different
    measurements of behaviour. In this graph of a single cow’s behaviour, an increase
    in the time spent lying down and decrease in the time spent standing (and later
    also eating) can be seen from around a week before to two weeks after the cow
    was diagnosed with fever. Because an increase in the time spent exhibiting one
    type of behaviour signifies a reduction in the time spent in other types of behaviour,
    monitoring whether the increase in lying time affects the time spent in another
    behaviour (e.g., eating), may help to better asses the health status of the cow
    and provide better treatment. Download : Download high-res image (391KB) Download

    cow during several weeks in late spring, combined with the mean THI (temperature-humidity
    index) during these weeks. c) Daily means and standard deviations of the difference
    between indoor and outdoor THI, calculated by substracting outdoor from indoor
    values, on the three farms. The means are based on four selected days per season:
    22─25.09.2021 (autumn), 24─27.02.2022 (winter), 03-06─06.2022 (spring), 22─25.07.2022
    (summer). d) Daily means and standard deviations of the wind speed measured by
    three sensors that were placed in different locations in the barn of farm 1. The
    values are presented as differences from the mean of all sensors and are based
    on four selected days per season: 22─25.09.2021 (autumn), 24─27.02.2022 (winter),
    03─06-06.2022 (spring), 22─25.07.2022 (summer). Even more insight can be obtained
    when behavioural data are combined with data regarding the barn climate, as is
    illustrated in Fig. 6b. In this figure a change in the behaviour of a single cow
    can be seen, i.e., a decrease in lying behaviour and increase in standing behaviour.
    A reduction in lying time and an increase in standing time could be a sign of
    heat stress (Hoffmann et al., 2020, Tucker et al., 2021), but may also be observed
    in cows with mastitis (Dittrich et al., 2019, Tucker et al., 2021). The inclusion
    of THI measurements improves the determination of the reason for this change in
    behaviour. In the case illustrated by Fig. 6b, the change in lying and standing
    time seem to parallel simultaneous changes in THI, suggesting that the cow may
    be experiencing heat stress, rather than suffering from mastitis. The integration
    of data, as performed in this prototype system, not only benefits the monitoring
    of the welfare status of individual cows, but also could help to identify structural
    or mechanical problems in the barn that could affect the welfare of all cows.
    This is enabled by the use of an external weather station as a reference and the
    use of multiple sensors to measure the same parameters. As illustrated in Fig.
    6c, the combination of measures of temperature and humidity both inside and outside
    the barn allows to calculate the difference in THI between the inside and outside
    of the barn and thereby to determine if the structure functions well to buffer
    extreme external weather conditions (Lovarelli et al., 2021). Fig. 6c shows that
    the more enclosed barn at farm 1 has positive Δ THI values in February and negative
    Δ THI values in June and July, suggesting that this barn buffers the outside THI
    values (at least numerically) better than the barn on the other two farms, which
    are open on all sides. This example shows that the integrated system can monitor
    the buffering capabilities of a barn and potential changes to them over time,
    which might occur when, for instance, climate controlling devices such as ventilators
    malfunction. The automatic detection of changes in the barn climate would enable
    a farmer to respond before any effect may be noticed in the behaviour of the cows.
    In addition, the use of multiple sensors to measure the same parameter offers
    the possibility to detect specific potential problem areas where the environmental
    conditions are inferior to those elsewhere in the barn. For example, Fig. 6d illustrates
    a comparison of wind speed measured by three wind sensors on farm 1 in different
    seasons. During autumn and winter, the values measured by the different sensors
    seem quite similar, but during late spring and summer (when the ventilators were
    operational), the mean values measured by sensor 2 are numerically lower than
    those from the other two sensors, and the mean values measured by sensor 3 are
    numerically higher than the average wind speed in the barn. Although these results
    may in part have been caused by a slightly higher positioning of sensor 2, this
    comparison also suggests that the ventilation system has a better coverage of
    the feeding area (monitored by sensor 3) than of the lying area (monitored by
    sensors 1 and 2), which could negatively affect cows’ lying times in the summer
    period (Calegari et al., 2014). The detection of problem areas in the barn can
    help to resolve potential structural or mechanical problems in these areas, thereby
    improving the barn environment as a whole and preventing the aggregation of cattle
    in one part of the barn (Provolo and Riva, 2009, Seyfi, 2013). The integrated
    monitoring system can also be extended to directly control the barn environment
    through the operation of, for example, cooling systems and wind screens, thereby
    achieving faster and more appropriate barn climate control. 4. Discussion The
    prototype of an integrated system designed to monitor barn environment and cow
    behaviour simultaneously was aimed to provide an open framework for research,
    allowing for customization and fine-tuning before its ultimate adoption as a management
    assistant on commercial dairy farms. Evaluation of the collected data shows that
    the system can effectively handle large quantities of information arriving at
    frequent intervals, with minimal data loss and outliers. Indeed, even though there
    were occasional malfunctions of individual nodes or sensors, the functioning of
    the more central components (i.e., gateways and backend) were only affected when
    power outages occurred on the farms. Data loss was kept low by combining a time-slotted
    wireless protocol, which prevents data collision (Khaleghi et al., 2013), with
    distributed data buffering, which minimizes data loss due to temporary failures
    of the communication infrastructure. Furthermore, the time of the nodes was constantly
    synchronized with the gateway time to prevent clock drifting which could have
    caused loss of data if the data were transmitted in the wrong time slot. Another
    challenge for data fusion (or indeed for any automatic collection of data) is
    the inherent uncertainty in sensor measurements, which could be caused by noise
    or impreciseness of the measurements or by the ambiguities and inconsistencies
    present in the environment (King et al., 2017, Kumar et al., 2006). Indeed, even
    though the percentage of outliers in our data was low, the outliers still had
    considerable effects on the calculated means and should therefore be excluded
    from analyses. In this study, the data were filtered manually, but there are several
    established outlier-detection algorithms that could be integrated in the system
    to exclude these values automatically (Basu and Meckesheimer, 2007, Du et al.,
    2023). The evaluation of data stability and outliers represent the first steps
    in testing the quality (or reliability) of the data that are obtained by the integrated
    system. The next step is to test the system’s ability to accurately detect situations
    of reduced cow welfare on the farm. Apart from the data quality, the cost of the
    system (purchase, installation, and operation) is also of high importance to farmers
    (Zhang et al., 2021). The initial investment is expected to lie between €60,000─80,000
    for a farm with 200 dairy cows. Although initial investments in automatic monitoring
    system are usually high, many economic evaluations show that these systems increase
    annual profit (Adenuga et al., 2020, Drach et al., 2017, Rutten et al., 2014).
    For instance, improved oestrus detection through the monitoring of cow behaviour
    was estimated to raise annual profit by 7 to 94.3 % (Adenuga et al., 2020), while
    effective heat stress management could reduce economic loss due to heat stress
    by as much as 60 % (St-Pierre et al., 2003). Compared to other systems, which
    tend to focus on a limited set of parameters, this integrated system has the added
    advantage of enabling improved management of multiple variables rather than just
    one (e.g., oestrus detection or heat stress management), facilitating higher net
    profits. Nevertheless, the initial installation cost plays an important role in
    the decision of farmers to invest in PLF technologies (Borchers and Bewley, 2015).
    To reduce costs, it is important to limit the use of multiple sensors by determining
    the minimum required number of sensors that are necessary per barn. The correlations
    shown in Table 5 can help to determine this number. To obtain a comprehensive
    overview of all aspects of a cow’s state, especially related to welfare (Fraser
    et al., 1997, von Keyserlingk et al., 2009), a multidimensional approach is needed.
    Advantages of using integrated data from different sources have already been shown
    in several studies on livestock management (Chang et al., 2022, Cruz et al., 2022,
    Pandey et al., 2021). However, while it is certain that data integration gives
    a better overview of a cow’s status, much is still unknown about the interactions
    between barn environment, cow behaviour and cow status (Leliveld & Provolo, 2020).
    For research and development purposes, it is therefore important that a system
    is open and can be customized to incorporate new measurements and explore new
    approaches to optimize the automatic monitoring of dairy cows. The present study
    lays the foundation of an integrated automatic monitoring system that is customizable
    and open by establishing suitable architecture that can unify and process in one
    place data from various sources. In addition, the system incorporates features
    that are specifically adapted for the use on dairy farms and in rural areas, such
    as an ultra-low power design and wireless communication channels (Germani et al.,
    2019, Riaboff et al., 2022). This work aimed to establish an open and customizable
    system with an architecture suited to data integration. By establishing such a
    system, this work provides an open framework for research-based data integration
    appropriate for the automatic, remote, and real-time monitoring of livestock.
    The next step in the development of this system is to design models and algorithms
    that can combine the many different parameters that are measured by the system
    to detect patterns associated with single welfare issues (e.g., reduced lying
    time, combined with increased THI as an indication of heat stress) as well as
    reduced cow welfare in general. For instance, algorithms similar to those developed
    by Chang et al. (2022) could be adopted to detect various cow welfare issues from
    the data generated by this system. Another important next step is the integration
    of herd data (e.g., calving dates and health status) and milk yield. This would
    not only help to improve the accurate detection of single welfare issues (Jensen
    et al., 2016, Van Hertem et al., 2016), but also provide important information
    on cow reproduction and production, leading to a more complete picture of a cow’s
    state and improved cow management. 5. Conclusions The development of this prototype
    system entails important progress towards data integration in the field of smart
    dairy farming, as well as a first step in the design and implementation of an
    open and customizable automatic integrated cow monitoring system for both research
    and commercial purposes. Next steps involve the integration of additional information,
    such as herd data, and to develop suitable models and algorithms that can combine
    data from multiple diverse sources to provide an accurate and complete overview
    of the state of an animal. The final product would then consist of a single system
    that automatically monitors all aspects related to production, reproduction, and
    welfare of cows on the farm, thereby supporting farmers in important management
    decision-making. CRediT authorship contribution statement Lisette M.C. Leliveld:

  description: Rainfall measurement is of great significance to agriculture, weather
    forecasting and water resource management, while rain energy harvesting is a desirable
    solution to energy demand of wireless sensor networks of rainfall information.
    In this work, a novel self-powered siphon rain gauge (SR) integrating with a siphon
    unit, a sensing unit and an energy harvesting unit is proposed, which can simultaneously
    measure rainfall information and capture rain energy. In the siphon unit, a siphon
    structure is used to periodically automatically trigger and stop siphon events.
    In the sensing unit, a liquid–solid multi-tube triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
    is proposed for the first time to detect rainfall information by a multi-tube
    synergistic sensing strategy. In the energy harvesting unit, a rotary TENG excited
    by the siphon emptying event is utilized to generate electricity by a rainwater
    potential energy collection-based generation strategy. After optimization design,
    the water level resolution of the multi-tube TENG is around 2.5 times higher than
    that of traditional single-tube TENG, resulting in a rainfall resolution of 20.45
    μm of SR. Besides, the rotary TENG successfully converts random, disordered, high-entropy
    raindrops energy into regular, ordered, low-entropy fluid mechanical energy. It
    can finally help the SR achieve a power density of 97.2 µW/m2, which is nearly
    2.5 times higher than that of liquid–solid contact TENG using the traditional
    instantaneous impact-based generation strategy. The proposed self-powered SR not
    only obtains an excellent real-time rainfall sensing capability, but also has
    remarkable rain energy harvesting ability. Therefore, this SR has great potential
    for extensive applications in the hydrology and meteorology fields.

    electricity by a rainwater potential energy collection-based generation strategy.
    After optimization design, the water level resolution of the multi-tube TENG is
    around 2.5 times higher than that of traditional single-tube TENG, resulting in
    a rainfall resolution of 20.45 μm of SR. Besides, the rotary TENG successfully
    converts random, disordered, high-entropy raindrops energy into regular, ordered,
    low-entropy fluid mechanical energy. It can finally help the SR achieve a power
    density of 97.2 µW/m2, which is nearly 2.5 times higher than that of liquid–solid
    contact TENG using the traditional instantaneous impact-based generation strategy.
    The proposed self-powered SR not only obtains an excellent real-time rainfall
    sensing capability, but also has remarkable rain energy harvesting ability. Therefore,
    this SR has great potential for extensive applications in the hydrology and meteorology
    fields. Graphical abstract Download : Download high-res image (200KB) Download

    harvesting 1. Introduction Rainfall information can provide the precipitation
    amount, frequency, and distribution of rainfall events over a specific period,
    demonstrate seasonal variations and identify climate changes in a particular location.
    The acquisition and utilization of rainfall information is of great significance
    to agricultural production, water resource management, weather forecasting, meteorological
    prediction and prevention of natural disasters. A rain gauge is a sensor that
    is commonly used to obtain rainfall information, which can be a node in rainfall
    information wireless sensor networks. According to different principles, rain
    gauges commonly can be divided into mechanical type, electrical type, optical
    type, visual type and so on. Siphon rain gauge (SR) is a typical representative
    of mechanical rain gauge, which can accurately measure rainfall amount, rainfall
    intensity, and start and end times of precipitation based on the siphon principle
    [1], [2]. It has been widely used in the field of hydrology and meteorology by
    virtue of its obvious advantage of good measurement accuracy caused by the ability
    to directly detect the weight or volume of rain. SR also has outstanding features
    of low cost, simple construction, and high compatibility with rainfall patterns.
    Especially since it has no mechanical moving parts in the siphon pipe, the good
    durability and long life are particularly suitable for long-term deployment of
    SR in rainfall information wireless sensor networks [3]. However, the traditional
    SR usually needs battery power to achieve its own functions and help the circuit
    module to process and transmit the rainfall information. So, energy supply problems
    such as battery replacement and maintenance seriously restrict the application
    of SR as a node in the wireless rainfall information sensor networks in the above
    environment [4]. On the other hand, there is a serious challenge for SR to achieve
    high accuracy in real-time measurement. That is the underestimation of rainfall
    due to the siphon emptying event which expels part of precipitation during the
    siphoning process [5], [6]. The greater the rainfall intensity, the more rainwater
    is expelled, resulting in a greater measurement error. Nowadays, capturing clean
    and renewable energy to replace traditional fossil energy is mandatory for the
    sustainable development of human society faced with the severe challenges of energy
    crisis and environmental pollution. In addition, for the rainfall information
    wireless sensor networks widely deployed in urban and remote areas, harvesting
    surround environmental accessible energy is more favorable than adopting a traditional
    battery power scheme that requires manual replacement and maintenance. Rain energy
    is obviously the first natural choice of available environmental energy for rainfall
    information wireless sensor networks deployed in places that reach plenty of rainfall.
    Recently, a class of energy harvesters based on triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
    via liquid–solid interface contact electrification was introduced for rain energy
    harvesting [7], [8], [9]. Based on triboelectrification and electrostatic induction,
    this type of TENG-based energy harvester can convert raindrop mechanical energy
    into electrical energy [10], [11], [12]. Furthermore, it is also very suitable
    to be designed as an active rainfall sensor according to the linear relationship
    between voltage and rainfall intensity. So, this technology utilizing TENG is
    promising to realize a fully self-powered device with energy harvesting/sensing
    function in wireless information sensor networks as a node for autonomous rainfall
    monitoring [13], [14], [15]. However, there are two thorny problems with this
    technology that need to be solved urgently. In the aspect of energy harvesting,
    the power density obtained by the TENG with liquid–solid contact electrification
    mode with array structure using the traditional instantaneous impact-based generation
    strategy are still at a low level [16], [17], although some scholars have adopted
    improved methods such as surface modification of triboelectric layer at the microstructural
    structure and optimization of the electrode layer [18], [11], [19]. It mainly
    results from the randomness, disorder, and high entropy properties of the raindrop
    energy. In the aspect of rainfall sense, unfortunately, the existing sensing principle
    of TENG significantly relies on detecting the voltage amplitude of the TENG electric
    signal, which is seriously affected by humidity as reported in previous references,
    especially in rainy environments [2], [12]. It is worth mentioning that a tipping
    bucket rain gauge combined with TENGs is proposed previously by our research group
    to explore rainfall sensing and rain energy harvesting [2]. It has reached a minimum
    rainfall resolution of 5.5 μm, but the used freestanding TENG with solid–solid
    interface contact electrification will accelerate the wear of the electrode and
    friction material surface, thus affecting the sensing performance and service
    life of this rain gauge. Fortunately, The TENG with liquid–solid interface contact
    electrification is expected to solve the above problems. However, there is a limitation
    of electrode width and spacing with the traditional single-tube TENG (ST-TENG)
    due to the stability of the signal, which makes it challenging to improve the
    resolution [2], [28]. In this work, a novel self-powered siphon rain gauge based
    on liquid–solid multi-tube TENGs with a single-electrode mode, a rotational TENG
    with a freestanding triboelectric-layer mode and a siphon is designed and investigated.
    The TENG-based siphon rain gauge has a remarkable rainfall sensing performance
    by detecting the electrical signal frequency of tubular TENGs which has a linear
    relationship with the rainfall intensity, as well as the remarkable harvesting
    ability of raindrops mechanical energy that is firstly collected by a siphon bucket
    to reach a stable high energy level and then converted into electrical energy
    via the rotary TENG (R-TENG) excited by a siphon trigger event. In the aspect
    of sensing unit, a multi-tube synergistic water level sensing strategy based on
    liquid–solid tubular TENGs is first proposed. Compared with the traditional single-tube
    TENG (ST-TENG) [20], [21], [22], [23], the ability of the proposed strategy to
    distinguish the water level has been significantly improved, which further effectively
    improves the rainfall intensity resolution of the siphon rain gauge. Besides,
    the theoretical model and finite element model of the system have been established,
    and essentially reveal that the siphon time is the key factor affecting the resolution
    of the rain gauge which is verified in experiments. Then, the structure parameters
    affecting the siphon time in the siphon unit have been determined and optimized,
    resulting in the improvement of the accuracy of the siphon rain gauge. In the
    aspect of energy harvesting, a rainwater potential energy collection-based generation
    strategy for a stable high energy level utilizing the siphon trigger event to
    make the R-TENG work is first presented. It successfully converts random, disordered,
    high-entropy raindrops energy into regular, ordered, low-entropy fluid mechanical
    energy, and then further into electrical energy by rotational TENG. Thus, this
    approach effectively solves the problem of the traditional instantaneous impact-based
    generation strategy collecting the rainwater energy by TENGs with liquid–solid
    interface contact mode that the energies obtained by raindrops are very small
    due to the limited volume and terminal falling velocity of the individual raindrop
    [24]. The gravitational energy with a constant high level accumulated by raindrops
    over time can be released through a siphoning process to drive the rotational
    TENG to generate electricity at higher efficiency. Therefore, the proposed self-powered
    siphon rain gauge on the basis of the TENGs employing the unique multitube synergistic
    sensing strategy and the potential energy collection-based generation strategy
    has great application prospects in the wireless rainfall information sensor networks
    for meteorology and hydrology fields. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Structure
    and working principle of siphon rain gauge Fig. 1a describes the schematic diagram
    of the siphon rain gauges in the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for real-time rainfall
    monitoring and data transmission. Fig. 1b illustrates the overall construction
    diagram of the designed siphon rain gauge, which contains a tapered funnel, a
    shell, an external bracket, and a main structure of the rain gauge. The main structure
    of the rain gauge (Fig. 1c) mainly includes four units, a siphon unit (Fig. 1d),
    a sensing unit (Fig. 1e), an energy harvesting unit (Fig. 1f) and a supporting
    frame. Based on the siphon principle, the siphon unit with an ingenious vent tube
    structure is manufactured to automatically trigger and stop of siphon for continuous
    rainfall information measurement and rainwater energy collection. The sensing
    unit realizes sensing through multi-tube TENG (MT-TENG), where five Fluorinated
    Ethylene Propylene (FEP) tubes serve as one triboelectric layer connected with
    the siphon unit, and the other triboelectric layer is rainwater. The electrodes
    made of copper foil serve as an electrode layer pasted around the FEP tubes. The
    energy harvesting unit consists of a shaft, an impeller, a rotor, a stator, two
    flange coupling and two shaft brackets. The energy harvesting unit collects the
    energy of the stator as the triboelectric layer and electrode layer concurrently,
    and a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane is placed on the outer surface of
    the rotor as another triboelectric layer. The digital photo of the designed siphon
    rain gauge and its integral construction are shown in Fig. 1g and Fig. 1h. Fig.
    1i, Fig. 1j and Fig. 1k depict the siphon unit, sensing unit and energy harvesting
    unit, of which copper foils are pasted on the outer surface of the sensing unit
    and the inner surface of the energy harvesting unit of the prototype, respectively.

    The siphon phenomenon will be triggered by the increasing real-time rainwater
    level of the siphon unit, and the whole working principle of the siphon unit is
    illustrated in Fig. 2a. The siphon process diagram and the demonstration video
    obtained by finite element simulation are supplemented in Supporting Information
    (see Fig. S4) and Supporting Movie S1. When the water level rises to the siphon
    stopping level, the working process enters the first phase (Fig. 2a ii) of the
    working cycle from the initial phase (Fig. 2a i). The water level keeps rising
    and reaches the siphon starting level after the second phase (Fig. 2a iii), then
    the working process comes to the third phase (Fig. 2a iv), in which the siphon
    emptying event is triggered. Due to a continuous thrust on the rainwater caused
    by the joint action of air pressure and hydraulic pressure, the water level will
    soon drop from the siphon starting level to the siphon stopping level, i.e., after
    the fourth phase (Fig. 2a v) the working process will return to the first phase,
    in which the siphon ends, and the rainwater starts storing again. Thus, a total
    working cycle of the siphon is finished. The established theoretical model of
    the siphon phenomenon is provided in Supporting Information. The working principle
    of the traditional ST-TENG based on a single-electrode mode is schematically depicted
    in Fig. 2b [22]. Before the water level reaches the electrode, because the FEP
    tube is easier to obtain electrons than copper electrode, they both produce the
    same amount of positive and negative charges respectively, as depicted in Fig.
    2b i. When the rainwater reaches the first electrode, the original electrostatic
    balance is destroyed, and the water covering the electrode is positively charged.
    Meanwhile, the induced potential difference drives electrons to flow from the
    ground to the electrode, thereby generating the current signal (Fig. 2b ii). The
    current continues until the rainwater completely covers the electrode. With the
    ever-rising water level, the corresponding current signal will be generated when
    the rainwater reaches the second electrode (Fig. 2b iii) and the third electrode
    (Fig. 2b iv). After the triggering of the siphon, the water level drops back to
    the initial stage of Fig. 2b i and rises again, so as to realize the continuous
    rainfall sensing. The previous study about ST-TENG has made achievements in both
    theoretical exploration and application exploration, but the electrode width and
    spacing they studied remain at the cm level [25], [26]. Furthermore, it is proposed
    that the major issue with the principle of ST-TENG is the contradiction between
    the quality and resolution of electrical signals. Only by ensuring a certain electrode
    spacing can a stable electrical signal be generated. This may be because the interference
    between the two electrodes will increase with the decrease of the spacing. There
    is always an upper limit on parameter optimization of ST-TENG, thus, it is urgent
    to innovate and breakthrough in principle for improving the sensing resolution.

    Fig. 2. Operational principles of the proposed TENGs-based siphon rain gauge:
    (a) working principle of the siphon unit, (b) working principle of the traditional
    ST-TENG, (c) proposed MT-TENG, (d) R-TENG. To break the limitation of traditional
    ST-TENG in principle, a novel sensing unit is proposed to further improve the
    resolution of the rain gauge. The key lies in the proposed multi-tube synergistic
    sensing strategy alleviates the contradiction between improving the resolution
    of the rain gauge and ensuring the quality of electrical signals to a certain
    extent. As depicted in Fig. 2c, the electrodes are pasted on the three tubes in
    an equidistant and staggered arrangement. Since the three tubes are connected,
    their water levels keep rising consistently. When the water level is in Fig. 2c
    ii, the bottom electrode of tube 1 generates an electrical signal. Similarly,
    the bottom electrodes of tube 2 and tube 3 will generate electrical signals accordingly
    when the water level is in the stages of Fig. 2c iii and Fig. 2c iv. Theoretically,
    the more tubes in series, the higher the resolution the siphon rain gauge can
    achieve. After the siphon is triggered, the water flow at the outlet of the siphon
    unit will drive the energy harvesting unit to work, and its working principle
    is shown in Fig. 2d. Initially, when the flexible PTFE membrane overlaps with
    electrode 1, the former is negatively charged, and the latter is positively charged
    (Fig. 2d i). When the PTFE membrane slides towards to electrode 2, the electrostatic
    balance is broken, a potential difference generated between the two electrodes
    makes the current flows from electrode 1 to electrode 2 (Fig. 2d ii). When the
    PTFE membrane rotates counterclockwise until it overlaps with electrode 2, it
    returns to the electrostatic balance state (Fig. 2d iii). As the PTFE membrane
    is in the position shown in Fig. 2d iv, the corresponding induced current will
    be generated. The above is a complete working cycle of R-TENG. The designed R-TENG
    based on the siphon structure can collect the tiny, disordered, high-entropy energy
    contained in the raindrop and convert it into the ordered, low-entropy, mechanical
    energy of the fluid with the potential energy, which greatly improves the power
    density of traditional raindrop energy harvesters with array structure using the
    traditional instantaneous impact-based generation strategy[10], [11], [12]. 2.2.
    Performance of siphon unit It is shown in Fig. 2a that each cycle of the siphon
    unit has two processes: the water storage process and the siphon process. The
    designed siphon rain gauge can only sense the rainfall in the water storage process,
    resulting in the underestimation of the detected rainfall amount. Through theoretical
    analysis in Supporting Information, the measurement accuracy and the error of
    the rain gauge can be expressed as, respectively: (1) (2) where and are the measured
    rainfall amount and actual total rainfall amount in one cycle, and are the heights
    of starting water level and stopping water level, and is the actual loss of rainfall
    amount during siphon process, is the siphon time. Therefore, the siphon time must
    be controlled to further improved the measurement accuracy. According to the theoretical
    derivation of siphon time in Supporting Information, the expression of siphon
    time is as follows: (3) where is the instantaneous velocity of water level falling
    at time , is the real-time height of water level in a water tank, is the annular
    cross-sectional area of siphon bucket, is the outlet area of siphon bucket, is
    the loss coefficient, is the volume flow rate of inflow, (average rainfall intensity
    x top opening area of the tape funnel). From the above analysis, it can be concluded
    that , , , , , and are the seven parameters that determine . Thus, for these seven
    parameters, the parameters optimization and performance analysis of the siphon
    unit are carried out from three aspects: numerical analysis (NA), finite element
    analysis (FEA) and experimental analysis (EA), see Fig. 3. It can be seen from
    Fig. 3a and b that with the increase of and , the siphon time will increase slightly,
    but its impact can be almost ignored. This also shows that the designed siphon
    rain gauge has high stability under different . The siphon time decreases with
    the increase of and (Fig. 3c and f), but increases with the increase of and (Fig.
    3d and e). It is worth noting that the height of the siphon start level is set
    as in NA (Maple), while the pressure required to trigger siphon in FEA and EA
    is often much greater, resulting in of NA is slightly smaller under the same conditions,
    especially for and (Fig. 3e and f). According to Equation. (2), the error of the
    rain gauge under different , and are obtained, see Fig. 3g-i. Obviously, the variation
    trends of error and siphon time with respect to , and are consistent. This phenomenon
    is well matched with the theoretical analysis (i.e.,measurement error is positively
    correlated with siphon time). It is conceivable that the siphon time will increase
    with the increase of the loss coefficient , which is confirmed by Fluent, see
    Fig. S2 in Supporting Information. Additionally, the nature of each variable used
    in the equations is defined in Supporting Information. In general, the specific
    values of the above key parameters of the siphon unit can be determined for the
    subsequent experiments: =1 m2, =4 mm, =65 mm, =120 mm, =29 mm. Download : Download

    To characterize the electrical output performance of the ST-TENG, an experimental
    system for a single FEP tube is established. The electrical output signal using
    the electrical wiring method shown in Fig. 4a is measured during the process of
    the water level increasing and falling in a cycle of the siphon unit (Fig. 4b).
    The width of three electrodes (C1, C2 and C3) pasted on the single tube is 2 mm
    and the blank region (P1 and P2) is 28 mm. When the water level rises across C1,
    C2 and C3, there are three corresponding peaks in the voltage and current of ST-TENG
    across a resistance of 1 GΩ; when the water level drops rapidly across the electrodes
    after the siphon is triggered, peaks with large amplitude will be generated due
    to the high rate of water level decline, see Fig. 4c. Fig. 4d shows the open-circuit
    voltage and the derivative of the open-circuit voltage signal relative to time
    of ST-TENG. Obviously, increases faster within the electrode regions (C1, C2 and
    C3). That is, the growth rate of in the electrode region is higher than that in
    the blank region. Therefore, a positive peak will be obtained in an electrode
    region through differential processing, which is more conducive to calculating
    the signal frequency (i.e., the rain gauge resolution). Download : Download high-res

    tubes A&B&C. To further improve the rain gauge resolution, the concept of MT-TENG
    is proposed and a preliminary experiment is carried out. Fig. 4e shows the experimental
    system established for synergistic three FEP tubes, which are labeled by A, B
    and C. Two electrodes with a width of 2 mm were pasted on each tube labeled by
    C1 (lower one) and C2 (upper one). The blank region of the single tube is 34 mm,
    and the blank region between two adjacent electrodes of each two tubes is 10 mm.
    Fig. 4f shows the diagram of the synchronized water level at different electrode
    regions and blank regions of three tubes. First, for better comparison, the and
    of tube A, B and C under the wiring mode shown in Fig. 4a is obtained, see Fig.
    4g i-iii respectively. The preliminary MT-TNG is established by three synergistic
    FEP tubes with the electrical wiring method shown in Fig. 4e (i.e., connect tubes
    A&B&C in series). And Fig. 4h clearly shows the generated by the six electrodes
    from the three tubes. Importantly, it can be seen that the resolution of MT-TENG
    is increased by three times under this condition. In summary, compared with traditional
    ST-TENG, the MT-TNG can indeed improve the resolution of the rain gauge when achieving
    the upper limit of the electrode spacing of the single tube. In order to optimize
    the key parameters of MT-TENG, a series of theoretical analyses was carried out
    in Supporting Information, where the theoretical distinguished rainfall amount
    of the MT-TENG is obtained: (4) where is the spacing between two electrodes of
    an FEP tube, is the total number of the FEP tubes, is the top opening area of
    tapered funnel, and are the cross-sectional areas of the outer cylinder of the
    siphon bucket and tube, respectively. From the Equation. (4), it can be concluded
    that ( =electrode width  + blank region), , , are key parameters. Besides, , ,
    and , which affects the sensing performance of the rainfall information, are studied
    systematically, as depicted in Fig. 5. The study of the other three parameters,
    , and , is shown in Figure S6 in Supporting Information. Performance optimization
    experiments of sensing for the TENGs-based siphon rain gauge are performed at
    a rainfall intensity of 250 mm/d. Fig. 5a-c shows , short-circuit current and
    of the ST-TENG with a 1 m-diameter tapered funnel under different electrode width
    in three cycles, respectively. Fig. 5a indicates the voltage signal in three working
    cycles of a siphon rain gauge (including the water storage process and siphon
    process), and the of the ST-TENG in three working cycles. In order to more intuitively
    observe the signals generated by the electrodes, and generated by the water storage
    process in the three cycles are separated from whole generated signals and exhibited
    in Fig. 5b-c. Obviously, the signals of and will increase with the increase of
    . For better resolution, of 2 mm is the selected width with the stable peak-to-peak
    value of and at 15 V and 0.1nA respectively. Fig. 5d-e shows and of the ST-TENG
    driving by the collected rainwater with a 1 m-diameter tapered funnel under different
    electrode spacing . Under each condition, the electrical signal frequency is measured
    by the test and the distinguished rainfall amount is calculated based on Equation.
    (S4). There is no doubt that the time between two signal peaks is increasing with
    the increased while the peak value of and are almost the same. It is shown in
    Fig. 5f that reduces from 58.8 mHz to 21.2 mHz while grows from 49.2 μm to 136.6
    μm as the increases. When the is less than 10 mm, the two signals tend to interfere
    with each other, which will affect the signal identification under the multi-tube
    coupling condition (i.e., in the sensing unit). Therefore, 10 mm electrode spacing
    is selected as the optimal value in the subsequent demonstration experiment. Using
    the electrical wiring methods of single tube and multitube shown in Fig. 2b-c,
    the electrical output performance of MT-TENG under different tube number can be
    obtained (Fig. 5g-i). The increases from 9.8 mHz to 70.2 mHz while decreased from
    294.9 μm to 41.5 μm with the increasing . The rainfall resolution is improved
    effectively by Increasing , especially when the single tube reaches the limit
    resolution. Theoretically, the resolution can be further improved as long as can
    be continuously increased. Due to the limitations of the test, the feasible maximum
    is not explored in this work. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download

    characteristic of the MT-TENG of the siphon rain gauge at 250 mm/d. Based on the
    experimental result shown in Fig. 5d, = 10 mm is the optimal value obtained for
    MT-TENG under the condition that the frequency of the electrical signal can be
    recognized clearly. Thus, of the single tube T2 and multitube T1-5 under the condition
    of 2 mm electrode width and 10 mm electrode spacing per tube are shown in Fig.
    6a i-ii. It can be seen from Fig. 6a i that the characteristics of the electrical
    signals generated by the five tubes are the same, so take T2 as an example. According
    to the number of positive peaks, there are six electrodes with a spacing of 10
    mm on each tube. In order to obtain the results of MT-TENG more effectively, five
    groups of data after differential processing are further coupled and spliced,
    and then the curve in Fig. 6a ii is obtained. The five groups of data of different
    tubes are distinguished by different colors. Obviously, the collaborative five
    tubes can improve the electrical signal frequency by five times based on a single
    tube. Undoubtedly, MT-TENG with a multi-tube synergistic sensing strategy can
    greatly improve the resolution of the siphon rain gauge. Fig. 6b shows and under
    different rainfall intensities. With the increasing , the absolute values of and
    are increasing. Importantly, increases linearly as increases, as marked in Fig.
    6c. The variance of 0.99834 is obtained by linear fitting, indicating that the
    linearity of with respect to is pretty good. The measured electrical signal frequency
    is almost the same under the same rainfall intensity and the condition of humidity
    from 30% to 70%, see Fig. 6d. It can also be easily seen from Fig. 6e that is
    hardly affected by humidity, while decreases rapidly with the increase of humidity.
    All in all, the method of using frequency to calibrate rainfall information is
    more reliable and stable compared with voltage, which is more susceptible to the
    surrounding environment (e.g., humidity). It further shows the frequency- based
    sensing principle adopted has a good ability to withstand humidity interference,
    indicating the excellent stability and robustness of the designed siphon rain
    gauge. Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size

    siphon process, a R-TENG is designed in the energy harvesting unit for converting
    the potential and kinetic energy in rainwater into electric energy. Fig. 7 shows
    the electric output performance of the R-TENG at a constant rainfall intensity
    of 250 mm/d. Firstly, two significant parameters, the turbine radius and the number
    of electrode pairs , are optimized through a series of experiments. With the increasing
    , , ,and transferred charge tend to decrease, as illustrated in Fig. 7a i-iii.
    The maximum peak-to-peak values of , ,and are around 45 V, 2 μA, 19 nC when equals35
    mm. As exhibited in Fig. 7b, increases slightly and increases rapidly with the
    increasing , while is almost constant. In addition, the increase of will also
    lead to the decrease of the turbine speed , which is due to the increase of the
    resistance moment, so that the frequency of the electrical signal will correspondingly
    decrease, see Fig. 7c. Fig. 7d indicates the influence of on can be almost ignored,
    while it is positively related to . Fig. 7e shows the relationship of average
    voltage and current peak of the R-TENG at 1 MΩ to 1000 MΩ resistance under 250
    mm/d. Obviously, the gradually increases while decreases with the increased resistance
    value. It can be seen that will constantly approach the open circuit condition.
    And the maximum peak power of R-TENG reaches the energy harvesting unit reaches
    225 μW. Through comparison between the proposed rainwater potential energy collection-based
    generation strategy and the traditional instantaneous impact-based generation
    strategy, the designed device has great advantages in energy harvesting, see Fig.

    reference, the distinguished minimum water level height of the sensing unit is
    compared between the proposed multi-tube synergistic sensing strategy and the
    traditional single-tube sensing strategy [20], [21], [23], [26], [27], [28], and
    then the power density of the energy harvesting unit is compared between the proposed
    rainwater potential energy collection-based generation strategy and 225 μW at
    the optimized matching impedance resistance of around 31.6 MΩ, see Fig. 7e. Importantly,
    the power density of the traditional instantaneous impact-based generation strategy
    is marked in Fig. 8. The detailed comparison results are given in Table S2 and
    S3 in the Supporting Information. The distinguished water level height of the
    proposed sensing strategy is reduced to 2/5 of the best reported result in the
    literature using the traditional sensing strategy, whilst the power density of
    the proposed energy harvesting strategy is 5 times of the traditional strategy
    under normal rainfall intensity conditions [10], [11], [12], [16], [17], [29],
    which indicates that the sensing precision and energy harvesting ability are significantly
    optimized and improved. 2.4. Demonstration The application demonstrations of TENGs-based
    siphon rain gauge on sensing and energy harvesting are illustrated in Fig. 9.
    Note that the video of the working principle of siphon pain gauge is displayed
    in Supporting movie S2. Fig. 9a shows the of single tube (Fig. 9a i) and five
    tubes (Fig. 9a ii) under a constant rainfall intensity of 175 mm/d. For the single
    tube in Fig. 9a i, the first detected electrode height is 12 mm, and the electrode
    spacing is 10 mm. The six electrodes on the single tube are represented by black
    dots, which correspond to the peak value of . For better distinction, the identification
    of signals with the same color indicates that the electrodes belong to the same
    tube. Thus, it is obvious that there are five FEP tubes and 30 electrodes totally
    in Fig. 9a ii. The first detected electrode height is still 12 mm, and the electrode
    spacing is 2 mm. Through the experimental result in Fig. 9b, the distinguishable
    rainfall of MT-TENG decreases obviously with the increase of the tube number under
    175 mm/d, which means that the sensing resolution is greatly improved. The detailed
    process of rainfall intensities measurement using the sensing unit under the condition
    of regularly varying rainfall intensities is displayed in Supporting Movie S3.
    Fig. 9c shows the real-time rainfall intensity measured by MT-TENG for the rainfall
    intensity ranging from moderate rain to extremely heavy rain (i.e., from 17.5
    mm/d to 250 mm/d), which are in good agreement with the input rainfall intensity.
    According to the Equation. (S3) and Equation. (S10) in Supporting Information,
    the measured and compensated precipitation, the measured and optimized accuracy
    can be calculated, as illustrated in Fig. 9d and Fig. 9e, respectively. Under
    each rainfall intensity, the error between compensated precipitation and the input
    precipitation are less than 8%. And the maximum optimized accuracy reaches 98.4%
    at 75 mm/d; The minimum optimized accuracy is 92.4% at 17.5 mm/d. In general,
    the current compensation methods can indeed improve the measurement accuracy to
    a certain extent, but it still requires to be improved. In the follow-up research,
    the measurement accuracy of the rain gauge will also be improved by some measures,
    such as standardizing the test data readings, optimizing the compensation formula
    and so on. Above rainfall simulation experiments are conducted on the experimental
    platform as shown in Fig. 9f. Supporting Movie S4 shows the lighting LEDs by the
    energy harvesting unit. Download : Download high-res image (333KB) Download :

    integrated with a siphon unit, a sensing unit and an energy harvesting unit is
    proposed. Combined with the characteristics of each unit, the working principle
    of the SR is introduced and then systematically investigated by theoretical analysis,
    finite-element simulations, and experimental results. In the sensing unit, the
    concept of the multi-tube synergistic sensing strategy based on liquid–solid tubular
    TENG for liquid level sensing is presented for the first time. With the decrease
    in electrode distance and the increase of the tube number, it significantly improves
    the water level resolution compared to the traditional single-tube TENG, which
    is beneficial for increasing the resolution of SR. Then there is a siphon emptying
    event that will happen when rainwater reaches the set height of the siphon bucket
    in the siphon unit. It makes the R-TENG in the energy harvesting unit work efficiently
    to generate electricity through the rainwater potential energy collection-based
    generation strategy that successfully transforms the random, disordered, high-entropy
    raindrop energy into regular, ordered, low-entropy fluid kinetic energy. In addition,
    the key structural parameters of the siphon unit, sensing unit and energy harvesting
    unit affecting the output performances of the system are investigated and optimized
    with a series of thorough modeling and testing efforts. Eventually, the water
    level resolution of the multi-tube TENG can reach 2 mm, which is 2.5 times higher
    than that of traditional single-tube TENG reported before. Thus, the rainfall
    resolution and measurement accuracy of the SR can reach 20.45 μm and 98.4%, respectively.
    Besides, the power density of the prototype is maximized at 97.2 mW/m2 with a
    load resistance of 31.6 MΩ, which is higher under common rainfall intensity conditions
    compared with the results using the traditional instantaneous impact-based generation
    strategy in previous literature. The proposed SR shows excellent performances
    as a rainfall self-powered sensor and rain energy harvester, which would be very
    promising for realizing a fully self-powered wireless sensor network for autonomous
    rainfall monitoring. 4. Experimental section 4.1. Fabrication of the siphon rain
    gauge The siphon rain gauge in this work has three parts, a tapered funnel, an
    external bracket, a shell, and a main structure of the rain gauge. The stainless-steel
    bracket is fixed on the ground by welding. The shell is fixed inside the external
    bracket with the dimensions of 500 mm × 600 mm (height × diameter). The tapered
    funnel with a maximum diameter of 1 m and the main structure of the rain gauge
    are located at the top and inside of the shell, respectively. The shell and tapered
    funnel are made by an injection molding machine using the material of polymethyl
    methacrylate (PMMA). The main structure of the rain gauge has the optimized dimension
    of 250 mm × 250 mm × 285 mm (length × width × height), including a siphon unit,
    a sensing unit, an energy harvesting unit and a supporting frame. The MT-TENG
    used in the sensing unit and the R-TENG used in the energy harvesting unit work
    in the single electrode mode and the freestanding triboelectric-layer mode, respectively.
    The siphon unit is made of acrylic with a size of 130 mm × 140 mm (diameter ×
    height), which is connected with five FEP tubes. The FEP tubes and the electrodes
    made of copper foil pasted outside form the sensing unit. Electrodes with a width
    of 2 mm are arranged on five FEP tubes in an equidistant dislocation manner, and
    the electrode spacing on each tube is 4 mm. The energy harvesting unit consists
    of a shaft, an impeller, a rotor, a stator, two flange couplings and two shaft
    brackets. The shaft is made of aluminum alloy with a size of 6 mm × 250 mm (diameter
    × length). The impeller, rotor, stator, flange coupling, and shaft bracket are
    all made by a 3D printer. The dimension of each PTFE membrane fixed on the outside
    of the rotor is 6 mm × 250 mm (length × width). The electrode attached to the
    outside of the rotor is made of copper foil, and each electrode of eight pairs
    of electrodes has square dimensions of 60 mm × 60 mm × 0.065 mm (length × width
    × thickness). Additional information is provided in the Supporting Information.
    4.2. Measurement of the fabricated devices The rainfall intensity test for the
    rain gauge is carried out on the rainfall simulation experiment platform (Fig.
    9(a)). A peristaltic pump is used to control the simulated rainfall intensity
    varying from 0 to 250 mm/d. The electric signals of MT-TENG and R-TENG are measured
    by a Keithley 6514 electrometer and a National Instruments PCI-6529 data acquisition
    system. The electrical signal data is transmitted to the PC, which is analyzed
    and recorded by LabVIEW. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

  description: After the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake (Kumamoto earthquake sequence) of
    maximum magnitude M7.3 occurred, agricultural fields and crops were significantly
    damaged by soil liquefaction in lowland polders, which had shallow saline groundwater.
    A desalinization treatment was required to recover agricultural production in
    polders in Kumamoto. To understand the soil salinity levels in the root zone,
    we installed multiple-point measurements using the wireless sensor network system
    (WSNS) for real-time monitoring of soil moisture (θ) and bulk soil EC (ECb) in
    a cherry tomato greenhouse. Pore-water electrical conductivity (ECw) can be estimated
    as an indicator of the field's salinity level simultaneously. First, we found
    rapid increases in θ and ECw where soil liquefaction and sand boils occurred.
    Through soil survey, we confirmed the existence of a large channel beneath one
    of the liquefaction plots, suggesting considerably high spatial heterogeneity
    of soil salinity across the greenhouse. Secondly, the high salinity level could
    not be controlled by drip irrigation at all. Finally, 1-week flooded leaching
    treatments were carried out; the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey
    indicated that the salinity level decreased significantly except around the channel
    plot. The combination of the flooded leaching and natural rainfall was more effective
    for salt leaching in macropores and channels. Our analysis using the WSNS highlighted
    three management strategies that may help reduce a polder's salinity level.

    in significant temporal and spatial variations in soil salinity, leading to the

    Introduction The 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake (Kumamoto earthquake sequence) occurred
    in Kumamoto Prefecture and its surrounding areas in Japan on April 14, 2016 [1].
    The epicenter was located at 32.793°N, 130.749°E, with a focal depth of about
    10.0 km [2] (Fig. 1). There were a series of foreshocks and mainshocks in the
    same region, which included the M6.5 (at 21:26 on April 14 (local time)) and M7.3
    (at 1:25 on April 16 (local time)) earthquakes [3]. The Earthquake seriously damaged
    Kumamoto''s agricultural lands and crop facilities along the Ariake sea. There
    are many lowland coastal farmlands along the coastline of the Ariake sea as a
    result of many reclamation projects since ancient times [4]. In Kumamoto prefecture,
    having approximately 20,000 ha of agricultural land reclamation, [5] reported
    crop damages due to soil liquefaction containing high salinity in shallow groundwater
    in response to the strong ground shaking. Because the local distribution of the
    liquefaction might cause high spatial variability of soil salinity in the lowland
    coastal farmlands, the effective desalinization of salinity soil was required
    to recover agricultural production. Download : Download high-res image (314KB)

    earthquake''s epicenter occurred on 15 Apr., 2016 at 16:25:06 UTC (credits: USGS
    https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20005iis #general). For the
    recovery of salinized farmlands, volumetric soil water content (θ) and pore water
    electrical conductivity (ECw) are helpful in measuring soil salinity conditions
    through a real-time monitoring system. For example, [6] developed a Field Monitoring
    System (FMS) containing two central systems: a monitoring system and field measurements
    (e.g., Time Domain Ttransmissiometry (TDT) sensors and dataloggers). The monitoring
    system can collect the in-situ data through Bluetooth and send it to the data
    server over the Internet. This measurement technique allowed us to facilitate
    agricultural production recovery on 2011 tsunami-affected farmlands through real-time
    monitoring θ and ECw in homogeneous paddy fields [7]. However, if the heterogeneity
    of soil salinity was caused by upland fields converted from the recovered paddy
    fields [8], the utilization of FMS was limited by the prohibitive cost of setting
    several observation points for monitoring the spatial variability of salinity
    conditions. Especially in crop management, such as soybean and tomato cultivation
    on coastal tidelands, soil salinity levels presented considerably high temporal
    and spatial heterogeneity because of the differences in reclamation measures and
    farming practices [8]. New innovative and cost-effective IoT applications are
    helping the farming sector improve agricultural production''s standard, quantity,
    sustainability, and price effectiveness [9]. While access to real-time data reduces
    site visits, a significant benefit of distributed real-time data relates to decision-making
    support for a more effective irrigation timing and scheduling of salt leaching.
    Recent advances in sensing technology, particularly in wireless sensor network
    systems (WSNS), enable environmental monitoring in real-time and at unprecedented
    spatial and temporal scales [10,11] developed the WSNS with Arduino and XBEE for
    real-time monitoring θ and ECw in heterogeneous agricultural fields and greenhouses.
    The WSNS consists of the extension unit, an edge device connected to soil moisture-salinity
    sensors (TDT sensors), and the base unit that receives the data and transmits
    it to the cloud (Fig. 2). Measured data was available to download through a Web
    server. For recovery of tsunami-affected farmlands, [11] analyzed the prototype
    of WSNS and concluded that the technology could effectively capture spatially
    representative measurements of soil salinity in soybean fields. Download : Download

    By comparison with point measurement technology, geophysical methods such as electrical
    resistivity tomography (ERT) can provide two-dimensional spatial geological information
    non-invasively about bulk soil EC (ECb) that is defined by the reciprocal of the
    electrical resistivity. ERT is an effective tool to ascertain the change in the
    groundwater environment because electrical resistivity is strongly affected by
    θ and salinity variations in the soil [12]. After the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake,
    [13] reported changes in soil resistivity distribution based on the ERT line survey
    in Kumamoto. Furthermore, our concern is that the Earthquake might cause seawater
    intrusion from the seaside around a coastal polder. For example, seawater intrusion
    from the seaside was confirmed after the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake [14]. Due to the
    ERT survey, the validation of flooded leaching and seawater intrusion must be
    essential for desalinization. This study aimed to evaluate the damages to tomato
    cultivation caused by ECw in a Kumamoto coastal polder, and assess agricultural
    production recovery before-and-after the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake using our developed
    Wireless Sensor Network System (WSNS). We also investigated the missing data rate,
    communication system, and power supply issues of the WSNS in greenhouse conditions.
    Additionally, we examined the spatial variation of θ and ECw due to soil liquefaction.
    Moreover, we conducted flooded leaching treatments and assessed the impact of
    flooded leaching and natural rainfall on desalinization by analyzing changes in
    solute mass (θ⋅ECw) profiles, utilizing our developed WSNS and ERT survey. Prior
    to the earthquake, we determined the optimal “θ•ECw” value for successful cultivation
    of salt-tolerant tomatoes, taking into account the required saline level for their
    excellent growth. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study site Field measurements
    and soil survey were conducted at a Yokoshima reclamation area (≈2,900 ha) (32°50′49.9\"N
    130°34′06.4\"E) in Kumamoto, Japan. Our research site was a plastic greenhouse
    of a tomato field (0.13 ha) along an agricultural waterway (EC = 0.012 dS m−1)
    and a watercourse (EC = 0.099 dS m−1) on the east edge of the Yokoshima reclamation
    area (Fig. 3a). Coast protection exists between the watercourse and the Ariake
    sea. The soil type was sandy clay in the rhizosphere (the upper soil layer) down
    to 80 cm deep. The lower layer below 80 cm deep was heavy clay. Average saturated
    hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and dry bulk density (ρb) measured using undisturbed
    soil core samples taken in the upper and lower layers were 104, 1.2 cm d−1 and
    0.9, 1.1 g cm−3, respectively. Porosity was 55% for the upper soil layer. We created
    two wells with an 80 cm-auger and investigated the greenhouse''s groundwater level
    (GWL) and the EC using a portable EC meter once a month. The GWL was shallow,
    and the EC of GWL was approximately 6 dS m−1 even before the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake.

    Fig. 3. Sensor locations in a greenhouse damaged by the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake
    (a), ERT line survey in the greenhouse after the tomato cultivation (b) in Yokoshima
    polder, Kumamoto. Before the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake, a tractor-mounted implement
    was used for plowing to create ridges and furrows in the cultivation of tomatoes.
    For the double ridge planting cultivation, the ridge height was 30 cm, and the
    top width was 90 cm. The ridges were covered with white polyethylene sheets having
    holes (120 mm in diameter) at a distance of 50 cm spread over the ridges. Cherry
    tomato seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Aiko) (Sakata Seed Co.) were transplanted
    in the holes in October 2015 and have been harvested since the planting period.
    The characteristics and innovation of salt-tolerant cherry tomato cultivars are
    described by [15,16]. For tomato cultivation, pumping well water (EC = 0.106 dS
    m−1) from groundwater at 50 m was used as drip irrigation. On April 14th, the
    2016 Kumamoto Earthquake occurred, and JMA reported approximately M6.0 in the
    region [1]. Although the earthquake caused liquefaction, which increased the spatial
    variability of soil salinity levels near the soil surface, tomato cultivation
    was maintained at the end of May 2016. In June 2016, a soil survey was conducted
    to examine the effects of liquefaction on the chemical and physical characteristics
    of the soils. We also investigated the size of cracks and channels under the liquefaction
    spot around P2 (Fig. 3a). For the image analysis of the cracks caused by the liquefaction,
    we used the open-software platform ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). 2.2. Field
    measurements using the WSNS with TDT sensors Our developed WSNS consists of a
    base station, which is the primary device that receives data from the sensor-connected
    edge devices (the extension units). By incorporating wireless modules, namely
    the ZigBee wireless module (XBee) for short-range communication around the sensor
    and the wireless module (3GIM) for long-range communication utilizing cellular
    networks, into Arduino (as shown in Fig. 2), it is possible to achieve data collection
    through wireless communication and store the data on the cloud. The control program
    for the system was developed using Arduino language, which is a modified and extended
    version of the C/C++ programming language and the standard programming language
    for Arduino. In moisture and salinity measurement using TDT sensors, the system
    measures the waveform of the step-pulse-like transmission signal and performs
    waveform analysis based on signal propagation time and attenuation of signal strength.
    This analysis allows for determining the dielectric constant of bulk soil (εb)
    and bulk electrical conductivity (ECb). However, due to increased data communication
    volume from acquiring and storing waveform data, this system reads the processed
    εb and ECb values from within the TDT sensor [11]. Furthermore, the system includes
    a circuit integrated into the homemade connection board [11], allowing for the
    transmission of alerts when the battery level is low. To ensure a reliable power
    supply, a 20W solar panel and a 20Ah lead-acid battery were chosen as the independent
    power source. Additionally, a sleep mode was implemented to minimize power consumption
    during idle periods, excluding data transmission and reception. In early April
    2016, we began a study at the research site to monitor εb and ECb using the WSNS
    with TDT sensors (Acclima). By sending a command to acquire sensor data from the
    base unit to the extension units, it was possible to acquire the values of εb
    and ECb from the three extension units (Fig. 2). Since the Arduino did not have
    a clock function, we first obtained the real-time on the server and sent and received
    data to the extension units. After sending/receiving data, a sleep mode was used
    to reduce power consumption. Three TDT probes were installed horizontally at depths
    of 10, 20, and 40 cm from the top of ridges at three locations (P1, P2, and P3)
    (Fig. 3a). At the same depth, soil temperature was measured using thermocouples
    at P1. The WSNS, with a 20 Ah battery, was powered by a 20W solar panel and settled
    outside the greenhouse. TDT measurement data were recorded every hour in the WSNS
    and uploaded to the data server. The εb was converted to θ using Topp''s eq [17].
    For the temperature-correction of ECb (values at 25°C (ECb25)), the following
    equation was used [18]: (1) where T is soil temperature (K). For the estimation
    of ECw, we used the Hilhorst model [19] expressed by: (2) where εw is the dielectric
    constant of water (78.5 at 25°C), ε0 is estimated εb when ECb is 0. The ε0 is
    an empirical parameter, and it was determined using sampled soil in a walk-in
    temperature-controlled laboratory at the standard temperature of 25°C [8]. In
    this study, the estimated ε0 was 3.46, the appropriate value ranging from 3.1
    to 5.8 for clayey soil [20]. 2.3. Flood leaching In July 2016, the mulch and top
    roof of the greenhouse were removed, followed by rotary plowing down to a depth
    of 20 cm at the end of the harvesting process. A ridge was then created around
    the experimental field. According to [21], the recommended electrical conductivity
    (EC) level for irrigation water to comply with agricultural water quality standards
    is below 0.3 dS m–1. Throughout different seasons, the EC of the irrigation water
    in the waterway remained below 0.1 dS m–1. Therefore, flood leaching was performed
    using water from the agricultural waterway. The leaching water was added, and
    a water depth of approximately 5 cm (flooded condition) was maintained for one
    week in early July and August 2016, respectively. 2.4. ERT survey after the Kumamoto
    Earthquake On 28 July 2016, in the middle of the two leaching events, an ERT survey
    was carried out to observe two-dimensional ECb distribution. We determined three
    parallel survey lines (Lines 1, 2, and 3) from the seaside. Lines 1 and 2 contained
    liquefaction sites near the soil surface, and Line 3 was a control site as no
    liquefaction site. The survey line space was 2.5 m, and each line had 50 electrodes
    with an electrode spacing of 0.5 m (Fig.3b). Using a Profiler-4 system manufactured
    by OYO Corporation, the electrical potential was measured between the electrodes.
    Resistivity distributions were obtained from the 2D inversions of the in-line
    survey data with a 2D inversion program entitled ”E-Tomo ver. 4.1” [22]. Through
    the analysis, the vertical observation points were depths of 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.3,
    1.9, 2.7, 3.7, 4.8, 6.0, 7.4, and 8.9 m. An additional ERT survey was conducted
    at a survey line (Line 0) along the watercourse to understand whether saltwater
    intrusion occurred from the seaside to the greenhouse. The survey line along the
    watercourse had 50 electrodes, and the electrode spacing was 1.0 m (Fig.3a), providing
    2D spatial resistivity information down to 10 m deep. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Validation of the WSNS prototype performance Fig. 4 shows temporal changes
    in θ and ECw at depths of 10, 20, and 40 cm from the top of ridges at three locations
    (P1, P2, and P3) using the WSNS prototype. In the figure, the occurrence times
    of the foreshock and mainshock are indicated by dashed lines. There was no physical
    damage to the WSNS due to the earthquake. In Fig. 4, the data loss period was
    omitted due to a lack of server capacity. The lack of server capacity was improved
    after May 7. Download : Download high-res image (546KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Temporal changes in θ at three depths (10 (a), 20 (b), 40 cm (c))
    and ECw at three depths (10 (d), 20 (e), 40 cm (f)) at three locations (P1, P2,
    and P3) of the damaged agricultural field. Table 1 shows the percentages of data
    missing (= the number of missing data/ total data number) at observed depths and
    locations for the WSNS. Before-and-after the mainshock, the loss rates for the
    extension units P1, P2, and P3 differed. Especially at the extension unit P1,
    the percentage of missing data was 33%, the highest among the WSNS prototype.
    We did not investigate corrosion and poor synchronization of the XBee module for
    P1, so a poor wiring connection was suspected. Table 1. Percentages of data missing
    at observed depths and locations in the sensor network system. Empty Cell Location

    (%) after the Earthquake 12.2 14.0 0.5 0.0 4.3 1.4 5.8 1.4 0.5 Before setting
    the WSNS in the field, we tested the WSNS mesh-topology: the extension units exchange
    information with neighbors to create a multi-hop network. Using the XBee configuration
    software XCTU, we confirmed the 1:n communication path by the extension unit (not
    shown). Since XBee automatically changes the communication path of the mesh network,
    it has a function that allows direct communication with the base unit or detour
    communication via another extension unit, even if some extension units fail. It
    is speculated that this function improved the data acquisition stability even
    when the extension unit''s data was missing (Table 1). In addition, the WSNS hardware
    performance can vary significantly depending on site conditions. In this study,
    the wireless communication distance between the base and extension units was about
    300 m under the site conditions, suggesting that the wireless communication was
    successful on the greenhouse scale. Since the WSNS operates on battery power,
    overall power consumption becomes a critical constraint. In this study, stable
    continuous operation for 1 hr of data acquisition was possible using a solar panel
    (20 W) and battery (20 Ah) out of the greenhouse. This wired power supply approach
    would be a significant drawback, as the extension units for WSNS will be deployed
    in the greenhouse. Additionally, multi-point measurements using the WSNS might
    reduce the work efficiency of tomato cultivation, so miniaturization of the extension
    unit, including each solar panel and battery, was expected. On the other hand,
    the WSNS operated while the vast disaster disrupted various lifelines. The WSNS,
    such as a stand-alone sensing measurement, was even more valuable in preparing
    for disaster management. 3.2. Field investigation Even before the foreshock on
    April 14, the spatial variability of θ was confirmed, and θ at P1 was the highest
    among the WSNS observation points (Fig. 4a, 4b, 4c). The groundwater level (GWL)
    was as shallow as about 50 cm from the surface of the ridge at P1. θ at 40 cm
    deep of P1 was the almost saturated condition. ECw varied from 5 to 11 dS m−1
    at the three depths of P1, P2, and P3 locations, and the average of ECw at 10
    cm between the three locations was 10 dS m−1 before the foreshock on April 14
    (Fig. 4d, 4e, 4f). In the rhizosphere, the spatial variation of θ and ECw can
    be influenced by factors such as irrigation water, liquid fertilizer, and root
    distribution. However, the presence of high ECw values suggests the influence
    of saline groundwater (EC = 6.2 dS m−1) as the underlying condition, resulting
    in the accumulation of salts near the soil surface. Tomatoes grew as well until
    the foreshock in 2016, as they did under the shallow saline groundwater conditions
    in 2015 (not shown), suggesting high salinity tolerant of the tomatoes. Due to
    the foreshock and mainshock from April 14 to 16, muddy water containing sand spouted,
    and ponding conditions between the ridges, a so-called liquefaction phenomenon,
    were observed locally inside the greenhouse (Fig. 5a). The liquefied sand in the
    muddy water, also named a sand boil [[23], [24], [25], [26]], is the most common
    and dominant seismic liquefaction structure type in polders. The details of liquefaction
    structures and models are shown in [27]. Especially at P2, the liquefaction and
    sand boil occurred severely. Through θ and ECw monitoring at three locations and
    three depths, rapid increases in θ and ECw were confirmed at depths of 10 and
    20 cm at P2 (Fig. 4b and 4e). These findings suggest the local upward bypass flow
    accompanying the initiation of cracks and channels in the formation process of
    sand boil under shallow saline groundwater conditions. In addition, since the
    TDT sensor is a contact sensor, an increase in ρb might affect θ. Download : Download

    near the soil surface due to the earthquake (a), death of tomato plants at P2
    (b), and a channel between the soil surface and groundwater around the P2 location
    (c). In May 2016, tomato leaves and fruits were damaged, and ECw at a depth of
    10 cm was 1.5 times higher than before the Earthquake (Fig. 4d). The high salinity
    level could not be controlled by drip irrigation at all. Fig. 5b shows visible
    color changes from green to yellow or brown around P2, where maximum ECw reached
    17.4 dS m−1, resulting in the onset of leaf death. Such hotspots existed in the
    greenhouse (Fig. 3a), implying spatial variability of high salinity. Through a
    soil sampling survey near the soil surface in June, a physical and chemical analysis
    of soil with/without the sand boil was conducted. The percentage of sand content
    for soil containing the soil crater was 55%. EC1:5 and chloride ion concentration
    were higher than in areas where the sand boils did not occur (Table 2). On the
    other hand, nutrients such as inorganic nitrogen and phosphonic acid were lower
    because the sand boils erupted from the deeper soil layer under the saline groundwater.
    At the liquefaction site around P2, we found a large crack, making a bypass flow
    channel between the soil surface and the groundwater (Fig. 5c). The minimum and
    maximum widths of the skewed crack were 1.2 cm and 5.7 cm, respectively. The length
    of the skewed crack was 62 cm when GWL was 50 cm. Such cracks increased the high
    spatial variability of soil salinity in the root zone. In May 2016, there was
    a 44% decrease in the total yield of cherry tomatoes in the greenhouse when compared
    to May 2015 (the previous year before the Earthquake). Table 2. Effects of liquefaction

    in the root zone, the first flood-leaching process was implemented in early July
    2016. Although [27] recommends that flooded leaching treatments last for a couple
    of days, a water depth of approximately 5 cm (flooded condition) was maintained
    to remove salt from the root zone in 7 days. Fig. 6a shows the two-dimensional
    ECb profiles converted by ERT on three parallel lines (Lines 1, 2, and 3). The
    entire measurement grid size was 6 × 50 m (0.5 m node spacing) for the XY coordinate,
    where Lines 1, 2, and 3 were located at Y= -2.5, 0, and 2.5 m. The ECb on each
    line was plotted to a depth of 5.0 m in the XZ coordinate. ECb in the root zone
    was approximately less than 2 dS m−1 and increased in the deeper soil layer, suggesting
    that the first leaching treatment improved the desalinization process through
    the root zone. However, some ECb hotspots still existed at Lines 1 and 2. Primarily,
    a location of the XZ coordinate (38, 0) on Line 2, where the crack was investigated,
    remained higher ECb value. Download : Download high-res image (782KB) Download

    (Lines 1 through 3) (a) and comparison of two-dimensional ECb profiles in the
    greenhouse and along the watercourse through ERT line survey on 29 Jul. 2016 (b).
    An adverse effect of bypass flow on salt leaching through cracks is the increase
    in the leaching requirement (LR), the fraction of infiltrated water that must
    pass through the root zone to prevent soil salinity from exceeding a level that
    would significantly reduce crop yield [7]. Because of the adverse bypass flow
    effect, the P2 location needed much more water to wash away the salts. In addition,
    if undetected cracks existed beyond the ERT survey, we concluded that additional
    leaching treatment was required. However, our findings were heterogeneity of ECb
    for the saline groundwater, varied from 2 to 14 dS m−1 between depths of 2 and
    5 m from Line 1 through Line 3. Significant lateral flow from the seaside would
    change the desalinization process scenario in the greenhouse''s root zone. For
    the evaluation of lateral flow from the seaside, Fig. 6b shows the ECb profile
    to a depth of 10 m on Line 0 outside of the greenhouse (Fig. 3a). As a result,
    ECb was 3 dS m−1 at a depth of 10 m near the seaside. This assumes that saltwater
    intrusion from the seaside was negligible because it might be avoided by the watercourse,
    contributing to the maintenance of the freshwater zone between the greenhouse
    and the Ariake sea. 3.4. Validation of the flooded leaching effect In early August
    2016, the second flood-leaching treatment was conducted, and then we temporarily
    investigated θ and ECb profiles at the exact location (P1, P2, and P3). Fig. 7
    shows examples of spatial and temporal variability in θ and ECb obtained from
    the TDT measurements and ERT survey (only available on Lines 1 and 2). Measurements
    are from 4 days, 10 Apr., 10 May, 28 Jul., and 14 Sep. 2016. The upper, middle,
    and lower panels show measurement data at P1, P2, and P3, respectively. In the
    right-hand panels (Fig. 7c, 7f, 7i), θ•ECw was calculated to determine the total
    solute concentration per volume of soil. Download : Download high-res image (404KB)

    P1 (a, b, c), location P2 (d, e, f), and location P3 (g, h, i) before-and-after
    flood leaching on 10 Apr., 10 May, 28 Jul., and 14 Sep. 2016. Regarding “θ•ECw”,
    soil salinity is the salinity mass per unit volume of soil (g m−3) and is expressed
    as the product of soil salinity and θ [28]. Since salinity is positively correlated
    with ECw, “θ•ECw” may be used as an index of soil salinity in unsaturated conditions.
    For example, change in θ•ECw was used to infer good soybean growth in the desalinization
    process of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami-affected farmlands [7,11] found θ•ECw was approximately
    1 for good soybean growth. Tomatoes with salinity tolerance would survive in the
    range of higher θ•ECw, but θ•ECw of 1.0 might be a good reference value to consider
    the dimensionless value of θ•ECw relatively. Before-and-after the flooded leaching
    treatments θ varied from 0.2 to 0.53 in the root zone (Fig. 7a, 7d, 7g). GWL was
    at least 65 cm, so that θ was the saturated condition (θ= 0.55 m3 m–3) below a
    depth of 65 cm. Based on ECb profiles, depending on θ (Fig. 7b, 7e, 7h), θ•ECw
    was calculated to a depth of 90 cm. Before the Earthquake, the average of θ•ECw
    between depths of 10cm and 40cm at P1, P2, and P3 were 4.9, 3.1, and 2.6, respectively
    (Fig. 7c, 7f, 7i). After the earthquake, the average of θ•ECw increased to 5.8
    and 6.9 at P1 and P2, where wilting tomato plants occurred. Therefore, the threshold
    of θ•ECw for good tomato growth would be around 5. According to [29], salt damage
    was observed at an ECe (electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract)
    of 10.0 dS m−1, and complete withering occurred at an ECe of 20.0 dS m−1 for other
    tomato species. The empirical relationship between the ECe and ECw can be expressed
    with [18]: (3) where ρb is the bulk density. The wide range of ECe (< 20.0 dS
    m−1) and field water capacity (θ ≈ 0.45 m3 m−3) supports our θ•ECw observations.
    Using Eq. (3), a high θ•ECw (ECw > 16 dS m−1) indicates wilting of tomato plants,
    although it is essential to note that the proper θ level can vary depending on
    soil types. On 14 Sep., after the second flooded leaching treatment, the average
    of θ•ECw at all locations decreased significantly to 2.6, lower than the threshold
    value for good tomato growth. For the desalinization process of salinity soil,
    we cannot be sure that the flooded leaching is practical, but we can be reasonably
    sure that salt leaching by rainfall is effective in a temperate climate. The effects
    of the flooded leaching process and solute leaching by rainfall on soil salinity
    management were investigated in tsunami-affected farmlands [7]. For the recovery
    of agriculture in a short period, flooded leaching must be the most effective
    treatment, but not for cracks and channels. Because of the adverse bypath flow
    effects [30], natural rainfall helped to reduce the salinity levels. In this study,
    total rainfall between the middle of Aug. and Sep. was 147 mm. The amount of rainfall
    corresponded to the total amount of flooded leaching water if the unit gradient
    flow was assumed under unsaturated conditions. This combination of the desalinization
    processes was the most plausible explanation for accomplishing sufficient salt
    exclusion to recover the tomato growth. Indeed, the tomatoes grew well in October
    2016. 4. Conclusions While the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake occurred, the WSNS with
    TDT sensors captured rapid increases in θ and ECw due to soil liquefaction and
    sand boil under shallow saline groundwater conditions in a lowland polder. Our
    findings were a sand boil channel as a bypass flow pathway, making sands vent
    out with upwelling water from groundwater in the greenhouse. Soil liquefaction
    and sand boil caused considerably high temporal and spatial heterogeneity of soil
    salinity, resulting in the death of salt-tolerant tomatoes in a month. The WSNS
    performed adequately enough to measure ECw from 4 to 17 dS m–1 when θ varied from
    0.33 to 0.55 m3 m–3 before-and-after the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake. A significant
    benefit of the real-time data was the decision-making support for scheduling flooded-leaching
    treatments. Although the percentage of missing data reached 33% due to a poor
    wiring connection at P1, there were no wireless communication and power consumption
    problems in the WSNS prototype. The 1-week flooded leaching treatments were successful
    in reducing the high salinity levels, except in the vicinity of the sand boil
    channel as observed through the ERT survey. In addition to the flooded leaching,
    natural rainfall (with a total amount of 147 mm, equivalent to the volume of water
    used for the flooded leaching) could also be utilized for salt leaching in macropores
    and channels, providing a practical solution. Even though a strong earthquake
    changed the soil structure above the shallow groundwater in a polder, the watercourse
    around a polder could prevent saltwater intrusion from the seaside. Consequently,
    soil desalinization was completed in 4 months, and the tomatoes grew well during
    the next cultivation season. We believe our analysis may contribute to implementing
    soil salinity management strategies to recover agricultural production in a polder.

  description: Unsustainable use of water resources and climate change will exacerbate
    the existing tensions surrounding resources, especially in the Mediterranean context.
    Despite investments in costly modern equipment, the performance of irrigated agriculture
    remains below expectations, notably because of the lack of available water data
    and the limited use of decision support tools. Although a variety of soil moisture
    sensors are available on the market, they are not widely used by the agricultural
    community because of their high cost and complexity. Access to information at
    an unprecedented level, via easily accessible low-cost and low-tech sensors, may
    be a major lever for improved identification of achievable gains in performance,
    and to guide actors toward efficient water management. To explore this hypothesis,
    an open source wireless soil moisture sensor, low-energy and economically and
    technically accessible, was developed. The tool was designed according to water
    users’ requirements and applied to a Tunisian irrigation scheme subject to major
    water use efficiency issues. The functioning of the wireless sensor network was
    tested on pilot plots over a growing season and compared with commercial sensors.
    A single parameter calibration can be performed in either the laboratory or the
    field. This low-cost sensor can be used for real-time irrigation monitoring and
    as a decision-making tool for water management.

    Irrigation is a fundamental aspect of crop production. Summer 2022, already considered
    to be one of the driest and warmest seasons ever recorded in Europe and the Mediterranean
    basin [1], has shown how crucial it can be [2], and what is more, the Mediterranean
    region is considered as a climate change hotspot. The Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change [3] foresees the intensification of extreme hydrological events,
    notably more frequent and longer episodes of water deficit. Agricultural activities,
    largely dependent on water availability, are particularly impacted and threatened.
    Irrigation is a response to agricultural vulnerability to drought. As a result,
    irrigated land has increased in recent decades, and the increase will most probably
    continue in the future. However, pressure on water resources is already critical
    in the Mediterranean region, due not only to the high spatio-temporal variability
    of its distribution but also to increased urban and rural demand. In particular,
    agricultural water demand tends to grow with increasing potential evapotranspiration.
    These tensions have already led to water use restriction policies, user conflicts
    and water shortages [4]. In this context, it is indispensable to improve agricultural
    water management and encourage water-saving practices. Precision agriculture has
    flourished in recent decades and a wide range of monitoring tools including model-based
    control strategies, automation systems, remote sensing or in field sensing [5,6]
    have been developed to improve the performance of irrigated systems. At farm level,
    irrigation management can be supported by using soil moisture probes to improve
    irrigation scheduling and reduce the volumes applied throughout the growing season
    [7,8]. Tensiometers and capacitance sensors that provide information on soil water
    status are already available [9] but are rarely used in farming systems, particularly
    at the farm scale, and even more rarely in the Global South. The different barriers
    to the adoption of precision farming technologies are linked to the user''s socio-technical
    environment, but mostly to (i) economic rationales or (ii) the complexity of using
    these technologies, including the calibration procedures [10,11]. Recent technological
    developments such as onboard electronics and Internet of Things (IoT) offer new
    opportunities to provide alternative monitoring tools for agro-systems and resource
    management [12] that are easier for farmers to use than previous systems. For
    irrigated agriculture in particular, these technologies allow real-time monitoring
    of water flows through water sensor networks (WSN) that can be installed at the
    required spatial and temporal scale. Several studies have demonstrated the technical
    feasibility of monitoring irrigation using these types of systems with different
    telecommunication networks and sensors to monitor weather, soil and plant variables
    [[13], [14], [15]]. Some studies mentioned gains in irrigation performance in
    different agronomic contexts thanks to the use of such tools [[16], [17], [18]].
    Recently, some advances were made in the characterisation and calibration of low
    cost capacitance sensors for IoT networks [19,20]. However, to our knowledge,
    no study has yet gone beyond laboratory prototypes or experiments in controlled
    conditions, and have adapted these innovations to local agrarian contexts. The
    objective of this study was thus to fill this gap by developing a soil moisture
    sensor that is easily adoptable by water users and to share all the steps, from
    design to calibration, operation and maintenance, based on a field reality. To
    this end, we designed an open source, low-tech and low-cost tool with a single
    parameter and physically-based calibration method, tested it in real farmers’
    conditions, and assessed the potential advantages and limits of this technology.
    2. Material and methods 2.1. Shaping innovation: Our overall approach We argue
    that for technological innovations to be useful for end users, the innovations
    need to be co-developed with the stakeholders thus making it possible to adapt
    the technology to the local context. A co-innovation process between researchers
    and stakeholders was established to (i) chose the variable to monitor; (ii) build
    the sensor and (iii)evaluate its use. This was done through a loop back procedure
    described in Vandôme et al. [21]. After diagnosing the agrarian context, local
    water management issues and stakeholder needs, a sensor prototype was submitted
    to water users through a demonstration workshop. The feedback provided by the
    workshop participants enabled the production of a second version of the prototype
    that was better suited to local needs and constraints. The creation of an area
    for the design, maintenance and sharing between the actors of the co-innovation
    process – hereafter called Fab Lab – allowed the innovation to continually evolve
    based on the users’ feedback throughout the process. 2.2. Study site and water
    user requirements The Echraf public irrigation scheme is located in the Haouaria
    agricultural plain, at the northern tip of the Cap Bon peninsula in Tunisia (36°59′33.529″N,
    11°2′28.309″E). Drip irrigation of market gardening crops grown on sandy and draining
    soils has resulted in several problems. The reduced soil water holding capacity
    (around 4%) makes irrigation management complex: on the one hand the permanent
    wilting point (PWP) is quickly reached due to rapid drying of the soil; while
    on the other hand, the root profile is quickly saturated during an irrigation
    event, leading to percolation losses. In these conditions, optimal irrigation
    would theoretically involve regular application of low water volumes. In practice,
    this strategy is difficult to achieve for the farmers, due to (i) lack of information
    concerning the water resource (volumes applied, discharge rates, soil moisture,
    surface area irrigated), (ii) the variable flow rates of water supplied by the
    collective network, (iii) poor uniformity of application due to ageing or low
    quality irrigation equipment, and (iv) the recent emergence of drip irrigation
    technology in the region, which has not been combined with any training for water
    users. In the first stages of the co-innovation process, the stakeholders and
    the researchers agreed that, to solve these problems, a soil moisture sensor –
    hereafter termed Pilowtech – should be used in the field to assess crop water
    availability. To further develop this idea, a Fab Lab was set up in the Water
    Users Association (WUA) building where exchanges with farmers led to a set of
    specifications (Table 1) that were then used to design prototype soil moisture
    sensors. The Fab Lab was also used for the production and repair of the sensors.
    In parallel, three pilot farmers volunteered to host tests of the sensors in real
    conditions in three irrigated potato plots throughout the whole crop cycle. Table

    stated needs, we built a network of wireless, low-cost, low-tech, low-power and
    open-source soil moisture sensors. The overall architecture of the network of
    sensors is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (283KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flowchart of the water sensor network. 2.3.1.
    Hardware components The Pilowtech sensor is composed of a soil moisture probe,
    a data acquisition module and a power supply. The capacitance soil moisture sensor
    – model EK1940 v1.2 – was chosen for its resistance to corrosion, its low cost
    and availability. In addition, it operates over a voltage range of 3.3 V to 5
    V, making it compatible with low-power microcontrollers. The data acquisition
    module includes a microcontroller, a communication microchip and small electronics
    (wires, resistors, breadboard). The microcontroller chosen was the Arduino Pro-Mini,
    with a 3.3 V voltage and a frequency of 8 MHz. In addition to the advantages of
    Arduino systems (widely used, easy to use and open-source), thanks to its small
    size, the Pro-Mini is easy to embed and is one of the cheapest controllers on
    the market. It is also compatible with the LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide-Area Network)
    communication protocol. The LoRa SX1276 communication module makes it possible
    to send and receive data via the LoRA radio network. The whole device is powered
    by a rechargeable Li-ion 18,650 battery (3.7 V and 3500 mAh). To allow onsite
    and instantaneous data reading, a reader was further developed based on an Arduino
    Uno board and a liquid crystal display (LCD) shield. The system is powered by
    a rechargeable Li-ion power bank with a 3.7 V output. To avoid damage caused by
    humidity, the probes were assembled at the end of PVC pipes (Ø40). Silicone was
    used to guarantee a tight sealing at the junction of the probe/pipe and the heat-shrink
    tubing at the wire junctions. The case of the acquisition module was printed using
    a 3D printer. The 3D printing file is available in the research data section at
    the end of this article. 2.3.2. Wireless communication network IoT technologies
    allow wireless communication of data generated by devices via different types
    of networks. The LoRaWAN communication protocol allows data transmission at low
    data rates (0.3–50 kb/s) and over long ranges (≤ 30 km). Compared to other available
    networks, the LoRa network stands out for its low energy consumption [22]. The
    LoRaWAN protocol thus met both our objectives and technological development conditions
    (sparse plots, no need for heavy data packets) and had also been tested in previous
    studies [23]. A private LoRa network was set up in the irrigation scheme. Likely
    due to the topography, two gateways were needed to cover the area that included
    the three experimental plots. The Things Network gateway, which, according to
    the manufacturer, has a range of about 10 km, was installed near the Fab Lab.
    The Things Indoor gateway, which has a shorter range but costs less, was installed
    between two pilot plots in the eastern part of the irrigation scheme. 4G+ airboxes
    were used to provide the Wi-Fi required for the gateways internet connection.
    2.3.3. Software and data workflow The microcontroller was programmed in C/C++
    language using the open source Arduino software (IDE) 1.8.19. The program was
    uploaded from the computer to the Arduino Pro-mini using a FTDI wire. To minimize
    energy consumption, the program code was written to maintain the sensor in sleeping
    mode (low µA consumption). The system woke up at 5-minute intervals to collect
    the analog signal produced by the probe, to convert it into digital data and send
    it through the LoRa network. Theoretically, this optimization enables the sensor
    to be energy autonomous throughout the irrigation season. The Arduino program
    is also available in the research data section. The data produced transited locally
    through the gateway via the LoRa network and was then routed online to the free
    server “The Things Network Cloud (Europe 1)” [24]. Within this server, the gateway
    was declared on the cloud and an application gathering sensor (device) IDs was
    generated. This server allowed real time data reading online but not storage or
    data processing. The free and open-source flow-based programming tool Node-RED
    [25], was thus used to gather the data from this online server and store it on
    a local server via an InfluxDB database [26]. The Node-RED flow is also available
    in the research data section. 2.3.4. User access to data Three different types
    of user access to data were provided through multiple channels to serve end-users
    with different technology literacy levels: (i) an online platform with access
    to data time series; (ii) a mobile phone messaging alert system; and (iii) an
    onsite data reader (Fig. 1). The online data reading is done using Grafana software
    [27], a free open-source data visualization and processing platform. A dashboard
    was produced to visualize data from each pilot farm. The dashboard comprised time
    series graphics for each soil moisture sensor (specified by its location and depth)
    and a map showing the location of the sensors. Data could be combined for visualization
    at different levels (plot, farm, irrigation scheme – the highest level being defined
    by the network). In parallel, Grafana enabled the development of a messaging alert
    system using the Telegram smartphone application and Telegram bots. The alert
    system was set to send a message to the end-user each time the soil water content
    (i) dropped below a threshold value (permanent wilting point), corresponding to
    a certain level of crop water-induced stress; or (ii) reached field capacity,
    in order to stop irrigation. The onsite data reader was designed for instantaneous
    visualization. The farmer has to physically plug the onsite reader into the sensor
    to get an instant display on the LCD screen. The reader can be programmed to display
    the volumetric soil moisture content, or the% refill level of total available
    soil moisture. Both Arduino programs are available in the research data section.
    In all cases, it is necessary to provide the user with data that can be easily
    used and guide their decision-making. The data emitted by the sensors and stored
    on the server are raw data, proportional to the output voltage of the capacitance
    probe. It is therefore necessary to define the relationship between soil moisture
    and raw values, before processing the data using visualization tools. 2.4. Calibration
    of the capacitance probe The capacitance probe operates according to the following
    principle: electric current flows through a coplanar concentric capacitor, which
    is the part inserted into the soil. The capacity is proportional to the relative
    dielectric permittivity of the medium, which itself depends on the soil moisture
    content. The output voltage (0–5 V) is converted into a digital value (10 bits)
    by the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of the microcontroller. Two calibration
    protocols based on the gravimetric method are proposed to determine the relationship
    between the output voltage and soil moisture. 2.4.1. Calibration in the laboratory
    Laboratory experiments allowed us to determine the relationship between the output
    values of the sensor (ϵ) and the volumetric soil moisture (θv,% volume). The gravimetric
    method was used. Three soil samples (S1, S2, S3) were collected from the 0–30
    cm horizon in three separate plots in the irrigation scheme. In parallel, bulk
    density was measured in each plot using the cylinder method. Samples were first
    dried in a heating chamber at 105 °C for 24 h and then left to cool at room temperature
    (20 °C). The dry soil samples were then used to fill a beaker of known volume
    (150 mL) while making sure the field bulk density was maintained by weighting
    the beaker. The volumetric humidity (θv) could therefore be defined by Eq. (1):
    (1) where θv is the volumetric soil moisture content (%), Vw the water volume,
    Vs the dry soil volume. To determine the relationship, the probe was inserted
    along the entire length of the capacitance device (approximately 6 cm), guaranteeing
    good contact between the soil and the probe. A small volume of water (1.5 mL corresponding
    to an increment of 1% of soil volumetric moisture) was repeatedly added to the
    sample. At each addition, the soil was mixed to guarantee isotropy, left to rest
    for 15 min and then restored to bulk density. The operation was repeated until
    the digital value reached a plateau, corresponding to soil water saturation. The
    digital value of the sensor, ϵ, acquired with the onsite reader, was recorded
    for each known sample volumetric humidity value, θv, in order to establish their
    correspondence. 2.4.2. Field calibration The purpose of field calibration was
    to provide a simple method to locally parametrize the soil moisture sensor without
    the need for sophisticated equipment. A soil sample was collected from each of
    the three pilot plots (samples P1, P2 and P3). The protocol was the same as that
    used in the laboratory with the following adaptations. First, the samples were
    dried in the sun on the roof for two days, followed by 3 h in an oven at 100 °C.
    To check the soil was dry, the sample was weighed on a kitchen scale (precision
    ±1 g), then put back in the oven and weighed again. If the mass of soil was unchanged,
    the soil was considered to be dry. Second, to limit the uncertainty caused by
    the use of a simple kitchen scale, a large mass of soil was used and the sample
    was only weighed at initialization. Bulk density could not be measured in field
    conditions. Consequently, a standard sandy bulk density was defined for the soil
    samples (1.5 kg of dry soil for 1 L in a graduated bucket), for which the θv-ϵ
    relationship was established. Water was progressively added using a 10 mL measuring
    glass (i.e. an increment of 1% θv). Readings were made with the sensor in the
    same conditions as those used for the laboratory calibration. Three replicates
    were made for each soil sample using three different probes in order to study
    the potential variability linked to the capacitance probe and its impact on the
    calibration. 2.4.3. Properties of the soil samples Soil samples from the pilot
    plots were analyzed in the laboratory. Table 2 lists the main soil properties.
    Despite slight local heterogeneities, the soils had most properties in common.
    They are sandy soils (≥ 90%) with low organic matter content (≤ 1%). Water storage
    capacity is low, with permanent wilting points ranging from θv 5% to 7% and field
    capacity ranging from 9% to 11%. Bulk density is about 1.6 g/cm3. Table 2. Soil

    Soil moisture measurements make it possible to understand different physical processes
    such as filling of the total available soil moisture, deep percolation, or surface
    evaporation. The choice of the location and depth of the sensor depends on the
    properties of the type of soil and the processes to be monitored, as well as the
    characteristics of the cropping system. In our study site with a drip-irrigated
    potato crop, the objectives were twofold: to ensure crop water comfort and to
    limit deep percolation. To this end, soil moisture was measured at two depths:
    (i) at a depth of 30 cm, at a distance of 15 cm from the drip line, and (ii) at
    a depth of 60 cm, directly under the drip line. These measurements provided information
    on the structure of the water bulb. On the one hand, we considered that “correct”
    soil moisture at the two locations satisfies crop water comfort and on the other
    hand, that high soil moisture content at a depth of 60 cm – the maximum effective
    rooting depth – leads to deep percolation. Field monitoring lasted from March
    5 to June 15, 2022. Three plots were instrumented with two to three Pilowtech
    sensors each, corresponding to approximately one sensor/0.1 ha. To evaluate the
    quality of the sensors by comparing the data, plots P1 and P2 were equipped with,
    respectively, a commercial capacitance-based sensor (Drill and Drop manufactured
    by Sentek Technologies, “SAND” factory default setting) and a tensiometer (Watermark
    manufactured by Irrometer). Measurement depths and positions with respect to the
    drip line were the same as with the Pilowtech sensors. Time series produced by
    the commercial capacitance sensor were post-calibrated with respect to the average
    of the series produced by the Pilowtech (coefficient of 0.621) in order to adapt
    the measurement of the commercial probe to the local soil type and to allow comparison
    of the data. Installation of the Pilowtech in the field required the use of a
    graduated auger and a fence post to attach the acquisition module. The capacitance
    probe was inserted vertically into the soil after moistening the substrate to
    guarantee a good contact between the soil and the probe. 3. Results 3.1. Design
    of the Pilowtech, a decision-support tool for irrigation management 3.1.1. Hardware
    The hardware design of the soil moisture sensor is easy and quick to make (about
    30min.). The electrical assembly was simplified in order to be as reproducible
    as possible (Fig. 2). The sensor was configured with two analog inputs for two
    capacitance probes, thus allowing soil moisture to be measured at two depths at
    each location. Access to the plug for on-site reading was by means of a screw
    cap at the above-ground extremity of the PVC tube. Download : Download high-res

    the Pilowtech sensor. The numbers refer to Table 4. 3.1.2. Results of calibration
    The results of the laboratory calibration are presented in Fig. 3. The digital
    values returned by the sensor in air and in water were ϵa = 437 and ϵw = 202,
    respectively. The sensor displayed a digital value of ϵs = 434 in the presence
    of dry soil (θv = 0%). The curve decreased, reflecting the inverse relationship
    between moisture content and output voltage: the wetter the soil, the lower the
    output voltage, and therefore the lower the digital value returned. The distribution
    of the data shows a linear trend at low soil moisture content and then an increase
    in the slope above a threshold (around 6% moisture content) suggesting the existence
    of a vertical asymptote. This type of behavior can be described by an exponential
    relationship between ϵ and θ. From these results, we constructed the following
    empirical equation: (2) where k is a parameter depending on soil properties, ϵs,
    ϵw and ϵa are respectively, the sensor output variable, the sensor constant value
    in water and the sensor constant value in the air. Therefore, the expression of
    volumetric soil moisture can be modeled as a function of the output voltage variable
    and three parameters depending on the soil type (k) and the probe used (ϵw, ϵa).
    This model appears well fitted (R2 = 0.972) with respect to the data obtained
    from the laboratory calibration (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (265KB)

    the field calibration performed on the soils of the pilot plots are shown in Fig.
    4. For each of the three soil samples (P1, P2, P3), the calibration is made using
    three different sensors (A, B, C). The results were used to parametrize Eq. (2),
    and the corresponding curves (models) were compared with the experimental data.
    The soil parameter k was determined by searching for an optimal match between
    the gravimetric and simulated soil moisture and minimisation of the error. Table
    3 summarizes the parameters obtained. The results showed that the model based
    on Eq. (2) satisfactorily fitted the data obtained using the gravimetric method
    for all three soils (0.875 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.983). The parameters related to the capacitance
    probe ranged between 182 and 198 for ϵw and between 430 and 479 for ϵa. The soil
    parameters obtained with the same soil sample varied little with respect to their
    mean (3% ≤ cv ≤ 4%). However, parameter k varied more between the different soil
    samples (6% ≤ cv ≤ 10%), parameter k is thus more sensitive to soil characteristics.

    farmer connected to the WSN has access to a personal space on the online platform.
    The data produced by the sensors are gathered for each farm and can be displayed
    according to the desired location, date and depth. The calibration results allow
    the raw data to be displayed in the form of volumetric soil moisture (Fig. 5).
    Time series are available for consultation (historical and real time) and can
    be downloaded in different formats. In the field, the data can be accessed manually
    using the onsite reader. When visiting the plots, by unscrewing the top of the
    protective PVC tube at the desired location and depth, the farmer can simply plug
    in (Fig. 6a). After several trials, the farmers indicated the most practical visualization
    is the one that displays the filling percentage of the total available soil moisture
    (FP = ). This percentage is visualized by means of a progress bar (Fig. 6b). Download

    3.2. On field data evaluation: comparison with commercial water sensors The data
    series produced by the Pilowtech sensors were compared with series produced by
    commercial sensors at two locations. 3.2.1. Ability for monitoring relative soil
    water status The data obtained for plot P2 were compared with the tension measurement
    produced by a commercial tensiometer probe (Watermark) at the same location and
    depths (30 and 60 cm) as the Pilowtech (Fig. 7). Monitoring continued from March
    8 to June 13, 2022, i.e. shortly after planting until the potatoes were harvested.
    The tensiometers were installed on March 25, before the start of the irrigation
    season. Irrigation was regular (frequency of around 3 days) during the development
    stage (April). Irrigation events were less frequent from the midseason until harvest
    (from May to June). The time step for data generation is 4 h for the tensiometer
    and around 5 min for the Pilowtech. Irrigation events are clearly identifiable
    from the peak moisture contents measured by the Pilowtech, and from the drops
    in tension measured by the tensiometer. At a depth of 30 cm, tension varied between
    0 and 50 kPa. The volumetric soil moisture measured globally varied between the
    permanent wilting point (  = 5.83% at pF = 4.2) and field capacity (  = 9.41%
    at pF = 2.5). At a depth of 60 cm, the range of soil moisture was slightly higher
    (between 8% and 13%) and the range of tension was lower (between 2 and 15 kPa).
    At both depths, the data produced by the commercial tensiometer and the Pilowtech
    sensor were highly correlated. In the shallow soil layer, the probes are more
    sensitive to water inputs. Their variations make it possible to monitor the entire
    irrigation schedule, and to distinguish between the hydration and drying phases
    of the soil. Close to the maximum rooting depth, the response of both probes was
    less sensitive to drip irrigation inputs. Minor non-percolating irrigation events
    were less or not detected. However, analysis of moisture peaks showed that both
    probes reacted to irrigation events on the same dates. The sensor thus has the
    ability to monitor relative changes in soil moisture. Download : Download high-res

    status in plot “P2”: comparison between the Pilowtech (red curves) and a commercial

    was due to a power failure, independently from our system. 3.2.2. Ability for
    absolute soil moisture monitoring In plot P1, the measurements made with a commercial
    capacitance sensor and the Pilowtech (30 and 60 cm) from April 4 to May 3 were
    compared (Fig. 8). The data generation time step of the commercial sensor is 1
    h, and around 5 min for the Pilowtech. Comparison of the soil moisture content
    characteristics measured in the plot “P1” (  = 7.00% at pF = 4.2 and  = 10.71%
    at pF = 2.5) showed that the range of moisture content measured by the commercial
    probe and by Pilowtech was globally bounded by the permanent wilting point and
    field capacity. We also compared the potential of detection of irrigation peaks,
    corresponding to local maximum soil water moisture content. Results revealed an
    excellent temporal match, confirming that irrigation events were accurately detected
    by both sensors. The ability of the Pilowtech to measure the intensity of irrigation
    events was further analyzed by comparing the magnitude of changes in soil moisture
    recorded by both probes during the first month of monitoring (Fig. 9). Download

    moisture measured following an irrigation event and the minimum moisture value
    preceding the same irrigation event. The results showed a good correlation between
    the magnitudes recorded by the two probes for low and medium intensity events
    (∆ < 4%). On the other hand, the gap between measurements by the two probes was
    larger in the case of more intense, higher magnitude events (∆ > 4%). Under these
    conditions, the Pilowtech sensor gave higher amplitudes than those measured by
    the commercial probe. This difference could be explained by the different sampling
    intervals used in sandy soils with high hydraulic conductivity. These behavioral
    variations could also be the result of drift trends the experimental data did
    not allow us to characterise. 3.3. Provisioning and maintenance 3.3.1. A low tech
    sensor with reasonable maintenance requirements The system was designed to be
    low power and to enable several months’ autonomy with a 3.7 V battery. The main
    maintenance tasks during the season were: (i) battery management; (ii) network
    troubleshooting; (iii) hardware maintenance. At the end of the 102-day monitoring
    period, one sensor out of the eight installed needed its battery recharging. The
    first assumption made in the event of a gap in the data time series is that the
    battery is empty. After checking the voltage, the second hypothesis is a network
    failure. A few occasional network interruptions required maintenance tasks over
    the course of the season, the origins of which were identified as follows: power
    supply failure at the gateway or an interruption in Wi-Fi coverage at the gateway
    location. Finally, once the network and the power supply have been checked, a
    gap or an anomaly in the data time series may be due to hardware failure. The
    connectors in the acquisition module and at the junction with the probes should
    then be checked. Direct reading in the field may be necessary to check the quality
    of the data provided by the probe. Out of the 16 probes installed (2 per sensor),
    25% of the probes showed occasional anomalies that required a technical intervention.
    In these situations, the probes produced unstable and inconsistent data in the
    data series that were easy to identify. As these events occurred following irrigation
    events, we assume they were due to faulty seals resulting in leakage into the
    probe''s electronic circuits. In this case, technical maintenance consists in
    removing the damaged probe, and drying or replacing it, and making sure it is
    watertight. The resulting anomalies in soil moisture data time series can also
    be easily cleaned. 3.4. A low-cost sensor with adjustable costs Table 4 summarizes
    the costs required to design a low tech soil moisture sensor. The cost of production
    is adjustable depending on requirements. The components needed for the sensor
    itself cost less than 10€ with an onsite reading system only, less than 15€ for
    a wireless sensor, and a total of slightly more than 20€ for the sensor with a
    double data reading mode. For the wireless solution, setting up a LoRa network
    requires a gateway (costing between 50€ and 300€) and an Internet connection.
    However, this investment is sufficient to network an unlimited number of sensors,
    which allows the costs to be amortized or shared between users. The low cost hardware
    and free software of the Pilowtech thus make the sensor highly affordable. Table

    probes become accessible to any water user? We developed a soil moisture sensor
    based on the specifications and feedback provided by the water users of an irrigation
    scheme. The sensor we developed is (i) low tech, meaning easy to make, maintain
    and reproduce; (ii) low cost, so small farming systems can afford it; (iii) low
    power, and consequently relatively self-sufficient and sustainable over time;
    (iv) meeting farmers’ expectations for monitoring water status in the root zone.
    The data can be accessed in two ways: remotely via an online interface, or in
    the field through direct reading. Calibration is feasible both in the laboratory
    and in the field. The sensor rating curve (Eq. (2)) is given by only one parameter,
    k, characteristic of the soil. This rating equation provides a reliable prediction
    of volumetric soil moisture once it has been parameterized. The sensor allows
    soil moisture to be monitored at two depths and can be used as a decision support
    tool for irrigation scheduling. Comparison with commercial probes highlighted
    the good performance of the Pilowtech sensor for irrigation scheduling and for
    monitoring relative soil moisture. The low recording frequency of the commercial
    tensiometer, capillary hysteresis processes and the low water holding capacities
    of the soils prevented accurate plotting of sandy soil retention curves [28].
    To go further, a laboratory experiment conditions would allow comparison of the
    Pilowtech sensor results with the predictions of the Van Genuchten function for
    a sandy soil [29]. The measurement of absolute soil moisture was satisfactory
    compared with that of the commercial capacitance probe, but the measurement may
    be subject to slight deviation over time. A metrological study, specific to the
    monitoring of the deviation by multiplying the controls and measuring battery
    discharge rates, should enable conclusions to be drawn concerning these effects.
    At the level of the farm or of the irrigation scheme, the number of sensors could
    be multiplied to create a wireless sensor network based on the LoRaWAN protocol.
    The data produced in real-time can be used by different types of stakeholders:
    (i) by farmers as a decision-support tool at the field and farm levels; (ii) by
    irrigation scheme managers and agricultural advisors to assess water requirements
    and advise water users; (iii) by researchers, for whom the production of these
    data will help assess performance gaps, compare practices and feed model scenarios.
    Recent advances in on-board electronics and IoT therefore appear promising for
    the agricultural sector and particularly for water management, to the extent that
    they led to the development of both economically and technically accessible measurement
    tools. The plasticity of these systems is particularly interesting because it
    makes the tool adaptable to the agrarian context: for instance, we were able to
    adapt the data reading system to the users. Moreover, the open source nature of
    the system transforms the traditionally “black box” sensor into a tool that can
    be fully programmed by the user. Thus the user can calibrate the Pilowtech according
    to the characteristics of his/her field, which makes it better suited and therefore
    more reliable than a default pre-calibrated probe. On the other hand, it is important
    to stress that these advantages are not necessarily considered as such by every
    farmer. Indeed, the “do it yourself” approach may be seen as a limitation as it
    requires time to get used to it, more regular maintenance, and a certain level
    of agronomic expertise. These limitations can be overcome by supporting users,
    notably through training or by providing technical support. The scale of the irrigation
    scheme, and user collectives such as water users associations, appear to be a
    suitable environment to host a Fab lab, making it possible to pool maintenance
    interventions and the expenses involved in running wireless sensor networks. The
    Fab Lab also appears as a valuable environment for user training, notably regarding
    the calibration process, which although not requiring any special equipment, may
    nevertheless demand some ability. Another alternative could be for further studies
    to produce tables associating parameter values with major soil types. Currently,
    the use of these technologies is facilitated by the growing importance of the
    community involved in this domain, the multiplication of suppliers worldwide,
    and the trend towards simplification of components and reduction of their costs.
    However, component costs still depend on the market, and are consequently sensitive
    to fluctuations (the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, led to a worldwide shortage
    of electronic chips). Hence, the equipment used in the present study will inevitably
    evolve with technical advances and market changes, which is not a problem as long
    as the equipment remains highly affordable and available from local suppliers.
    In any case, the Pilowtech sensor was designed as an evolving tool, necessarily
    subject to change through re-design and ”bricolage”, as signs of its re-appropriation
    by users [30]. Future studies should focus on the multi-criteria (agronomic, environmental,
    hydraulic, socioeconomic) impacts of the adoption of such tools for irrigated
    agriculture, including paying attention to potential side effects [31,32]. Some
    work remains to be done before massive use of this type of technology is achieved,
    and particular attention will have to be paid to the mechanisms of adoption and
    the means to promote the dissemination of the innovation among farmers and water
    users. After all, there is nothing to prevent the adjustment of this sensor to
    a variety of contexts, for irrigation management of diverse cropping systems or
    for environmental monitoring, at the same time bearing in mind that “not everything
    that can be counted actually counts”. 5. Conclusion The use of new technologies
    for agriculture does not necessarily need to be expensive, complex and energy
    intensive. We designed a low-cost, open source, low-tech and low-energy soil moisture
    sensor for monitoring crop irrigation. The calibration method implemented is simple,
    based on only one parameter, and allows real time monitoring of the fulfillment
    of the water requirements of an irrigated crop, in the present case, potato. The
    irrigation schedule can therefore be adjusted accordingly. Comparison of our low-cost
    sensor with commercial probes in field conditions over a whole irrigation season
    underlined the good performance of the Pilowtech sensor. The sensor can be used
    as a decision-support tool for real-time water management. At the scale of an
    irrigation scheme, the skills and costs of the equipment required to build a wireless
    sensor network could be shared between users. Soil moisture probes are known as
    a driver to achieve water savings, and this study provides a way to make them
    accessible, although they require more regular maintenance than existing commercial
    ready-to-use solutions. We believe that this study contributes to the democratization
    of the use of new technologies in agriculture and provides keys to facilitating
    their adoption, in both the North and the global South. Future work should focus
    on assessing the impacts of the adoption of such innovation, and its adaptation
    to different contexts. Research data All the software required for the design

  description: The advent of smart agriculture has revolutionized agricultural management.
    It is an emerging technology that uses modern sensing and communication technologies
    such as internet of things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles, robotics and automation
    and artificial intelligence. The technology recognizes the factors responsible
    for diminished agricultural yields and helps to track them in a real-time mode.
    Simultaneous monitoring of qualitative and quantitative improvement in the agricultural
    production, optimization of parameters such as environmental conditions, soil
    conditions, plant growth and its health can be done on a real-time basis. Interestingly,
    the data collected from various sensors with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can
    be utilized to measure parameters that ensures better plant growth for enhancing
    agricultural management. On the contrary, manual intervention can be reduced to
    the maximum as the wireless monitoring of plant parameters provides accurate status
    of plant nutrition and health. Furthermore, the technology focuses on development
    of devices and tools to monitor, display, and inform the farmers regarding agricultural
    parameters. The recent development of IoT-based robotics and automation lead to
    dynamic, fast, and accurate farming with increase in agricultural yields. Additionally,
    geological and meteorological information existing as numerical, or image data
    could be analyzed promptly using artificial intelligence. This would further help
    to make an effective decision on pest control, fertilizer usage, and water management,
    etc. This chapter reviews the existing and emerging sensors along with wireless
    network, IoT, artificial intelligence, and other communication technologies, focused
    on agricultural industry. It also discusses the existing practical difficulties
    and implementation challenges of the latest technologies; also extends discussion
    on the future direction of smart agriculture.

  description: Saffron is a valuable and most expensive spice in the world, known
    for its texture, smell, and medicinal values, which has increasing demand in the
    global saffron market. However, saffron yield reduced in recent years due to climate
    shifts and the gradual lowering of groundwater tables. Identifying and monitoring
    the saffron field changes is of exceptional importance for effective agronomic
    management for local agricultural sectors and farmers. Soil characteristics such
    as temperature, light intensity, rainfall and altitude are the important environmental
    parameters that affect the growth of saffron crop. The saffron crop requires low
    density, loose, and well-drained clay soils with an optimum pH range between 6.8-7.8.
    The crop is cultivated in cold regions having sub-tropical climate, at an altitude
    of 1,600m and 40-45cm of annual rainfall. Intelligent monitoring, tracking and
    management of saffron crop is possible using IoT and Artificial Intelligence based
    system. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the utility of monitoring
    of time series in accurately mapping saffron, and detecting saffron phonological
    behavior. This paper proposes a saffron crop precision farming system using rainfall
    sensor, light intensity sensor, soil moisture, and climate sensors and android
    application. The parameters are monitored via the internet and an alert message
    is sent, if certain parameters like rainfall, light intensity deviate from their
    threshold values. The created system enables farmers to remotely monitor different
    field conditions and make choices that will result in enhanced agricultural output
    with relatively less human work, less cost, and reduced power usage (use of solar
    power system). This emerging system enables monitoring of the saffron crop parameters
    and simulating similar environmental conditions for cultivating the same crop
    at different geographical locations. To address the lack of information and technical
    support, as well as to increase saffron production, the development of saffron
    crop monitoring and precision farming using wireless sensor networks (WSN) is
    proposed to assist farmers in real-time, achieving precision agriculture, and
    thus increasing saffron production. As a result, automatic water sprinkling control,
    checking the soil conditions, checking the atmospheric conditions for optimum
    growth are the useful information which are sent to farmers in real time as a
    result of this project using IoT and WSN.

  description: Improper disposal of municipal sewage sludge poses a significant threat
    to effective environmental protection. With the continuous advancement of artificial
    intelligence technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing detection
    technology is emerging as a promising research avenue to address this issue. However,
    the current state of real-Time detection technology is inadequate, hindering comprehensive
    and stable monitoring operation. Additionally, the rational use of network resources
    remains suboptimal. To address this challenge, this study proposes a resource
    optimisation technology for the current insufficient intelligent monitoring system
    of urban sewage sludge. By leveraging IoT and wireless technology, water meter
    data can be collected with minimal earth construction compared to traditional
    PLC collection. This is followed by utilising Faster R-CNN to plan the network
    transmission of sewage remote sensing information resources. Finally, the architecture
    collection module's scalability is enhanced by incorporating edge computing and
    reserving sensor ports to meet future plant expansion demands. The experiment
    demonstrates the significant potential of this technology in application and resource
    optimisation. In actual parameter tracking tests, the proposed method effectively
    monitors sewage sludge, providing policy guidance and measure optimisation for
    relevant authorities, ultimately contributing to pollution-free urban development.

  description: Fish farming is still controlled and managed in the traditional way
    where water quality and fish feeding are manually controlled. There is a need
    to use computer and communication technology in fish farms for remote monitoring
    and control. This paper deals with the design and implementation of an internet
    of things (IoT) based system for real-time monitoring, control and management
    of fish farming. The design of such a system is based on measuring different types
    of variables and using the information to control fish growth and increase productivity.
    Each fish pond is a node in a wireless sensor network. The node contains an embedded
    microcontroller connected to a set of sensors and actuators and a wireless communication
    module. Two fuzzy controllers are designed to control the water quality in the
    ponds as well as the environment using five sensors in each pond plus three environmental
    sensors. Practical results indicate the accuracy of the measurement system compared
    to the results obtained from commercial devices used on the farm. These results
    also showed that the proposed approach achieves the best performance of the real-time
    monitoring and control system in fish ponds.

  description: Tide gauge water levels are commonly used as a proxy for flood incidence
    on land. These proxies are useful for projecting how sea-level rise (SLR) will
    increase the frequency of coastal flooding. However, tide gauges do not account
    for land-based sources of coastal flooding and therefore flood thresholds and
    the proxies derived from them likely underestimate the current and future frequency
    of coastal flooding. Here we present a new sensor framework for measuring the
    incidence of coastal floods that captures both subterranean and land-based contributions
    to flooding. The low-cost, open-source sensor framework consists of a storm drain
    water level sensor, roadway camera, and wireless gateway that transmit data in
    real-time. During 5 months of deployment in the Town of Beaufort, North Carolina,
    24 flood events were recorded. Twenty-five percent of those events were driven
    by land-based sources—rainfall, combined with moderate high tides and reduced
    capacity in storm drains. Consequently, we find that flood frequency is higher
    than that suggested by proxies that rely exclusively on tide gauge water levels
    for determining flood incidence. This finding likely extends to other locations
    where stormwater networks are at a reduced drainage capacity due to SLR. Our results
    highlight the benefits of instrumenting stormwater networks directly to capture
    multiple drivers of coastal flooding. More accurate estimates of the frequency
    and drivers of floods in low-lying coastal communities can enable the development
    of more effective long-term adaptation strategies.

    of the frequency and drivers of floods in low-lying coastal communities can enable
    the development of more effective long-term adaptation strategies. Key Points
    We present a new low-cost, open-source sensor framework that measures coastal
    flooding from multiple sources For a 5 month deployment, 25% of floods were driven
    by land-based sources, contributions not present in tide gauge water levels Measures
    of flood frequency that rely only on tide gauges are likely underestimates where
    stormwater networks are routinely impaired 1 Introduction Coastal communities
    around the world are confronting the growing challenge of sea-level rise (SLR).
    In the United States, 6 ft of SLR by 2100 could affect 1.7 million homes and up
    to 3.6 million people (Bernstein et al., 2019; Hauer et al., 2016). Already, coastal
    communities from Florida to Alaska are actively investing in reducing their risk
    from SLR, whether through a full community relocation or large-scale infrastructure
    investments (Bronen & Chapin, 2013; Gornitz et al., 2020; Molinaroli et al., 2019).
    Long before communities are permanently inundated, they experience recurrent flooding
    (Dahl et al., 2017). As local SLR and heavy rainfall events increase, so does
    the frequency of flooding in low-lying coastal areas (Sweet et al., 2018). The
    tidal cycle now takes place on higher average sea levels, resulting in “sunny-day”
    flooding of roadways during high tides. Because sea water infiltrates drainage
    systems at even low tidal levels (Gold et al., 2022), ordinary rain storms can
    now cause flash floods. We refer to locations that experience flooding multiple
    times per year, from drivers other than extreme storms (e.g., tropical cyclones,
    nor''easters), as chronically flooded. It is well-established that higher sea
    levels will lead to more frequent flooding, but it is not clear which areas will
    be affected, how quickly, and how intensely. Chronic coastal flooding is difficult
    to monitor because the floods are hyper-local, creating a patchwork of affected
    intersections, blocks, or homes, and because floods can be caused by multiple
    sources. While chronic flooding is often associated with tidally driven sunny-day
    flooding, it can also be influenced by groundwater, wind, rainfall runoff, and
    riverine discharge (Loftis et al., 2018; Moftakhari et al., 2017). Analysis of
    tide gauge data has shown that non-tidal residuals are particularly important
    components of floods along the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States (Li et
    al., 2022). The role of stormwater drainage systems is also poorly understood.
    In Norfolk, VA, recent instrumentation efforts have shown that SLR has reduced
    the city''s stormwater system capacity by 50% (independent of the tide), and thus
    is hampering the ability of the system to handle heavy rainfalls (Coutu, 2021).
    The viability of stormwater systems is also affected by rising groundwater, which
    has led to corrosion and failure of underground infrastructure in Hawaii and Florida
    (Befus et al., 2020; Habel et al., 2020), a problem that is likely to occur elsewhere.
    The influence of subterranean infrastructure on flooding is not typically included
    in large-scale SLR driven flood risk assessments (e.g., “bathtub” inundation modeling
    approaches, Sweet et al., 2018) or smaller-scale assessments of compound coastal
    floods (Jane et al., 2020). While local residents often know of problem areas
    to avoid, information on the drivers, frequency, and spatial extent of these floods
    is rarely gathered systematically. One commonly used proxy for flood incidence
    (i.e., an indirect measure of flooding on land) is tide gauge water levels exceeding
    a locally defined threshold. Some National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) tide gauges have impact-based flooding thresholds created by local National
    Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Offices for issuing flood advisories. These thresholds
    can be revised periodically based on local infrastructure vulnerabilities and
    are therefore challenging to use for determining how flood frequency changes over
    time. For this purpose, the NOAA National Ocean Service developed the “high-tide
    flooding” (HTF) thresholds using a nationally consistent approach to define a
    threshold for each tide gauge (Sweet et al., 2018). These thresholds are not based
    on impacts on land but rather derived from a statistical (regression) relationship
    for water levels measured at NOAA tide gauges. Using the HTF thresholds, 12 NOAA
    tide gauges set records for flood frequency in 2018, and nationally, flood frequency
    is expected to double or triple by 2030 (Sweet et al., 2020). These tide gauge-based
    proxies for coastal flooding clearly show the implications of rising sea levels,
    but as an indirect measure of flooding on land, they likely paint an incomplete
    picture. First, the U.S. tide gauge network is sparse, and water levels can vary
    substantially over small geographies due to different winds, bathymetry, proximity
    to rivers or inlets, and other characteristics. Tide gauges also only show contributions
    to flooding within large water bodies (tides, surge, river discharge), and they
    will miss events that occur due to a combination of land-based sources (rainfall
    runoff, groundwater, infrastructure). Moore and Obradovich (2020) found that local
    tweets about flooding increased well before tide gauge water levels surpassed
    the NWS minor flood thresholds in several major cities. This suggests flooding
    may be occurring more often than existing flood proxies indicate. There have been
    several recent efforts to develop instrumentation for measuring chronic floods,
    the majority of which rely on ultrasonic depth sensors (i.e., air sonars). The
    FloodNet sensor (Silverman et al., 2022) is open-source and uses downward-looking
    ultrasonic sensors to detect street flooding by attaching the sensors to subaerial
    structures (e.g., street signs); the data are communicated in real-time using
    long-range radio (LoRa, FloodNet, 2022). Because the sensor is deployed subaerially,
    it cannot capture subterranean impairments to stormwater networks that may contribute
    to street floods. The StormSensor, which also relies on an ultrasonic depth sensor,
    is proprietary and is designed to be deployed within storm drains while still
    communicating data at regular intervals using LoRa. Notably, a nonprofit spent
    $280,000 USD to collect data on stormwater capacity in Norfolk using 25 of the
    StormSensors in 2021 (Coutu, 2021). In addition to the high cost, upon submergence,
    the StormSensors (and all ultrasonic depth sensors) cannot provide information
    about street water levels or flood extent. Pressure transducers are commonly used
    to measure water depths in water bodies at low-cost (Lyman et al., 2020; Maisano
    et al., 2019; Temple et al., 2020; Ware & Fuentes, 2018), however, they similarly
    only provide information about water levels at a single point. If deployed within
    a storm drain, real-time communication can also be impeded by stormwater infrastructure
    (grates, pipes). While not necessary for measuring flood incidence, real-time
    communication ensures no loss of data (e.g., due to sensor damage) and allows
    data to be used for hazard identification by stakeholders, practitioners, and
    researchers alike. Here we present the utility of a new sensor framework for measuring
    the incidence and drivers of chronic floods. The sensor framework—which we coin
    SuDS: the Sunny Day flood Sensors (SuDS)—consists of a pressure logger deployed
    within a storm drain and a subaerially mounted communications gateway equipped
    with a camera. Data are streamed to a web-based (open-source) platform for real-time
    communication of chronic flood hazards. This framework overcomes limitations of
    existing instrumentation by (a) identifying street flooding from a combination
    of subterranean and subaerial sources and (b) allowing for real-time communication
    of water depths and visual confirmation of flood extent. Further, the sensor framework
    is open-source and can be manufactured using online tutorials at low-cost. We
    confirm through a 5-month deployment of the SuDS in Beaufort, North Carolina (NC)
    that land-based sources contribute significantly to chronic coastal floods at
    this location and consequently, flood frequency is higher than that suggested
    by proxies that rely exclusively on tide gauge water levels for determining flood
    incidence (i.e., the NWS and NOAA HTF thresholds). 2 Materials and Methods Detailed
    step-by-step instructions for manufacturing the SuDS framework are available online
    (Hayden-Lowe et al., 2022). Sensor hardware and software are all open-source.
    At the time of publication, the SuDS framework costs approximately $650 USD to
    manufacture (excluding handheld tools, 3D printers, and soldering irons), which
    is comparable to the cost of a single commercial (real-time) pressure transducer.
    Herein we summarize both sensor components—the in situ pressure logger and the
    subaerial camera and gateway—and the workflow for real-time communication. We
    then describe the initial SuDS deployment in Beaufort, NC. 2.1 Pressure Logger
    in Storm Drain We designed a pressure logger that can be deployed in storm drains
    to measure real-time water levels coming into storm drains from both below (e.g.,
    tides) and above (e.g., rainfall) while transmitting these data to a subaerial
    communications gateway (Figure 1a). All electronics for the pressure logger are
    located within a watertight PVC housing attached to the bottom of the grate covering
    the storm drain. The electronics housing connects to the pressure transducer via
    a vertical PVC pipe that extends to near the bottom of the drain (Figure 1b).
    We use a low-cost BlueRobotics pressure transducer that can measure up to 10 m
    depths with a reported depth resolution of 0.16 mm. The transducer communicates
    with an open-source data logger (SparkFun OpenLog Artemis) that records absolute
    pressure and temperature, which is later converted to water depth in the cloud
    (Section 4). The real-time data collected by the data logger are transmitted via
    Bluetooth to a communication gateway (described below) using a low-energy Bluetooth
    board. The logger electronics are powered with three D-cell batteries and secured
    to the PVC electronics housing using custom 3D-printed mounts (Figure 1d). The
    D-cell batteries in the pressure logger are replaced approximately every 4–6 months.
    Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Installation of the Sunny Day Flood
    Sensors (SuDS) in Beaufort, North Carolina. The SuDS consist of (b) a pressure
    logger deployed within a storm drain and (c) a subaerially mounted communications
    gateway equipped with a camera. The gateway is powered by an outlet on the light
    post. (d) Internal view of the pressure logger. The SuDS are open-source and can
    be manufactured using online tutorials at low cost. Pressure is sampled every
    6 min, but this rate can be modified to suit local conditions. The data logger
    and Bluetooth board are powered off between samples to reduce battery consumption.
    The logger is mounted at an elevation in the storm drain so that the pressure
    transducer is out of water and able to dry at least once every 24 hr; this is
    a requirement for proper functionality of the transducer (as prescribed by the
    manufacturer). When the pressure logger is entirely submerged, the Bluetooth connection
    with the gateway is lost, and data are stored locally on the data logger. Once
    the water recedes, the Bluetooth connection is reestablished and the previously
    logged data are downloaded by the gateway. The pressure transducer is sensitive
    to temperature. To account for this, we calibrate each transducer in the lab by
    recording pressure at known depths for a range of temperatures (Figure S1 in Supporting
    Information S1). The results are used to develop a transducer-specific equation
    that corrects the pressure readings for temperature. This calibration also serves
    as (pre-deployment) validation for the manufacturer-supplied accuracy of the pressure
    transducer: ±2 mbar/yr in the 0°C–60°C operating range. Raw pressure readings
    are corrected for temperature at the communications gateway (Section 3) and drift
    is corrected in the cloud (Section 4). 2.2 Subaerial Camera and Communications
    Gateway The camera and communications gateway (collectively referred to as “the
    gateway” herein) is mounted to a light post within Bluetooth range of the pressure
    logger (Figure 1a). Although not limited to deployment on light posts, the gateway
    requires an electrical outlet for power and must be within range of an accessible
    WiFi signal. The gateway contains a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Quad Core computer
    (with Bluetooth and WiFi) running the Linux-based Raspberry Pi OS, an uninterruptible
    power supply module, and an adjustable focal length camera, all housed in a waterproof,
    polycarbonate enclosure retrofitted with an optical dome. Heatsinks and a CPU
    fan prevent gateway components from overheating. All components are secured within
    the waterproof enclosure using a DIN rail and custom 3D-printed mounts (Figure
    1c). The gateway manages communication between both the pressure logger and cloud
    data storage. Communication errors from events such as logger submergence and
    weak signal strength along either link are handled in the following manner. A
    continuously running Python program manages data flowing both from the pressure
    logger and to the cloud-based database. Data flow is shown in Figure 2. Upon collecting
    a sample, data collected on the pressure logger are stored to an internal file
    and transmitted over Bluetooth to the gateway. Bluetooth is then powered off and
    the logger enters a deep sleep mode to conserve power until the next sample. The
    gateway is always watching for the Bluetooth signal to appear. When it does, a
    connection is established and the gateway waits a predetermined amount of time
    for data to appear from the pressure logger. If data are not received within the
    expected time an attempt is made to recover from an error condition. Otherwise,
    if valid data are received, it is checked to see if it is sequential with previously
    received data. If so, the record is logged to files on the gateway. If it is not
    sequential, then the gateway downloads the relevant file(s) from the pressure
    logger filesystem to catch up. The gateway then attempts to transmit data through
    a data application programming interface (API) to the cloud (Section 4). If the
    gateway is in “catch-up” mode, the database is polled to find the most recent
    observation, and data are transmitted using the data cache stored in the gateway
    filesystem. Since pressure data are stored both on the logger and the gateway,
    gaps in the data can be recovered automatically despite any communication lapses.
    Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic of data transmission to the
    cloud and post-processing workflow. After data is collected in the field (bottom),
    application programming interfaces are used to transmit data to cloud-based storage
    and route data through post-processing algorithms. Cloud storage allows data to
    be easily visualized through supplementary web applications (optional pathway,
    top). Image acquisition is scheduled by time (every 6 min) using a built-in Linux-based
    Cron facility. This enables visual confirmation of roadway flooding and provides
    an indication of flood extents. Images are written to the gateway''s local storage
    and kept for 4 weeks. Images are transmitted to cloud storage through a photo
    API by first polling the database to find the most recent image and continuing
    from that point. 2.3 Data Processing and Storage in the Cloud The general workflow
    of data transmission to the cloud is shown in Figure 2. Two APIs are used to route
    raw data from the gateway to cloud storage. The “photo” API receives images from
    the Raspberry Pi and saves them to Google Drive. The data API receives raw temperature
    and pressure data from the Raspberry Pi and stores it in a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL
    database table. Both APIs were created using the FastAPI framework in Python (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com),
    containerized using Docker (Merkel, 2014), and deployed on RedHat''s OpenShift
    platform. The APIs offer functions that respond to “POST” and “GET” requests to
    communicate with the Raspberry Pi and prevent duplicate data transmission (double
    sided arrows in Figure 2). Raw pressure and temperature data are post-processed
    in the cloud. A scheduled processing function runs every 6 min and converts the
    raw absolute pressure data into water depth (above the pressure transducer) using
    atmospheric pressure data from the closest NOAA tide gauge. Water depth is then
    assessed for quality control issues (e.g., erroneous jumps in pressure) and converted
    to drift-corrected water levels relative to the road and NAVD88. Drift is common
    in low-cost pressure transducers (Lyman et al., 2020). Here, we identify and correct
    for drift by setting the running minimum water depth equal to zero (i.e., when
    no water is in the storm drain and the pressure transducer is recording atmospheric
    pressure). The methodology for drift correction is shown in Figure S2 in Supporting
    Information S1. Notably, although the pressure transducer used in the pressure
    logger has a manufacturer-reported long-term stability of ±2 mbar/yr, during our
    5-month deployment, the observed drift was significantly large: the equivalent
    of 0.5 ft of water depth. We illustrate the robustness of our drift correction
    through comparison of the SuDS pressure logger with a co-located commercial pressure
    logger in Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1. Once in the cloud, data and
    images can be loaded to other web interfaces for real-time communication of flood
    hazards. 2.4 Case Study Location: Beaufort, North Carolina Our case study location
    for assessing the utility of this new sensor framework for measuring the incidence
    and drivers of chronic floods is Beaufort, NC (Figure 3). Beaufort is a historic
    small town on the southeastern coast of NC and a popular tourist destination.
    Downtown Beaufort is a hub of activity during the summer months, but roadway flooding
    has rendered shops and restaurants inaccessible during high-tide events in recent
    years. Water levels at the local tide gauge (NOAA 8656483) surpassed the NOAA
    HTF threshold on one day in 2000, four days in 2019, and is projected to surpass
    the threshold 6–15 days per year by 2030 (Sweet et al., 2020). Figure 3 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Overview map of Beaufort, NC and the location of
    a local National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge (8656483).
    (b) Map of the study area showing the stormwater network (and designed flow direction),
    location of the Sunny Day Flood Sensors pressure logger, gateway, and field of
    view for the camera. Working with Beaufort officials, we installed a single SuDS
    pressure logger and gateway in June 2021 at the location of a flood hotspot on
    Front Street, the main waterfront roadway in Beaufort (Figure 3b). This portion
    of Front Street is protected by bulkheads, which according to local officials,
    are rarely overtopped during high-tide events. Therefore, stormwater infrastructure
    was hypothesized to play a large role in chronic roadway floods. The stormwater
    network at this location consists of two storm drains located on opposite sides
    of the street that connect to an outfall one block to the southeast. This outfall
    empties into Taylors Creek, a tidal creek connected to the Atlantic Ocean via
    Beaufort Inlet. The pressure logger was installed in the drain on the south side
    of the street and the gateway on a neighboring light post (Figure 1a). The pressure
    transducer was positioned just above the bottom of the storm drain, at the elevation
    of the bottom of the outfall pipe (3.14 ft below the top of the roadway), such
    that the transducer records air pressure when the drain is completely empty of
    water. To visually confirm roadway flooding and capture a larger range of flood
    extent, we pointed the camera at the storm drain across the street, which is at
    a slightly lower elevation (Figure 3b). A NOAA tide gauge (8656483) is located
    0.6 miles west of the SuDS, which allows for robust comparison of measured flood
    frequency with those estimated using local flood proxies (i.e., when tide gauge
    water levels exceed the NWS minor flood or NOAA HTF threshold). Data from a NWS
    station 1.2 miles north of the SuDS (Beaufort Smith Field, KMRH) was used to analyze
    precipitation patterns during observed flood events (Figure 3a). 3 Results and
    Discussion 3.1 Flood Measurements Over the course of five months (22 June 2021–30
    November 2021), the SuDS captured 14,770 measurements of storm drain water levels
    and 38,616 images. There were four data gaps in storm drain water levels during
    the study period due to battery depletion in the pressure logger (8/14–8/19, 9/20–9/22,
    10/14–10/15, and 10/25–11/04), totaling 21 days of missing data (13% of study
    period). Based on camera images, two roadway flood events occurred during these
    data gaps (10/29 and 11/4); however, because we do not have in situ knowledge
    of stormwater capacity from the pressure loggers, we do not include these floods
    in our calculation of flood frequency or discussion of flood drivers below. On
    every day of measurement, the SuDS pressure logger recorded water from the tidal
    creek (receiving water body) entering the storm drain with each rising tide. Hence,
    the stormwater network was always at reduced drainage capacity at high tide, meaning
    that the network of pipes and catch basins could not convey runoff from the roadway
    to the tidal creek as designed during a rain event. We identified 24 discrete
    flood events where water levels surpassed the elevation of the top of the storm
    drain and then receded back into the drain. Using this definition of a flood event,
    it is possible to have more than one event in a day. However, given this definition,
    not all of the detected floods extended onto the roadway and impacted roadway
    functioning. As illustrated by the roadway cross-section in Figure 4, flood extent
    during 11 flood events was limited to parking spaces (water level < 2.8 ft NAVD88),
    six extended into the roadway (2.8 ft < water level < 3.15 ft NAVD88), and an
    additional seven flood events overtopped the curb and extended onto the sidewalk
    (water level > 3.15 ft NAVD88). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Cross
    section of the roadway and maximum water levels during flood events measured by
    the Sunny Day Flood Sensors pressure logger in Beaufort, NC between 22 June and
    30 November 2021. Here we define a flood event as water levels surpassing the
    elevation of the top of the storm drain. The color of horizontal lines indicates
    the type of flood event. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
    and National Weather Service flood thresholds are shown as dotted lines; the number
    in parentheses indicates the number of times water levels at the Beaufort NOAA
    tide gauge exceeded these thresholds during the measurement period (see text for
    detailed comparison). Water levels above the monitored drain are interpolated
    across the roadway, but the spatial extent was also confirmed using camera images
    (e.g., Figures 5 and 6). The 24 measured flood events in Beaufort can be classified
    into two types based on drivers, which we identify using imagery, the shape of
    the stormwater hydrograph, and local precipitation data. The first type of flooding—“sunny-day
    flooding”—is caused by high water levels in the tidal creek which fill the stormwater
    network until water overtops onto the street (Figure 5a). The shape of the storm
    drain hydrographs for these floods are smooth and periodic, following the predicted
    tide (Figure 5b). The second type of flooding—“rainy-day flooding”—occurs during
    rain storms. In almost all cases, these floods occur when the capacity of the
    stormwater network is reduced by elevated water levels in the tidal creek such
    that runoff floods the roadway (Figure 6a). The storm drain hydrographs for this
    type of flooding are characterized by sharp increases in water level above the
    longer period fluctuations, which coincide with rain events (Figures 6b and 6c).
    We do not classify these floods further based on tidal influence primarily because
    we found that rainy-day floods occurred at all stages of the tide (rising, peak,
    and ebbing) and it is unclear to what extent high groundwater contributes to flood
    occurrence or extent. The six storms that resulted in rainy-day flooding were
    short-lived with somewhat intense precipitation (duration: 25 min—2.4 hr, amount:
    0.45—1.58 inches), but all storms were below the 1 year return period based on
    Atlas 14 point precipitation frequency estimates for the nearby Morehead City
    NWS Station (NWS, 2022). Hence, the rainy-day floods that we observe are primarily
    driven by SLR. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A series of “sunny-day”
    flood events measured in November 2021 in Beaufort, NC. (a) Photo of the flooded
    roadway during the highest observed water level on 8 November 2021 and (b) measured
    water levels above the storm drain pressure transducer relative to the road surface.

    4 August 2021 in Beaufort, NC. (a) Photo of the flooded roadway during the 3 August
    flood event, (b) 1-hr rain intensity from the Beaufort Smith Field precipitation
    gauge (see Figure 3a), and (c) measured water levels above the storm drain pressure
    transducer relative to the road surface. Using these definitions, we observed
    18 sunny-day and 6 rainy-day flood events over the five-month study. The two types
    of flood events had distinctly different flood durations and magnitudes (Figure
    7a). Sunny-day flood events were long in duration (median duration = 86.6 min)
    and led to the highest magnitude of flooding during the study period (1.27 ft
    above the top of the storm drain). Rainy-day flooding was much shorter in duration
    (median duration = 10.9 min) and spanned a smaller range of flood magnitudes (0.1–0.6
    ft above the top of the storm drain). Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    (a) Comparison of flood magnitude (i.e., depth of water above the top of the storm
    drain) and duration for both sunny-day and rainy-day floods, with boxplots showing
    the distribution of each variable for all floods. (b) Comparison of measured storm
    drain water levels during sunny-day and rainy-day floods to water levels recorded
    at the local National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge. 3.2 Comparison
    With Tide Gauge Data and Flood Thresholds Generally, storm drain water levels
    agreed well with NOAA tide gauge observations; for our entire data record (flood
    and non-flood events), the RMSE of storm drain water levels compared to NOAA gauge
    water levels was 0.23 (2.7) and 0.2 ft (2.4 inches) excluding days when it rained.
    During sunny-day flood events, there was very strong agreement between observations
    (RMSE = 0.1 ft), whereas during rainy-day floods, storm drain water levels diverged
    greatly from tide gauge observations (RMSE = 1.81 ft). The NOAA HTF flood threshold
    for the Beaufort tide gauge is 3.23 ft NAVD88 (Sweet et al., 2020), which spans
    just above the crest of the roadway at the location of the SuDS (Figure 4). The
    NWS minor flood threshold is slightly lower at 2.92 ft NAVD88, which according
    to the NWS corresponds to the elevation where at the west end of Front Street
    begins to flood (https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=mhx&gage=bftn7).
    Using SuDS data, we measured 18 floods below the NOAA HTF flood threshold, 5 of
    which were rainy-day floods. Similarly, we measured 12 flood events below the
    NWS minor flood threshold, two of which were rainy-day floods. If we use these
    thresholds and the NOAA tide gauge water levels to determine flood frequency for
    the same time period as the SuDS measurements, we find four discrete exceedances
    of the NOAA HTF threshold and eight exceedances of the NWS minor flood threshold
    (Figure 4). Note that due to battery outages in the SuDS pressure logger (Section
    7), we omit two tide-gauge exceedances of the NWS minor flood threshold from this
    total (i.e., we did not capture two floods with the SuDS that were otherwise detected
    as tide gauge exceedances of the NWS minor flood threshold). It is not surprising
    that our measured flood incidence is higher than the proxy provided by the NOAA
    HTF threshold given that this threshold is not intended to capture land-based
    sources of flooding: here, rainfall runoff and reduced capacity in stormwater
    infrastructure. The NWS minor flood threshold is impact-based, meaning that it
    reflects the elevation of vulnerable infrastructure, but it is calibrated empirically
    to NOAA tide gauge water levels and therefore also does not encapsulate the effects
    of land-based sources. Although the data in this study only span 5 months, the
    rainy-day events constitute 25% of all floods. Hence, while flood proxies that
    rely exclusively on tide gauge water levels for determining flood incidence (i.e.,
    the NWS and NOAA HTF thresholds) are useful for forecasting high tide events,
    the actual flood frequency may be significantly higher in areas where the stormwater
    network has reduced capacity. 3.3 Sensor Limitations The SuDS have supplied a
    rare look at conditions within storm drains prior, during, and after chronic floods
    in Beaufort, NC. As a low-cost sensor framework, however, there are limitations.
    First, we found that the low-cost pressure transducer is sensitive to temperature,
    despite on-board manufacturer supplied corrections, and needs to be calibrated
    prior to use to ensure data quality. Second, we have documented (and corrected
    for) drift in the pressure measurements that may be caused by prolonged inundation
    or intermittent wetting-drying cycles (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1).
    A more robust pressure transducer would likely eliminate these limitations, albeit
    at an increase to the sensor cost. We also use NOAA air pressure data to convert
    the raw pressure data from the in situ pressure transducer to gauge pressure.
    Future iterations of the SuDS framework could incorporate an atmospheric pressure
    transducer directly on the gateway. Third, the SuDS framework uses Bluetooth to
    send data from the pressure logger to the gateway, but the range of this connection
    is impeded by the metal grate covering the storm drain. This means the gateway
    and pressure logger must be fairly close to each other (line of sight) for consistent
    data uploads. Poor Bluetooth connectivity or loss of connectivity can also lead
    to data loss. Lower bandwidth communications technologies (i.e., LoRa) could be
    used to extend the distance between the monitored storm drain and gateway and
    provide more consistent data uploads. The SuDS are designed to continuously collect
    data during floods, but real-time communication between the pressure logger and
    the gateway ceases once the logger becomes submerged. This loss of communications
    is a common drawback of flood-sensing technologies that rely on wireless communication.
    But contrary to other technologies, our logger continues to collect water level
    data while underwater and transfers the data once communications are re-established.
    The camera incorporated in the gateway also provides real-time photos of the roadway
    even when the pressure sensor communications are interrupted, and therefore a
    visual confirmation of flood incidence and spatial extent. In addition, flooding
    can be inferred by the last recorded water level and the timing of lost communication:
    our real-time web app shows a “flooding” banner on the sensor site''s page if
    communications are lost and the last recorded water level was within 0.5 ft of
    the roadway surface. Machine learning techniques (e.g., long short term memory)
    could be useful in prediction of flood depths during sensor communication outages
    given external data streams of flood drivers (e.g., tide gauge water levels, rainfall
    intensity), a potentially fruitful avenue for future work. Finally, the communications
    gateway requires electricity, so this sensor framework could stop functioning
    during a major flood event if power is lost for an extended period of time (>1
    hr). 3.4 Implications for Community Engagement and Hazard Communication The SuDS
    sensor framework presented here can contribute to enhanced flood awareness and
    public safety in the near-term, as well as improved resilience to climate change
    in the long-term. Local officials typically block off flooded roads to protect
    public safety, but with chronic flooding, it is not always evident when roads
    will need to be closed and when they can be reopened. The SuDS framework can be
    used to notify emergency management officials when water levels begin to approach
    the roadway (i.e., sensor communications are lost due to flooding) or once water
    levels have receded (i.e., communications resume). Such alerts reduce the risk
    of vehicle damage and minimize the duration of disruptions, as the road can be
    reopened promptly. Local residents can also view images in real-time on the web
    app to determine if they can travel safely or need to adjust their plans (“Flood
    Cam” tab in Figure 8). Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Screenshot of
    the Sunny Day Flood Sensors (SuDS) web app showing live water level data from
    the monitored storm drain in Beaufort, NC. This web app also shows sample sites
    (and flooding status) on an overview map (“Map” tab), real-time images from SuDS
    gateway cameras (“Flood Cam” tab), and information about the project (“About”
    tab). The SuDS framework can be used to support broader public engagement and
    education efforts concerning the impacts of climate change. Unlike many climate
    impacts, chronic coastal flooding is visible, frequent, and can be directly linked
    to SLR. For example, the SuDS framework could be integrated into a community science
    project to document the extent and disruptions associated with tidal floods (e.g.,
    North Carolina King Tides Project, 2023). Informational signs near the SuDS can
    raise awareness around the issue of chronic flooding and the impacts of SLR. As
    communities increasingly prepare for higher sea levels, a stronger understanding
    of the incidence and drivers of chronic flooding can inform evidence-based adaptation
    plans and investments. First, data from the SuDS framework can help identify the
    relative contributions of rainfall and high-water levels in receiving water bodies.
    Such evidence is valuable because some adaptation strategies may only combat flooding
    from one source. For example, higher bulkheads can prevent overtopping, but will
    not prevent water from entering through the stormwater network. Second, the SuDS
    framework can improve estimates of future flood frequency by identifying the range
    of conditions that lead to flooding. Adaptation strategies designed for extreme
    events, such as high sand dunes, will have little effect or exacerbate smaller
    floods along the back-side of islands or bays. With greater evidence on how chronic
    flooding will evolve into the future, communities can assess their needs and priorities
    and allocate resources accordingly. Finally, the SuDS framework is purposefully
    open-source and low-cost, with the goal of enabling broader adoption by researchers
    and community members alike. Chronic coastal flooding is ubiquitous in low-lying
    coastal communities, and many questions remain about its drivers and impacts.
    By monitoring flooding where people live and by capturing flooding from multiple
    drivers, this sensor framework can enable widespread progress in understanding
    the causes of such events and devising potential solutions. 4 Conclusions Historical
    water levels, as measured at tide gauges, have shown that SLR is increasing flood
    frequency over time. Tide gauges only capture marine-based flood contributions.
    Here we show using a new low-cost, open-source sensor framework that land-based
    sources of flooding are important components of floods driven by SLR. For a 5
    month deployment in the Town of Beaufort, NC, we find that one quarter of the
    recorded flood events (25%) were driven by land-based sources (i.e., stormwater
    runoff) during moderate high tides where the stormwater network had a reduced
    drainage capacity. The accuracy of the data collected through the sensor framework—which
    consists of an in situ storm drain pressure logger, subaerial roadway camera,
    and real-time wireless gateway—was corroborated through comparison to (a) water
    levels measured at a neighboring NOAA tide gauge, (b) photos from the subaerial
    roadway camera, and (c) a co-located pressure logger. By instrumenting the storm
    drain directly, as opposed to using subaerial measurements of water levels (e.g.,
    air sonar), we gain novel insight into the capacity of stormwater networks and
    their influence on coastal flooding, information on flood drivers (tides, tides
    + rain), and definitive measures of flood frequency. Our results demonstrate that
    measurements of flood frequency that rely solely on tide gauge proxies (i.e.,
    the NWS and NOAA HTF thresholds) may be substantial underestimates of coastal
    flooding in areas with stormwater networks. Additional research is needed to assess
    how the contributions of land- and marine-based sources of coastal flooding vary
    across geographies and may evolve under future climate change. This study occurred
    at one location on the NC coast, and our results may not be representative of
    the drivers of flooding in other areas. Moreover, as SLR and rainfall patterns
    change, the relative contributions of these drivers may shift. Developing more
    accurate flood frequency measures across geographies and over time is also needed
    for social science research. Flood measures that more closely align with the lived
    experience of coastal residents are critical for understanding the social and
    economic consequences of coastal flooding, today and in the future. Acknowledgments

    1. Introduction Earth dams, also known as “embankment”, “earthfill”, or “rockfill”
    dams, have received significant attention due to their popularity in disaster
    phenomena [1]. The failure of earth dams can pose a significant risk to the environment
    and nearby communities, as they can release large amounts of contaminated water
    and sediment downstream. According to data from the International Commission on
    Large Dams (ICOLD) and the literature [2], there were over 1600 recorded dam failures
    worldwide between 1800 and 2010, of which a significant proportion were embankment
    dams. Several forms of embankment dam failure are reported, such as overtopping,
    foundation defects, piping, or structural failure of the materials. Seepage and
    internal erosion within an embankment dam are some of the leading causes of instability
    [3]. When the seepage of a dam exceeds the critical value, internal erosion or
    structural instability occurs, leading to collapse [4]. Therefore, detecting seepage
    paths is crucial for preventing potential earth dam collapses and establishing
    anti-seepage measures [5,6]. Most dam seepage monitoring methods can be divided
    into three categories: internal monitoring, environmental monitoring, and slope
    monitoring. Internal monitoring using geophysical methods has the advantages of
    being fast, non-destructive, and low-cost but is limited by technical operational
    characteristics and the need for extensive wiring. Methods in this category include
    electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), electromagnetic (EM) methods, seismic
    refraction tomography (SRT), ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and earthquake noise
    monitoring [4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Internal monitoring can provide detailed information
    about the interior of the dam, but it still has drawbacks, such as a limited depth
    and the inability to conduct long-term monitoring. Environmental monitoring mainly
    focuses on the hydrological and geological environment around the dam, including
    upstream water level monitoring, rainfall monitoring, visual observation [14],
    and deformation measurement [15], which are long-term monitoring activities. Slope
    monitoring focuses on temperature monitoring on the surface of the dam, and commonly
    uses thermal imaging [16,17] and fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS)
    [18,19]. From the above literature, traditional wired transmission is commonly
    used for monitoring systems. Wired transmission equipment includes electrical
    and fiber-optic cables, which can provide a long-term power supply for the equipment.
    Moreover, it requires on-site cable infrastructure, which is difficult to maintain
    and has high deployment and construction costs. In addition, deploying a large
    amount of wiring for wired communication will lead to negative aesthetic effects
    [20,21]. Recently, several studies have shown that wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    are more scalable, may be quickly deployed, reduce construction difficulty, increase
    system flexibility, and will even adapt to diverse application scenarios [22,23].
    Since earthen dams are mostly located in remote and sparsely populated areas,
    it is difficult to obtain power equipment and carry out immediate maintenance;
    henceforth, using wireless transmission would be the preferred choice. The remaining
    sections of this article are organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related
    work. Section 3 provides detailed explanations of the materials used to develop
    the sensors, the transmission methods, and the evaluation of the transmission
    results. Section 4 details the methods applied for point-to-point transmission,
    hop-by-hop transmission, and power testing, as well as the transmission results.
    Section 5 provides a detailed introduction to the configuration of the dam, water
    level gauge, and sensors used in the seepage experiment, as well as the results
    of the seepage experiment. Section 6 discusses the experimental results from Section
    4 and Section 5. Finally, Section 7 concludes the article. 2. Related Work In
    recent years, the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has made
    it possible for monitoring devices to collect data from different environments.
    The application areas include agricultural data collection [24,25,26], water quality
    monitoring [27], industrial control, flood prevention [27], smart water network
    management [28], environmental monitoring [22], and healthcare [29]. These IoT
    devices’ sensors, computing, and communication form wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    [30]. A WSN is a network that can interconnect multiple sensor nodes wirelessly.
    Sensors are typically small and low-power devices, and are very varied, including
    environmental sensors, seismic sensors, low-sampling-rate magnetic sensors, thermal
    sensors, and visual sensors [22]. They can be widely deployed in various areas,
    making WSNs widely used in multiple fields. When using multi-hop communication,
    WSNs can consume less power than traditional single-hop communication and will
    effectively overcome long-distance transmission challenges [22,31]. Compared to
    ground wireless sensor networks, WUSN technology can provide better concealment,
    ease of deployment, real-time data, reliability, and coverage density [21]. It
    has been successfully applied in military tracking, healthcare, infrastructure
    monitoring, post-natural disaster human rescue, and smart agriculture [21,32,33].
    The communication types under WUSN can be divided into three types: underground
    to underground (UG2UG), underground to aboveground (UG2AG), and aboveground to
    underground (AG2UG) [32,34,35]. The advancement of wireless communication technology
    has led to the development of various products, including LoRa, ZigBee, and NB-IoT
    [35,36,37,38], which are all part of low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs). These
    have the potential to provide a large number of devices over long distances with
    low power consumption, offering a potential solution for WUSN applications [39,40].
    In wireless communication technology, LoRa (Long Range) has a remote communication
    capability that utilizes chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology [41]. LoRa was
    explicitly developed for long-range and low-power IoT applications and supported
    license-free radio frequency bands. This technology can withstand high levels
    of interference and multi-path propagation, and is not affected by Doppler effects.
    This makes LoRa suitable for transmission in WUSN; however, the limiting conditions
    of LoRa transmission in soil still need to be analyzed [42]. Nonetheless, the
    above-mentioned environmental monitoring related to dam monitoring is mostly applied
    on the ground and less devoted to underground monitoring. This study aims to fill
    this gap by integrating environmental monitoring and internal monitoring. Moreover,
    wireless communication in dense materials such as soil or rock is more challenging
    than wireless communication through the air, as noted by Akyildiz and Stuntebeck
    [21]. Wan, Yang, Cui, and Sardar [42] conducted single-point wireless underground
    propagation testing on the soil surface and proposed some suggestions for applying
    LoRa-based wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) in soils. The concept
    of mesh multi-hop routing has been proposed to overcome the challenges associated
    with underground transmission. Ebi et al. [43] demonstrated the feasibility of
    data transmission for urban drainage systems through mesh multi-hop routing. Abrardo
    and Pozzebon [20] proposed a linear sensor based on multi-hop LoRa chain communication,
    and conducted feasibility testing in the underground excavation of a medieval
    aqueduct environment. Regarding earth dams, seepage and internal erosion are the
    main factors causing embankment instability. The lake water level before embankment
    failure, as well as the pore pressure or water content inside the embankment,
    can be used as the basis for early warning of embankment failure. If changes in
    the water level or water content inside the embankment can be monitored in real
    time by overcoming the bottleneck of wireless underground transmission, then the
    safety of downstream areas and property can be effectively ensured. This study
    aimed to develop a wireless underground transmission sensor module based on IoT
    technology, equipped with a soil moisture sensor. LoRa was chosen as the communication
    protocol due to its long-distance, low-power, low-cost, and license-free characteristics.
    After the sensor communication module was developed, peer-to-peer transmission
    tests, multi-hop underground transmission tests, power management tests, and soil
    moisture tests were conducted to propose a feasible configuration for underground
    transmission based on the experimental results. The wireless underground transmission
    sensor was then applied to monitor changes in soil moisture inside the embankment,
    and the measurement results were compared with those obtained from water level
    sensors. The findings from this study take a leap towards preventing large disasters
    related to earth dam failure. 3. Proposal This section introduces the internal
    and external design of wireless underground transmission sensors, the architecture
    of program coding, power management instructions, methods for evaluating sensor
    performance, and explanations of soil moisture measurement testing. 3.1. Sensor
    External and Internal Design In this study, a wireless underground transmission
    sensor equipped with a soil moisture sensor was developed for monitoring changes
    in the soil moisture content inside an earth dam. In terms of the external design
    of the sensor (Figure 1a), the sensor is designed to be used in an underground
    environment composed of materials such as water, metal, organic matter, clay,
    and gravel, which have high moisture and corrosion resistance. Therefore, the
    outer casing material needs to have moisture-proof and corrosion-resistant functions.
    The composition of the outer casing uses PLA plastic and acrylic. The upper lid,
    upper part, lower lid, and lower part of the outer casing are printed using a
    3D printer with PLA material. Acrylic is used as the circular tube in the center
    of the outer casing, which facilitates observation of the sensor’s condition.
    The external dimensions are 17.8 cm in length and 8.5 cm in width. For waterproofing,
    an O-ring anti-corrosion oil seal and epoxy resin AB glue isolation (requires
    24 h of static placement) are used, and, finally, screws are used for locking.
    For the internal design (Figure 1b), a SAMD21 Pro RF development board, soil moisture
    sensor (SMS), LTE antenna 100 mm FPC U.FL (flexible, 3 dBi gain, <3 VSWR, and
    50 Ω impedance), desiccant, and lithium-ion battery are included. Figure 1. Wireless
    underground transmission sensor: (a) external configuration and finished product
    of the sensor: (b) internal configuration. 3.2. SAMD21 Pro RF (SAMD21)-Based Sensor
    The sensor development board used in this project is manufactured by SparkFun
    Electronics and is called the SAMD21 Pro RF. It has the advantages of being reliable
    and low-cost (approximately USD 33.95 per unit, 2022 estimate). The board comes
    with an RF transceiver module that supports the LoRa communication protocol and
    operates in the LoRa 923 MHz frequency band. The board has 4 digital and 5 analog
    IO pins, each with a dedicated GND pin and 256 KB of flash memory. The antenna
    is connected using a u.FL antenna connector. It has a power switch and a JST connector
    (2 pin) for power supply from a lithium battery. It can also be powered using
    a micro-USB connector. The power switch in the off position also allows for charging
    the connected lithium battery. The edge of the circuit board has a Qwiic connector,
    which makes it very easy to add sensors and actuators without the need for soldering
    or a soldering iron. The SAMD21 development board allows users to use the C++
    programming language to program it in the Arduino IDE-based operating system.
    3.3. Power Management Testing Good power management can increase the device operating
    time and reduce maintenance costs. Sensor power management can be divided into
    sleep mode and the power-saving mechanism. Sleep mode mainly puts the sensor and
    the internal components of the development board into sleep. The power-saving
    mechanism mainly saves power during the entire device operation process by planning
    the timing of entering sleep mode based on the sensor’s requirements. Generally,
    manufacturers of sensors and development boards will consider sleep mode functionality
    when developing the products, and sleep mode can be achieved by calling the corresponding
    code in the program. Sleep mode will put the LoRa chip, SAMD21 chip, and soil
    moisture sensor into sleep. Planning for the power-saving mechanism needs to be
    written in the program’s operating system, and it can design the duration of work
    per hour and the number of work times. By changing the transmission operation
    time, the time that the device can maintain in sleep mode per hour can be increased.
    3.4. Programming Plan for Wireless Underground Transmission Sensors The firmware
    is programmed using the Arduino IDE, and the program design is divided into two
    parts: the Gateway Node (GN) and the Sensor Node (SN). The GN’s functions include
    receiving message packets sent by the SN, sending time information to the SN for
    calibration, and providing SN wake-up/sleep system decisions. The message packets
    received by the GN can directly present the data results through the computer.
    The SN is the bridge for sensor monitoring, sending monitoring data, monitoring
    power information, accessing other SNs, providing other SN message packet transmissions,
    dynamically adjusting the SN access order, and executing the wake-up/sleep system.
    The SN has an internal clock that can be updated through the time information
    provided by the GN and used as a trigger for SN wake-up/sleep system decision
    making. As shown in Figure 2a, taking SN1 as an example, the message packets are
    forwarded in the order of SN2→SN3→SN4→SN5→GN, and when the forwarding order is
    completed, one cycle is completed, with an interval of listening time after forwarding.
    As shown in Figure 2b, taking SN2 as an example, the order of message packets
    is changed to SN1→SN3→SN4→SN5→GN. When SN5 experiences a disruption event during
    monitoring (such as flooding, power failure, or entering sleep mode), the sensor
    can dynamically adjust the access order, remove unresponsive SNs, and reduce the
    forwarding time. As shown in Figure 2c, taking SN1 as an example, the sending
    order of SN1’s message packet is changed to SN2→SN3→SN4→GN. The reception time
    of the GN and SN is determined by generating a random value within a certain time
    range, and the probability of collision between data is reduced by using the randomly
    generated time. Figure 2. The process of forwarding message packets by the SN
    in order: (a) using SN1 as an example; (b) using SN2 as an example; (c) the process
    of forwarding message packets by the SN after dynamically adjusting and removing
    the failed SN5 (using SN1 as an example). The operation process of the GN can
    be divided into four stages (Figure 3a). The first stage is the system startup,
    which initializes the chip, declares variables, and sets the internal time and
    LoRa parameters (bandwidth: 125 kHz; coding rate: 4/5; spreading factor: 7). In
    the second stage, the internal time information is read and converted into a string.
    The time message packet is forwarded to the specified SN in the third stage. In
    the fourth stage, the transmission end becomes a receiving end and enters the
    listening state, waiting for about 7–9 s to determine if a reply is received from
    other SNs. When a reply from an SN is received, the message packet is immediately
    displayed on the computer. Regardless of whether a message packet is received
    in the fourth stage, the process will return to the second stage. Figure 3. Wireless
    underground transmission sensor programming flowchart: (a) gateway node (GN) process;
    (b) sensor node (SN) process. First stage—pink; second stage—light yellow; third
    stage—green; fourth stage—blue; fifth stage—deep yellow. The operation process
    of the SN can be divided into five stages (Figure 3b). The first stage is the
    system startup to initialize the chip, declare variables, and set the internal
    time and LoRa parameters (bandwidth: 125 kHz; coding rate: 4/5; spreading factor:
    7). In the second stage, it reads the soil moisture data, internal time information,
    and battery information, and converts the information into a string. In the third
    stage, the message packet is forwarded to a designated SN or GN. The purpose of
    forwarding to a designated SN is to provide a basis for dynamic adjustment and
    confirmation of the hop connection. When the forwarded SN fails to receive the
    message packet successfully, it will record one reception failure. The SN transmission
    target will be removed when the failure count exceeds 8 times. The purpose of
    forwarding to a GN is to pass the message packet to the computer for recording.
    In the fourth stage, it enters the listening state, and the transmitter becomes
    the receiver, waiting for about 5–7 s to determine whether there is a response
    from other SNs or GNs. When a time message packet from a GN is received, the time
    message will update the SN’s internal clock. When a message is received from the
    SN, the SN dynamic adjustment record will be recalculated. In the fifth stage,
    it will evaluate whether to enter sleep mode. After completing one round of message
    packet forwarding, it will judge whether a message has been received from a GN.
    The SN will enter sleep mode to save power when no GN message is received after
    more than 5 cycles. 3.5. Effectiveness Evaluation of Transmission Testing The
    wireless underground transmission sensor developed in this study is mainly designed
    to overcome the challenges associated with underground transmission. Therefore,
    field tests were conducted to investigate the maximum transmission distance and
    transmission conditions of the sensor underground. During the transmission process,
    the received signal strength indication (RSSI) and packet loss ratio (PLR) of
    each node were observed, and the multi-hop ratio (MHR) was added for multi-hop
    transmission. Additionally, the RSSI has been used as a measurement to evaluate
    the signal quality in many wireless transmission studies [26,44]. The PLR represents
    the ratio of transmission failures to the total number of transmissions, calculated
    using the following formula: PLR= 𝑇 𝑆 ×100 (1) where T represents the number of
    transmission errors, S represents the total number of transmissions, and PLR represents
    the packet loss ratio. The MHR represents the percentage of successful transmissions
    that experienced a multi-hop, calculated as the ratio of the number of hops to
    the total number of transmissions. MHR= 𝐽 𝑆 ×100 (2) where J is the number of
    times that a hop occurred during transmission, S is the total number of transmissions,
    and MHR is the multi-hop ratio. 3.6. Soil Weight Water Content Law Test The wireless
    underground transmission sensor developed in this study is equipped with an I2C
    soil moisture sensor (SMS), which uses the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol
    to transmit digital signals. The SMS converts the analogue signal to a digital
    signal through its internal firmware. The principle of the soil moisture sensor
    is to measure the dielectric constant in the soil, and the value of the soil moisture
    sensor is related to the soil properties. The soil moisture sensor available on
    the market uses standard sand to calibrate the relationship between the digital
    signal and the volume water content of the soil. However, the conventional density
    bottle experiment is limited because the local soil contains a large amount of
    gravel, making it difficult to carry out volume water content tests. Therefore,
    this study collected local soil and conducted indoor experiments to calibrate
    the relationship between the SMS digital signal and the weight water content of
    the soil. The test was carried out in five steps as follows: First, the local
    soil was placed in a pot with a diameter of 25 cm and a height of 10 cm (empty
    pot weight: 106 g), and the pot was placed in an oven (temperature set to 40 °C).
    After drying, the weight of the dry soil was recorded (5542 g). Secondly, water
    was added to the pot to cover the height of the soil, and the weight of the water
    was recorded (628 g). Thirdly, three self-made wireless underground transmission
    sensors were inserted into the soil, and the weight of the water and the soil
    moisture digital signal were recorded. Fourth, the pot was placed in the oven
    (temperature set to 40 °C), and after about 2 h, the pot was taken out, and the
    weight of the water and the soil moisture digital signal were recorded. The data
    acquisition time was set to 10 min. Step four was repeated until the soil moisture
    reached saturation. Finally, the relationship curve between the digital signal
    and the weight water content of the soil was analyzed and plotted. 4. Testing
    of Wireless Underground Transmission Sensors A series of tests on wireless underground
    transmission sensors are introduced in this section, including peer-to-peer transmission
    tests, multi-hop underground transmission tests, power management tests, and soil
    moisture calibration tests. The test results are explained to demonstrate the
    effectiveness of developing wireless underground transmission sensors through
    these tests. 4.1. Peer-to-Peer Transmission Test Using peer-to-peer transmission
    tests to investigate the effects of different distances and depths on GN and SN
    transmission, the transmission mechanism was carried out in non-hopping mode,
    using two SNs and one GN, and the data acquisition time was set to 10 min to evaluate
    the RSSI and PLR measurement values of sensors sending signals to each other.
    PVC pipes protected the sensors to avoid soil contact that may cause damage. Peer-to-peer
    transmission tests were carried out in three different scenarios: aboveground
    to aboveground (AG2AG), aboveground to underground (AG2UG), and underground to
    underground (UG2UG). The AG2AG transmission tests were conducted at distances
    of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m with the two SNs changing at equal distances (Figure 4a).
    The AG2UG and UG2UG transmissions considered four different distances and depths:
    30 cm (depth of 30 cm), 50 cm (depth of 50 cm), 90 cm (depth of 90 cm), and 120
    cm (depth of 90 cm), with the GN fixed aboveground at a distance of 100 cm from
    the SN1 plane (Figure 4b). Figure 4. Peer-to-peer transmission test sensor configuration
    diagram for (a) ground transmission and (b) underground transmission. The AG2AG
    transmission test results show that the average value of the RSSI was −76.33 (SDRSSI
    = 4), and the PLR was 8%. The values of the RSSI and PLR were very similar with
    changes in the distance, which indicates that the transmission of the sensors
    is minimally affected by the air medium. Referring to the transmission situation
    of the GN by SN1 and SN2, the AG2UG transmission test results (Figure 5) show
    that the RSSI decreased with increasing distance, and the variation in the PLR
    was not significant. The minimum RSSI was about −120. Based on the mutual transmission
    situation of SN1 and SN2, the UG2UG transmission test results show that the RSSI
    values within about 50 cm of the underground transmission were similar to those
    of the ground transmission, and the RSSI decreased significantly with increasing
    distance, with a minimum of about −95, suggesting that the soil medium significantly
    affects the transmission of the RSSI. Comparing the results of the AG2UG transmission
    and UG2UG transmission, the RSSI value of AG2UG was significantly lower than that
    of UG2UG, which indicates a significant loss effect as the transmission medium
    changes from air to soil. In summary, the underground transmission signal decreased
    with increasing distance, and there was a significant loss effect when the signal
    passed through different media (air and soil). Figure 5. Peer-to-peer transmission
    test: the difference between the solid and dashed lines demonstrates signal attenuation
    caused by transmission through the different media. 4.2. Multi-Hop Underground
    Transmission Test The multi-hop underground transmission experiment was conducted
    under the same depth but different horizontal distances to investigate the effect
    of signal hopping on the transmission of the GN and SN, and to measure the maximum
    distance of underground transmission. Three SNs and one GN were used in the experiment,
    with the SNs protected by PVC pipes and the data collected every 10 min. The SNs
    were placed at the same depth with only the distance between them varying evenly
    (Figure 6). All SNs were buried at a depth of 75 cm, with SN1 fixed at 50 cm from
    the GN, and six different horizontal distances were considered: 50 cm, 100 cm,
    150 cm, 200 cm, 225 cm, and 250 cm. The experiment was designed for the GN to
    receive data, and the average RSSI, PLR, and MHR were estimated by receiving data
    from SN1 and SN2. Figure 6. Experimental setup diagram of the multi-hop underground
    transmission test. The analysis of this test refers to the data results returned
    by SN2 and SN1. The analysis results of SN2 (Figure 7a) show that SN2 was located
    between SN1 and SN3, and the distance changes were the same. The transmission
    situation of SN2 to SN1 and SN3 can be observed. The RSSI gradually decreased
    with increasing distance. Since the distance changes were equidistant, the RSSIs
    of SN1 and SN3 showed the same trend. When the test distance reached 250 cm, the
    PLR of SN1 and SN3 increased significantly. SN1 and SN3 needed to communicate
    with SN2 through the hop point of the GN, indicating that the maximum transmission
    distance of peer-to-peer transmission converted to multi-hop transmission was
    approximately 225 cm, and that multi-hop transmission would increase the PLR.
    The analysis results of SN1 (Figure 7b) show the transmission situation of SN1
    to SN2 and SN3. The RSSI gradually decreased with increasing distance. When the
    horizontal distance reached 150 cm, the distance between SN1 and SN3 was 300 cm,
    and SN1 needed to use SN2 and the GN as hop points to transmit to SN3. During
    the process of increasing the horizontal distance from 150 cm to 250 cm, SN3 had
    a very high MHR of about 80%, and the PLR changed slightly, indicating that the
    transmission behavior was mostly multi-hop transmission. When the horizontal distance
    was 250 cm, hop points occurred between SN1 and SN2, and SN2 needed to communicate
    with SN1 through the GN. The horizontal distance between SN1 and SN3 increased
    to 500 cm, causing multiple transmission failures during the transmission process.
    Therefore, the PLR of SN2 and SN3 increased significantly, and the MHR decreased.
    The test results show that the distance of 250 cm significantly impacts underground
    transmission. Figure 7. Multi-hop underground transmission test: (a) transmission
    status of SN2 to SN1 and SN3; (b) transmission status of SN1 to SN2 and SN3 (when
    RSSI information is not recorded after the multi-hop occurs). 4.3. Power Management
    Test The wireless underground transmission sensor uses a lithium-ion battery to
    store power, with an output voltage of 3.7 V and a rated capacity of approximately
    5200 mAh. As the battery’s lifespan decreases with usage, and it is impossible
    to confirm whether it is fully charged after charging, the estimated battery capacity
    for the sensor operation time is only 80% of the rated capacity (4160 mAh). The
    sensor’s power consumption is estimated using a combination of sleep mode and
    the sleep mechanism. The wireless underground transmission sensor’s average operating
    current is measured using a three-meter (3 m) meter, returning approximately 22.5
    mA, which can be reduced to 0.4 mA during sleep mode. The sleep mechanism of the
    sensor is set to sleep for 1 h each time. After waking up, it operates for 7 min
    to search for surrounding sensors, send and receive messages, and confirm the
    GN signal source. If there is no GN signal source, it will enter 1 h of sleep.
    When the sensor operates according to the sleep mechanism and has no GN signal
    source, it can operate for approximately 64 days. When the sensor works continuously
    without sleep, it can last for approximately 7 days. 4.4. Soil Moisture Calibration
    Test A calibration test was conducted for soil moisture sensors using field soil,
    and the relationship curve between the digital signals and soil weight moisture
    content was plotted. Firstly, a three-stage sieving analysis test was performed
    on the field soil. The test results (Figure 8a) showed that in the first stage,
    any gravel with a length greater than 10 cm was taken, and its cumulative weight
    percentage was about 7.4%. In the second stage, a sieve mesh size range of 50
    to 9.525 mm was used, and the cumulative weight percentage was about 51.2%. In
    the third stage, a standard sieve mesh size analysis was performed indoors, ranging
    from #4 (4.76 mm) to #200 (0.074 mm), and its cumulative weight percentage was
    about 41.4%. To avoid the non-uniformity of large and fine particles, the soil
    in the third stage was used to calibrate the soil moisture sensor. The soil at
    the test site had a water content of 3.8% and a dry unit weight of 22.56 (kN/m3).
    According to the ASTM classification, the soil falls under coarse-grained soil
    with gravel. Three sensors, SN1, SN2, and SN3, were used for the calibration tests,
    and the data acquisition time was set to 10 min. The calibration test results
    of the soil moisture sensor (Figure 8b) showed that the digital signal was in
    the range of about 520~240 (with an average standard deviation of 3.08) from full
    water to no water, and the soil weight moisture content was in the range of 12%~0%
    from full water to no water. According to the trend line, the digital signal can
    be converted into the soil weight moisture content through the regression formula
    in Figure 8b. Figure 8. (a) Results of on-site soil sieving analysis. (b) Relationship
    between digital signal and weight-based soil moisture content graph. 5. Seepage
    Test of Earth Dam Field-scale seepage tests were conducted on the earth dam to
    test the actual deployment and performance of the wireless underground transmission
    sensors. The sensors monitored changes in the water content within the dam, and
    the results were compared with those obtained from monitoring wells. The following
    describes the layout of the field test and the results of the sensor measurements.
    5.1. Configuration of Seepage Test The study area was in the downstream section
    of the Landao River, a tributary of the Beigang River in Ren’ai Township, Nantou
    County (Figure 9a–c). The test section was approximately 280 m long, with an average
    channel width of 28 m and a slope of roughly 6.3°. During normal conditions, the
    channel was dry, and the outlet of a sediment outlet structure located upstream
    was used for the test. The dam was constructed by mechanically stacking soil,
    forming a closed dam (Figure 9d). The dimensions of the dam are shown in Figure
    10a, where H represents the dam elevation, h represents the breach height, and
    other dimensions are indicated as per the image description. The soil was stacked
    in layers of approximately 25 cm, with a total of 11 layers. The breach was located
    on the 10th layer, and the 11th layer consisted of two wing dams, each approximately
    50 cm high, on either side of the breach. The height of each layer and the coordinates
    of the sensors were recorded using a total station. A pressure-type water level
    logger (HOBO Water Level Logger U20-001-01) was also installed to monitor the
    water level. A PVC pipe was installed on the left bank of the dam to protect the
    water level logger. The sensors were arranged in a straight line inside the dam
    (Figure 10b), forming an independent transmission chain. Each transmission chain
    had a GN for data reception. One set of SN and GN transmission chain was placed
    on top of the dam (representing air medium). Two sets of transmission chains were
    buried inside the dam, with one set consisting of five SNs and one GN. The sensor
    and receiver numbers of the transmission chain were S1-1, S1-2, S1-3, S1-4, and
    S1-5 for the first set, and S3-1, S3-2, S3-3, S3-4, and S3-5 for the second set.
    Water level meters numbered W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, and W6 were used as a reference
    for the soil water content data. In addition, water level meter W0 recorded changes
    in the water level of the reservoir. The first set of transmission chains corresponded
    to water pipe W1, and the second set corresponded to water pipe W3. The sensors
    were placed starting 50 cm from the bottom of the dam, with S1-5, S1-4, and S1-3
    placed at 50 cm intervals, and S1-1 and S1-2 placed at 75 cm intervals. The arrangement
    of the two sets of transmission chains was the same. To prevent damage of the
    instruments during the breach period, the instruments were buried in a location
    that would not be affected by the breach. They were placed at 1.55 m from the
    water pipe in the direction of the breach, with 1.3 m between the water pipes.

    (c) Lanjiang River watershed; (d) deposition condition of on-site earth dam. Figure
    10. Seepage test of the earth dam: (a) dimensions of the earth dam and (b) location
    of sensors and water level loggers. 5.2. Analysis of Internal Water Content of
    Dam The experimental results compare and analyze the data obtained from the water
    level meters and sensors. The analysis results (Figure 11) show that the data
    were taken at 1300 s, 1400 s, 1500 s, 1600 s, 1700 s, 1800 s, and 1900 s, with
    the color depth becoming lighter as time elapsed. The time and location of the
    water level monitored by the sensors were interpolated, and the interpolated water
    levels were connected. In the first transmission chain, only the sensor of S1-1
    did not detect any change in moisture. At 1300 s, the water level measured by
    the W1 water level meter and that monitored by the sensor were 70.20 cm and 175.19
    cm, respectively, with a water level difference of 104.99 cm. The water level
    of the W1 water level meter did not reach the highest water level of the sensor
    after the experiment. In the second transmission chain, the sensors that detected
    soil moisture were S3-5 and S3-4. At 1800 s, the water level measured by the W3
    water level meter and that monitored by the sensor were 103.30 cm and 160.61 cm,
    respectively, with a water level difference of 57.31 cm. The water level of the
    W3 water level meter also did not reach the location of the sensor after the experiment.
    The first and second transmission chains were interpolated, and the water level
    of the sensor in W2 was estimated, which was not reached by the water level after
    the experiment. This suggests a water level difference between the water level
    meter and the sensor, and that the water level meter cannot truly represent the
    seepage water level within the dam. According to the box plot showing the water
    level difference (Figure 12), the median water level difference between the sensor
    and the water level meter was 106.70 cm for the W1 water level meter, 96.71 cm
    for the W2 water level meter, and 57.35 cm for the W3 water level meter. The seepage
    test caused the dam to fail within about 30 min, so the observation time of the
    seepage changes was very short. However, the water level in the water well needs
    time to seep into the wall of the pipe, making it difficult to react as quick
    as the sensor. The water level difference between the sensor and the water level
    meter will decrease to the downstream water level meter, and the difference between
    the two will gradually narrow. Figure 11. Analysis of seepage using water level
    data from the water gauge and monitoring data from the sensors in the earth dam
    seepage test. Figure 12. Box plot of water level differences between water level
    meters and sensors. 6. Discussion A series of tests were carried out to investigate
    the feasibility of multi-hop transmission using the wireless underground transmission
    sensor. These tests included peer-to-peer transmission, multi-hop transmission,
    power management testing, and soil moisture testing. The sensor distribution location
    was not too dispersed to achieve more accurate monitoring of seepage water levels
    in the dam, so the LoRa parameters were set to the default medium-distance setting
    in the program. Although we did not optimize the LoRa parameters for different
    soil compositions and moisture content changes, they were sufficient to achieve
    the monitoring aims. The peer-to-peer transmission test mainly investigated the
    influence of different environments (air and soil) and distance variations on
    transmission, and the evaluation was based on the measurement values of the RSSI
    and PLR. The AG2AG test results showed that the transmission RSSI and PLR of the
    sensor on the ground at a medium distance (60 m) were not affected by distance
    variations. Although this test did not investigate the transmission limit distance
    of peer-to-peer transmission in the air, previous research has shown that wireless
    transmission in the air can be achieved at distances of approximately 2 km [45],
    8 km [46], and 22 km [47] through adjustments of different LoRa parameters and
    antenna heights, as well as application area environments. Adjustments to LoRa
    parameters (output power and spreading factor) will affect the receiver sensitivity,
    causing the RSSI to vary, and trade-offs between the distance and transmission
    data volume need to be considered before adjusting parameters [43,48]. These results
    show that LoRa has great application flexibility. The comparison between AG2AG
    transmission and UG2UG transmission showed that the RSSI value decreased with
    distance underground, indicating significant attenuation of the transmission RSSI
    value in the soil medium. The comparison between AG2UG transmission and UG2UG
    transmission showed that when the transmission signal medium changed from air
    to soil, the RSSI attenuation was significantly affected by the soil medium. The
    presence of plant roots and small amounts of gravel on the ground led to greater
    signal attenuation. These findings are similar to the test results of Wan, Yang,
    Cui, and Sardar [42]. The multi-hop transmission test aimed to investigate the
    transmission of sensors under the same depth and different horizontal distance
    conditions. The maximum transmission distance of the sensor, which changed from
    peer-to-peer transmission to multi-hop transmission, was about 225 cm, and the
    PLR showed a slightly upward trend. Similar case studies on underground transmission
    suggest that the transmission distance is affected by changes in the soil properties
    and water content [35,42]. According to Hardie and Hoyle [35], UG2UG transmission
    can reach up to 20 m. In addition, other scholars have suggested that reliable
    transmission can only be carried out within 7.5 m [34]. In this study’s seepage
    test of the earth dam, the main monitoring object was the seepage water level
    inside the dam. Considering that the sensor’s volume may affect the seepage result,
    a soft antenna minimizes the sensor’s volume. During the storage process, the
    sensor is placed circularly, which may lead to a shorter transmission distance.
    In the future, the antenna type may be adjusted according to the monitoring object.
    Based on the transmission results of SN1, when the distance between SN1 and SN2
    reached 250 cm, the actual distance between SN1 and SN3 was 500 cm, and there
    was a significant upward trend in the PLR. Therefore, it was proved that the maximum
    distance that can maintain the PLR without being affected under the hop transmission
    is 450 cm. In addition, it was observed during data analysis that there is a waiting
    time for the response after the sensor sends data. The response time when the
    sending is successful is about 0.2 s, and 2 s~4 s when unsuccessful. Therefore,
    when the transmission distance of the sensor exceeds the limit, it is easy to
    increase the response time and affect the PLR. It is therefore recommended that
    in establishing the transmission chain of underground transmission in the future,
    the sensor configuration should be within the effective distance. Wireless underground
    transmission sensor power management is achieved by using sleep mode and a sleep
    mechanism to save power. The sleep mechanism is set to 1 h of sleep time and 7
    min of operation time. During the field test, sleep mode was canceled using the
    remote control. The total time spent on the construction of the embankment, installation
    of sensors, and measurement operations during the seepage test was 9 days. The
    sensor can operate normally during the seepage test by coordinating operating
    and sleep times. Ten wireless underground transmission sensors were used in the
    field test, which all successfully awakened during the test. The sleep mechanism
    used in this test was fixed-time-based (sleep–awake–sleep–awake), although the
    awakening was occasionally unnecessary. We propose to change the sleep mechanism
    such that the periods without awakening have a longer sleep time, and to adjust
    the battery capacity according to the monitoring items to achieve a longer battery
    life. The soil moisture content test results showed a difference in the water
    level between the water level meter and the sensor. In addition, the water level
    difference between the sensor and the water level meter decreased downstream,
    proving there was a time delay in the reaction of soil water flow inside the embankment
    after entering the water pipe (groundwater well) to generate a seepage phenomenon.
    After the entire seepage test, the seepage water level monitored by the sensor
    was higher than that monitored by the water level meter, and the water level monitored
    by the water level meter did not reach the actual seepage height, indicating that
    the water level meter could not truly represent the seepage water level inside
    the embankment. Although the sensor transmission mechanism may cause the monitored
    soil moisture content to be non-real-time measurement results, the effect of expressing
    the actual seepage phenomenon of the embankment is better than the monitoring
    results of the water level meter. Considering the limitations of the research
    method discussed above, when sensors are applied to earthen dams, on-site drilling
    is still required using machinery. As the transmission of the sensor is wireless,
    the size of the drilling hole only needs to be slightly larger than that of the
    sensor. In terms of power management, increasing the power capacity or changing
    the sleep mode can increase the lifespan of the device. However, in the case of
    this study, increasing the power capacity requires a larger sensor casing or expensive
    batteries, which would have a greater impact on seepage within the earthen dam.
    Optimizing the sleep mode has become an important task, but in the design of this
    study, it means increasing the sleep cycle, which can affect the timing of the
    sensor operation as the cycle increases. 7. Conclusions This study developed a
    wireless underground transmission sensor equipped with a soil moisture sensor
    to monitor the seepage water level changes inside a full-scale dam body. Feasibility
    tests were conducted on the wireless underground transmission sensor, including
    peer-to-peer transmission tests, multi-hop underground transmission tests, and
    power management tests, followed by field seepage tests of the dam. The peer-to-peer
    transmission test proved that the sensor signal did not attenuate when transmitted
    through the air over 60 m, and the effect of the RSSI and PLR in the air was smaller.
    The signal strength in the soil medium was greater than that in the air medium,
    and the signal decreased with distance. When the signal was transmitted, the conversion
    of different media resulted in a greater signal strength loss than that of a single
    medium. The multi-hop transmission test results proved that the maximum transmission
    distance of the wireless underground transmission sensor from peer-to-peer transmission
    to multi-hop transmission was about 225 cm, and that the transmission PLR would
    be significantly affected when the multi-hop transmission distance exceeds 250
    cm. The test results from the field seepage tests on the dam, using sensors and
    water level meters, showed that the water flow inside the dam’s soil would cause
    a delay in the seepage phenomenon after entering the water pipe (groundwater well).
    The wireless underground transmission sensor could monitor the seepage water level
    position faster. Due to the rapid changes in the dam’s breach water level, the
    water level gauge could not keep up with the seepage water level position. Furthermore,
    the water level difference between the sensor and the water level gauge decreased
    downstream. Therefore, this study proved that the wireless underground transmission
    sensor was better than the water level gauge in monitoring the actual seepage
    phenomenon in the earth dam, which could play a crucial role in future early warning
    systems. As part of our future work, we plan to conduct multi-hop transmission
    tests on different soil properties and environments, and propose parameter optimization
    adjustments for corresponding environments. We will propose better solutions for
    power management to improve the operational lifespan of sensors. Additionally,
    we will expand the monitored items of sensors, such as inclinometer sensors, pressure
    sensors, and vibration sensors, and construct a more comprehensive earth dam monitoring
    system. Author Contributions Conceptualization, supervision, writing—review and

    applied in large amount of civilian fields. The UAV Remote Sensing (UAVRS) is
    a comprehensive technology composed of UAV flying aircraft, light remote sensing
    payload, satellite positioning device, remote-control system, communication technology
    and application technology. An UAVRS system is mainly composed of UAV platform,
    load system, ground control and data transmission system and image processing
    system. With the popularity of civilian UAV products and the development of UAV
    remote sensing payload, UAVRS also shows an explosive growth trend in various
    industries. However, the short battery life and limited coverage of the civilian
    drones are one of the key factors restricting the UAVRS applications. Besides,
    although the application of UAVs in various industries and fields continues to
    deepen, most of them are single-type applications in a certain discipline or industry.
    The 5G technology and wireless communication technology advance and will give
    rise to the UAVRS applications in terms of“networking”,“IoT”, and“real-time”,
    as well as cross-domain and convergence application. The modern cities are highly
    complex and sociotechnical. They comprise people and communities interacting with
    one another and with objects (e. g., roads, buildings) within a range of urban
    settings or contexts. It is extremely difficult to monitor and manage such complex
    sociotechnical systems. The monitoring and mapping of pollutions, traffic, infrastructures
    are great challenges in rapidly changing cities, and especially gained increasing
    attentions of citizens and are putting great stresses on policy makers and urban
    planners. Theoretical and practical efforts to create better city monitoring and
    management systems have a long history. In the 21st century, we recognize and
    conceive “creative”,“smart”and“knowledge”cities, in which the multidisciplinary
    Information and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has played a vital
    role. The Internet of Things (IoT) promotes the development of the smart cities.
    However, in various urban domains, the cities equipped with a sensor-based web,
    or a cyber-physical information infrastructure, are far from sufficient to help
    policy makers or citizens to get a full understanding of the real time or near
    real time city conditions. To this end, due to their mobility, autonomous operation,
    and communication/processing capabilities, UAVs are envisaged in many smart city
    application domains. In this article, we describe a technology of air-ground collaborative
    low-altitude UAV remote sensing network system. The system composes of intelligent
    UAV, the UAV base station (drone-in box) and operation system. The UAV remote
    sensing network can provide high-frequency and real-time observations of the land
    surface. Based on the UAV remote sensing network, we constructed a comprehensive
    application for urban governance. An UAVRS network composed of eight UAV base
    stations was deployed in Danzao Town, Foshan City. Connected through 5G network,
    the UAVRS network advances the UAV inspection frequency, spatial coverage, and
    response time. It provides revolutionary and intelligent services for local agents
    and departments of water affairs, environment protection, public security, urban
    management, and emergency. The UAVRS network system in Danzao is expected to develop
    a real-world smart city paradigm that could be copied and migrated to other towns
    across the country.

  description: The monitoring of the coastal environment is a crucial factor in ensuring
    its proper management. Nevertheless, existing monitoring technologies are limited
    due to their cost, temporal resolution, and maintenance needs. Therefore, limited
    data are available for coastal environments. In this paper, we present a low-cost
    multiparametric probe that can be deployed in coastal areas and integrated into
    a wireless sensor network to send data to a database. The multiparametric probe
    is composed of physical sensors capable of measuring water temperature, salinity,
    and total suspended solids (TSS). The node can store the data in an SD card or
    send them. A real-time clock is used to tag the data and to ensure data gathering
    every hour, putting the node in deep sleep mode in the meantime. The physical
    sensors for salinity and TSS are created for this probe and calibrated. The calibration
    results indicate that no effect of temperature is found for both sensors and no
    interference of salinity in the measuring of TSS or vice versa. The obtained calibration
    model for salinity is characterised by a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and a
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.74 g/L. Meanwhile, different calibration models
    for TSS were obtained based on using different light wavelengths. The best case
    was using a simple regression model with blue light. The model is characterised
    by a correlation coefficient of 0.99 and an MAE of 12 mg/L. When both infrared
    and blue light are used to prevent the effect of different particle sizes, the
    determination coefficient of 0.98 and an MAE of 57 mg/L characterised the multiple
    regression model.

    1. Introduction The oceanic ecosystem covers about 70% of the Earth’s surface.
    It is estimated that the oceans contain around 97% of the total water on the Earth
    [1]. Oceans are known for their extraordinary biodiversity [2]. Exploiting these
    ecosystems has increased the environmental impact in recent decades. Moreover,
    the impact linked to activities linked to tourism in coastal areas has risen [3].
    The study of coastal areas is challenging due to their high biodiversity and the
    wide variety of human activities developed in these locations [4]. Each habitat
    presents physicochemical and topological characteristics [5], including the distributions
    of nutrients, organisms, water quality, temperature, pH, and salinity [6]. The
    oceans present temporal variability, annual, seasonal and daily changes, which
    involve phenomena such as tides, river plumes, marine currents, weather, and maritime
    traffic, among others [7]. In addition, the exploitation of resources by human
    beings causes alterations in the ecosystem, occasionally leading to severe damage
    [8]. Therefore, monitoring the water quality in the oceans is crucial to better
    managing coastal and marine areas [9]. The study of water physicochemical parameters
    allows the application of smart green protocols to ensure the sustainability of
    the exploitation of resources, as well as the protection of biodiversity. Remote
    sensing is the most widely used system for monitoring the land, oceans, and seas
    [10]. These systems are mainly based on obtaining information from the studied
    surfaces from the electromagnetic waves that are emitted [11]. Different information
    sources for remote sensing include satellites, aircraft, and drones. Satellites
    present different resolutions, and some have excellent spatial resolution that
    allows the obtaining of highly accurate values of the studied parameters [12].
    Nevertheless, the temporal resolution is low, considering that the studied phenomenon
    usually presents changes in a short period. Therefore, satellites might not detect
    the change produced in the time necessary to act if necessary. Some examples of
    satellites used for land and oceans monitoring are Landsat [13], Sentinel [14],
    MODIS [15], and NOAA [16]. Moreover, satellites do not allow studies in sea depths
    or studies of the variation along the water column. An alternative to remote sensing
    systems is the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Although WSNs might have a low spatial
    resolution, they are characterised by offering an excellent temporal resolution
    and the possibility of having real-time information [17]. The implementation of
    low-cost sensors and the reduction in communication technologies and deployment
    costs allow for increasing the number of nodes, enhancing the spatial resolution.
    These low-cost WSNs are currently used in many fields of study, such as agriculture,
    health, smart cities, and oceans [18]. Their use has increased in recent years
    for water quality monitoring in fresh and saltwater ecosystems. In addition to
    optical sensors (such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodiodes), electromagnetic
    sensors are used to measure parameters such as water conductivity [19]. Electromagnetic
    sensors are based on the external electromagnetic field near and inside the studied
    environment. This type of sensor can be implemented in many different cases. An
    example of this is the monitoring of the evolution of scour in the foundations
    of bridges, using intelligent probes based on electromagnetic sensors [20]. There
    are studies in which this type of sensor is used to detect water pollution by
    nitrates [21,22]. Another type of electromagnetic sensor is the inductive coil,
    which allows the detection of water pollution and uses the flow produced to apply
    Internet of Things sensors [23]. This work aims to design and test a sensor node
    based on electromagnetic sensors, such as inductive coils combined with optical
    sensors. In this way, it is intended to determine the water quality through parameters
    such as conductivity and turbidity in different aquatic environments. Conductivity
    is associated with total dissolved solids (TDS), which are associated with turbidity
    and Total Suspended Solids (TSS), thus allowing the detection of the discharge
    of pollutants in the coastal areas. The calibration test is composed of up to
    25 calibration samples with variable values of salinity and TSS. Compared with
    previous studies regarding the nodes, the novelty of this study is the integration
    in a single device of existing commercial and own-developed optical and electromagnetic
    sensors and the analysis of its operation. In addition, previous sensors were
    calibrated for conductivity and turbidity; in this case, the calibration will
    be for salinity and TSS. The paper presents the design, creation and calibration
    of the sensor node for the water quality monitoring of coastal areas. The main
    contributions are the following: The complete design of the low-cost node based
    on physical sensors to measure physical and chemical parameters is presented.
    We include the creation of new physical sensors, which can be easily adapted to
    commercial devices due to their low cost and good sensibility. In addition, the
    design of the node, including the software and hardware aspects, is described.
    Regarding the measurements, we have studied the possible interferences in the
    performance of the sensor, including the following: (i) electrical interferences
    of sensors’ signal and circuits for powering the sensor and receiving the signal,
    (ii) interference of salinity in the optical sensor for TSS measurement, (iii)
    interference of TSS in the electromagnetic sensor for salinity measurement, and
    (iv) interference of temperature on both TSS and salinity sensor. The rest of
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines different studies related
    to the determination of water quality, such as conductivity and turbidity. Section
    3 describes how the development of the proposed system has been carried out. The
    test bench for the calibration is detailed in Section 4. The results are discussed
    in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 summarises the conclusion and future work. 2.
    Related Work This section shows different studies on the implementation of sensors
    to determine water quality (conductivity and turbidity) in aquatic environments.
    In addition, studies related to remote sensing are presented as well as how different
    techniques have been interconnected to establish conductivity and turbidity values
    for decision-making. Brinda Das and P.C. Jain, in 2017 [24], implemented a real-time
    water quality system using different sensors (pH, conductivity, temperature).
    They used the ZigBee module to transfer the data obtained to the microcontroller.
    The GSM module sends these data to a smartphone or computer. In addition, the
    system sends messages to alert them of discharges that may contaminate the water.
    In 2015, Parra et al. [25] developed a low-cost sensor based on conductivity.
    To do this, they used two coils using the method of mutual inductance. They tested
    five prototypes and concluded that the coils that gave the best results were those
    of 40 turns and 80 turns (fed and induced, respectively). With the results obtained,
    they extracted an equation that made it possible to calculate the water conductivity
    with high precision. Wang et al. in 2020 [26] reviewed conductivity systems. The
    sensors used were based on conductive polymers (CP). CPs are mainly composed of
    polyaniline, polypyrrole and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene). These were prepared
    under different polymerisation conditions and used as various sensors. It was
    observed that CP and other detection materials, such as metals, metal oxides,
    etc., show a high detection performance. In addition to conductivity, another
    parameter which characterises water quality is turbidity. In 2016, Azman et al.
    [27] developed a nephelometric turbidity sensor for continuous water quality monitoring.
    The results obtained can be visualised directly by the consumer. They compared
    the developed sensor with the commercial turbidity sensor (Hach 2100P) from the
    Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU). This system is based on the use of LEDs that
    transmit light and receivers based on light-dependent resistors. They communicated
    with the central processor (PIC 16F777) and a module (RS232). Arifin et al. in
    2017 [28] developed a turbidity sensor of different wavelengths of polymer optic
    fibre to measure turbidity. They used infrared LED, photodetector and polymer
    optic fibre. As a result, they found that the output voltage is affected by the
    length of the sensor, whether or not it has a coating, the curvature of the sensor
    and the concentration of turbidity that the water presents. In 2018, Wang et al.
    [29] developed a low-cost sensor for turbidity monitoring. The sensor is based
    on detecting transmitted and scattered light by using 850 nm (insert full name)
    infrared LEDs and dual orthogonal photodetectors. The proposed design can measure
    turbidity within the 0–1000 NTU range. Mulyana and Hakim [30], in the same year,
    developed Arduino Leonardo, a water turbidity monitoring system. They used a photodiode
    and an infrared LED to implement the turbidity sensor. They processed the analogue
    signal received by the Arduino Leonardo. They found that the turbidity detection
    range for the developed sensor was between 0 NTU and 40 NTU. Finally, Parra et
    al. [31] developed a turbidity system to differentiate the type of turbidity it
    was. The implemented sensor consists of four LEDs. In addition, it is composed
    of photodiodes and resistors, which are located at 180°. They used different types
    of samples; Isochrysis galbana, Tetraselmis chuii and sediment. Finally, they
    created an algorithm to establish the turbidity, the concentration of the turbidity
    source and the origin of it. As a result, they found that the type of turbidity
    present in the water can be differentiated. Mansor et al. in 2022 [32] developed
    an alert system for water pollution in rivers. With the implementation of this
    system, they intend to notify the authorities when there is an anomaly. It is
    a low-cost system. The data obtained through ammoniacal nitrogen, suspended solids
    and biochemical oxygen demand sensors are sent via WiFi to the ThingSpeak platform.
    They found that the errors of the conductivity sensor were 6.84% and 6.35%, comparing
    it with the reference sensor. They finally obtained accurate readings for the
    turbidity sensor. In contrast to the works presented so far, water quality and
    remote sensing studies are shown. In 2017, Sharaf El Din et al. [33] based their
    study on determining the deterioration of surface water. They mapped different
    surface water quality parameters (SWQP) to do this. Additionally, they developed
    an artificial intelligence modelling method to map this type of water based on
    the backpropagation neural network to quantify the concentrations of different
    parameters by using the images of the Landsat 8 satellite. They concluded that
    using that neural network based on Landsat8 can establish concentrations of different
    SWQPs from Landsat8 images. Abdelmalik, in 2018 [34], wanted to show a spatial
    distribution map in Lake Qaroun for each water quality parameter. He used data
    from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiation (ASTER) to
    do this. Among the parameters analysed in this study are the electrical conductivity
    of water and turbidity, as well as temperature. He used different samples to obtain
    the relationship between the water quality parameters and the ASTER values. As
    a result, he found a significant correlation between the observed values and the
    remote sensing data, with R2 > 0.94 sig. < 0.01. Finally, in 2020, Sagan et al.
    [35] evaluated the ability of remote sensing to assess water quality. This study
    analysed more than 200 data sets, including dissolved oxygen, organic matter,
    and electrical conductivity. They combined the data taken in the laboratory and
    collected by proximal sensors distributed in different areas with hyperspectral
    images and satellite data. As a result, they found that the optically active parameters
    can be obtained by the satellites. However, those optically non-active parameters
    can be estimated indirectly, but there are still problems. To do this, you have
    to use deep learning. Although all these studies present significant advances,
    they also offer some difficulties. For example, remote sensing often only allows
    for continuous monitoring of the study area. In addition, image processing techniques
    are often expensive and complicated to handle. However, the present study shows
    that combining different sensors for developing a low-cost parametric probe can
    allow the evaluation of different water quality parameters. With the evolved low-cost
    node, continuous conductivity monitoring is allowed, as well as turbidity determination.
    In this case, the conductivity is measured as salinity, which is also known as
    Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). Salinity or TDS is measured in g/L and is the summation
    of diluted solids in the water. Regarding turbidity, it is measured in terms of
    TSS, which represents the amount of solids in water which are not diluted or sedimented.
    The TSS is usually measured in mg/L. The proposed solution also allows more excellent
    coverage to be established due to the large number of sensors deployed throughout
    the study area. In addition, these temperature measurements can be compensated
    for by using a temperature sensor. 3. Overall Description of the Proposed Water
    Quality Monitoring System This section describes the sensor node developed for
    water quality monitoring. The system is composed of a low-cost node capable of
    collecting and storing environmental data on an SD card. 3.1. Sensor Node In order
    to develop the water quality sensor node, an Arduino Leonardo module is used [36].
    Other microcontrollers can be used; we have selected the Arduino Leonardo module
    for its features and its quality–price rate. The Arduino Leonardo module is a
    board based on an Atmega328 microcontroller. Its features are shown below: Microcontroller:
    ATmega328 Operating Voltage: 5 V Input Voltage (Recommended): 7–12 V Digital Input/Output
    Pins: 14 (6 of them are PWM outputs) Analog Input Pins: 6 DC current per pin:
    20 mA/pin DC current for 3.3 V output pin: 50 mA/pin Flash Memory: 32 KB (ATmega328)
    of which 0.5 KB is used by Bootloader SRAM: 2 KB (ATmega328) EEPROM: 1 KB (ATmega328)
    Clock Speed: 16 MHZ Physical characteristics: Weight (25 gr), Width (53.4 mm),
    Length (68.6 mm). Likewise, different peripheral sensors useful in environmental
    monitoring are required. Specifically, the system is able to measure the levels
    of salinity, the amount of TSS and the water temperature which is used, if necessary,
    to compensate the measurements of salinity and TSS. 3.2. Water Salinity Sensor
    The water salinity sensor is based on the use of two different coils coiled over
    a PVC tube and introduced into a water sample. As is shown in [25], the principle
    of operation of this sensor is based on the concept of mutual inductance between
    a powered coil ( 𝐿 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 ) and an induced coil ( 𝐿 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 ). In this case, the
    sensor has two coils with lengths hp and hi and a number of spires: 𝑁 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 and
    𝑁 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 . Additionally, the sensor does not have a ferromagnetic core. Instead
    of this, it has a cylindric space, section S, which will be filled with water
    with concentrations of dissolved salts with a relative permeability 𝜇 𝑟_𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟
    . The solenoids are coiled over the PVC pipe with a diameter of 2.6 cm. The wire
    used to form the coils is enamel copper wire with a calibre of 0.4 mm. For our
    deployment, 𝐿 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 has 40 spires while 𝐿 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 is composed of 80 spires. Figure
    1 shows the circuit used to create our water salinity sensor. As Figure 1 shows,
    the developed sensor is inserted inside the methacrylate tube, which is used to
    measure other parameters with the rest of the device. This sensor is an own design
    used previously as a conductivity meter. Figure 1. Diagram of our water salinity
    sensor. Regarding the manner of feeding the powered coil, the system also contains
    a 7555 integrated circuit in Astable mode [37] to create a square signal that
    alternates between a positive voltage of 5 V and 0 V. Finally, the output voltage
    that comes from an induced coil is sent to a general-purpose diode and a low-pass
    filter to rectify the alternating signal and obtain a continuous value. 3.3. TSS
    Sensor The water TSS sensor [38] is based on the use of an LED [39] and a photodiode
    [40] in the infrared band. The infrared LED and the photodiode are placed at a
    distance of 3.2 cm. Both elements work at 900 nm and are disposed at an angle
    of 180°. Both devices are supplied with a voltage of 5 V, which can be directly
    extracted from the Arduino module. An alternative to power this circuit is the
    use of a voltage regulator of LM7805, powered with a voltage up to 25 Volts, since
    this type of regulation permits a maximum output current of 1 A. Figure 2 shows
    the electronic circuit of our proposed system. The Vout terminal is connected
    to an analogue pin of the Arduino module. This sensor is an own design previously
    used for determining and characterising turbidity. Figure 2. The electronic circuit
    of the turbidity sensor. In order to improve the TSS measuring and provide the
    sensor with further use, an RGB LED and an LDR are used. The sample of water is
    illuminated by the RGB LED, and the LDR registers the amount of light that reaches
    it. As Figure 3 shows, the RGB LED uses a common cathode connected to the GND,
    while terminals that control each colour are connected to an output pin of the
    Arduino module through a resistor between 100 Ω and 330 Ω. On the other hand,
    the LDR is powered by a 5 V Arduino pin, and the voltage value, which is proportional
    to the amount of received light, is registered by an analogue input of the Arduino
    module. Additionally, a resistor of 1 kΩ is added, creating a voltage divisor
    to better control the amount of voltage the Arduino receives. Figure 3. Schematic
    of RGB sensor. 3.4. Water Temperature Sensor The DS18B20 temperature sensor [41],
    a commercial probe, is one of the most versatile sensors available on the market.
    This sensor is suitable when the temperature in humid or water environments should
    be measured since there is a waterproof probe model. The DS18B20 can measure temperatures
    between −55 °C and 125 °C. It has a very wide range; however, it does not have
    the same error in the entire range. Specifically, for temperatures between −10
    °C and 85 °C, the sensor has an error of ±0.5 °C, while for the rest of the temperatures
    between −55 °C and 125 °C the error is ±2 °C. Figure 4 shows the electric connections
    of this sensor to a digital pin of an Arduino. Figure 4. Connections for DS18B20.
    3.5. Timing Tag of Measurements Finally, the measurements collected are tagged
    using a time tag provided by the real-time clock (RTC). There are several RTC
    models widely used in electronic developments, among which we can highlight the
    DS1307 [42] and the DS3231 [43]. The DS1307 model is highly affected by temperature
    variations. This fact affects the time measurement of the resonator crystals,
    translating it into errors in an accumulated lag, which can be 1 or 2 min per
    day. To solve this, the DS3231 incorporates a temperature measurement mechanism
    and compensation system that guarantees an accuracy of at least 2 ppm, which is
    equivalent to a maximum lag of 172 ms/day (1–2 s/month). Our system incorporates
    the RTC DS3231, which guarantees the correct operation for a longer time. Figure
    5 shows the connection diagram of the entire system, while Figure 6 shows a real
    photo of the prototype of the system. The RTC is also used to generate a routine
    in the node to ensure data gathering every hour and to put the node into a deep
    sleep in the meantime to save energy. This enhances the battery life, allowing
    more extended monitoring periods. Figure 5. Full circuit of our sensor node. Figure
    6. Real image of our prototype. 3.6. Communication Technology Concerning the communication
    of the node, there are different options for communicating information to the
    gateway and across the network. The most simple one, which is implemented for
    the tests conducted in this paper, is to integrate an ESP32 module that allows
    a WiFi connection with the Arduino Leonardo. To do this, we connect the Arduino
    Leonardo and ESP32 modules using the UART port. 4. Test Bench In this section,
    the material and methods for the calibration test are defined. First, we describe
    the preparation of calibration samples, the materials used, the number of samples,
    and how they are generated. Next, the calibration procedure is defined. 4.1. Calibration
    Samples Different samples were created to conduct a complete calibration and evaluate
    the performance of the different sensors included in the multiparametric probe;
    see Table 1. The samples were created according to the expected values in the
    coastal areas, which might differ from other marine areas. Generally, the salinity
    is lower and the turbidity is greater in the coastal area. Since, in our possible
    scenarios in the marine areas, there are river mouths, deltas, and wetlands, a
    wide range of values of salinity and turbidity are included for the calibration.
    Table 1. Samples for the salinity sensor calibration. The calibration samples
    have a volume of 100 mL. Each was prepared in the laboratory using an analytical
    balance, NaCl, lime, and distilled water. NaCl was used as a source of dissolved
    solids which increased the salinity of the water. Meanwhile, the lime was the
    source of suspended solids. The last variable parameter in our calibration is
    the temperature. The temperatures for the calibration were 14, 21 and 26 °C. The
    temperatures were attained by heating the water with a microwave and cooling the
    samples in the fridge. The temperature sensor, which is a commercial probe, was
    used to measure the temperature of the samples at the calibration moment. 4.2.
    Calibration Test A calibration test is proposed to evaluate the suitability of
    the proposed sensor. Data from the different available sensors (inductive coils,
    IR photodiode, and LRD with the different lights) are gathered using the samples
    described above. The water of each sample is introduced into the methacrylate
    tube. One of the extremes of the tube was sealed for the calibration procedure.
    The sample was kept in the tube for 1 min in order to gather the calibration data.
    A total of five repetitions were performed. 4.3. Measurement Process The sensor
    node is powered with the battery to gather the data of each calibration sample.
    When the node is powered, it starts to measure all the variables one by one. The
    node starts triggering the RGB LED and measuring the signal of the LDR. The light
    colours go from red, green, blue, yellow, purple, cyan, and white. One value of
    the LDR signal is gathered for each light colour. Then, the IR LED is turned on
    and data are collected from the IR photodiode. After that, the coil is powered,
    and the signal from an induced coil is measured. The whole process is entirely
    automatic and conducted in sequential order by the node. In order to avoid the
    impact of artificial light, which might affect the measurement procedure, a back
    box is used to cover the node. The samples are carefully introduced into the tube
    and extracted using pipettes, since during the calibration the box is not waterproof.
    We start by measuring the samples with less salinity and TSS; sample 5. Then,
    the samples with the same TSS and higher salinity concentrations are used: samples
    10, 15, 20, and 25. This way, we do not contaminate the salinity samples. After
    finishing measuring the samples with TSS equal to 0 mg/L, the tube is cleaned
    and the next set of samples is measured; the sample with TSS equals 9 mg/L, starting
    with sample 4, and then samples 9, 14, 19, and 24. This process is repeated, and
    the measurement finishes with samples 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21. The node is connected
    to a computer to both power it and view the information. We have used the Arduino
    IDE monitor to see and gather the data in real-time. Data are obtained from the
    Arduino IDE monitor and introduced into Statgraphics for statistical analyses.
    4.4. Statistical Analysis Statgraphics Centurion XVIII is used for data processing.
    First of all, a multivariate analysis is carried out with all the data to evaluate
    if there are interferences and correlations between unexpected parameters. Then,
    single-way ANalysis Of Variance (ANOVA) and multiple groups tests were conducted
    for each correlated pair of variables between the measured parameter (salinity
    or TSS) and the sensor signal. Regarding the multiple group test, Duncan’s multiple
    range test is selected. Finally, for that cases in which correlation and ANOVA
    indicate that the measured parameter might be measured with the sensor, a regression
    model is obtained with Statgraphics. For the regression models, all available
    models for Stagraphics are considered, and based on the results of the comparison
    of alternative models the regression model with better R2 is selected. For all
    tests, 95% of confidence is used. 5. Results In this section, we present and discuss
    our results. First, we show the general results of the calibration test. Then,
    the detailed data for the salinity are analysed. Subsequently, the evaluation
    of data from the TDS sensor is described. Finally, the main discussion linked
    to the obtained results is presented. 5.1. General Results of the Calibration
    Test First of all, in order to evaluate if any of the target variables (temperature,
    salinity and TSS) might act as an interferent with the data gathering of another
    variable, a multivariate analysis is performed. The result of this analysis can
    be seen in Figure 7. The graphic depicts the correlation between included parameters
    and the measurement of the coil, the photodiode and the LDR with the different
    lights. The correlation values close to −1 and +1 indicate that the input variables
    are highly correlated. Meanwhile, the correlation values close to 0 indicate that
    variables are not correlated. Figure 7. Correlation matrix from the multivariate
    analysis. Focusing on the studied parameters, the temperature is not correlated
    with any of the sensors. Thus, it is possible to affirm that, for the tested temperature
    range (14 to 26 °C), the temperature does not act as an interferent for any of
    the measured variables (TSS and salinity) with the proposed sensors (electromagnetic
    and optical sensor). The salinity is correlated only with the response of the
    salinity sensor. This indicates that the salinity does not interact with the measurement
    of the TSS sensors. Regarding the TSS, it is only correlated with the measurement
    of the TSS sensors. In this case, the correlation is a strong negative correlation.
    Concerning the response of the sensors, the tension coil and the Vpp coil (the
    input tension in the Arduino and the Vpp measured with an oscilloscope) only correlated
    between each other and with salinity. This indicates that any or both responses
    can be used for the calibration. The tension coil is preferred for the calibration
    since it is the input for the Arduino node. Therefore, the obtained calibration
    equation can be used directly in the node. 5.2. Calibration of Proposed Sensors
    5.2.1. Salinity Sensor Before entering into detail, the results of a single way
    ANOVA are shown. The p-value of the ANOVA, equal to 0.000, indicated that the
    differences in Vpp of the coil for the different salinities are statistically
    significant. The multiple-group test revealed that four different groups could
    be identified in Table 2. Table 2. Summary of ANOVA for salinity. A single regression
    model is used because the temperature and the turbidity were not correlated with
    the coil’s response in the previous subsection. All data obtained in the calibration
    test are used for the correlation. First of all, the detected outlier data are
    excluded from the linear regression. Figure 8 depicts the regression model for
    the salinity. The mathematical model, the equation to be used in the Arduino,
    can be seen in Equation (1). This model is characterised by a correlation coefficient
    of 0.90, a determination coefficient of 0.81, and an Absolute Mean Error (AME)
    of 0.74 g/L. 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 ( 𝑔 𝐿 )= (−7.5839+0.6055× 𝑉 𝐴𝑟𝑑𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑜 𝐶𝑜𝑖𝑙 − − − − − − − −

    and the value of salinity in analysed new samples, and 𝑉 𝐴𝑟𝑑𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑜 𝐶𝑜𝑖𝑙 is the input
    analogue value in the pin in which the coil is connected to Arduino. Figure 8.
    Calibration of the salinity sensor. Blue squares represent the calibration data.
    The blue line is the mathematical model, the green lines are the confidence interval,
    and the grey lines are the prediction interval. 5.2.2. TSS Sensor As in the previous
    case, the first step is to analyse the results of the ANOVA. In this case, all
    the responses to different lights are included. The p-value of the ANOVA for all
    light sources is equal to 0.000, which indicates that the differences in the Arduino
    inputs for the different TSS are statistically significant. The multiple-group
    test revealed differences among the used lights. While with infrared, red, green,
    and blue lights it is possible to generate five different groups, for the rest
    of the lights only three groups can be identified. Thus, we use the lights that
    allow the generation of five groups for the obtention of calibration models. As
    in the previous case, since there is no correlation between temperature or salinity
    with the light sensor responses, these data are not included in the regression
    models. All data obtained in the calibration test are used for the correlation.
    First of all, the detected outlier data are excluded from the analyses. Outliers
    are excluded individually for the dataset of each light source. Figure 9 depicts
    the individual regression models for the TSS and each light source. The mathematical
    models can be seen in Equations (2)–(5) for IR, red, green and blue lights. The
    models are characterised by correlation coefficients of a determination coefficient
    of −0.97 for the IR photodiode and −0.99 for the LDR, regardless of the used light.
    The determination coefficients are 0.94, 0.98, 0.99 and 0.99 for the IR photodiode,
    and LDR with red, green and blue light, respectively. The MAEs are 103, 31, 34,
    and 12 mg/L for each model. 𝑇𝑆𝑆 ( 𝑚𝑔 𝐿 )=2463.35−10.179× 𝑉 𝐴𝑟𝑑𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑜 𝐼𝑅 (2) 𝑇𝑆𝑆

    Measurement in Aquatic Systems In order to validate the proposed system, measurements
    in a real aquatic system have been conducted. Two sites were selected for the
    verification of the system. The first site is an irrigation ditch, characterised
    by freshwater with high clarity and low TSS. The TSS of the irrigation ditch is
    mainly related to the degraded organic matter from the surrounding vegetation.
    It might be polluted by runoff from agricultural fields, which increases the turbidity
    and salinity and might even generate the eutrophication process. Nonetheless,
    at the measuring moment, no abnormal conditions were observed. The second aquatic
    environment measured is the seashore, at the north side of the breakwater of the
    port. In this area, due to the predominant current and the sediment particle size
    in the beach, it is normal to find high turbidity values. The salinity of this
    area is not as high. At the moment of the data gathering, the water quality was
    not good. Over the previous days, a gale affected the area, and the wind and waves
    caused the movement of sediment, generating higher turbidity. The data gathered
    by the sensors during the test can be seen in Table 3. It must be noted that,
    since TSS measurements require some time, three repetitions were performed and
    the mean value was used. We can see that the variation of gathered data from the
    optical sensors is lower for IR LED. Thus, we decided to apply the equations for
    the IR LED instead of using the model for the Blue LED. Table 3. Summary of ANOVAs
    for TSS. After applying the equations described above, the TSS and salinity values
    for the seashore and the irrigation ditch water are the following: 3.39 and 227.33
    mg/L of TSS and 0.37 and 34.20 g/L of salinity. These values are normal for these
    environments, especially considering the high turbidity found on the seashore
    due to inclement weather in previous days. Nonetheless, since most of the monitoring
    equipment is developed for measuring the turbidity in NTUs and the salinity as
    conductivity in mS/cm, a fair comparison cannot be made with existing probes.
    Even though it is possible to convert the salinity into mS/cm considering factors
    such as water temperature, the conversion of TSS in mg/L into NTUs depends on
    the type of particles causing the turbidity. 5.4. Discussion 5.4.1. Analyses of
    Calibration Results The salinity calibration showed that the proposed sensor could
    be used in coastal areas, mainly in regions with abrupt salinity changes, such
    as river mouths, areas with underground water emergence, or events in areas with
    emissaries or desalinisation plants [44,45]. It will be possible to detect the
    direction and magnitude of the freshwater or brackish water in the sea since in
    this case the variation in salinity is higher than 1 g/L. Nonetheless, with an
    MAE of 0.74 g/L and the reduced sensibility of the sensor for high values of salinity,
    the use of this sensor for monitoring the changes in salinity in very stable areas
    where the changes are less than 0.5 g/L this sensor is not recommended [46,47].
    Concerning the TSS sensor, according to data for this calibration, blue light
    is the one that offered the most accurate measure of TSS. Nevertheless, according
    to several authors, IR light should be preferred. Therefore, we suggest creating
    a multiple regression model that incorporates both light sources in order to avoid
    and correct the effect of particle size. The multiple regression model obtained
    by combining both light sources is defined in Equation (6). It has a determination
    coefficient of 0.98 and an MAE of 57 mg/L. 𝑇𝑆𝑆 ( 𝑚𝑔 𝐿 )=2104.65+1.7× 𝑉 𝐴𝑟𝑑𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑜
    𝐵𝑙𝑢𝑒+2.54× 𝑉 𝐴𝑟𝑑𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑜 𝐼𝑅 (6) As for the salinity sensor, the MAE does not allow
    the direct use of this sensor for deep water or seawater characterisation. The
    typical TSS values in these waters are below 100 mg/L [48,49,50], and even below
    10 mg/L in some areas [51]. Regarding the sensitivity of designed and tested sensors
    and existing ones, Table 4 summarises some examples. The sensitivity of our sensor
    has been calculated as the minimal detectable concentration according to the calibration
    curve and the node characteristics. After calculating the minimum detectable concentration,
    the sensitivity is converted into a percentage according to the minimum and maximum
    detected values. The proposed sensors’ sensitivity is similar to commercial probes
    and handheld equipment. The proposed system can be used as a probe to measure
    the environment, or as a handheld system with minor modifications in the code
    of the node. Table 4. Summary of data gathered in real tests. Finally, considering
    the cost of commercial ready-to-use devices, the cost of our system is lower than
    the ones included in Table 5. The estimated price of the presented sensor node,
    including the sensors, the battery, the node, the SD card, the box, and all required
    circuits, is less than EUR 100. Table 5. Comparison with existing sensors in the
    market. 5.4.2. Potential Impact of the Proposed Multiparametric Probe The low-cost,
    low-energy consumption, and low maintenance of the proposed multiparametric probe
    are aimed at maximising the possibility of its adoption. It is a low-maintenance
    probe, considering that no membranes, no electrodes, and no reagents are used
    for the water quality measurement. Even though cleaning will be necessary and
    strongly correlated with the monitored environment, the nutrients in the water,
    the epiphytes, and other fauna, this need will be lower for conductivity sensors
    based on electrodes. The correct design of the external protection and barriers
    against invertebrates and ichthyofauna, as well as deployment, ensures the avoidance
    of the obstruction of the tube for water measurement caused by sediments or fauna.
    Under the project SALVADOR, part of the Thinkinblue program, we aim to promote
    water quality monitoring in coastal areas. This multiparametric probe is part
    of the proposed system composed of tens of probes deployed in different coastal
    areas, which send the gathered data to a database [61]. On the one hand, this
    generation of data will be crucial for local and regional marine managers, who
    will have updated data about the water quality of the coastal area. This will
    help them to improve the management of these areas. On the other hand, the data
    will also be accessible to the scientific community, who can use the data for
    the study of climate change, the recovery of natural areas, or changes in water
    due to pollution. Moreover, according to the calibration, the proposed sensors
    of the multiparametric probe are not affected by temperature changes. This is
    relevant since it reduces the complexity of its operations, since no temperature
    regulation of correction for the data is needed, at least for the studied temperature
    range. 5.4.3. Main Limitations of the Proposed Multiparametric Probe The most
    relevant limitation is the relatively low sensibility of the probe for high salinity
    and low TSS values. These aspects will be considered and improved in future work,
    including new calibrations with more samples and physical and electronic changes
    to the physical sensors. Thus, the use of the multiparametric probe can be extended
    to other marine areas far from the coast. On the other hand, more TSS than lime
    should be used, such as phytoplankton and organic matter. Using multiple light
    sources, it is most probable that the sensor can distinguish between different
    sources of TSS. Thus, including new calibrations, the sensor can provide data
    of TSS, turbidity in NTU, and chlorophyll-a in mg/m3, among others. Regarding
    the node’s communication, the node is configured to operate with an ESP32 module
    using a WiFi connection. Nonetheless, the WiFi technology will only allow the
    monitorisation of superficial water. For monitoring the water column, the use
    of an Ethernet connection and the use of an additional ESP32 module on the water
    surface will be implemented. In these cases, as the box will be completely submerged
    under the water, it is recommended that the connection between them uses a low-losses
    wire such as the UTP 6e category to avoid problems in the data transmission. The
    ESP32 module will be located over the water surface inside a buoy, ensuring a
    good signal transmission over the air. 6. Conclusions The need for low-cost and
    low-maintenance multiparametric probes is crucial for efficient coastal management.
    Nonetheless, the existing solutions are expensive and require considerable maintenance.
    This fact precludes the appropriate monitoring of coastal water. The most efficient
    option, the use of remote sensing, is limited in terms of temporal resolution
    and adverse climatological conditions. In this paper, we have designed, created
    and calibrated a low-cost and low-maintenance multiparametric probe for coastal
    areas, composed of our own developed optical and electromagnetic sensors for salinity
    and TSS and a commercial probe for temperature. The scientific contribution of
    this paper can be summarised as follows: A sensor node combining two physical
    sensors (for TSS and for salinity) designed, created, calibrated in the laboratory,
    and verified in the real environment with a commercial probe for temperature has
    been presented. The complete design of the low-cost node is detailed, including
    the electronic components and the communication technology for integrating the
    node into a WSN. No electrical interferences of the sensors’ signal and circuits
    for powering the sensor and receiving the signal are detected when sensors are
    connected sequentially. No interference of salinity with the optical sensor for
    TSS measurement is detected. No interference of TSS in the electromagnetic sensor
    for salinity measurement is detected. No temperature effect on TSS and salinity
    sensors in the measured range is detected. Future work will include the increment
    of calibration values to check if it is possible to improve the sensibility of
    the sensor at lower TSS values and higher salinity values. Moreover, if no improvement
    can be obtained, physical or electronic modification of the physical sensor will
    be considered. For the TSS sensor, the effect of increasing the tube size to have
    a greater optical path length and the reduction of light intensity on the sensibility
    for low TSS will be evaluated. For the salinity sensor, the increase of the water
    volume by using a tube with a bigger diameter increase the number of spires, and
    other coil configurations will be checked. Author Contributions Conceptualisation,

    living tree trunk 1. Introduction Forests are the largest ecosystem on earth and
    have the functions of regulating the climate, preventing wind and fixing sand,
    and mitigating the greenhouse effect [1]. However, in the last couple of years,
    extreme drought and high-temperature events have increased significantly, leading
    to frequent forest decay and tree death on a global scale. The research on the
    mechanism of plant drought death has become a hot topic, among which the analysis
    of the water physiology and water content of woody plants is the core content
    [2]. The current remote sensing measurement methods cannot accurately detect the
    physiological state of a single tree and cannot meet the needs of the water relationship
    research, and the traditional method of manual field sampling is too time-consuming
    and laborious [3]. In this paper, after processing AE signals collected by WASN,
    a diagnostic model of tree core MC was established based on ACMD-IGWO-XGBoost.
    At present, the drying method [4], dielectric constant method [5] and resistance
    method [6] are the main methods for measuring the moisture content of living wood,
    but they all have some shortcomings. The drying method needs to collect samples,
    which will cause damage to living wood, and the process is complicated. When using
    the dielectric constant method, it is difficult to match the size of the sensor
    and the trunk, and the power consumption of the detection circuit is high. The
    resistance method also causes damage to the trunk. However, we pay more attention
    to the application of real-time, convenient and lossless AE signals in measuring
    MC [7]. Yang Li et al. have found that the AE characteristics of Yunnan pine with
    different MC are very different [8]. Xiaosong Li used wavelet decomposition to
    analyze AE signals in the frequency domain [9]. Llana et al. tested the nondestructive
    testing methods (AE, vibration sensors and probes) of conifer species such as
    Pinus kiwi and Pinus scotchinensis with different water content and deduced the
    corresponding regression correction coefficient [10]. In addition, traditional
    signal decomposition methods (EMD, VMD, and ICEEMD) have been applied to other
    industries, such as power load prediction [11], carbon dioxide emission prediction
    [12], etc. ACMD is mostly used for fault identification of mechanical bearing
    structures because of its superiority in handling compared with primitive, unsteady
    AE [13,14,15]. Govind Vashishtha et al. demonstrated a new method for identifying
    defects in centrifugal pump impellers through ACMD [16]. Chuancang Ding and Baoxiao
    Wang proposed an improved Sparsity-ACMD for the detection of rub-impact faults
    [17]. Xiaolong Wang et al. introduced an ACMD processing technology into wind
    turbine bearing fault diagnosis for the first time [18]. The existing research
    results all show the excellent superiority and accuracy of ACMD in the feature
    recognition of AE signals. However, no research reports have been found on the
    inversion of the water content of living wood through child wave signs based on
    ACMD signal decomposition. In this paper, low-power and high-precision wireless
    acoustic emission nodes designed by ourselves are used to collect the fundamental
    water content of standing trees. Based on the ACMD of the original AE signal,
    for the first time, the optimal MC diagnosis model of living standing trees is
    established by using machine learning-related technologies so as to realize the
    remote real-time nondestructive monitoring of the MC of standing trees, providing
    a new mentality for measuring the MC of standing trees. The schematic framework
    of the WASN is properly displayed in Figure 1. Figure 1. Schematic diagram of
    WASN. 2. System and Methods 2.1. Wireless Acoustic Emission Sensor Network The
    WASN node used in this paper was further improved on the previous basis. It had
    two independent AE data acquisition channels and was equipped with a high-speed
    amplifier, the OPA627, due to the low amplitude of AE signals. Due to the need
    for low-power wireless transmission, the ultra-low-power digital-to-analog converter
    AD7536 was responsible for converting and transmitting the collected data to the
    STM32F405RG central controller, and the LoRa module SX1278 was used to construct
    the 433MHz wireless communication network. The excitation sound source for data
    collection was generated by the regular periodic vibration of the Arduino miniature
    vibration motor. The AE wave during the process was propagated directly through
    the surface of the tree trunk and collected by the AE sensor coupled with Vaseline
    on the surface of the bark. To further strengthen the anti-interference function
    of this system, two R15α probes were positioned longitudinally at a distance of
    10 cm and 20 cm between the acoustic source and the tree at the diameter of breast
    height (1.3 m above the ground). In this way, the difference term can be calculated
    for the far and near probes to reduce the measurement error of the system. Four
    types of trees growing in the same area were selected as sample trees, namely
    Buxus sinica, Zelkova serrata, Pinus sylvestris and green maple, with a total
    of 12 trees. The architecture of the WASN and field installation diagram are displayed
    in Figure 2. Figure 2. Field testing structure of WASN and its sample node: (a)
    sample of AE node; (b) architecture of the wireless AE node; (c) site installation
    diagram. 2.2. Time Series Decomposition of AE Waveform Based on ACMD The AE waveform
    of a tree trunk is affected by its material, shape, moisture and other factors,
    showing certain characteristics of fluctuation and non-stationarity. However,
    due to the regular excitation of the micromotor, the AE waveform also has an obvious
    trend of periodic fluctuation. If the algorithm model can capture the periodic
    rule of AE waveforms well, the accuracy of the prediction of tree trunk MC will
    be greatly improved. In this paper, the original non-stationary AE sequence is
    decomposed by the ACMD algorithm. ACMD is an adaptive signal decomposition algorithm,
    and the framework matching and tracking of a recursive algorithm can effectively
    process multimodal signals with time-varying characteristics. A non-stationary
    AE signal with s components can be defined as: 𝑦(𝑡)= ∑ 𝑠 𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 (𝑡)= ∑ 𝑠 𝑖=1
    𝐴 𝑖 (𝑡)cos(2𝜋 ∫ 𝑡 0 𝑓 𝑖 (𝜏)𝑑𝜏+ 𝜑 𝑖 ) (1) where 𝐴 𝑖 (𝑡) , 𝑓 𝑖 (𝜏) are the instantaneous
    amplitude and frequency of the i-th component. 𝜑 𝑖 represents the initial phase.
    ACMD is based on the broadband signal through modulation and modulation to narrowband
    signal to achieve the simplification of solving the problem. Through demodulation
    technology, the above equation can be converted to: 𝑦(𝑡)= ∑ 𝑠 𝑖=1 𝑚 𝑖 (𝑡)cos(2𝜋
    ∫ 𝑡 0 𝑓 ̃ 𝑖 (𝜏)𝑑𝜏)+ 𝑛 𝑖 (𝑡)sin(2𝜋 ∫ 𝑡 0 𝑓 ̃ 𝑖 (𝜏)𝑑𝜏) (2) 𝑚 𝑖 (𝑡)= 𝐴 𝑖 (𝑡)cos(2𝜋
    ∫ 𝑡 0 ( 𝑓 𝑖 (𝜏)− 𝑓 ̃ 𝑖 (𝜏))𝑑𝜏+ 𝜑 𝑖 ) (3) 𝑛 𝑖 (𝑡)=− 𝐴 𝑖 (𝑡)sin(2𝜋 ∫ 𝑡 0 ( 𝑓 𝑖 (𝜏)−
    𝑓 ̃ 𝑖 (𝜏))𝑑𝜏+ 𝜑 𝑖 ) (4) where 𝑚 𝑖 (𝑡) and 𝑛 𝑖 (𝑡) represent the demodulation operator,
    and 𝑓 𝑖 ̃ (𝑡) is the corresponding frequency function. We can see from the above
    equation that if we choose the suitable 𝑓 𝑖 ̃ (𝑡) to make 𝑓 𝑖 ̃ (𝑡)= 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑡) ,
    the narrowest bandwidth pure amplitude modulated signal is obtained in this ideal
    case. Each component of the signal is estimated by solving the demodulation bandwidth
    minimization problem. At this time, ACMD extracts each component of the signal
    one by one based on the recursive framework, it is converted into the optimization
    problem of finding the i-th signal component. min 𝑚 𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑛 𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑓 ̃ 𝑖 (𝑡)
    { ‖ 𝑚 𝑖 ″ (𝑡)‖ 2 2 + ‖ 𝑛 𝑖 ″ (𝑡)‖ 2 2 +𝜆 ‖𝑦(𝑡)− 𝑦 𝑖 (𝑡)‖ 2 2 } (5) where ‖•‖ 2
    is Euclidean norm, 𝑚 𝑖 ″ (𝑡) and 𝑛 𝑖 ″ (𝑡) are the second derivatives of the demodulation
    operator, and 𝜆 represents the penalty factor. Considering the discrete form of
    the signal, under the time series of 𝑡= 𝑡 0 ,⋯, 𝑡 𝑁−1 , the discrete form of the
    above equation is: min 𝐵 𝑖 , 𝐷 𝑖 { ‖Λ 𝐵 𝑖 ‖ 2 2 + ‖ 𝑛 𝑖 ″ (𝑡)‖ 2 2 +𝜆 ‖𝑦(𝑡)− 𝐺
    𝑖 𝐵 𝑖 ‖ 2 2 } (6) where Λ = diag[ Ω , Ω ] is the square diagonal matrix, Ω is
    a second-order difference matrix, and Gi is the frequency diagonal matrix in the
    discretized form Bi = [miT, niT]T. In the decomposition of the original AE signal
    step by step using the demodulation bandwidth minimization problem, the first
    signal component is subtracted from the original signal component and looped several
    times until all signal components are obtained. 2.3. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)
    The algorithm principle of GWO is to imitate the social class system and prey
    hunting track of the grey wolf, and it achieves the purpose of optimization according
    to the searching, surrounding and hunting behavior in the process [19]. The grade
    divisions, which occur from high to low and are usually divided into four levels,
    are α, β, δ, and ω. The leader of the pack is defined as the α wolf, subordinates
    who assist the α wolf in making decisions are defined as β wolves, the third rank
    of wolves are known as δ wolves, and the lowest rank are the ω wolfs, which are
    subject to all other wolves of all classes. It may not seem as though ω-wolves
    have an important role, but they are essential to the internal balance between
    the species. The mathematical model of the behavior of a grey wolf group to search
    for the location of prey and surround it can be expressed as: 𝐷=𝐸× 𝑋 p (𝑡)−𝑋(𝑡)
    (7) 𝑋 𝑖 (𝑡+1)= 𝑋 𝑝 (𝑡)−𝐴×𝐷 (8) where 𝐷 represents the distance vector between
    the prey and grey wolves, 𝑡 represents the current number of iterations, 𝑋 𝑝 (𝑡)
    is the vector of the current grey wolf population’s position, and 𝐸 and 𝐹 are
    both the coefficient vectors, the calculation of which is as follows: 𝐹=2𝑢× 𝑟
    1 −𝑢 (9) 𝐶=2 𝑟 1 (10) 𝑢=2(1− 𝑡 𝑡 max ) (11) where 𝑡 max is the maximum iterations
    number; 𝑟 1 , 𝑟 2 are vectors randomly ranged in [0, 1]; and 𝑎 is the distance
    control parameter with an initial value 𝑎 0 = 2. In the process of grey wolves
    hunting prey, the α wolves lead the pack to search for the prey. Then, led by
    the alpha, the β and δ wolves attack and catch their prey. In the process, α,
    β, δ wolves are nearest to the prey position, and the position of the three wolves
    can be used to calculate the position of the individual grey wolf moving toward
    the prey: 𝐷 𝛼 =| 𝐸 1 × 𝑋 𝛼 (𝑡)−𝑋(𝑡)| (12) 𝐷 𝛽 =| 𝐸 2 × 𝑋 𝛽 (𝑡)−𝑋(𝑡)| (13) 𝐷 𝛿
    =| 𝐸 3 × 𝑋 𝛿 (𝑡)−𝑋(𝑡)| (14) The advance direction and step size of the ω wolves
    relative to the α wolves, β wolves and δ wolves are calculated as: 𝑋 1,𝜔 (𝑡+1)=
    𝑋 𝛼 (𝑡)− 𝐹 1 × 𝐷 𝛼 (15) 𝑋 2,𝜔 (𝑡+1)= 𝑋 𝛽 (𝑡)− 𝐹 1 × 𝐷 𝛽 (16) 𝑋 3,𝜔 (𝑡+1)= 𝑋 𝛿
    (𝑡)− 𝐹 3 × 𝐷 𝛿 (17) The final position vector of the ω wolves is: 𝑋 𝜔 (𝑡)= 𝑋 1,𝜔
    + 𝑋 2,𝜔 + 𝑋 3,𝜔 3 (18) According to the above model, wolves evolved to surround
    their prey by constantly updating their positions until they reached a maximum
    number of iterations or solution accuracy. 2.4. Multi-Strategy Joint Optimization
    of Improved GWO When solving the problems of function optimization, the GWO algorithm
    generally uses initial overall information that is randomly generated and characterized
    by difficulty in retaining the diversity of the population. The quality of the
    original population greatly affects the convergence speed and global optimization
    performance of the algorithm. In order to enhance the global search capability
    of GWO, avoid results that occur from falling into local optima, and accelerate
    the convergence rate, the following strategies are adopted for joint optimization:
    Hénon mapping was used to initialize the gray wolf population so that individuals
    were evenly distributed in the search space as much as possible, and the diversity
    of the initial population was increased; the spiral predation strategy was applied
    to the location updating process of the ω wolf to give consideration to both local
    exploitation and global search capabilities; and the firefly disturbance strategy
    was used to perturb the locations of all gray wolves to strengthen their ability
    to jump out of the local optimal solution, expand their grabble scope, and improve
    their global search ability. 2.4.1. Hénon Mapping A chaotic system has both non-convergence
    and random boundedness. The randomness, regularity and ergodicity of the corresponding
    chaotic map are suitable for maintaining the multiformity of an algorithm’s population
    and improving the global grabble ability. Common chaotic mapping mainly includes
    tent mapping, logistic mapping and Hénon mapping. A tent map has good ergodic
    properties, but this map has a fixed point of a rational number, which will cause
    algorithm failure once the data falls into the fixed-point cycle. Logistic mapping
    has the disadvantage of an uneven distribution, mainly in the two ranges [0, 0.1]
    and [0.9, 1], where the probability of a value is much higher than in other ranges.
    Hénon mapping has the same uniformity as tent mapping but is more stable, which
    can cover the search blind area to the greatest extent and enhance the individual
    diversity of gray wolves [20]. Hénon mapping was used to initialize the GWO algorithm
    population, and the expression was as follows: { 𝑦 1 (𝑡)=1−𝑎 ( 𝑦 1 (𝑡−1)) 2 +
    𝑦 2 (𝑡−1) 𝑦 2 (𝑡)=𝑏 𝑦 1 (𝑡) (19) where t is the number of chaotic iterations.
    When a = 0.6 and b = 0.7, y1(t) and y2(t) show chaotic characteristics. Even a
    small change in the original value will contribute to a great difference in the
    following chaotic sequence so that the chaotic sequence can spread over the entire
    search area without repeating. 𝑧(𝑡)=𝑎𝑏𝑠(𝜔 𝑦 1 (𝑡)),𝑖=1,2,⋯𝑛. (20) We normalized
    the Hénon sequence from the range [−2, 2.25] to [0, 1] according to the above
    formula. 𝑥 𝑡 𝑖 =𝑙 𝑏 𝑖 +𝑧(𝑡)(𝑢 𝑏 𝑖 −𝑙 𝑏 𝑖 ) (21) Finally, the initial wolf pack
    position is obtained through the above equation, where ubi and lbi are the maximum
    bound and minimum bounds of the solution space. It can be seen from the histogram
    of chaotic value and chaotic value frequency that the chaotic value sequence is
    distributed evenly in Figure 3. Figure 3. Comparison of chaotic values and random
    values of Hénon mapping: (a) scatter plot of chaotic value dimension distribution
    and (b) chaotic value frequency histogram. 2.4.2. Reverse Learning Strategy For
    the purpose of letting the individual grey wolf find a better solution, the corresponding
    reverse solution is achieved through the reverse learning strategy, and the fitness
    values of the current solution and the reverse solution are compared to retain
    the better solution [21]. The reverse learning strategy is introduced into the
    grey wolf algorithm, and the mathematical expression is: 𝑋 𝑜𝑝𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 (𝑡)=𝑝𝑐+𝑟⊕(𝑞𝑐−
    𝑋 𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 (𝑡)) (22) 𝑋 𝑡+1 𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡)= 𝑋 𝑜𝑝𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 (𝑡)+ 𝑐 1 ⊕( 𝑋 𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 (𝑡)− 𝑋 𝑜𝑝𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 (𝑡))
    (23) where 𝑋 𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 (𝑡) , 𝑋 𝑜𝑝𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 (𝑡) are the optimal solution of the t-th iteration
    and the corresponding reverse solution; 𝑝𝑐 and 𝑞𝑐 are the maximum and minimum
    bounds; 𝑟 is a random number matrix; and 𝑐 1 is the control parameter, the calculation
    of which is as follows: 𝑐 1 = (𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑟 max − 𝑡 𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑟 max ) 𝑡 (24) 2.4.3. Firefly
    Perturbation Strategy At the late stage of the GWO iteration, in consideration
    of the assimilation of individual wolves, the algorithm tends to fall into local
    optimization. Aiming at this problem, the firefly perturbation strategy was used
    to perturb the positions of all individual grey wolves [22]. The firefly disturbance
    strategy is based on firefly brightness to move to a new location. The grey wolf
    position update formula is thus: 𝑌 𝑡+1 𝑖,𝐽 = 𝑋 𝑡+1 𝑖,𝑗 +𝜎( 𝑋 𝑡+1 𝑖,𝑗 − 𝑋 𝑡 𝑝 )+𝜃(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑−
    1 2 ) (25) where 𝜎 represents attraction, and 𝜎= 𝛽 0 × 𝑒 −𝛾 𝑟 2 𝑖,𝑗 ; 𝛽 0 represents
    maximum attraction, 𝛾 represents the absorption coefficient of the light’s intensity;
    𝑟 𝑖,𝑗 is the distance between 𝑋 𝑡+1 𝑖,𝑗 and 𝑋 𝑡 𝑝 ; 𝜃 is the step factor range
    in [0, 1]; and 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 is a regularly spread random number in [0, 1]. 2.5. XGBoost
    XGBoost is an additional model composed of k regression tree models [23]. We set
    the tree model of the t-th iteration training as 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑥 𝑗 ) . Then, the final
    prediction result of the k regression tree integration became: 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ = ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾
    𝑓 𝑘 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ), 𝑓 𝑘 ∈𝐹 (26) where 𝑓 𝑘 represents an independent regression tree,
    and 𝐹 are all the regression trees; 𝑓 𝑘 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) is the predicted value of sample
    i on the k-th regression tree; and 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ is the final forecast result. The objective
    function of XGBoost is defined as: 𝑂 𝑏 𝑗 = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝐶( 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ )+ ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 Ω(
    𝑓 𝑘 ) (27) Ω( 𝑓 𝑘 )=𝛾𝑇+ 1 2 𝛾 ‖𝜉‖ 2 =𝛾𝑇+ 1 2 𝜂 ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑇 𝜉 2 𝑗 (28) where ∑ 𝑖=1
    𝑛 𝐶( 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ ) is the loss function, Ω( 𝑓 𝑘 ) is the regular term, 𝑇 and 𝜉
    represent the number and weight of the leaf nodes, respectively, and 𝛾 and 𝜂 are
    the penalty terms that inhibit the model complexity caused by the increase in
    leaf nodes. Here, 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ adds a new function 𝑓 𝑡 at the t iteration of the greedy
    optimization target function to improve the precision of the prediction. Here,
    the target function of the model in the t iteration is: 𝐽( 𝑓 𝑡 )= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 (𝐿(
    𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ̂ 𝑡−1 )+ 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ))+Ω( 𝑓 𝑡 ) (29) By expanding the second-order Taylor
    formula of the loss function in the above equation, the simplified target function
    of the t-th training is: 𝐽( 𝑓 𝑡 )= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝑔 𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑥 𝑖 )+ 1 2 ℎ 𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 2 (
    𝑥 𝑖 ))+Ω( 𝑓 𝑡 ) (30) where 𝑔 𝑖 represents the first-order derivative of the loss
    function, and ℎ 𝑖 represents the second-order derivative of the loss function.
    After substituting (28) into (30), the final target function is obtained: 𝐽( 𝑓
    𝑡 )= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝑔 𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 ( 𝑥 𝑖 )+ 1 2 ℎ 𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 2 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ))+ 1 2 𝜂 ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑇 𝜉 2 𝑗 +𝛾𝑇
    (31) The optimal 𝜉 𝑗 is: 𝜉 ∗ 𝑗 =− ∑ 𝑖∈ 𝐼 𝑗 𝑔 𝑖 ∑ 𝑖∈ 𝐼 𝑗 ℎ 𝑖 +𝜂 , and at this point,
    the optimal target value is obtained: 𝐽( 𝑓 𝑡 )=− 1 2 ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑇 ( ∑ 𝑖∈ 𝐼 𝑗 𝑔 𝑖 )
    2 ∑ 𝑖∈ 𝐼 𝑗 ℎ 𝑖 +𝜂 +𝛾𝑇 (32) where 𝐽( 𝑓 𝑡 ) represents the structure fraction of
    the tree, and the smaller it is, the higher the precision. 2.6. Framework of ACMD-IGWO-XGBoost
    Taking the waveform parameters collected by WASN as the sample set, the figure
    shows the framework of the water-content diagnosis method for living wood designed
    in this paper. Firstly, the original AE signal was decomposed by ACMD, and the
    subsequence waveform was divided into a training set and a testing set based on
    the score of 8:2. Then, the relevant parameters of XGBoost are initialized, and
    the heuristic algorithms of particle swarm optimization (PSO) [24], ant colony
    optimization (ACO) [25], the seagull optimization algorithm (SOA) [26] and IGWO
    are used to adjust the extreme gradient boost superparameters. Thus, four evaluation
    indexes were selected to compare the prediction results of IGWO, which was improved
    by multi-strategy joint optimization in this paper, with the results of the other
    three algorithms and finally output the optimal diagnostic model of live wood
    MC. Figure 4 shows the whole analytical process of the different algorithms adopted
    in this study. Figure 4. Optimization process of xgboost of four hybrid intelligent
    models based on ACMD method. 2.7. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Figure 5
    displays the AE nodes’ on-site diagram and data acquisition interface. As can
    be seen, AE feature parameters such as amplitude, rise time, duration, ring count
    and signal energy can all be precisely measured and calculated. Figure 5. Actual
    sensor node installation and data collection diagram: (a) deployment of AE nodes
    and (b) display interface of AE data. 2.7.1. Time Series Decomposition of AE Waveform
    Signal Based on ACMD Here, we compare the wave decomposition effectiveness of
    ACMD and VMD [27]. A total of 90,000 sample points for a consecutive 9 s were
    selected from the training data, and VMD and ACMD were used for decomposition,
    as shown in the decomposition diagram below. The ordinate represents the amplitude
    of the sub-sequence after the original amplitude decomposition of each sampling
    point. The original AE signal still has a strong time-varying non-stationary property.
    It can be seen from the waveform decomposition diagram that 9 sequential wavelet
    waves are generated after VMD decomposition, while only 6 are generated after
    ACMD decomposition in Figure 6 and Figure 7. While the number decreases, the amount
    of effective information of a wavelet increases, reducing the amount of subsequent
    calculations, which highly proves the efficiency and effectiveness of ACMD in
    AE signal decomposition. Figure 6. VMD algorithm decomposition results. Figure
    7. ACMD algorithm decomposition results. 2.7.2. IGWO-XGBoost Performance Test
    To further explore the factors affecting IGWO’s performance regarding multi-strategy
    joint optimization, Hénon mapping, reverse learning strategy and firefly disturbance
    were, respectively, used for optimization comparison experiments, and set three
    optimization policies. They were named IGWO1, IGWO2, and IGWO3. Details are in
    Table 1. Table 1. Improvement strategies of GWO. Here, as shown in Figure 8, we
    selected the Rosenbrock single-peak function, sphere single-peak function, Schwefel
    multipeak function and Rastrigin multipeak function as test functions, respectively.
    Figure 8. Standard test function: (a) sphere function; (b) Rosenbrock function;
    (c) Schewfel function; (d) Rastrigin function. During the test, in order to remove
    errors caused by accidental factors, 50 independent experiments were conducted
    on the 5 optimization algorithms, respectively, and the final results were averaged.
    The quantity size was set to n = 30, and the maximum number of iterations were
    T = 500. Here in IGWO, ε = 8, b1 = 0.6, and b2 = 0.6. In Figure 9, when the sphere
    standard function test is adopted, all four optimization algorithms can complete
    iterative convergence within 200 times and successfully search for the minimum
    value, which also means that compared with the basic GWO algorithm, the three
    improvement strategies cooperate to work together on GWO. The other three optimization
    strategies all fall into local optimality, and the convergence rate decreases
    under different test functions. IGWO2 without the reverse learning strategy fell
    into local optima twice, indicating that the reduction of species diversity would
    cause the optimization algorithm to become caught in local optima. On the other
    hand, it shows that the reverse learning strategy plays a leading role in the
    improvement of IGWO performance, and Hénon mapping and the firefly perturbation
    strategy coordinate convergence speed and the global search ability of the algorithm.
    Figure 9. Different GWO algorithms converge on four standard test functions: (a)
    sphere function; (b) Rosenbrock function; (c) Schewfel function; (d) Rastrigin
    function. IGWO does not fall into local optimality in all test functions, showing
    excellent global search performance and fast convergence, indicating that IGWO’s
    global optimization ability and convergence speed are superior to GWO, IGWO1,
    IGWO2 and IGWO3. 2.7.3. Comparative Analysis of Different Improvement Algorithms
    Based on XGBoost’s low requirements and high performance in solving problems and
    for waveform feature processing, heuristic algorithms such as PSO, ACO, SOA and
    IGWO are used to optimize the extreme gradient boost hyperparameters. XGBoost
    is the baseline model for predicting MC. However, the XGBoost algorithm has too
    many parameters, and the regular terms are constantly adjusted in the optimization
    process, so it is hard to select the optimal parameter value of the heuristic
    optimization algorithm in advance. Using random numbers within the valid range
    of a particular parameter of a heuristic algorithm can better optimize the result.
    First, we initialized the relevant hyperparameters of the XGBoost model. Then
    the swarm sizes were set to 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300. Finally, to further
    verify the prediction performance of these models, multiple indicators of root-mean-square
    error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE),
    and goodness of fit (R2) were employed for the evaluation. In Figure 10, we stipulate
    that the four final algorithms shall be sorted according to the value of the population
    according to the evaluation index, including the evaluation index of the training
    set and the evaluation index of the testing set. The wider the color block in
    the figure, the better the evaluation index. IGWO-XGBoost has the best performance
    in the 6 types of swarms: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300. In particular, when
    the swarm size is 200, the best parameter combination and the optimum performance
    can be achieved. Considering the complex correlation between every decomposed
    waveform and MC, this result is very satisfactory. Therefore, in the subsequent
    field measurement experiments, the total swarm was set to 200. Figure 10. Comparison
    of evaluation indexes for MC prediction algorithms: (a) PSO-XGBoost; (b) ACO-XGBoost;
    (c) SOA-XGBoost; (d) IGWO-XGBoost. 3. Result Five hundred groups of original AE
    waveforms in the same tree were randomly selected, and IGWO after multi-strategy
    joint optimization was used for predictive modeling of AE signals without decomposition,
    VMD decomposition and ACMD decomposition. Figure 11 shows the prediction errors
    of each method. Figure 11. Prediction error distribution diagram using different
    decomposition methods. Compared with the IGWO model, which used the original AE
    signal for prediction without decomposition, VMD-IGWO and ACMD-IGWO reduced the
    prediction error while the number of prediction deviation points also decreased,
    and ACMD-IGWO even reduced by nearly 118.4%. The prediction error distribution
    is concentrated near the origin, so the prediction error is smaller, and the evaluation
    index value is better. The results show that the subsequences after ACMD decomposition
    have a stronger tendency, which is more conducive to improving the prediction
    accuracy. The MC of a standing tree trunk is an important parameter to measure
    the physiological condition of this tree. However, the MC of the trunk of living
    trees changes dynamically in real time. We expect that the IGWO-XGBoost in this
    paper can be used to predict the MC of different tree species with high precision
    and a stable month cycle, which is of positive significance for monitoring the
    physiological state of trees. Samples were collected for 60 s every 1 h and 24
    h a day on the same tree for a month. A total of 43,200 AE waveforms and 4.32
    × 108 sampling points were collected. We have carried out a measurement campaign
    on 4 typical tree species at Nanjing Forestry University (Robinia Pseudoacacia,
    Photinia serrulata, Pinus massoniana and Toona sinensis). The installation method
    of the WASN was as mentioned above: within a three-point line installation on
    the bark surface and Vaseline coupling. Finally, KT-80, a dual-function wood-moisture-measuring
    instrument from KLORTNER Technology, Italy, was used to calibrate the true value
    and predict and analyze the change in moisture content within a month. The four
    algorithms all use the AE waveform of four trees collected in the field, and the
    corresponding sample data set decomposed by ACMD as the training input. The MC
    predicted by different models and the calibrated real MC values of the 4 tree
    species are shown in Figure 12. The evaluation indexes of field results are depicted
    in Table 2. Figure 12. Trunk MC variations of 4 selected trees during 30 days:

    sinensis. Table 2. Results of MC recognition of four algorithms. 4. Discussion
    Accurate MC prediction is an important guarantee for monitoring the physiological
    activities of trees [28]. Changes in wind speed, photosynthetically active radiation,
    soil temperature and humidity have certain effects on tree trunk moisture, so
    it is considered important to add these factors before establishing the model
    in future work [29]. Compared with the traditional methods, which are complicated
    to install and cause irreversible damage to living trees, the multi-strategy joint
    optimization of IGWO-XGBoost proposed in this paper based on ACMD waveform decomposition
    draws the following conclusions: Compared with the traditional VMD method, ACMD
    has a better decomposition effect for time-varying multimode AE signals, which
    can decompose the original AE signals step-by-step into stable and more representational
    subsequence groups. With the number of subsequence groups effectively reduced,
    the working time of the algorithm is shortened, and the prediction accuracy is
    improved. By using Henon chaotic mapping, reverse learning strategy and firefly
    disturbance strategy, GWO was jointly optimized with multiple strategies, which
    enhanced the global search capability of GWO and improved its convergence speed.
    Standard test functions were used to compare and analyze the influence degree
    of these three improved strategies on IGWO. By using multi-strategy joint optimization,
    IGWO optimizes the hyperparameters of XGBoost, and shorter iteration times and
    higher prediction accuracy are obtained compared with PSO, ACO and SOA. Compared
    with the results of commercial MC measuring instruments [30], the proposed diagnostic
    method can stably and effectively characterize the actual MC change of tree trunks
    and has high applicability and accuracy in complex field conditions. Author Contributions

  description: 'In this paper, the regression analysis technique is applied to a large
    water quality dataset for the Sitnica River in Kosovo. It has been done to assess
    the correlation between water quality parameters. The data are generated by a
    wireless sensors network deployed in Sitnica. A regression analysis is applied
    to four water quality parameters: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and electrical
    conductivity. The correlation between each pair of parameters has been assessed
    by using the WEKA software package, which is a popular time-saving tool for data
    analysis in distinct domains. The data are pre-processed to exclude out-of-range
    values and then the assessment of correlation for the pairs of parameters is applied.
    In comparison to other pairs of water quality parameters, the results show that
    dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity correlate particularly closely with
    temperature. Regression equations of these two pairs of parameters may provide
    inferred information on dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity about the
    Sitnica River. Such information may otherwise not be available to resource managers
    in Kosovo. Moreover, due to its easy to use and availability as an open-source
    software, WEKA may aid decision-makers on the management providing almost real-time
    information about surface water quality within the basin. This can be particularly
    useful especially in the case of continuous observation of water quality and a
    huge dataset gathered by using wireless sensors.'

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Delhi, India SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture
    is one of the oldest and most significant practices that humans have engaged in.
    The process of growing crops involves several crucial steps that directly impact
    crop yield and quality. The first stage is soil preparation, which is vital to
    the success of the crop yield. Proper soil preparation involves removing waste,
    breaking up soil clumps, and adding organic matter and fertilizer. The second
    stage is sowing seeds, which requires precision and careful spacing to ensure
    that each plant has enough space, sunlight, and nutrients for healthy growth.
    In the third stage, the utilization of fertilizers becomes crucial as they play
    a vital role in sustaining soil fertility and fostering robust crop development..
    Overuse of fertilizers can negatively impact crop quality, making it important
    for farmers to use them appropriately. The fourth stage is irrigation, which involves
    keeping the soil moist and humid to create ideal growing conditions. Proper irrigation
    practices are essential for healthy crop growth and good yields. The fifth stage
    is weed protection, which involves removing unwanted plants to avoid interference
    with crop yields. The final stage is harvesting, which requires proper equipment,
    tools, and careful labour to avoid damage to crops. Indian farmers face several
    challenges such as rampant use of fertilizers, overwatering, and underwatering,
    which can be mitigated by using AI and IoT tools. The Wireless Sensor Network
    is one such tool that can help farmers monitor soil temperature, moisture, and
    nutrients. Using a decision tree algorithm, farmers can receive guidance on the
    ideal quantities of water and fertilizer to apply to their crops, enabling them
    to make well-informed decisions about irrigation and nutrient management. This
    empowers farmers to make well-informed decisions based on accurate guidance. In
    conclusion, agriculture is a vital practice that requires proper planning and
    execution. The use of technology, such as AI-enabled tools, can help farmers overcome
    challenges and improve their agricultural practices, leading to healthier crops
    and higher yields. SECTION II. Pre-Existing Framework Drone technology has revolutionized
    the way farmers approach agriculture, offering high-quality images, video, and
    data from above. Drones are increasingly used in agriculture for detailed soil
    and field analysis. Multispectral cameras on drones provide high-resolution images
    of crops and soil, allowing farmers to assess crop health and optimize management
    for higher yields and greater efficiency. Drones equipped with spray nozzles can
    accurately apply pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, reducing the risk of
    overuse and minimizing waste. Thermal sensors on drones can optimize irrigation
    and help farmers make more efficient use of water. Hyperspectral cameras can identify
    crop diseases and pests, reducing crop losses and pesticide use. However, the
    high cost and lack of infrastructure and regulatory framework in India are barriers
    to widespread adoption of drone technology. SECTION III. Methodology for Improving
    Agricultural Practices using AI and IoT Tools The agriculture industry is being
    transformed by the advanced technology of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). WSNs
    are wireless networks that do not require any infrastructure and are composed
    of numerous low-cost, battery-powered sensors that can be placed in a farm in
    an ad-hoc manner. These small sensors are competent of gathering critical data,
    like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light intensity, and animal behaviour,
    and transmitting it wirelessly to a central data collection point or base station.
    These sensors are designed to measure and monitor various physical or environmental
    conditions in the farm, like humidity, soil moisture, nutrient levels, temperature,
    and water level. The sensors are strategically placed in different parts of the
    farm and are connected wirelessly to a central gateway device, which collects
    and aggregates the data from the sensors. The data collected from the sensors
    is then transmitted to a cloud-based web server, where it is analysed, processed,
    and stored for further use. The utilization of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
    in agriculture offers various benefits. Firstly, it empowers farmers to remotely
    and accurately monitor their fields in real-time, enabling them to make informed
    decisions on irrigation, fertilization, and other agricultural practices. Secondly,
    WSN enables farmers to optimize the utilization of resources, such as water and
    fertilizer. By monitoring soil moisture and nutrient levels, farmers can supply
    the crops with the appropriate amount of water and nutrients, thereby reducing
    wastage and improving crop yields. Thirdly, the use of WSN reduces farmers'' dependence
    on manual labour and guesswork, saving time, money, and mitigating the risk of
    errors and mistakes. Finally, the application of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    in agriculture plays a crucial role in minimizing the environmental consequences
    of farming. It achieves this by effectively reducing the carbon footprint associated
    with agricultural activities and facilitating the adoption of sustainable farming
    practices. WSN technology is a game-changer for farmers as it provides them with
    a more efficient and cost-effective way of improving farming practices, increasing
    productivity, and meeting the challenges of modern agriculture. As technological
    advancements continue, we can expect to see even more innovative solutions that
    further enhance the benefits of WSN in agriculture. Fig. 1. Crop Management with
    WSN and AI Technology Show All A typical Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) architecture
    consists of three primary components, namely the sensor nodes, the gateway/base
    station, and the back-end server or cloud platform. The sensor nodes, which are
    integral parts of WSN, are compact, cost-effective, and energy-efficient devices
    designed to gather data from the surrounding environment. Each sensor node is
    made up of sensors, a radio transceiver, a microcontroller, and a power source,
    usually a battery. Numerous characteristics, including temperature, humidity,
    light, soil moisture, etc., can be measured by the sensors. The microcontroller
    handles the radio transceiver for communication with other nodes or the base station,
    analyses sensor data, executes algorithms, and manages the microprocessor. The
    gateway or base station, acting as an intermediary between sensor nodes and the
    back-end server or cloud platform, is a more potent device with internet connectivity
    and more substantial battery capacity. It receives data from sensor nodes through
    wireless communication, processes or aggregates the data, and sends it to the
    back-end server. The back-end server or cloud platform is where the gathered data
    from the sensor nodes is processed, stored, and analysed. It is responsible for
    managing the WSN, including device registration, configuration, and firmware updates.
    The server provides a web-based interface to users for data analysis and visualization
    and may offer APIs or interfaces for third-party applications to access the data
    Fig. 2. Flow of Crop Management Show All Wireless protocols such as Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), Zigbee or Wi-Fi are commonly utilized for communication among
    the sensor nodes, gateway, and back-end server in a WSN architecture. Additionally,
    the architecture may employ data security mechanisms like encryption, authentication,
    and access control to safeguard the data from unauthorized access or tampering.
    Decision Tree Algorithm: After collecting data on different environmental parameters
    such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels using a Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN), the collected data is pre-processed, cleaned, and prepared
    for machine learning model training. One commonly used machine learning algorithm
    for predictive tasks in agriculture is the decision tree algorithm. This algorithm
    constructs a decision model encompassing the potential outcomes of decisions,
    encompassing uncertain events and resource expenditures, with the aim of forecasting
    the value of a target variable by considering multiple input variables. Once the
    model is trained, it can suggest the optimal amount of nutrients and water required
    for crops at specific growth stages. The farmer can access this information through
    a mobile application on their Android phone. The decision tree algorithm is a
    valuable tool for agriculture that can assist farmers in making informed decisions
    about crop management by providing precise recommendations based on real-time
    field data. SECTION IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION After gathering and analysing the
    data collected from the field, the farmer will be advised of how to treat their
    crop The results of crop management using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and
    decision tree algorithms can vary depending on various factors such as the crop
    type, environmental conditions, and the accuracy of the data collected from the
    WSN nodes. By providing real-time data on temperature soil moisture, and nutrient
    levels, WSNs can enable more precise irrigation and fertilization practices, leading
    to improved crop yield. WSNs can provide accurate data on the crop''s water and
    nutrient requirements, allowing farmers to optimize resource use and minimize
    waste. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) facilitate automated data collection and
    analysis, thereby diminishing the necessity for manual labour and allowing farmers
    to allocate their attention to other significant tasks. Fig. 3. Data collected
    from sensors Show All By applying decision tree algorithms to the data collected
    from the WSN nodes will help making data-driven decisions regarding crop management
    practices, farmers can mitigate the risk of human error and enhance the overall
    health of their crops. By optimizing resource use and minimizing waste, crop management
    using WSNs and decision tree algorithms can contribute to a more sustainable and
    environmentally friendly agriculture industry. Fig .4. Train Accuracy Show All
    Fig .5. Train Loss Show All SECTION V. Conclusion The combining Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSN) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in crop management has rapidly
    emerged as a promising field with the potential to revolutionize agriculture practices.
    These technologies allow farmers and researchers to collect and analyse data on
    various environmental factors that influence crop growth, such as humidity, temperature,soil
    moisture, and light intensity. The implementation of WSN and AI in crop management
    can provide numerous benefits, including optimized crop yields, reduced energy
    and water consumption, prevention of pest infestations and diseases, and improved
    crop quality. Using machine learning algorithms, like decision trees, clustering
    algorithms, and artificial neural networks, farmers and researchers can make informed
    decisions based on the collected sensor data. WSN and AI technologies offer a
    unique opportunity for precision agriculture, enabling farmers to apply targeted
    interventions in specific areas of the field based on the environmental conditions.
    This approach can lead to more efficient use of resources and improved crop yields.
    The adoption of WSN and AI technologies in crop management can revolutionize agriculture
    by providing real-time data on environmental conditions and enabling data-driven
    decisions. With the ongoing advancements in technology, we can anticipate witnessing
    the emergence of more sophisticated applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and AI technologies in the field of crop management. This progress includes the
    development of advanced algorithms capable of addressing intricate issues effectively.

  description: The oil and gas sector industry is actively embracing the integration
    of remotely monitored and controlled well completions. This technological advancement,
    commonly known as "intelligent completions," has experienced rapid progress in
    recent years, showcasing advantages such as heightened recovery rates and accelerated
    production. Notably, cost savings derived from reduced well interventions offer
    additional returns, particularly for wells characterized by multilateral configurations,
    subsea locations, or unmanned platform setups. The adoption of this technology
    continues to gain momentum due to the proven value demonstrated through field
    installations. The implementation of intelligent completions has become pervasive,
    with around 3000 systems deployed by the conclusion of 2022. With the rapid development
    of the economy and society, as well as the continuous deepening of oilfield development,
    the traditional on-site management model of oilfield personnel for oil-water wells
    has increased the labor costs for enterprises. In response to this, by means of
    a digital intelligent water injection monitoring system driven by Internet of
    Things (IoT), oilfield managers can monitor and control water injection equipment
    anytime and anywhere, realizing convenient management. The remote wireless intelligent
    water injection device mainly consists of an underground intelligent water distributor,
    a surface control unit, and a remote-control system, constituting a wireless visualized
    production control system. This system, through real-time monitoring of individual
    well water injection status and coordination with water injection and production
    data across the entire block, conducts big data analysis to effectively enhance
    reservoir development efficiency. The intelligent water distributor is equipped
    with pressure sensors, temperature sensors, and flow meters, enabling the monitoring
    of subsurface pressure, temperature, and related data. The surface control unit
    acts as the central unit connecting the underground actuator and the computer
    terminal. The wellhead controller assembly collects and transmits data on subsurface
    layer pressure and flow, automatically and intelligently controlling the flow
    of each subsurface layer. The remote-control system is composed of a surface computer
    system, a wireless network or the internet, and a communication network between
    the surface and the underground intelligent water distributor. The surface computer
    system mainly employs piezoelectric pulses and compiled communication waves to
    achieve bidirectional control and communication between the wellhead controller
    and the underground intelligent water distributor. The remote intelligent signal
    wave serves as the medium for information transmission between underground and
    surface levels. It generates a wave through the opening and closing of the nozzle,
    causing pressure variations, forming a single wave, with every 5 waves constituting
    a signal wave group. The wireless intelligent water injection technology was first
    applied on an intelligent unmanned platform in the Bohai Oilfield in 2019. Well
    M located on the platform is a highly-deviated water injector with a depth of
    4419.60 meters. The wellbore deviation for the interval from 968.57 to 4424.00
    meters exceeds 60 degrees, making conventional zonal water injection techniques
    inadequate for meeting the requirements of designated layers. The remote wireless
    intelligent water injection technology ensured a higher water absorption index
    for the first to third layers, achieving the goal of efficient water injection
    development.

    approximately 97.3%, 98.2%, 97.25%, and 97.56%, respectively. The new smart greenhouse
    automation system was also evaluated on four crops with a high turnover rate.
    The system has been found to be highly effective in terms of crop productivity,

  description: The approach of providing safe drinking water is a necessity to protect
    public health. In urban areas, the quality of drinking water has improved significantly
    over the last century because of the advancement and implementation of water treatment
    plants and the distribution of water through an underground web of pipes. The
    same has not been implemented in rural areas due to its dispersiveness, therefore
    causing high capital costs in constructing centralized water treatment plants.
    There is an increase in mortality rate in rural areas often caused by chemicals
    and waterborne infectious pathogens such as enteric and aquatic bacteria, protozoans
    and viruses. These pathogens enter the body when biologically unsafe water without
    treatment is consumed. Apart from that, poor water management in rural areas has
    led to water shortages, inefficient use of water in the agricultural sector, an
    increase in the frequency of floods and drought, and increased water wastage.
    Recent advancements in technologies have provided an opportunity for sustainable
    management of water sources along with some innovative ideas to increase the efficient
    use of water. Smart water system (SWS) provides a solution for all these problems
    by real-time monitoring of data like contaminated water in the water distribution
    system (WDS), pressure, water quality, etc. Smart water management can be done
    on many levels like management in distribution systems (by detection of leakage,
    smart metering, different kinds of leakage assessment techniques, techniques for
    pipeline burst detection, and scheduling the pumps), management during water treatment,
    and smart farming. There is a network of wireless sensors planted underground
    for automated water management whose quality gets affected by moisture in the
    soil. When an increase in the productivity of crops is considered, advanced irrigation
    management technologies are integrated with water management technologies.

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Water scarcity is a growing
    concern in many regions around the world, due to climate change, population growth,
    urbanisation, industrial activities, and intensive agriculture [1], [2]. Addressing
    this issue requires a comprehensive approach that includes water conservation,
    efficient use of resources and investment in new technologies and infrastructure
    to improve water availability and quality. Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT), particularly regarding sensing technologies, robotics, Internet of Things
    (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), are playing
    an increasingly important role in the digitalisation of agricultural systems.
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations denominates this
    role as “Digital Agricultural Revolution” [3], also known as “Agriculture 4.0”
    [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. It is expected that the use of such technologies will
    bring significant advances worldwide, improving the productivity and efficiency
    of agricultural sector, and enhancing the quantity, quality and availability of
    agricultural products. Moreover, it will aid in adapting to climate change, curbing
    food loss and waste, optimising the utilization of natural resources, and ultimately
    leading to a reduced environmental impact in the foreseeable future [8]. The research
    work envisioned here is focused on the design of a methodology for the development
    of a Decision Support System (DSS) oriented to the agricultural sector, and from
    this, the Intelligent Data-Driven Decision Support for Agricultural Systems (ID3SAS)
    methodology is born. This proposed methodology is aligned with the current Agriculture
    4.0 trend and combines sensing technologies, IoT, cloud computing, data analysis
    based on AI methods, and decision-making support to address the issues faced by
    farmers/managers in agricultural environments. For this experiment, a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) was deployed to collect diverse parameters
    such as air temperature, humidity, soil moisture, ultraviolet (UV) radiation,
    infrared (IR) radiation, and visible light using sensors, with actuators (relay
    and water pump) enabling on- field actions. Data are transferred from the sensor
    nodes to a gateway via WiFi using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) communication
    protocol, which is posteriorly sent to a cloud server for storage. Machine Learning
    (ML) models were created for soil moisture and time-to-water estimation. Extra
    Trees Regression (ExtraTR) and AdaBoost provided better performance and, for this
    reason, were the models implemented in the system. For the DSS, we used the Fuzzy
    Logic theory to determine the irrigation time according to the sensors’ measurements
    and weather forecasting. At last, an interactive and user-friendly dashboard was
    created for data visualisation, recommendations, and controlling actions, in real-time.
    Our solution was implemented and tested on tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum
    L.), which will be referred to as the “prototype” in this article. The case study
    consisted of having two crops, where one was watered according to the manufacturer’s
    recommendations (i.e., the traditional method) and the other was watered according
    to the recommendations of the ID3SAS system. At the end of the study, both methods
    were evaluated considering the number and weight of tomatoes, as well as water
    consumption. It is important to note that this prototype offers essential guidance
    for implementing the ID3SAS methodology. Its successful implementation empowers
    farmers/managers with data-driven insights and smart recommendations. This facilitates
    the optimisation of irrigation schedules, efficient resource allocation and improved
    crop management, leading to increased productivity, reduced water consumption
    and minimised environmental impact. As a result, ID3SAS provides guidance for
    the widespread adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. To summarise, the
    contributions of the present article are as follows: We provide a generic methodology
    for the creation of a Smart Agricultural System (SAS) that can be easily adopted
    and adapted by the research community for additional testing and improvement.
    It is practical, affordable, and straightforward to implement; We cover a proper
    method for managing and preserving wireless sensor information through the utilisation
    of cloud computing technology and open-source software solutions; The experiment
    work collects data and takes actions in the field, which can significantly improve
    agricultural productivity, efficiency, and sustainability; The ID3SAS methodology
    supports decision-making in real-time, which is beneficial for farmers to address
    the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. The remainder of the article
    is structured as follows: subsection I-A presents the background of topic under
    study, regarding some technologies of Agriculture 4.0, followed by an overview
    of related work that can be found in current literature, in subsection I-B. Section
    II presents the overall design of ID3SAS methodology and it is divided into three
    subsections: ID3SAS concept in subsection II-A, its goals and requirements in
    subsection II-B and system architecture in subsection II-C. ID3SAS implementation
    in a prototype can be found in Section III. The results of the proposed system
    are presented and discussed in Section IV. In Section V, we conclude the research
    work, its limitations, and remarks regarding future work. A. Background Agriculture
    is a complex and multi-disciplinary field that involves the collaboration of various
    stakeholders (including farmers, managers, producer organizations, suppliers,
    auditors, and researchers) for effective management, decision-making, and the
    successful implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Advances in sensor
    technology have provided an invaluable capability to continuously monitor targeted
    agricultural parameters, while simultaneously, robotics has significantly enhanced
    the automation of farming procedures. Moreover, the rise of affordable and accessible
    computing power has fostered the creation of sophisticated decision support tools,
    which can substantially assist in the realm of improved agriculture management,
    leveraging data science, Big Data, and ML-based approaches. In this regard, the
    comprehensive exploration and analysis of Agriculture 4.0’s emerging trends and
    core technologies were meticulously documented in the research conducted by [8].
    Considering the scientific insights presented in this article, it is appropriate
    to briefly introduce the trends that follow. Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks:
    In recent years, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and WSAN have been widely used
    in numerous agricultural applications to improve traditional farming methods.
    Three fundamental tasks are carried out by sensor networks: sensing, communication,
    and computation. The difference between WSN and WSAN is that the latter includes
    an additional element: an actuator. This can be any physical device (such as lamps,
    fans, valves, or water pumps) that interacts with the environment. These networks
    are distributed arrangements of several sensors and actuators “nodes” interconnected
    by wireless links. Internet of Things: Conceptually, IoT refers to the capacity
    to connect physical and digital “things” with standard and interoperable communication
    protocols [9]. Since agricultural activities need to be continuously monitored
    and managed, agriculture is a perfect candidate for the deployment of IoT technologies.
    A comparison of the most used wireless communication protocols is presented in
    [8], featuring the basic characteristics of Bluetooth, Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN), Near Field Communication (NFC), Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID),
    Sigfox, WiFi, Zigbee, and mobile communications. Within their analysis, the authors
    concluded that Sigfox, ZigBee, and LoRaWAN exhibit the highest suitability for
    IoT-based agricultural applications, due to their energy-efficient nature, cost-effectiveness,
    and superior communication range. Cloud computing: Nowadays, cloud computing has
    attracted significant interest within the agricultural sector as according to
    [9], it provides (a) reasonably priced data storage services that significantly
    lowers storage costs for agricultural enterprises; (b) intelligent large-scale
    computer systems that convert these agricultural data into knowledge; and (c)
    a secure platform for the development of diverse agricultural IoT applications.
    Data Analytics, Big Data, and Machine Learning: As stated in the research conducted
    by [10], data analytics refers to the application of computer systems to analyse
    large datasets to support decision-making. This field is highly interdisciplinary,
    incorporating elements from various scientific disciplines such as statistics,
    ML, pattern recognition, system theory, operations research, and AI. The phases
    of data analysis, as outlined by [10], include (a) data preparation (planning,
    data collection, feature generation, and data selection); (b) preprocessing (cleaning,
    filtering, completion, correction, standardisation, and transformation); (c) analysis
    (visualisation, correlation, regression, forecasting, classification, and clustering);
    (d) postprocessing (interpretation, documentation, and evaluation). Data analytics,
    through Big Data, AI/ ML algorithms or statistics, has been identified as one
    of the main drivers behind the implementation of Agriculture 4.0 [8]. On the one
    hand, Big Data is defined as datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical
    database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyse [11]. Generally,
    Big Data is combined with the term “5V”, representing its five dimensions [12]:
    (a) volume, (b) velocity, (c) variety, (d) value, and (e) veracity. On the other
    hand, ML can be described as a computer program or system that possesses the ability
    to learn specific tasks without explicit programming [13]. It is a process that
    involves computers or machines to make decisions or recommendations by leveraging
    multiple data inputs. In a review made by [14] regarding ML applications in agriculture,
    the authors concluded that 61% of the analysed articles used ML methods for crop
    management (22% disease detection, 20% yield prediction, 8% weed detection, 8%
    crop quality, and 3% species recognition), 19% for livestock management (12% livestock
    production and 7% animal welfare), 10% for soil management and 10% from water
    management. Decision Support System: The definition of DSS is not consensual in
    the literature. In the present document, we will use the definition provided by
    [8]: software mechanism which aids an end-user to easily and quickly leverage
    complex data to improve decision-making processes. This involves transforming
    both raw data and the results obtained from analytics tools into actionable knowledge,
    presented through a user interface in a comprehensible manner. There are several
    ways to classify a DSS, depending on the type to be implemented, the design, and
    the application [15]. B. Related Work Significant work has been invested in studying
    the many aspects of Agriculture 4.0 during the past few years. An automatic DSS
    was proposed in [16] for managing irrigation in agriculture by utilising several
    autonomous nodes to measure soil and climatic parameters and estimate weekly irrigation
    needs. ML techniques are used for the reasoning engine of the system. A smart
    platform was proposed in [17], which aims to assist farmers in saving resources
    and enhancing farming productivity. This platform combines a WSN and drone imagery
    to gather data, allowing the tracking of soil irrigation and pest detection. The
    gathered data is transmitted to the cloud, where a rule-based system deduces the
    appropriate action based on it. In [18] the authors proposed a low-cost IoT system
    based on a WSN for agricultural applications. This system consists of sensor nodes
    (Arduino-based with a WiFi module and various sensors), a gateway (a Raspberry
    Pi including Mosquitto and Node-RED), and a user interface. The data are sent
    to the gateway via WiFi, using the MQTT protocol and posteriorly transferred to
    the cloud service (IBM Bluemix) for storage and visualisation in real-time. Reference
    [19] developed an autonomous and solar-powered IoT-based system for monitoring
    nitrate concentration in water bodies (lakes, streams, rivers). The collected
    data from sensor nodes are transferred to a gateway which, in its turn, sends
    data to a cloud server for storage. WiFi and LoRa protocols are used for data
    communication. The LoRa protocol was shown to be more efficient in terms of overall
    energy consumption, in addition to allowing data to travel larger distances compared
    to the standard WiFi protocol. Similarly, [20] developed an IoT-based sensor node
    to monitor a greenhouse. This node is composed of a microcontroller (ESP8266 NodeMCU),
    various sensors (air temperature and humidity, capacitive soil moisture, soil
    temperature, and light intensity), and two power units (lithium-ion batteries
    and a solar panel). The microcontroller is responsible for data collection and
    transmission to the gateway. Both Mosquitto and Node-RED are used in this implementation.
    In [21] an IoT-based system was proposed for smart agricultural applications.
    The authors designed a simulation environment (using Riverbed Modeler) with various
    sensors (e.g., temperature, rain, light, wind, pH, acoustic, light intensity,
    humidity, location, and chemical properties) that collect specific cornfield data
    and send them to a coordinator node. This node is responsible for communicating
    with a drone that, in its turn, sends data to the gateway. Node-RED gathers data
    from the Riverbed Modeler and then stores it in InfluxDB database. Visual interfaces
    and graphs are provided by Grafana. Reference [22] proposed an IoT sensor simulator,
    using Node-RED, IBM Bluemix, and IBM IoT sensors, and was designed specifically
    for lettuce plants grown in greenhouses or indoor agricultural environments. The
    culmination of these research efforts has played an important role in propelling
    the agricultural sector forward through innovative and creative approaches, consistently
    prioritising sustainability. These efforts encompass a diverse range of domains,
    including irrigation management, resource conservation, pest detection, water
    quality monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Employing cutting-edge technologies
    such as IoT, ML, cloud computing, and drone imagery, these initiatives seek to
    improve agricultural efficiency, productivity and resource optimisation. However,
    these works also demonstrate general limitations including reliance on rule-based
    reasoning, potential lack of adaptability to dynamic conditions, limited integration
    of advanced data analytics and ML, and a focus on specific aspects of agricultural
    management rather than comprehensive DSS. In light of this, the proposed methodology,
    ID3SAS, bridges these gaps by combining sensing technology, advanced data analytics,
    and fuzzy logic reasoning within a scalable and cloud-based DSS. By addressing
    limitations seen in prior works and providing guidelines for seamless integration,
    ID3SAS presents a promising unified approach for shaping the future of agriculture–
    a vision that harmonises intelligence, sustainability, and global societal demands.
    SECTION II. The Id3sas Methodology In this section, an overview of the design
    and development of the proposed methodology - ID3SAS - is provided. It begins
    with a description of the methodology’s concept, its main goals, and requirements.
    The methodology is then introduced, along with an overview of its individual structural
    components. A. Concept ID3SAS seeks to provide researchers, and developers who
    want to build a SAS with a set of essential requirements, specifications, and
    guidelines, distilled from a comprehensive study of the latest advancements in
    the field [8]. Within the context of this research work, a SAS is a system that
    combines different technologies (IoT, sensors, actuators, AI, and cloud computing,
    among others) in order to give the possibility to farmers and managers to have
    control over the agricultural processes and make better and quicker decisions.
    The following services are accessible through this system: Monitoring: Several
    parameters are measured by sensors that are strategically placed in the agricultural
    field and/or greenhouses (sometimes referred to as the “physical environment”
    in this document) and transferred, using proper communication protocols, to a
    local-based or cloud-based service for storage and further processing and analysis.
    External sources could also provide valuable data, which could include forecasting
    services (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API [23]) or satellite Earth observation services
    (e.g., Copernicus-related services [24]). Data transmission, storage, and processing:
    IoT technology is in charge of sending the collected data from the physical environment
    to a gateway server, which can send to a local-based or cloud-based server for
    storage and further processing. Data analysis and predictions: AI-based methods,
    particularly in the facet of ML, can identify complex patterns, trends, and relationships
    in the multidimensional, heterogeneous data, making accurate predictions and providing
    a strong foundation for improved decision-making and operations management. Decision
    support: A DSS seeks to assist managers and farmers in making quicker and more
    effective decisions to facilitate the planning of their agricultural activities.
    Control: It may be necessary to act on the physical environment (automatically
    or under user control). For instance, activating and controlling actuators to
    change the environment or the condition of the process in a predefined manner.
    A six-level model of automated decision-making based on AI is described in [25]
    and [26], starting from level 0 (no autonomy) until level 5 (full autonomy). The
    successful development and implementation of a SAS in the agricultural sector
    envisions to assist in sustainable development, by providing social, economic,
    and environmental benefits. These benefits could include improving crop productivity
    and farm profitability, optimising the management of farm inputs (e.g., irrigation
    water), and improving both storage and marketing activities thus ensuring food
    security. B. Goals and Requirements Goals have long been recognised as essential
    elements involved in the Requirements Engineering process as they provide the
    rationale for requirements [27], [28]. Considering this, Table 1 presents the
    goals that have been defined for ID3SAS. The description of these goals can be
    found in Table 7 (Appendix). These goals have as a foundation the review made
    by the authors in [8]. TABLE 1 ID3SAS goals These goals can be seen as general
    key aspects to advance the agricultural sector towards the digitalisation and
    empowerment of a SAS with AI, from the integration of multiple sensor nodes to
    the adoption of data-driven and automated processes. In addition, it is important
    to consider a generic approach that can be adopted across diverse agricultural
    scenarios. Furthermore, facilitating the utilisation of technology involves providing
    practical solutions that are user-friendly and accessible for farmers to embrace
    technological advancements in agriculture. A requirement describes the capabilities
    or characteristics that a product or service must provide to deal with a specific
    problem. According to [29], the requirements can be categorised in: (1) Functional
    Requirement (FR): ” 1. statement that identifies what results a product or process
    shall produce. 2. requirement that specifies a function that a system or system
    component shall perform ”, and (2) Non-Functional Requirement (NFR): ” 1. software
    requirement that describes not what the software will do but how the software
    will do it ”. Table 2 lists both FR and NFR defined for the ID3SAS. The description
    of each requirement can be found in Table 8 (presented in Appendix). TABLE 2 List
    of Functional and Non-Functional Requirements for ID3SAS However, it is important
    to remember that these requirements should be seen as a foundation for the design
    and implementation of a SAS within the scope of Agriculture 4.0. Depending on
    the case study at hand, requirements will have to be refined or new requirements
    will have to be adapted, as long as they meet the particular needs and desires
    of the stakeholders. C. Methodology ID3SAS is an integrative methodology that
    formalises the steps that should be taken to design and implement a SAS in the
    context of Agriculture 4.0. It proposes valuable tools for the agricultural sector
    and is designed with generic applicability in mind, in order to be used in different
    types of crops, fields, and environmental conditions, while still offering a wide
    variety of features and high usability. Figure 1 illustrates the ID3SAS methodology,
    its core components, data flow, and phases. This methodology has as a foundation
    the conceptual cloud-based IoT architecture proposed by [8]. This architecture
    consists of four layers (from bottom to top: physical, communication, service,
    and application layers). Adapting this architecture to ID3SAS, we have: Physical
    layer: Responsible for monitoring and actuating functions, where data are collected
    from the IoT devices and actions are made in the field through actuators. It includes
    the Sensing and Control components. Communication layer: Where adequate network
    allows the data communication between layers. It includes the Gateway component.
    Service layer: Responsible for data storage, processing, and analysis. It includes
    the Database, Data Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and Decision Support components.
    Application layer: For the access of agricultural information and control actions.
    It includes the Human-Machine Interface component. Other sources (optional): External
    dataset(s). It concludes the External Source component. FIGURE 1. The ID3SAS Methodology,
    composed of nine core components: External Source, Sensing, Control, Gateway,
    Cloud-based Data Storage, Data Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Decision Support
    and Human-Machine Interface. Show All This methodology is also divided into seven
    stages representing the data flow, starting from: Data Acquisition: The first
    step of ID3SAS methodology and, as the name implies, is where data are collected.
    In this phase we have (a) Sensing component, responsible for acquiring the data
    directly from the sensors or other devices in the Physical Layer; and (b) External
    Source component (optional), an external data source could be any source in the
    Internet that does not belong to the local network (e.g., weather forecasting
    services). The combination of different types of sensing devices can produce a
    more global informative dataset. Data Transmission: After collecting the desired
    data, it is necessary to transfer it to the next phase so that it can be stored,
    processed, and analysed. The physical devices (sensors and/or actuators) can be
    connected to a Gateway component that plays a role as the data forwarder between
    different networks. The choice of the most adequate communication protocol fully
    depends on the requirements of the system to be designed and implemented, as well
    as economic, accessibility, and capacity factors. Data Storage: Cloud computing
    (e.g., Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) [30] and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) [31])
    is very convenient for applications that use a huge amount of data, as it provides
    inexpensive data storage services for text, image, video, and other formats, which
    considerably reduces storage costs for agricultural enterprises. As so, a Cloud-based
    Data Storage component can be found in this phase, where data from the Sensing
    component and external sources are virtually stored in a cloud-based server for
    further processing and analysis. Data Processing and Analysis: Sometimes, data
    collected from sensors and/or external sources are not ready to be directly used
    for decision-making processes. Facing this, the Data Processing component is responsible
    for transforming these “raw” data and preparing it for the next phase. Additionally,
    the Artificial Intelligence component can be used for advanced data analysis and
    generating predictions. Reasoning: In this phase, the Decision Support component
    receives inputs from the previous phases and calculates and deducts watering suggestions
    (e.g., precise time for watering the fields). Data transformation is done by reasoning
    processes, i.e., the component contains a Rule base and Fact base that enables
    the system to infer new data and make decisions. This system uses log data of
    the system, combined with AI-based techniques and agricultural expertise to create
    new appropriate rules and thus enrich the Rule base. User Interaction: Users can
    easily visualise the information from the physical environment by requesting data
    from the Sensing component and/or External Source component. To this end, an Human-Machine
    Interface (HMI) should be designed to support the processes of the entire SAS.
    According to the user’s demands, the output of this phase could be data/information
    for monitoring purposes, and/or physical action realised by an actuator. After
    the data leave the Human-Machine Interface component, there are two possible paths,
    as it is necessary to understand if there is a need to act in the physical layer:
    Does the agro-system “need intervention?”. If NO, the data flow ends with the
    HMI component; If YES, the user sends the final command to the actuators in the
    Control component. Actuation: In this phase, we find the Control component, which
    is responsible for controlling the actuators that are placed in the physical environment.
    Therefore, the level of autonomy of the system needs to be defined. Additionally,
    it is possible to see in Figure 1 two input points - Start - indicating that the
    system can acquire data from both internal (sensor) and external sources. There
    are also two output points - End - indicating whether the system is a Monitoring
    system (for monitoring purposes) or a Control system (applicable when the physical
    environment needs actuator intervention). SECTION III. Id3sas Implementation The
    ID3SAS methodology was deployed and tested in a lab scenario: a prototype consisting
    of tomato plants, located inside the UNINOVA room, at NOVA School of Science and
    Technology (NOVA-SST), Caparica, Portugal. The idea of this case study was to
    have separate tomato plants (of the same batch), where one was watered every three
    days according to the manufacturer’s specification, and the other is watered according
    to the recommendations of the ID3SAS system (Figure 2). It is worth highlighting
    that the goal of this prototype is to provide a reference for implementing the
    ID3SAS methodology. As such, only two plants were used since the focus was the
    functionality testing of the reference implementation. Regardless, it possesses
    the flexibility to be customised and scaled to accommodate larger agricultural
    scenarios. FIGURE 2. ID3SAS case study: example of two tomato pots (from the same
    batch), one of which received irrigation recommendations according to the manufacturer
    (‘control plant’) and the other received irrigation recommendations from the ID3SAS
    system (‘test plant’). Show All The material used for this case study is listed
    below: Plants: Tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum L.), inserted in plots with
    a surface area of 0,04 m 2 . Hardware: (a) two microcontrollers (ESP32 NodeMCU
    and ESP8266 NodeMCU); (b) one single-board computer (Raspberry Pi 3 Model B);
    (c) six sensors (two air temperature and humidity sensors DHT11, two sunlight
    sensors SI1145, two capacitive soil moisture sensors); (d) two actuators (one
    2-channel SPDT Relay, one submersible water pump with a flow rate of, approx.,
    120L/hour ); (e) Bresser Weather Station 7-in-1 Sensor; (f) Other relevant components
    (external power supply, breadboards, jumper cables, water tank). Software: (a)
    Arduino IDE; (b) Docker; (c) Eclipse Mosquitto; (d) Node-RED; (e) MongoDB Atlas;
    (f) Jupyter Notebook; (g) Weather API - OpenWeatherMap. A. Sensing Component In
    this prototype, the Sensing component consists of two sensor nodes, namely Sensor
    Node 1 and Sensor Node 2. Both of these nodes are equipped with a set of sensors,
    including the SHT31, SI1145, and capacitive soil moisture sensors. The primary
    distinction lies in the microcontroller employed by each node, as Sensor Node
    1 integrates the ESP32 NodeMCU, whereas Sensor Node 2 utilises the ESP8266 NodeMCU.
    Figure 3 shows the hardware structure for Sensor and Actuator Node 1. In both
    sensor nodes, the microcontroller is responsible for sending the collected data
    from sensors to the Gateway component (subsection III-C) via WiFi using MQTT protocol.
    The SHT31 (air temperature and humidity) and SI1145 (sunlight) sensors are calibrated
    based on the weather station readings. The soil moisture sensor is calibrated
    by correlating the values when the sensor is placed in the air and when it is
    immersed in water. Data are collected with 1 hour sampling time. FIGURE 3. ESP32
    NodeMCU connected to sensors (SHT31, SI1145, capacitive soil moisture), actuators
    (2-channel relay, water pump), and an external power supply. Show All B. External
    Source Component The External Source component was designed to correlate the parameters
    obtained by the physical sensors and by external sources (such as global and local
    weather stations, satellites, and radars). The developed External Source component
    relies upon the OpenWeatherMap API. This Application Programming Interface (API)
    is useful for retrieving both current and forecasted weather data (up to a duration
    of 5 days) for any given location across the globe. Subsequently, this functionality
    will prove valuable for the Decision Support component (subsection III-G), as
    it will require consideration of significant indicators such as precipitation
    patterns, including current and forecasted rainfall within the upcoming hours.
    Based on these indicators, the ID3SAS system will make informed decisions regarding
    the watering or non-watering of plants. C. Gateway Component The Gateway component
    is responsible for distributing data from the physical layer and from external
    sources to other components of the methodology. The communication is carried out
    using MQTT protocol (over WiFi network) through tools like Mosquitto and Node-RED,
    which serve as a communicator and integrator, respectively. MQTT is a suitable
    solution for this prototyping experiment, as it provides a simple and lightweight
    Publisher-Subscriber architecture that fits well within the scope of such IoT
    solutions. For monitoring purposes, the WSAN functions as a Publisher, while Node-RED
    assumes the role of a Subscriber. Conversely, in terms of control, Node-RED acts
    as a Publisher, while the WSAN as a Subscriber. It is important to acknowledge
    that, despite the previous mention of Sigfox, ZigBee, and LoRa as the most suitable
    wireless communication protocols for IoT-based agricultural applications, this
    article employed WiFi for the developed case study. This choice was made due to
    the availability of ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers equipped with built-in
    WiFi modules, which were readily accessible for use in the experiment. In Figure
    4 the flow was configured to get data from the Sensor Node 1 via MQTT and store
    it in the cloud database, using MongoDB Atlas. It also provides functionality
    to trigger sensor data retrieval, send commands to the ESP32, and manually refresh
    the sensors. The same logic was used to configure Sensor Node 2. FIGURE 4. Node-RED
    flow configured to get data from the Sensor Node 1 (publisher) via MQTT to the
    Node-RED (subscriber) and store them in the MongoDB Atlas database. The nodes
    used are: (1a,b,c,d,e,f) MQTT in, (2) Join, (3a,b) Function, (4) Debug, (5) Mongodb
    out, (6) Split, (7) Switch, (8a,b,c,d,e,f) Link out, (9) Inject, (10a,b) MQTT
    out and (11) UI Button node. Show All D. Database Component The selected database
    for this experiment is MongoDB Atlas,1 a cloud-based Not Only-Structured Query
    Language (NoSQL) database solution provided by MongoDB. It was chosen due to its
    reliability, scalability, and security features, making it an ideal choice for
    implementing the ID3SAS system. The deployment of Database component was facilitated
    using Node-RED, by installing the “node-red-node-mongodb” package [32]. This package
    includes three nodes: Mongodb, Mongodb in, and Mongodb out, which enable the seamless
    storage and retrieval of data in/from a MongoDB instance (Figure 4). E. Data Processing
    Component The Data Processing component is crucial to clean, transform, and prepare
    the data for various purposes, such as visualisation or for training AI-based
    models. Figure 5 shows the processes of Artificial Intelligence and data pre-processing.
    The pre-processing stage was made using the Python language within Jupyter Notebook
    and implemented in Node-RED. It is important to note that specific pre-processing
    steps and techniques may vary depending on the characteristics of the data and
    the requirements of the intended ML models. FIGURE 5. ID3SAS Artificial Intelligence
    process and data pre-processing subprocess. Show All 1) Feature Engineering Feature
    Engineering was an important step in this process in order to improve the performance
    and interpretability of ML models. This involved selecting relevant features,
    eliminating redundancy, and creating new informative features derived from existing
    ones. These efforts aimed to provide additional information to the models, thereby
    enhancing their overall effectiveness. Table 3 provides an example of Feature
    Engineering applied in the prototype. In this example, the dataset was transformed
    to enable auto-regression modelling, such that a model can be built using the
    past recent values (lags) of a time series as explanatory variables (input), to
    predict future observations (output). As so, two engineered features were created
    - “Soil Moisture (t-1)” and “Soil Moisture (t+1)”. These new features are derived
    from the original “Soil Moisture” input feature and represent the soil moisture
    values (from sensors) at the previous and subsequent times, respectively. By introducing
    these engineered features, the ML model can capture temporal dependencies and
    patterns in the data that might be useful for predicting future soil moisture
    levels. The same logic was used for the parameters “AirTemp”, “AirHum”, “UVLight”,
    “VisibleLight” and “IRLight”. TABLE 3 Example of Feature Engineering used in the
    data pre-processing process 2) Handle Missing Values and Outliers Missing values
    were handled appropriately using Pandas package.2 To remove the outliers, the
    techniques Z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR) were used. 3) Standardisation
    and Normalisation Standardisation and normalisation [33] are two common techniques
    used in data pre-processing to transform the features of a dataset in preparation
    for creating ML models. Standardisation adjusts features to have zero mean and
    unit variance, while normalisation scales features to a specific range, typically
    between 0 and 1. F. Artificial Intelligence Component The process of creating
    predictive models using ML for regression tasks typically involves several key
    steps: data preparation, data splitting, model selection, training, evaluation,
    and fine-tuning. Figure 5 illustrates the steps of ID3SAS AI process: Data split:
    the dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, typically with a split
    of around 70-80% for training and 20-30% for testing; Model selection: the choice
    of regression models [33] includes linear regression, decision trees, random forests,
    etc.; Model training: the selected model is trained using the training data; Model
    evaluation: the trained model is assessed in terms of performance using the test
    dataset. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared
    Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or () are commonly used; Fine-tuning:
    if the model’s performance is unsatisfactory, it is necessary to refine or fine-tune
    the model to enhance its performance. Techniques such as Grid Search Cross Validation
    (GridSearchCV) [33] can be used to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
    1) Model Selection, Training and Evaluation Five regression algorithms were selected
    to predict the soil moisture and the time-to-water, namely: Random Forest, ExtraTR,
    Gradient Boosting Regression (GradientBR), and AdaBoost (with Decision Tree) [33].
    The following features were passed to the model: Inputs (from sensors): “AirTemp”,
    “AirHum”, “SoilMoisture”, “UVLight”, “VisibleLight” and “IRLight”. Inputs (from
    Feature Engineering): “AirTemp(t- n )”, “AirHum(t- n )”, “SoilMoisture(t- n )”,
    “UVLight(t- n )”, “VisibleLight(t- n )” and “IRLight(t- n )”, where n is the hour
    of monitoring. Outputs: “SoilMoisture(t+ n )” (estimates soil moisture value after
    n hours) and “TimeToWater” (estimates the number of hours remaining until it is
    necessary to water the plants again). Table 4 compares the selected models according
    to their evaluation metrics - RMSE and (equations 1 and 2, respectively). These
    metrics were used to assess the accuracy and performance of the predictive models:
    RMSE R 2 = 1 n ∑ i=1 n ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − √ =1− ∑ n i=1
    ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ¯ ) 2 (1) (2) View Source where, n represents
    the number of data points, yi the observed values, y ^ i the predicted values,
    and y ¯ the mean of the observed values. The two best models were selected for
    optimisation using GridSearchCV [33]. TABLE 4 Performance evaluation (RMSE and
    R 2 ) of the predictive models for “SoilMoisture(t+ n )” and “TimeToWater” estimations
    2) Deployment The Artificial Intelligence component was deployed in Node-RED.
    Thus, five Predictor nodes were created, namely: “AdaBoost_SoilMoisture_t+1”,
    “AdaBoost_SoilMoisture_ t +12”, “AdaBoost_SoilMoisture_ t+24”, “ExtraTR_ SoilMoisture_t+6”
    and “ExtraTR_ Timetowater”. These models were chosen according to Table 4. G.
    Decision Support Component The Decision Support component aims to aid managers
    and farmers in expediting and enhancing the decision-making process, thereby facilitating
    the strategic planning of their agricultural endeavors. Figure 6 illustrates its
    process. The first step is to retrieve the current data (air temperature and humidity,
    soil moisture, UV, visible light and infrared light) from sensors (Sensing component,
    subsection III-A). If the soil moisture value is higher than the threshold (in
    this case study the limit value is 60%), then the system does not take actions.
    On the other hand, if the value is lower, then the system checks the weather forecasting
    (External Source component, subsection III-B). If it is expected to rain in the
    next 6 hours, the system does not irrigate the plants. Otherwise, if it is not
    expected to rain, the Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) calculates the irrigation time
    in accordance with data retrieved from the sensors. We used Fuzzy Logic to determinate
    irrigation time, as it is useful to handle uncertain and imprecise inputs rather
    than relying on binary classifications (e.g., soil moisture is “dry” or “not dry”),
    allowing for more accurate and flexible irrigation scheduling. FIGURE 6. ID3SAS
    Decision Support process. Show All 1) Defining Parameters The crop’s water needs
    are influenced by weather parameters. Table 5 shows the general relation between
    tomato water needs and air temperature and humidity, cloudiness, UV index [34],
    and wind speed. It is important to note that this Table provides a general indication
    of the relations between the crop water needs and climatic factors, as the actual
    water needs required may vary based on the crop type, soil type, and other environmental
    factors. TABLE 5 General relation between crop water needs and climatic factors
    (air temperature and humidity, cloudiness, UV index, and wind speed). “+”, “++”,
    “– ” and “– – ” represent strong, very strong, weak, and very weak relations,
    respectively. Information based on [35] and [36] for tomato plants From Table
    5, it is possible to take into consideration the following general principles:
    Air temperature: higher temperatures increase water evaporation, leading to greater
    water requirements for plants; Air humidity: lower humidity levels enhance water
    evaporation, necessitating more water for plants in low humidity conditions; Cloudiness:
    clear sky conditions result in elevated evaporation rates and higher water needs,
    while cloudy conditions reduce evaporation and decrease water requirements; UV
    Index: higher UV radiation levels stimulate increased evaporation and transpiration
    in plants, increasing their water needs; Wind speed: strong winds accelerate evaporation
    and can dry out plants, requiring additional irrigation to compensate for the
    enhanced water loss. In this article, the water crop needs are translated to “Irrigation
    Time”, and so was considered the output of the FLS. It has four subparameters,
    namely: “Short” (2 secs), “Medium-short” (3 secs), “Medium-long” (4 secs), and
    “Long” (5 secs). Remembering that the submersible water pump used has a flow rate
    of 120 L/hour (approx.), it implies that the pump irrigates 33.3 mL/second (approx.)
    of water. 2) Fuzzy Sets and Membership Functions The FLS sets and their associated
    membership functions are represented in Figure 7. All three inputs “Air Temperature”,
    “Air Humidity” and “UV Index” and the output “Irrigation Time” have four fuzzy
    sets. The “Cloudiness” and “Wind speed” parameters were not considered, as the
    experiment was performed inside a room. FIGURE 7. Membership functions of Fuzzy
    Logic System: (a) Air Temperature (fuzzy sets: ‘very_cold’, ‘cold’, ‘normal’ and
    ‘hot’), (b) Air Humidity (fuzzy sets: ‘low’, ‘medium_low’, ‘medium_high’ and ‘high’),
    (c) UV Index (fuzzy sets: ‘low’, ‘moderate’, ‘high’ and ‘very_high’) and (d) Irrigation
    Time (fuzzy sets: ‘short’, ‘medium-short’, ‘medium-long’ and ‘long’). Show All
    3) Fuzzy Rules Given the fuzzy sets, there are 64 possible rules that can be generated
    based on Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System [37]. These rules were described using
    the “IF - THEN” condition. Examples: Rule 1: “IF Air Temperature is Very Cold
    AND Air Humidity is Low AND UV Index is Low THEN Irrigation Time is Short”; Rule
    2: “IF Air Temperature is Normal AND Air Humidity is Medium-high AND UV Index
    is High THEN Irrigation Time is Medium-Long”; Rule 3: “IF Air Temperature is Hot
    AND Air Humidity is Low AND UV Index is Low THEN Irrigation Time is Long”. These
    rules were decided based on Table 5 and the professional knowledge of the authors
    of this article. 4) Deployment The Decision Support component was deployed using
    Node-RED. As illustrated in Figure 6, the first step is to set the soil moisture
    value. In this case study, the value is 60%. The second step is to retrieve information
    from the External Source component (subsection III-B), where it is possible to
    understand if it is predicted to rain in the next few hours. However, as the experiment
    was performed indoors, this functionality was not considered for the recommendations.
    The result of this process is the “Irrigation Time”, which maps it to the corresponding
    irrigation label: “Short” (2 secs), “Medium-short” (3 secs), “Medium-long” (4
    secs) or “Long” (5 secs). These outputs will subsequently serve the purpose of
    controlling the duration of the water pump’s operation (subsection III-H), thereby
    regulating the amount of water utilised for watering the respective plant. H.
    Control Component The Control component of the prototype consists of one Actuator
    Node, composed of a microcontroller (ESP32 NodeMCU), a relay (2-channel SPDT Relay),
    and an actuator (submersible water pump) (Figure 3). The relay is used to control
    the water pump. Given that the ESP32/ESP8266 was not sufficient to power both
    the sensors and the water pump, an external power supply was incorporated into
    the system. Depending on the system requirements, the actuators can be controlled
    in two ways: manually or automatically. Figure 8 illustrates the Control component
    process. The outputs generated by the FLS regulate the duration of the water pump’s
    operation, thereby directly controlling the quantity of water utilised for the
    irrigation processes. FIGURE 8. ID3SAS Control process. Show All I. Human-Machine
    Interface Component The ID3SAS dashboard has six tabs offering various features:
    Home tab: Provides real-time data visualisation from sensors, actuators, and weather.
    It also offers recommendations based on the data. (Figure 9). Weather forecasting
    tab: Displays weather forecasts for up to 5 days, using OpenWeatherMap’s API.
    Plant’s Info tab: Contains a dataset with information on various plants, including
    vegetables (beetroot, broccoli, carrot, cucumber, eggplant, garlic, green pea,
    lettuce, onion, pepper, potato, and sweet potato) and fruits (apple, lemon, melon,
    strawberry, tomato, and watermelon). (Figure 10). Historical Data tab: Stores
    weekly data collected from sensors. Predictions tab: Stores weekly data generated
    by predictive ML models. Files tab: Enables users to download data from the database
    (specifically, MongoDB Atlas) in.csv format. FIGURE 9. ID3SAS Human-Machine Interface

    Historical Data, Predictions, and Files. Show All FIGURE 10. ID3SAS Human-Machine
    Interface (HMI) dashboard: Plant’s Info tab. Show All The user-friendly dashboard
    provided an intuitive interface that allowed users to access real-time data and
    information effortlessly. Moreover, predictions and recommendations are visualised
    in the dashboard, and were based on the analysis of historical data, current conditions,
    and crop-specific requirements. By leveraging this intelligent guidance, users
    could optimise resource allocation, mitigate risks, and maximise crop yield. Beyond
    data visualisation and recommendations, the dashboard also facilitated control
    actions. Users can remotely monitor and adjust irrigation systems, activate or
    deactivate equipment, and implement automated processes for timely interventions.
    SECTION IV. Results and Discussion A. Goals and Requirements The current article
    highlights the implementation of ID3SAS methodology in a laboratory scenario (i.e.,
    the prototype). The aim is to assess the functionality and efficacy of the methodology
    and if it successfully achieves the initially proposed goals (Table 1) and fulfills
    the established requirements (Table 2). Table 6 provides information on the extent
    to which the ID3SAS prototype meets the intended goals and satisfies both FR and
    NFR. TABLE 6 Goals and (functional and non-functional) requirements validation
    for ID3SAS implementation in the prototype While the authors duly recognise the
    importance of plant physiology, crop production, and water consumption in irrigation
    processes, it asserts that, within the scope of this study, the primary focus
    is placed on evaluating the performance of the ID3SAS methodology itself. According
    to this Table, all goals were successfully accomplished for the prototype, with
    the exception of goal 7 - Achieve robustness to dynamic environmental conditions.
    The outcome can be attributed to the controlled laboratory setting in which the
    experiment was conducted, where dynamic environmental factors such as rainfall
    and wind were absent. Consequently, the corresponding requirement NFR-10, which
    relates to robustness, could not be fulfilled. In order to address this, the acquisition
    of more resilient and outdoor-ready hardware, including sensors and actuators,
    will be necessary. The authors are fully aware of this and have plans to incorporate
    it into a future outdoor case study in the near future. Regarding goal 6 - Achieve
    general applicability to different scenarios - and despite the fact that ID3SAS
    methodology was implemented and tested exclusively in tomato plants, a notable
    feature has been integrated into the HMI dashboard (Figure 10). This feature incorporates
    information pertaining to various vegetables and fruits, encompassing essential
    parameters such as the minimum, maximum, and optimum temperature for vegetative
    growth, relative humidity, and photoperiodism. Consequently, users can conveniently
    navigate the dashboard and select the specific plant of interest. By doing so,
    the system will provide the corresponding requirements tailored to the selected
    plant, enabling effective decision-making and facilitating the implementation
    of relevant strategies. B. Case Study - Prototype ID3SAS methodology was tested
    on a case study that consisted of having tomato plants in separated pots, where
    one was watered according to the manufacturer (i.e., every three days) and the
    other is watered according to the recommendations of the ID3SAS system (Figure
    2). After conducting the experiment (from March to April 2023), measurements were
    taken to assess water consumption and tomato production in both plants. The results
    indicate that the plant watered in accordance with ID3SAS recommendations had
    a water consumption of 2190 mL and a crop production of 148 g. In contrast, the
    plant irrigated according to conventional methods had a water consumption of 2770
    mL and a crop production of 109 g. The findings demonstrate a reduction in water
    consumption of 20.9% and an increase in crop production of 26.4% when using the
    ID3SAS recommended irrigation technique in comparison to traditional methods.
    Nevertheless, the authors are aware of the limited representativeness of the case
    study, as two tomato plants are not representative of the agricultural reality.
    Consequently, it becomes imperative to undertake a comprehensive implementation
    on a medium-large scale scenario, in order to validate the efficacy of the ID3SAS
    system in terms of both production yield and the water consumption used for irrigation
    purposes. The authors hold the expectation that, upon conducting a case study
    of a larger scale, the outcomes pertaining to water consumption and crop production
    will exhibit similarly promising results. C. Hardware and Software The entirety
    of the setup depicted in this case study exemplifies a low-cost approach to implementing
    a SAS, with a total cost of less than 300 euro. This expense consists of ± 200euro
    allocated to sensors, actuators, and weather station (which functioned as the
    reference point for accurate measurements), and ± 70euro to computing equipment.
    From all the material used in the experiment, some conclusions can be drawn: (1)
    we chose the ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers instead of Arduino due to their
    built-in WiFi and Bluetooth modules; (2) we did not notice any difference in performance
    between the ESP32 and the ESP8266, thereby we suggest that the more cost-effective
    option can be pursued; (3) a high disparity exists between a resistive soil moisture
    sensor and a capacitive and corrosion-resistant soil moisture sensor. Initially,
    the resistive sensor was employed, but after a week of operation, the sensor was
    corroded, leading to inaccurate measurements. Consequently, it is recommended
    to employ a capacitive and corrosion-resistant soil moisture sensor; (4) the 7-in-1
    Weather Station was exclusively used to calibrate the sensors, specially in terms
    of air temperature, humidity and UV measurements; (5) the utilisation of a 2-Channel
    SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) Relay was determined based on the availability
    of resources at hand. However, it should be noted that, for the experiment, only
    one actuator was employed (submersible water pump), connected to a single relay.
    As so, if there is only one actuator connected to the WSAN, it is recommended
    to purchased a non-2-channel relay module instead, as this would allow cost savings
    without compromising the intended functionality; (6) an external power supply
    (12VDC/2.1A/25W) was used to facilitate the seamless operation of the ESP modules,
    sensors and actuators. It was observed that in cases where a node solely consists
    of sensors without any actuators, the requirement for an external power supply
    is rendered unnecessary. However, when designing a SAS based on ID3SAS methodology,
    it is imperative to consider the adaptation of the equipment to the specific scenario
    and budgetary constraints. For instance, the selection of appropriate sensors
    that are outdoor-ready might entail higher costs. Regarding the software, the
    selection of open-source software was motivated by its widespread availability,
    enabling researchers/developers interested in developing a SAS based on the ID3SAS
    methodology to access and utilise such software freely. D. Id3sas Components In
    the present experiment, by implementing the Sensing component (subsection III-A),
    the prototype was able to gather important agricultural data such as air temperature,
    humidity, sunlight, and soil moisture. These data served as inputs for subsequent
    components in the system, enabling informed decision-making and efficient control
    of irrigation actions. The Database component (subsection III-D) was implemented
    involving a cloud-based storage, namely MongoDB Atlas. This approach should be
    the most appropriated choice for storing agricultural information, as it requires
    a good storage capability for huge volumes of data. However, in situations where
    enterprise networks restrict access to cloud services, storing the data locally
    becomes a viable alternative. The Data Processing component (subsection III-E)
    was important to pre-process data. Feature Engineering was used to generate engineered
    features based on existing sensor inputs, allowing the predictive ML models to
    capture temporal dependencies and patterns in data. Missing values and outliers
    were also handled appropriately. With regard to the Artificial Intelligence component
    (subsection III-F), the evaluation results of the predictive ML models presented
    in Table 4 indicate that ExtraTR and AdaBoost exhibited superior performance in
    estimating soil moisture levels and predicting time-to-water, respectively. The
    ExtraTR model achieved a RMSE of 5.57 for “SoilMoisture(t+6)” estimation and a
    of 0.79. For “TimeToWater” estimation, it achieved a RMSE of 7.26 and a of 0.89.
    On the other hand, the AdaBoost model outperformed the ExtraTR model in terms
    of RMSE and for “SoilMoisture(t+1)” (3.81 and 0.91, respectively), “SoilMoisture(t+12)”
    (6.73 and 0.73, respectively), and “SoilMoisture(t+24)” (8.11 and 0.61, respectively)
    estimations. Furthermore, the output generated by the “TimeToWater” model (Figure
    11) was found to be more accurate when compared to the “SoilMoisture(t+ n )” model.
    While it is observed that the “SoilMoisture(t+1)” model has the lowest RMSE and
    highest (Table 4), its practical usefulness is limited for short-term predictions.
    In turn, the “TimeToWater” model offers enhanced planning capabilities over significantly
    longer time horizons. Additionally, although auto-regression models typically
    exhibit strong performance over short time spans, in this specific scenario, a
    decline in performance can be observed after 24 hours, whereas the “TimeToWater”
    model demonstrates success beyond 70 hours and with a smaller dataset. Moreover,
    in terms of interpretability, from an end-user perspective, the scheduling of
    irrigation events is easier to comprehend than the degradation of soil moisture
    levels. FIGURE 11. Comparison of real values and predicted values (ExtraTR and
    AdaBoost models) for “TimeToWater” parameter. Show All The Decision Support component
    (subsection III-G) assists users in making informed decisions and effectively
    planning their agricultural activities. Its process involves retrieving current
    data from sensors, checking weather forecasts, and utilising Fuzzy Logic approach
    for irrigation time calculations. The result is the determination of irrigation
    time, categorised as “Short”, “Medium-short”, “Medium-long”, or “Long”. These
    categories are then used to control the duration of the water pump’s operation,
    regulating the amount of water used for irrigation. By adjusting the “Irrigation
    Time”, the system effectively manages and optimises the irrigation process, ensuring
    appropriate and efficient utilisation of water resources. The Control component
    plays an important role in managing the actuators within the physical environment.
    As a result, it becomes imperative to define the level of autonomy the system
    should possess. In the context of this prototype, the decision to control the
    actuators manually or automatically will affect the overall functionality, performance,
    and application of the system. Lastly, the HMI component (subsection III-I), served
    as a powerful tool, empowering users with real-time information, personalised
    recommendations, and control actions. It improved decision-making capabilities,
    contributing to more sustainable and successful farming practices. SECTION V.
    Conclusion, Limitations and Future Work This article focuses on the implementation
    of the ID3SAS methodology, which represents a major breakthrough for the agricultural
    sector. By integrating wireless sensor data, field actuators, IoT, cloud computing,
    advanced data analytics, predictive models, and decision support tools, it offers
    significant contributions to creating a cutting-edge SAS, providing farmers with
    real-time decision-making capabilities that can lead to increased productivity
    and reduced water consumption. Embracing the transformative potential of Agriculture
    4.0 technologies, the ID3SAS methodology paves the way for more sustainable and
    efficient agricultural practices. ID3SAS was implemented and tested in a laboratory
    scenario, referred to as the prototype. The primary objective is to evaluate the
    functionality and effectiveness of the methodology in achieving the proposed objectives
    and fulfilling the established requirements. While the study acknowledges the
    significance of plant physiology, crop production, and water consumption in irrigation
    processes, it primarily emphasises assessing the performance of the ID3SAS methodology
    itself. However, it is imperative to consider the limitations of the current study.
    The experiment was conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, lacking dynamic
    environmental factors such as rainfall and wind, which limits the generability
    of the findings to real-world agricultural conditions. To address this, future
    research should focus on conducting outdoor case studies to evaluate the robustness
    and performance of the ID3SAS methodology under varying environmental conditions.
    Moreover, further research is needed to expand the applicability of ID3SAS to
    different crops and agricultural contexts. This could involve refining the predictive
    models to accommodate crop-specific requirements and optimising the decision-making
    algorithms for diverse farming practices. Additionally, the acquisition of more
    resilient and outdoor-ready hardware, including sensors and actuators, will be
    crucial for the successful implementation of the system in real-world agricultural
    settings. Continued research and development efforts in these areas will contribute
    to the advancement and widespread adoption of intelligent data-driven DSS in agriculture,
    ultimately promoting sustainable and efficient agricultural practices. While the
    ID3SAS methodology may demonstrate success within the parameters of the study,
    further research, tests, and validations in relation to plant physiology and its
    impact on crop performance could be vital for its real-world applicability and
    practical effectiveness. Appendix See Tables VII and VIII. TABLE 7 ID3SAS goals

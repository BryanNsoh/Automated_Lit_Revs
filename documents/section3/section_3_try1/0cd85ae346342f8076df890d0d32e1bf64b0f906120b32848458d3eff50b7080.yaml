    Get rights and content Highlights • A review of state-of-the-art Internet of Things
    applications for smart grid and home. • Definition of smart home holistic framework
    with key features from literature review. • General description of a smart home
    management model based on the holistic framework. • Discussion of current and
    future challenges for Internet of Things based solutions. Abstract Although Internet
    of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies
    for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very
    rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute
    towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications
    and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose
    a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks
    proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects
    in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model
    for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each
    level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data
    processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability.
    We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as
    a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home
    solutions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of
    ThingsSmart homeHolistic frameworkSmart grid 1. Introduction With the expected
    growth in world population, the demand for energy will continuously increase.
    Current power grids were built decades ago, and despite the fact that they are
    regularly upgraded, their capability to fulfill future demands is uncertain. Existing
    reserves of fossil fuels are limited and impose harmful emissions, making social
    and environmental implications and impact inevitable. The result of this current
    state is the transition of the traditional centralized grid towards a distributed
    hybrid energy generation system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources,
    such as wind and solar systems (Lund et al., 2015), biomass, fuel cells, and tidal
    power. Smart grid is a concept that integrates information and communication technologies
    (ICT) with grid power systems, in order to achieve efficient and intelligent energy
    generation and consumption (Iyer and Agrawal, 2010). It is characterized by a
    two-way flow of both electricity and information. Approaches in smart grid include
    novel solutions that would effectively exploit the existing power grid in order
    to reduce or eliminate blackouts, voltage sags and overloads. Utilities could
    benefit, as the load demand in critical situations would decrease. If demand is
    greater than the total generation, these systems could prevent the grid failure
    or major blackouts, and increase the reliability, quality, security and safety
    of the power grid. Smart grid solutions can be applied in every part of the grid:
    production, transmission and distribution. Recently, a fourth part of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home has become a major (mainstream) research and application
    interest in smart grid. Smart home refers to the use of ICT in home control, ranging
    from controlling appliances to automation of home features (windows, lighting,
    etc.). A key element of the smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling
    algorithms, which will provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori
    choices about how to spent electricity in order to decrease energy consumption.
    Another term commonly used is smart house or home automation. The combination
    of information technologies and advanced communication and sensing systems, creates
    a variety of new potential applications. New advanced concepts, such as pervasive
    or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where computing is made to appear
    everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for application in smart grid (Parikh
    et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable of communication and computation,
    ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances and sophisticated smart phones
    are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous network composing of such
    objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a fast growing popularity,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents a worldwide network of
    uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According to Gubbi et al. (2013),
    IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices providing the ability
    to share information across platforms through a unified framework, developing
    a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications. This is achieved
    by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information representation
    with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the Internet of Things
    aims to improve one''s comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation among smart
    objects. The standard IoT usually consists of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Wireless Sensor Network is
    a paradigm that was tremendously explored by the research community in the last
    two decades (Oppermann et al., 2014). A WSN consists of smart sensing devices
    that can communicate through direct radio communication. RFID devices are not
    as sophisticated. They mainly consist of two parts: an integrated circuit with
    some computational capabilities and an antenna for communication. The concept
    of IoT, combined with smart metering, has the potential to transform residential
    houses, homes and offices into energy-aware environments. There is an increasing
    interest in the research community to incorporate the IoT paradigm in the smart
    grid concept, particularly in smart home solutions. The trends of web search popularity
    for the terms: Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart Home since 2004 are shown
    in Fig. 1. According to these statistics by Google, the trends will further increase
    for the terms Internet of Things and Smart Home. Download : Download high-res

    to Google trends since 2004 for terms Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart
    Home. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to the integration of state-of-the-art
    IoT (or near IoT) solutions into the smart home, taking into account both home
    energy management considerations and architectural challenges and solutions with
    emphasis on data processing issues, networking and interoperability features of
    smart home protocols. For this purpose, we surveyed the IoT frameworks present
    in the literature, analyzed these state-of-the-art solutions and defined challenges
    for future research. Section two presents the methodology used in this paper in
    order to select the most appropriate recent developments as published in the literature
    covering the topics of Internet of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The in-depth
    analysis of the results, as identified by our methodology, is given in Section
    3. Our analysis is conducted in a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing
    IoT and near IoT applications are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart
    grid where such solutions are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home.
    Afterwards, a generalization is given of the existing solutions in a new generic
    holistic framework that incorporates key features from the literature review as
    identified by our methodology. The analysis is concluded by overviewing a general
    smart home management model for the IoT based holistic framework by defining its
    integral levels and their main tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art
    solutions. The fourth section discusses challenges associated with IoT constrained
    resources (energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities), along with networking,
    interoperability issues, big data analyses, security and privacy. An overview
    of useful guidelines and solutions needed to face these challenges is given. Finally,
    this paper is concluded in the fifth section. 2. Review methodology This section
    presents the methodology used in the paper in order to select the most appropriate
    recent developments as published in the literature covering the topics of Internet
    of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The literature was searched using the online
    service Google Scholar (GS) (https://scholar.google.com/). The main advantages
    of using GS as opposed to other similar resources like Scopus and Web of Science
    are freedom, ease of use, and a broader universe of cited and citing items (Franceschet,
    2010). Google Scholar has a high coverage for high quality studies, is highly
    sensitive and could be the first, and even more so a standalone choice for systematic
    reviews or meta-analysis (Gehanno et al., 2013). Only publications, excluding
    patents and citations were searched. All results provided by GS were sorted according
    to their relevance. Google Scholar''s ranking algorithm relies heavily on an article''s
    citation count, but also puts a high weighting on words in the title (Beel and
    Gipp, 2009). Currently GS does not search for synonyms of queried keywords; hence,
    all synonyms have to be rewritten and queried separately. Only publications between
    years 2010 and 2016 were considered. Papers prior to 2010 were not considered
    since most of the advances in this area have happened within the last few years
    (GS retrieves 130 publications with keyword “Internet of Things” in the title
    published before 2010, and 7650 publication published after 2010), which is in
    line with the Google trends as shown in Fig. 1. The following terms were allowed:
    “Wireless Sensor Network”, “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Smart Grid”, “Smart Home”
    and “Home Automation” to appear anywhere in the text of the publications. We consider
    the terms “Home Automation” and “Smart Home” to be synonyms, as well as the terms
    “IoT”, “Internet of Things” and “Wireless Sensor Networks” (since Wireless Sensor
    Networks together with RFID are the two main technologies which enable the development
    of IoT). Most of the research challenges in IoT have its origin in WSN; hence,
    some of the IoT solutions are simply borrowed from WSN (Mainetti et al., 2011).
    The general query form we use is “term1” AND “term2” AND “term3”, where term1
    = (“Wireless Sensor Networks” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT”), term2 = (“Smart
    Home” OR “Home Automation”), and term3 = “Smart Grid”, and thus perform six searches.
    The queries and the total number of publications retrieved by GS are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Number of publications found by GS engine for different queries.
    Query# Term1 Term2 Term3 Total number of results Query 1 “Wireless Sensor Network”

    Home” “Smart Grid” 1050 Query 6 “IoT” “Home Automation” “Smart Grid” 747 Only
    the first 100 results per query were considered for further analysis in this paper.
    There are overlaps between the result sets of the different queries so the final
    set of unique publications is around 150. For example, if we consider only the
    top 20 results there are a total of 74 unique publications, with multiple publications
    appearing in the results of more than one query. Fig. 2 shows the number of these
    overlaps, and additionally the average GS ranking for each group are given (e.g.
    papers that appear in the results of a single query have an average ranking of
    12.54). Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Total number of publications appearing in the top 20 results for
    the six queries. The number associated with each bar refers to the average ranking
    of the publications in the group. The unique set of publications was further filtered
    content-wise i.e. whether the publication has pertinent material regarding wireless
    sensor networks or Internet of Things solution/s for smart home and/or smart grid.
    First a number of papers were excluded based on the content of their abstract.
    Next, we considered the whole text of the remaining papers and retained only those
    in line with our review. The final remaining papers were analyzed in-depth. The
    finding is that the papers can be semantically divided in two main categories:
    WSN solutions and IoT concepts. The first category includes papers that provide
    real-life working implementations of WSN in different domains like habitat monitoring,
    home monitoring, etc. They can be considered the seeds of future IoT applications.
    The papers in the second category revolve around the IoT paradigm and provide
    concepts, frameworks, visions, and challenges of future “to be implemented” IoT
    solutions. Hence, this work separately elaborates the papers in the two categories
    in the forthcoming Section (3). We firstly expatiate on papers in context of WSN
    implementations (3.1), then we survey papers in line with IoT solutions (3.2 and
    3.3). 3. In-depth analysis of literature This section presents the in-depth analysis
    of the results as identified by our methodology. The analysis is conducted in
    a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing IoT and near IoT applications
    are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart grid where such solutions
    are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home. Afterwards, a generalization
    is given of the existing solutions in a new generic holistic framework that incorporates
    key features from the literature review as identified by our methodology. The
    analysis is concluded by overviewing a general smart home management model for
    the IoT based holistic framework by defining its integral levels and their main
    tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art solutions. 3.1. State-of-the-art
    (near) Internet of Things solutions in smart grid and smart home The integration
    of IoT within the smart grid will bring a new perspective to electricity management,
    with benefit for all parties involved. Table 2 differentiates the potential IoT
    applications regarding different aspects (parts) of the smart grid (Cardenas et
    al., 2014, Gungor et al., 2010, Parikh et al., 2010). Much of the pioneering research
    is hindered with a lot of challenges, especially when dealing with the first three
    aspects (generation, transmission and distribution) of the smart grid. The problems
    are mostly due to the harsh conditions in which sensor devices are deployed. Experimental
    results using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor networks show that wireless links
    (including both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios) in the smart
    grid have high packet error rates and variable link capacity due to electromagnetic
    interference, equipment noise, obstruction, etc. (Gungor and Korkmaz, 2012). Wireless
    nodes impose additional constraints, i.e. the memory and processing limitations
    of the sensor nodes and their limited power resources. Table 2. Potential IoT
    applications for smart grid. Energy providers Energy generation Transmission Distribution
    Consumers Real-time generation monitoring Transmission lines controlling Underground
    cable system monitoring Wireless automatic meter reading (smart metering) Power
    plants controlling Power monitoring Transformers stations controlling Home (Residential)
    energy management Alternative energy sources controlling Solar panels management
    Residential (distributed) production monitoring Predicting future solar panels
    and wind turbine production (using sensor data like temperature or humidity) Fortunately,
    most of these challenges are not present in the fourth, consumer side of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home. For example, sensors are usually connected to home
    appliances and the battery life problem becomes superfluous as the devices have
    a steady power supply. Furthermore, strong electromagnetic fields are not associated
    with home grid infrastructure. Still, IoT for smart home is subject to challenges
    like reliability, privacy, and security (Iyer, 2011). Modern homes equipped with
    smart meters, smart appliances, smart power outlets and sensing devices enable
    the development of energy-aware smart homes (Fig. 3). Although the smart home
    has been a dream for both utilities and consumers for a long time, such implementations
    are still very rare (Monacchi et al., 2013). On the other side, there are plenty
    of existing commercial solutions and advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) systems
    focused on large industrial consumers (Finn and Fitzpatrick, 2014, Palensky and
    Dietrich, 2011). Almost all of them fail to integrate small residential consumers.

    Fig. 3. Smart home. IoT carries the potential to overcome this gap and to provide
    services that will foster the development of intelligent solutions for the common
    people. The main goal of IoT is to advance a better and safe society, where “Everything
    is a service” (public safety, environment, health care, production, etc.). In
    this subsection we present relevant attempts from the literature as identified
    by our methodology. The papers discussed here semantically fall in a category
    regarding near IoT solutions for smart home, mainly from the neighboring fields
    of wireless sensor networks, home automation, and smart grid. Novel architectures
    in terms of state-of-the-art software technologies with focus on domestic environments
    and habitat monitoring are proposed in Monacchi et al. (2013) and Stojkoska and
    Davcev (2009). In Monacchi et al. (2013) the authors promote design guidelines
    for collecting and integrating household data, thus enabling data interoperability.
    In Stojkoska and Davcev (2009), a web interface is developed in order to increase
    the interaction between the deployed WSN and its end users. Authors of Kamilaris
    et al. (2011) propose a solution for a Web-based energy-aware smart home framework
    that enables smart appliances to the Web. They have developed a graphical user
    interface to ease the interaction. The evaluation of their solution is done using
    a WSN organized in a star topology and also a multihop topology (up to three hops)
    for larger apartments (smart homes of around 100 m2). VillaSmart (Caracaş et al.,
    2013) is associated with the ECOGRID EU (EcoGrid EU, 2015) project. The authors
    have installed a modular and extensible WSN in a test and reference household
    called VILLASMART. These authors are modeling the energy behavior of the building.
    These thermal models are improved using indoor and outdoor WSN readings (air and
    water temperature, solar radiation sensor, weather conditions and power consumption
    information), thus achieving more precise predictions of indoor temperature. Using
    the standard resistance-capacitance (RC) model, the maximum prediction error achieved
    is 1.790C. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz is used for indoor communication.
    The model parameter determination is done with the grey-box estimation method.
    In Srbinovska et al. (2015) a WSN is installed for vegetable greenhouse monitoring
    and a control system for agriculture is developed. This system helps farmers increase
    the crop production and quality by remotely controlling different parts of the
    greenhouse, like drip irrigation and fan facilities. In Risteska Stojkoska et
    al. (2014), the authors present a framework for temperature regulation inside
    commercial and administrative buildings, with focus on design and implementation
    of specific network topologies and node localization within the system. 3.2. Holistic
    IoT-based framework for smart home It is expected that smart objects will be dominant
    on the market in the next few years and will become omnipresent in households,
    which will impose the need for new and improved services for smart homes (Karnouskos,
    2011). For these reasons, the need for IoT based solutions will be incontestable.
    Most recent publications focus on developing a general IoT framework that is suitable
    for broader range of application domains. In Lee and Lee (2015), the authors identity
    five IoT technologies as essential for building successful IoT solutions: radio
    frequency identification, wireless sensor networks, middleware, cloud computing
    and software for application development. They also identify three IoT categories
    for enterprise applications: monitoring and control, big data and business analytics,
    and information sharing and collaboration. In(Da Xu et al., 2014), the list of
    enabling technologies is enhanced with Near Field Communication, location based
    services and social networks. They suggest a four-layer architecture made up of:
    sensing, networking, service and interface. The role of the cloud is missing;
    therefore, it is not clear how services would be enabled. Liu et al. (2014) presents
    a middleware that supports naming, addressing, storage and look-up services. The
    idea is to develop a middleware at the top of the existing systems, thus to achieve
    easier integration of existing applications into IoT environments. Once again,
    the cloud is omitted as an enabling technology that should support all these services.
    The monitoring of production processes in industry using IoT is investigated in
    Shrouf and Miragliotta (2015). The authors propose a detailed framework that is
    focused on energy management, with possibilities for in-house or cloud-based data
    mining and decision making. The role of the third-party solution designers is
    not specified in the framework. Readers can also refer to (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    He et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2014) for interesting work regarding IoT architectures.
    With respect to these publications, the framework presented in this paper can
    be considered a modified version of the most general model we found in literature
    (Da Xu et al., 2014), augmented with the cloud in the middle, and adapted to a
    particular application domain, i.e. smart home. This multi-level hierarchical
    holistic framework based on Internet of Things is used as a wrapper or generalization
    of all the key features of IoT solutions for smart homes identified in the literature.
    The graphical representation of the framework is given in Fig. 4. Within the framework
    data is sent wirelessly and is shown using dashed lines. The yellow lines correspond
    to a bidirectional electricity flow. The following paragraphs summarize each level
    of the framework. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Multi level IoT framework for smart home. 3.2.1. Smart
    home All household devices equipped with interfaces for wireless communication,
    make up the home WSN. Each home has a WSN, and the sensed data from each device
    is forwarded to a central station, which we refer to as home sink or home hub.
    Each node in the home WSN is considered a smart device and has moderate computation
    and communication capabilities. The home hub can be any one device (smart meter,
    PC, tablet or smartphone) that has some data storage capacity, can perform local
    processing and can communicate with devices outside the home WSN. In the case
    of smart residential complexes or smart buildings, the counterpart of the home
    hub is identified as residential sink or residential hub. The residential hub
    needs to have an additional feature, as compared to the home hub, which is that
    it is responsible for managing data from/to shared distributed production sources.
    This is rather important, as renewable sources are usually shared among consumers,
    one example being a residential building with a PV system on the roof, where the
    PV system is used by all households in the building. Within the framework, each
    distributed renewable energy source is considered a smart device. 3.2.2. Cloud
    All data from different sources is accumulated in the cloud (households'' data,
    sensor measurements from the transmission/distribution lines or from the production
    sites, etc.). The cloud should provide massive data storage and processing infrastructure.
    It is the most advanced level of the framework (Da Xu et al., 2014, Lee and Lee,
    2015). As stated in Gubbi et al. (2013), the cloud “promises high reliability,
    scalability and autonomy” for the next generation of IoT applications. The cloud
    is the central part of this system, hence our framework can be considered as “cloud
    centric” or “cloud based”. 3.2.3. Utility This level corresponds to the remaining
    parts of the smart grid, apart from the smart home: production, transmission and
    distribution. Each part independently sends data directly to the cloud. The typical
    information that can be exchanged with the utility is: price of electricity, weather
    forecast, distribution/transmission line status, current and future consumption
    of a microgrid, current and future production of the distributed production sources
    associated with a microgrid, etc (Sajjad et al., 2014). 3.2.4. Third party Third
    party applications are developed using the cloud data (Gubbi et al., 2013). Other
    terms that are interchangeably used are business applications, industry oriented
    applications or user-specific IoT application. Namely, third party application
    developers get data from the cloud (private or public) and use this data to deliver
    solutions in the form of web based or mobile applications (Fan et al., 2010).
    3.2.5. User interfaces This level represents user interfaces that deliver data
    to the end users (notifications, recommendations, smart device controls, etc)
    (Da Xu et al., 2014). Raw tabular data referring to monthly (or even daily) household
    consumption is hard to be interpreted by the users. A more sophisticated visualization
    tool is needed to present not only the overall household consumption, but also
    the consumption at device/appliance level (Liu et al., 2014). This is particularly
    useful, since consumers will be able to learn more about different appliances
    in their home, especially ones that cannot be controlled automatically, like non-flexible
    devices, hence enabling the users to control them intuitively taking into account
    their consuming nature. Third party applications should put an effort toward developing
    intuitive visual user interfaces for the consumers and frequently evaluate those
    using Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. 3.3. Smart home management systems
    An energy management system is defined as an interface between a utility company
    and smart devices that consume power. It aims to provide benefits for both parties
    (utilities and consumers), somewhat biased towards the consumers. Another term
    commonly used is Demand Side Management (DSM). It represents a set of technologies
    that enable monitoring and controlling the consumption/production at consumer
    level in order to perform power balancing in future energy systems (Atzeni et
    al., 2013, Rezvani et al., 2015, Siano, 2014). In the context of IoT solutions
    for smart home, the traditional DSM model is shifted toward the cloud centric
    model. The cloud based approach offers centralized optimization that considers
    a huge set of parameters; hence it is expected to outperform the energy management
    as compared to a traditional approach. Fig. 5 shows the general Smart home management
    model adopted for our holistic framework. The main tasks that should be performed
    at each level are presented as follows. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    3.3.1. Smart objects/smart devices Home appliances, lights, or sensors attached
    to production or transmission lines in a smart grid system can be considered smart
    objects. They can sense, actuate, process data and communicate. In order to sense
    and actuate, they need to perform A/D and D/A conversions (Byun et al., 2012).
    These devices periodically perform sensing and send (wirelessly of wired) sensed
    data to the hub. Moreover, if protocols allow it, sensed data can be sent directly
    to the cloud. If possible, smart devices should perform basic data processing
    before they send the sensed data (Stojkoska et al., 2012, Viani et al., 2013).
    Actuating can be also controlled remotely. In the context of DSM, home appliances
    can be divided in three categories: non flexible, flexible and dual nature appliances
    (Erol-Kantarci and Mouftah, 2010). The non-flexible appliances are those that
    are associated with baseline loads or non-preemptive tasks (like light, TV, PC,
    hair drier) and cannot be controlled by the system (Ullah et al., 2013). The flexible
    appliances are associated with regular loads or preemptive tasks (like heating
    or air-conditioning) and can be automatically operated by the system. The dual
    nature appliances sometimes can act as flexible, but sometimes as non-flexible
    (like washing machine, dish washer or laundry). For example, sometimes the consumer
    does not care about the exact time the dish washer will operate, as long as it
    is within a predefined time frame. These appliances usually present burst loads
    (Khan et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2013). The smart appliances (both flexible and
    dual nature) are equipped with smart power outlets that are able to measure their
    power consumption and to control their operation in real-time. 3.3.2. Hubs The
    hub is a device that is responsible for collecting raw and/or processed data from
    the smart devices and forwarding them to the cloud (Zhu et al., 2010). Whenever
    possible, the hub has to perform local data processing (Viani et al., 2013), in
    order to reduce the data flow towards the cloud. Furthermore, in a smart home
    scenario, the hub can send commands to the smart devices acting as a local scheduler,
    regulator, or load balancer (Byun et al., 2012). In the case of a residential
    hub, it can send commands to the devices that regulate the electricity flow to/from
    the nanogrid, i.e. to manage the operations of buying/selling electricity from/to
    the grid. The hub understands the communication protocols used by the smart devices.
    Hubs are needed to enable the interoperability between the smart objects, since
    the devices generally cannot communicate with each other (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    Heile, 2010). Hence, sometimes a household needs more than one hub. In the future,
    when full interoperability among smart devices is achieved, it is expected that
    hubs will be superfluous in the model. 3.3.3. Cloud The cloud is the most complex
    part of the home management. The main task of the cloud is to store the data (Zhou
    et al., 2013). Because of the high data volume, traditional approaches should
    be modified to meet the new requirements. New methods and algorithms based on
    machine learning techniques, time series processing and advanced analytics are
    to be employed (Da Xu et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013). Third-party applications
    typically assume that the data being used is unchanging i.e. the data is usable
    by applications on a non-real-time basis. In the cloud the event-based data is
    converted to query-based processing. This is a crucial step towards bridging the
    differences of real-time IoT networking and the third-party application world.
    The data should be stored persistently and abstracted at multiple levels so that
    they could be easily combined, recomputed and/or aggregated with previously stored
    data, with the possibility of some data coming from non-IoT sources (Da Xu et
    al., 2014). Even more importantly the different levels of abstraction will simplify
    the application access and usage since data will be presented in a manner required
    by applications. 3.3.4. Third party Third party should develop applications for
    the end users in the form of schedulers, regulators, and load balancers (Fan et
    al., 2010). A scheduler is a tool responsible for defining time slots in which
    the dual nature appliances will be active. A regulator is a tool responsible for
    the management of flexible devices, i.e. it will regulate the operation of air
    conditioners, heaters, dehumidifiers, etc. Load balancing should optimize energy
    consumption, considering current electricity price on the market and availability
    of electricity produced by the local renewable sources, if available. All these
    tools need advanced algorithms that use much more parameters than those obtained
    by the home devices. They should perform the complex tasks of mining and knowledge
    extraction from the available data in the cloud in order to create consumer and
    household profiles, or in simpler words the available smart home data should lead
    to the creation of personalized recommendations for all users (Liu et al., 2014).
    4. Challenges and solutions In this section, some guidelines for future developers
    of IoT solutions on how to make good choices when dealing with different challenges
    associated with practical issues are presented. 4.1. Edge (fog) computing Edge
    computing or fog computing is the process of data processing at the edge of the
    network. In this paradigm it is expected that the knowledge extraction process
    starts as early as the time the data is sensed i.e. at the sensor side. There
    are many reasons to employ this approach, but some of the more prominent ones
    are the energy saving, data volume reduction and latency reduction. Each object/entity
    in the IoT can consume a huge amount of energy if its communication is not optimized.
    For smart objects, in terms of energy consumption, local computation is an operation
    cheaper than communication. Hence, the effort should be shifted toward developing
    lightweight algorithms for local data processing. This approach will decrease
    the data volume and will avoid sending huge portions of raw data. Instead, only
    metadata will be transmitted (data about the data). Reducing the number of transmissions
    among IoT devices is also very important in order to avoid latency issues and
    saturation of the wireless channels. For these reasons, different data reduction
    techniques should be employed to minimize the communication overhead. There are
    three main techniques used for data reduction: data compression, data prediction
    and in-network processing (Stojkoska et al., 2012). For example, if data is not
    needed in real time, data compression (like delta compression) can be used. Otherwise,
    different filters can be used for real-time sensor data prediction, most of them
    based on adaptive filtering techniques, like moving average (MA), autoregressive
    (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), least mean square (LMS), and
    LMS with variable step size (LMS-VSS) (Risteska Stojkoska et al., 2014, Stojkoska
    et al., 2012). Prediction is performed at each device and at the hub, i.e. predictions
    are made simultaneously on both sides. If the sensed value differs significantly
    from the predicted value (the difference is above a predefined threshold emax),
    the smart device should send the measurement/data to the hub. Otherwise, the predicted
    value is considered to be “reliable” and is used to feed the filter for future
    predictions. This paradigm is known as “dual prediction scheme” (Santini and Romer,
    2006). In-network processing is the process of consecutive data processing on
    their way to the destination. As data travel through intermediate nodes, some
    aggregating operations are performed. 4.2. Big data The IoT-generated data come
    in big amounts, are variable in terms of structure, often arrive at real-time,
    and might be of uncertain provenance. This volume, velocity and variety (not to
    mention variable veracity) make the storing and analytics solution, which will
    generate useful insights, a very complex one (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). Traditional
    SQL-queried relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are unsuitable for
    the task, which is why big data solutions are needed. The IoT Cloud (Alamri et
    al., 2013, Botta et al., 2016) will enable the long-time storage and complex analysis
    of this data. The challenge of handling big data is a critical one, since the
    overall performance is directly proportional to the properties of the data management
    service (Dobre and Xhafa, 2014). A constellation of tools has evolved to service
    the market, most notably Apache''s open-source Hadoop distributed data processing
    system, plus various NoSQL databases and a range of business intelligence platforms.
    There are multiple vendors that operate in different parts of the analytics pipeline
    (data integration, data storage, core analytics and data presentation), as well
    as ''full-stack'' vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Software AG. Both
    proprietary and open source solutions adopt alternative database technologies
    for big data (Copie et al., 2013): time-series, key-value, document store, wide
    column stores, and graph databases. However, to date there is no simple answer
    to the big data management question in the Cloud (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). The
    problem becomes even more cumbersome when the factor of data integrity is taken
    into account, not only because of its impact on the quality of service, but also
    for its security and privacy related aspects especially on outsourced data (Liu
    et al., 2015). 4.3. Networking Networking protocols for Internet of Things solutions
    can be divided in smart device networks and traditional networks that are designed
    primarily for high data rates. Smart home networking protocols are expected to
    adopt the protocols already established in Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) communications, with no clear winner so far (Chen et al., 2012). Adding
    many advanced features to the protocol increases the cost, and reduces the ease-of-use.
    Designing an appealing protocol is not a trivial task, and is usually a tradeoff
    between the cost and the performances. In perspective of the topology to be used,
    mesh is the most suitable choice of network topology for wireless communication
    due to the presence of obstacles in the home, like walls, furniture, etc. Dual-mesh,
    which means that the network operates as both wired and wireless, is an appropriate
    solution for households that have a previously installed wired home automation
    system. There are many protocols designed for smart home solutions. Some of them
    dated back from the period when smart home was reserved for the wealthy households,
    and many new that try to combine the old design principles with the newly developed
    technologies. X10 is the oldest protocol that was initially wired, but new modifications
    make it dual-mesh. Insteon is another example of a dual-mesh protocol, which was
    recently integrated into Google owned Nest, Apple''s HomeKit platform and Apple
    Watch (Darbee, 2013). The more recent protocols work only wirelessly (ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, 6lowpan, EnOcean, etc.). There are different ways to classify protocols,
    and none of them is exhaustive enough. Using Google Scholar, we queried for publications
    that cover each of these protocols and the summary statistics for the number of
    publications is given in Table 3. This data is of November 2015. Table 3. Number
    of publications according to Google Scholar. Empty Cell Zigbee 6lowpan Z-Wave
    Bacnet X10 EnOcean Insteon Without patents 228000 9790 5770 6700 1840 1520 720
    With patents 264000 9010 7650 7550 1890 2440 1080 Table 3 shows that ZigBee is
    the most popular protocol, but this is true only for the scientific research and
    academia (ZigBee, 2015). In practice, the Z-Wave is the one that has the most
    manufacturers, mainly due to their interoperability. According to Z-Wave Alliance,
    over 35 million Z-Wave products have been sold since they began selling in 2005
    (Z-Wave Alliance, 2015). The basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave and Insteon are
    shown in Table 4. Theoretically, a Z-Wave network is limited to a maximum of 232
    Z-Wave devices, but most vendors recommend using about 30–50 (Darbee, 2013). For
    example, MiOS LTD with their Vera products recommends 50 devices for Vera Lite,
    and 100 devices for Vera 3 (MiOS, 2015). Table 4. Basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave

    2.4 GHz Gaussian, frequency-shift keying (GFSK) manchester channel encoding Frequency-shift
    keying (FSK) The price is another aspect that can be considered when choosing
    the right protocol. A ZigBee Licence costs $3500 per year, while Z-Wave charges
    $750 per device model for the logo (Darbee, 2013). A more detailed comparison
    of the smart home protocols can be found in Withanage et al. (2014). Each level
    of the IoT framework should have particular features. We identify and summarize
    the required capabilities of IoT devices at each level in Table 5. Table 5. Capabilities
    of IoT parts for smart home management system. Empty Cell Network topology Communication

    LTE/optical fiber/Wi-Fi very high very high Third party not applicable LTE/optical
    fiber/Wi-Fi high application dependent, from intermediate to high 4.4. Interoperability
    Currently, the main issue for the development of a generic smart home solution
    is the cost associated with integrating smart home devices (Ko et al., 2011).
    Interoperability is the key to open markets to competitive solutions in IoT (Lu
    et al., 2011, Misra et al., 2015). Leading companies in the world that are producing
    smart devices are working toward achieving full interoperability that will ensure
    easy integration with the existing Internet. Z-Wave products are already interoperable
    with their previous versions, while ZigBee Allience with its Zigbee 3.0 has announced
    this feature to be implemented by the end of 2015. ZigBee has formed many committees
    that aim to define product properties required for different vendors to build
    interoperable devices for different public application profiles, like Home Automation,
    Health Care, Remote Control, etc. Still, products are not necessarily interoperable
    across these profiles and across revisions within a profile. On the other side,
    X10 and Insteon are fully interoperable with each other (Darbee, 2013). Table
    6 summarizes the interoperability features of these protocols. Table 6. Interoperability
    features of Insteon, X10, Z-Wave and ZigBee. Empty Cell Insteon X10 Z-Wave ZigBee
    ZigBee invisible to each other No No No Z-Wave invisible to each other No Yes
    X10 Yes Yes Insteon Yes 4.5. Security and privacy One of the most important issues
    of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid development is related to cyber
    security, both for the wireless and the wired parts of the systems (Ning et al.,
    2013, Schneps-Schneppe et al., 2012). The smart grid can be a target for cyber
    terrorists, which emerges as a critical concern for system designers. Because
    of the way in which data is transmitted, IoT is inherently vulnerable to most
    of the common attacks of wireless networks. Hence, IoT requires a security policy,
    but the cost for providing it needs to be as low as possible. Different approaches
    that provide security lightweight crypto-primitives should be investigated (Altolini
    et al., 2013), in order to provide authenticity (the device is not a malicious
    object), integrity (transmitted data is identical with the received data) and
    confidentiality (make data unreadable to others) (Dimitrievski et al., 2006).
    5. Conclusions This paper addresses the vision that the residential buildings
    would shift themselves toward modern households that would be an evolution of
    the passive household. They would have their own solar panels and small wind turbines
    to produce their own energy, thus they would be able to buy/sell energy from/to
    the smart power grid. As it is expected for smart objects to become omnipresent
    on the market and respectively in consumers'' households within the next few years,
    the need for IoT-based services for smart home will be inevitable. In this paper,
    a methodology is developed using different search queries to select the most relevant
    papers from the literature that address this topic. Selected papers were semantically
    divided into two main categories: WSN solutions and IoT concepts. This was rather
    expected considering that WSN is the pivotal technology which enabled the development
    of IoT. Although the WSN solutions are real life implementations that integrate
    devices inside a smart home, two disadvantages are identified, as they: • work
    separately and the data is used only for local optimization; • make an assumption
    of a fully (or near fully) automated home, which is a costly solution for most
    of the households. The second category of papers concerning IoT mainly presents
    concepts, theoretical frameworks and visions for possible smart home/grid solutions.
    There is a lack of a unifying platform that would transform these separate individual
    applications into a single infrastructure, a platform that can be further used
    for advanced data mining and knowledge extraction. The desired solution should
    aggregate all available smart home data within a self-learning engine in order
    to create personalized recommendations for all users, regardless of the level
    of automation present at their homes. The solution should not entail any additional
    cost for the consumers, as it should not require any particular hardware. The
    main contribution of this paper is the IoT based holistic framework, which incorporates
    different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature.
    This integral IoT framework is specific to the smart home application domain,
    with the cloud being the central element in the system that serves not only to
    collect and store data, but also as a gateway to third-parties interested in developing
    applications. In this context, we additionally survey the smart home management
    system, and we identify a model with a set of specific tasks that should be performed
    at each level in order to meet the system requirements. As a second contribution,
    this paper discusses challenges for IoT based smart home solutions, with emphasis
    on practical issues like data processing, networking and interoperability of smart
    home protocols. Fog and edge computing are promising approaches for improving
    the energy saving inside the IoT network by reducing the number of transmissions
    between the IoT devices. Although there are some publications that investigate
    this potential, a lot of research and work still needs to be done. New big data
    solutions and algorithms are needed to deal with the potentially vast amount of
    data generated within the IoT. A constellation of tools has already appeared in
    the last few years, as there are multiple vendors that operate in different parts
    of the analytics pipeline. Another big issue is the interoperability, which is
    a prerequirement for opening the markets to competitive solutions in IoT. The
    current situation is that devices with different protocols cannot communicate,
    and, more important, the products with the same protocols are not necessarily
    interoperable across different profiles and across revisions within the same profile.

    \ with each other to serve a meaningful purpose. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art\
    \ methods, protocols, and\napplications in this new emerging area. This survey\
    \ paper proposes a novel taxonomy for IoT technologies, highlights some of\nthe\
    \ most important technologies, and profiles some applications that have the potential\
    \ to make a striking difference in human\nlife, especially for the differently\
    \ abled and the elderly. As compared to similar survey papers in the area, this\
    \ paper is far more\ncomprehensive in its coverage and exhaustively covers most\
    \ major technologies spanning from sensors to applications.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Today the Internet has become ubiquitous, has touched\nalmost every corner of\
    \ the globe, and is affecting human life in\nunimaginable ways. However, the journey\
    \ is far from over. We\nare now entering an era of even more pervasive connectivity\n\
    where a very wide variety of appliances will be connected to\nthe web. We are\
    \ entering an era of the “Internet of Things”\n(abbreviated as IoT). This term\
    \ has been defined by different\nauthors in many different ways. Let us look at\
    \ two of the most\npopular definitions. Vermesan et al. [1] define the Internet\n\
    of Things as simply an interaction between the physical and\ndigital worlds. The\
    \ digital world interacts with the physical\nworld using a plethora of sensors\
    \ and actuators. Another\ndefinition by Pe˜na-L´opez et al. [2] defines the Internet\
    \ of\nThings as a paradigm in which computing and networking\ncapabilities are\
    \ embedded in any kind of conceivable object.\nWe use these capabilities to query\
    \ the state of the object and to\nchange its state if possible. In common parlance,\
    \ the Internet\nof Things refers to a new kind of world where almost all\nthe\
    \ devices and appliances that we use are connected to a\nnetwork. We can use them\
    \ collaboratively to achieve complex\ntasks that require a high degree of intelligence.\n\
    For this intelligence and interconnection, IoT devices are\nequipped with embedded\
    \ sensors, actuators, processors, and\ntransceivers. IoT is not a single technology;\
    \ rather it is an\nagglomeration of various technologies that work together in\n\
    tandem.\nSensors and actuators are devices, which help in interact-\ning with\
    \ the physical environment. The data collected by the\nsensors has to be stored\
    \ and processed intelligently in order to\nderive useful inferences from it. Note\
    \ that we broadly define\nthe term sensor; a mobile phone or even a microwave\
    \ oven\ncan count as a sensor as long as it provides inputs about its\ncurrent\
    \ state (internal state + environment). An actuator is a\ndevice that is used\
    \ to effect a change in the environment such\nas the temperature controller of\
    \ an air conditioner.\nThe storage and processing of data can be done on the\n\
    edge of the network itself or in a remote server. If any prepro-\ncessing of data\
    \ is possible, then it is typically done at either\nthe sensor or some other proximate\
    \ device. The processed\ndata is then typically sent to a remote server. The storage\n\
    and processing capabilities of an IoT object are also restricted\nby the resources\
    \ available, which are often very constrained\ndue to limitations of size, energy,\
    \ power, and computational\ncapability. As a result the main research challenge\
    \ is to\nensure that we get the right kind of data at the desired level\nof accuracy.\
    \ Along with the challenges of data collection,\nand handling, there are challenges\
    \ in communication as\nwell. The communication between IoT devices is mainly\n\
    wireless because they are generally installed at geographically\ndispersed locations.\
    \ The wireless channels often have high\nHindawi\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ reliably\ncommunicating data without too many retransmissions is an\nimportant\
    \ problem and thus communication technologies\nare integral to the study of IoT\
    \ devices.\nNow, after processing the received data, some action\nneeds to be\
    \ taken on the basis of the derived inferences. The\nnature of actions can be\
    \ diverse. We can directly modify the\nphysical world through actuators. Or we\
    \ may do something\nvirtually. For example, we can send some information to other\n\
    smart things.\nThe process of effecting a change in the physical world\nis often\
    \ dependent on its state at that point of time. This\nis called context awareness.\
    \ Each action is taken keeping in\nconsideration the context because an application\
    \ can behave\ndifferently in different contexts. For example, a person may\nnot\
    \ like messages from his office to interrupt him when he is\non vacation.\nSensors,\
    \ actuators, compute servers, and the commu-\nnication network form the core infrastructure\
    \ of an IoT\nframework. However, there are many software aspects that\nneed to\
    \ be considered. First, we need a middleware that can\nbe used to connect and\
    \ manage all of these heterogeneous\ncomponents. We need a lot of standardization\
    \ to connect\nmany different devices. We shall discuss methods to exchange\ninformation\
    \ and prevailing standards in Section 7.\nThe Internet of Things finds various\
    \ applications in health\ncare, fitness, education, entertainment, social life,\
    \ energy\nconservation, environment monitoring, home automation,\nand transport\
    \ systems. We shall focus on these application\nareas in Section 9. We shall find\
    \ that, in all these application\nareas, IoT technologies have significantly been\
    \ able to reduce\nhuman effort and improve the quality of life.\n2. Architecture\
    \ of IoT\nThere is no single consensus on architecture for IoT, which\nis agreed\
    \ universally. Different architectures have been pro-\nposed by different researchers.\n\
    2.1. Three- and Five-Layer Architectures. The most basic\narchitecture is a three-layer\
    \ architecture [3–5] as shown in\nFigure 1. It was introduced in the early stages\
    \ of research in\nthis area. It has three layers, namely, the perception, network,\n\
    and application layers.\n(i) The perception layer is the physical layer, which\
    \ has\nsensors for sensing and gathering information about\nthe environment. It\
    \ senses some physical parameters\nor identifies other smart objects in the environment.\n\
    (ii) The network layer is responsible for connecting to\nother smart things, network\
    \ devices, and servers. Its\nfeatures are also used for transmitting and processing\n\
    sensor data.\n(iii) The application layer is responsible for delivering\napplication\
    \ specific services to the user. It defines\nvarious applications in which the\
    \ Internet of Things\ncan be deployed, for example, smart homes, smart\ncities,\
    \ and smart health.\nThe three-layer architecture defines the main idea of the\n\
    Internet of Things, but it is not sufficient for research on\nIoT because research\
    \ often focuses on finer aspects of the\nInternet of Things. That is why, we have\
    \ many more layered\narchitectures proposed in the literature. One is the five-\n\
    layer architecture, which additionally includes the processing\nand business layers\
    \ [3–6]. The five layers are perception,\ntransport, processing, application,\
    \ and business layers (see\nFigure 1). The role of the perception and application\
    \ layers\nis the same as the architecture with three layers. We outline\nthe function\
    \ of the remaining three layers.\n(i) The transport layer transfers the sensor\
    \ data from\nthe perception layer to the processing layer and vice\nversa through\
    \ networks such as wireless, 3G, LAN,\nBluetooth, RFID, and NFC.\n(ii) The processing\
    \ layer is also known as the middleware\nlayer. It stores, analyzes, and processes\
    \ huge amounts\nof data that comes from the transport layer. It can\nmanage and\
    \ provide a diverse set of services to the\nlower layers. It employs many technologies\
    \ such as\ndatabases, cloud computing, and big data processing\nmodules.\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n3\n(iii) The business layer manages\
    \ the whole IoT system,\nincluding applications, business and profit models,\n\
    and users’ privacy. The business layer is out of the\nscope of this paper. Hence,\
    \ we do not discuss it\nfurther.\nAnother architecture proposed by Ning and Wang\
    \ [7] is\ninspired by the layers of processing in the human brain. It\nis inspired\
    \ by the intelligence and ability of human beings\nto think, feel, remember, make\
    \ decisions, and react to the\nphysical environment. It is constituted of three\
    \ parts. First is\nthe human brain, which is analogous to the processing and\n\
    data management unit or the data center. Second is the spinal\ncord, which is\
    \ analogous to the distributed network of data\nprocessing nodes and smart gateways.\
    \ Third is the network\nof nerves, which corresponds to the networking components\n\
    and sensors.\n2.2. Cloud and Fog Based Architectures. Let us now discuss\ntwo\
    \ kinds of systems architectures: cloud and fog computing\n(see the reference\
    \ architectures in [8]). Note that this classifi-\ncation is different from the\
    \ classification in Section 2.1, which\nwas done on the basis of protocols.\n\
    In particular, we have been slightly vague about the nature\nof data generated\
    \ by IoT devices, and the nature of data\nprocessing. In some system architectures\
    \ the data processing\nis done in a large centralized fashion by cloud computers.\n\
    Such a cloud centric architecture keeps the cloud at the\ncenter, applications\
    \ above it, and the network of smart things\nbelow it [9]. Cloud computing is\
    \ given primacy because it\nprovides great flexibility and scalability. It offers\
    \ services such\nas the core infrastructure, platform, software, and storage.\n\
    Developers can provide their storage tools, software tools,\ndata mining, and\
    \ machine learning tools, and visualization\ntools through the cloud.\nLately,\
    \ there is a move towards another system archi-\ntecture, namely, fog computing\
    \ [10–12], where the sensors\nand network gateways do a part of the data processing\
    \ and\nanalytics. A fog architecture [13] presents a layered approach\nas shown\
    \ in Figure 2, which inserts monitoring, prepro-\ncessing, storage, and security\
    \ layers between the physical\nand transport layers. The monitoring layer monitors\
    \ power,\nresources, responses, and services. The preprocessing layer\nperforms\
    \ filtering, processing, and analytics of sensor data.\nThe temporary storage\
    \ layer provides storage functionalities\nsuch as data replication, distribution,\
    \ and storage. Finally, the\nsecurity layer performs encryption/decryption and\
    \ ensures\ndata integrity and privacy. Monitoring and preprocessing are\ndone\
    \ on the edge of the network before sending data to the\ncloud.\nOften the terms\
    \ “fog computing” and “edge computing”\nare used interchangeably. The latter term\
    \ predates the former\nand is construed to be more generic. Fog computing originally\n\
    termed by Cisco refers to smart gateways and smart sensors,\nwhereas edge computing\
    \ is slightly more penetrative in nature.\nThis paradigm envisions adding smart\
    \ data preprocessing\ncapabilities to physical devices such as motors, pumps,\
    \ or\nlights. The aim is to do as much of preprocessing of data\nas possible in\
    \ these devices, which are termed to be at the\nStorage layer \nPreprocessing\
    \ layer \nMonitoring layer \nPhysical layer\nSecurity layer\nTransport layer\n\
    Figure 2: Fog architecture of a smart IoT gateway.\nedge of the network. In terms\
    \ of the system architecture,\nthe architectural diagram is not appreciably different\
    \ from\nFigure 2. As a result, we do not describe edge computing\nseparately.\n\
    Finally, the distinction between protocol architectures\nand system architectures\
    \ is not very crisp. Often the protocols\nand the system are codesigned. We shall\
    \ use the generic 5-\nlayer IoT protocol stack (architectural diagram presented\
    \ in\nFigure 2) for both the fog and cloud architectures.\n2.3. Social IoT. Let\
    \ us now discuss a new paradigm: social IoT\n(SIoT). Here, we consider social\
    \ relationships between objects\nthe same way as humans form social relationships\
    \ (see [14]).\nHere are the three main facets of an SIoT system:\n(i) The SIoT\
    \ is navigable. We can start with one device\nand navigate through all the devices\
    \ that are con-\nnected to it. It is easy to discover new devices and\nservices\
    \ using such a social network of IoT devices.\n(ii) A need of trustworthiness\
    \ (strength of the relation-\nship) is present between devices (similar to friends\
    \ on\nFacebook).\n(iii) We can use models similar to studying human social\nnetworks\
    \ to also study the social networks of IoT\ndevices.\n2.3.1. Basic Components.\
    \ In a typical social IoT setting, we\ntreat the devices and services as bots\
    \ where they can set up\nrelationships between them and modify them over time.\
    \ This\nwill allow us to seamlessly let the devices cooperate among\neach other\
    \ and achieve a complex task.\nTo make such a model work, we need to have many\n\
    interoperating components. Let us look at some of the major\ncomponents in such\
    \ a system.\n(1) ID: we need a unique method of object identifica-\ntion. An ID\
    \ can be assigned to an object based on\ntraditional parameters such as the MAC\
    \ ID, IPv6\nID, a universal product code, or some other custom\nmethod.\n4\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(2) Metainformation: along with an ID,\
    \ we need some\nmetainformation about the device that describes its\nform and\
    \ operation. This is required to establish\nappropriate relationships with the\
    \ device and also\nappropriately place it in the universe of IoT devices.\n(3)\
    \ Security controls: this is similar to “friend list” set-\ntings on Facebook.\
    \ An owner of a device might place\nrestrictions on the kinds of devices that\
    \ can connect\nto it. These are typically referred to as owner controls.\n(4)\
    \ Service discovery: such kind of a system is like\na service cloud, where we\
    \ need to have dedicated\ndirectories that store details of devices providing\n\
    certain kinds of services. It becomes very important\nto keep these directories\
    \ up to date such that devices\ncan learn about other devices.\n(5) Relationship\
    \ management: this module manages rela-\ntionships with other devices. It also\
    \ stores the types\nof devices that a given device should try to connect\nwith\
    \ based on the type of services provided. For\nexample, it makes sense for a light\
    \ controller to make\na relationship with a light sensor.\n(6) Service composition:\
    \ this module takes the social IoT\nmodel to a new level. The ultimate goal of\
    \ having such\na system is to provide better integrated services to\nusers. For\
    \ example, if a person has a power sensor\nwith her air conditioner and this device\
    \ establishes\na relationship with an analytics engine, then it is\npossible for\
    \ the ensemble to yield a lot of data about\nthe usage patterns of the air conditioner.\
    \ If the social\nmodel is more expansive, and there are many more\ndevices, then\
    \ it is possible to compare the data with\nthe usage patterns of other users and\
    \ come up with\neven more meaningful data. For example, users can\nbe told that\
    \ they are the largest energy consumers in\ntheir community or among their Facebook\
    \ friends.\n2.3.2. Representative Architecture. Most architectures pro-\nposed\
    \ for the SIoT have a server side architecture as well.\nThe server connects to\
    \ all the interconnected components,\naggregates (composes) the services, and\
    \ acts as a single point\nof service for users.\nThe server side architecture\
    \ typically has three layers. The\nfirst is the base layer that contains a database\
    \ that stores details\nof all the devices, their attributes, metainformation,\
    \ and their\nrelationships. The second layer (Component layer) contains\ncode\
    \ to interact with the devices, query their status, and use\na subset of them\
    \ to effect a service. The topmost layer is the\napplication layer, which provides\
    \ services to the users.\nOn the device (object) side, we broadly have two layers.\n\
    The first is the object layer, which allows a device to connect to\nother devices,\
    \ talk to them (via standardized protocols), and\nexchange information. The object\
    \ layer passes information to\nthe social layer. The social layer manages the\
    \ execution of\nusers’ applications, executes queries, and interacts with the\n\
    application layer on the server.\n3. Taxonomy\nLet us now propose taxonomy for\
    \ research in IoT tech-\nnologies (see Figure 3). Our taxonomy is based on the\n\
    architectural elements of IoT as presented in Section 2.\nThe first architectural\
    \ component of IoT is the perception\nlayer. It collects data using sensors, which\
    \ are the most\nimportant drivers of the Internet of Things [15]. There are\n\
    various types of sensors used in diverse IoT applications.\nThe most generic sensor\
    \ available today is the smartphone.\nThe smartphone itself has many types of\
    \ sensors embedded\nin it [16] such as the location sensor (GPS), movement\nsensors\
    \ (accelerometer, gyroscope), camera, light sensor,\nmicrophone, proximity sensor,\
    \ and magnetometer. These are\nbeing heavily used in different IoT applications.\
    \ Many other\ntypes of sensors are beginning to be used such as sensors for\n\
    measuring temperature, pressure, humidity, medical param-\neters of the body,\
    \ chemical and biochemical substances, and\nneural signals. A class of sensors\
    \ that stand out is infrared\nsensors that predate smartphones. They are now being\
    \ used\nwidely in many IoT applications: IR cameras, motion detec-\ntors, measuring\
    \ the distance to nearby objects, presence of\nsmoke and gases, and as moisture\
    \ sensors. We shall discuss\nthe different types of sensors used in IoT applications\
    \ in\nSection 5.\nSubsequently, we shall discuss related work in data pre-\nprocessing.\
    \ Such applications (also known as fog comput-\ning applications) mainly filter\
    \ and summarize data before\nsending it on the network. Such units typically have\
    \ a little\namount of temporary storage, a small processing unit, and\nsome security\
    \ features.\nThe next architectural component that we shall discuss\nis communication.\
    \ We shall discuss related work (in Sec-\ntion 7) on different communication technologies\
    \ used for\nthe Internet of Things. Different entities communicate over\nthe network\
    \ [17–19] using a diverse set of protocols and\nstandards. The most common communication\
    \ technologies\nfor short range low power communication protocols are\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identification) and NFC (Near Field\nCommunication). For the medium\
    \ range, they are Bluetooth,\nZigbee, and WiFi. Communication in the IoT world\
    \ requires\nspecial networking protocols and mechanisms. Therefore,\nnew mechanisms\
    \ and protocols have been proposed and\nimplemented for each layer of the networking\
    \ stack, accord-\ning to the requirements imposed by IoT devices.\nWe shall subsequently\
    \ look at two kinds of software com-\nponents: middleware and applications. The\
    \ middleware cre-\nates an abstraction for the programmer such that the details\n\
    of the hardware can be hidden. This enhances interoperability\nof smart things\
    \ and makes it easy to offer different kinds of\nservices [20]. There are many\
    \ commercial and open source\nofferings for providing middleware services to IoT\
    \ devices.\nSome examples are OpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], Hydra\n[23], FiWare\
    \ [24], and Oracle Fusion Middleware. Finally, we\ndiscuss the applications of\
    \ IoT in Section 9. We primarily\nfocus on home automation, ambient assisted living,\
    \ health\nand fitness, smart vehicular systems, smart cities, smart\nenvironments,\
    \ smart grids, social life, and entertainment.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of research in IoT technologies.\n4. Related Survey Papers\nOur taxonomy describes\
    \ the technologies in the IoT domain\nand is classified on the basis of architectural\
    \ layers. We\nhave tried to cover all subareas and recent technologies in\nour\
    \ taxonomy. There have been many survey papers on the\nInternet of Things in the\
    \ past. Table 1 shows how our survey\nis different from other highly cited surveys\
    \ in the literature.\nLet us first consider our novel contributions. Our paper\n\
    looks at each and every layer in the IoT stack, and as a\nresult the presentation\
    \ is also far more balanced. A novel\naddition in our survey is that we have discussed\
    \ different IoT\narchitectures. This has not been discussed in prior surveys on\n\
    the Internet of Things. The architecture section also considers\nnewer paradigms\
    \ such as fog computing, which have also\nhitherto not been considered. Moreover,\
    \ our survey nicely\ncategorizes technologies based on the architectural layer\n\
    that they belong to. We have also thoroughly categorized\nthe network layer and\
    \ tried to consolidate almost all the\ntechnologies that are used in IoT systems.\
    \ Such kind of a\nthorough categorization and presentation of technologies is\n\
    novel to the best of our knowledge.\nAlong with these novel contributions our\
    \ survey is far\nmore comprehensive, detailed, and exhaustive as compared\nto\
    \ other surveys in the area. Most of the other surveys look\nat only one or two\
    \ types of sensors, whereas we describe\n9 types of sensors with many examples.\
    \ Other surveys\nare also fairly restricted when they discuss communication\n\
    technologies and applications. We have discussed many types\nof middleware technologies\
    \ as well. Prior works have not\ngiven middleware technologies this level of attention.\
    \ We\ncover 10 communication technologies in detail and consider\na large variety\
    \ of applications encompassing smart homes,\nhealth care, logistics, transport,\
    \ agriculture, environment,\nsmart cities, and green energy. No other survey in\
    \ this area\nprofiles so many technologies, applications, and use cases.\n5. Sensors\
    \ and Actuators\nAll IoT applications need to have one or more sensors to\ncollect\
    \ data from the environment. Sensors are essential\ncomponents of smart objects.\
    \ One of the most important\naspects of the Internet of Things is context awareness,\
    \ which\nis not possible without sensor technology. IoT sensors are\nmostly small\
    \ in size, have low cost, and consume less power.\nThey are constrained by factors\
    \ such as battery capacity and\nease of deployment. Schmidt and Van Laerhoven\
    \ [25] provide\nan overview of various types of sensors used for building\nsmart\
    \ applications.\n5.1. Mobile Phone Based Sensors. First of all, let us look at\n\
    the mobile phone, which is ubiquitous and has many types\nof sensors embedded\
    \ in it. In specific, the smartphone is\na very handy and user friendly device\
    \ that has a host of\nbuilt in communication and data processing features. With\n\
    the increasing popularity of smartphones among people,\nresearchers are showing\
    \ interest in building smart IoT solu-\ntions using smartphones because of the\
    \ embedded sensors\n[16, 26]. Some additional sensors can also be used depending\n\

    \ can be built on the\nsmartphone that uses sensor data to produce meaningful\n\
    results. Some of the sensors inside a modern smartphone are\nas follows.\n(1)\
    \ The accelerometer senses the motion and acceleration\nof a mobile phone. It\
    \ typically measures changes in\nvelocity of the smartphone in three dimensions.\
    \ There\nare many types of accelerometers [27].\nIn a mechanical accelerometer,\
    \ we have a seismic\nmass in a housing, which is tied to the housing\nwith a spring.\
    \ The mass takes time to move and is\nleft behind as the housing moves, so the\
    \ force in\nthe spring can be correlated with the acceleration.\nIn a capacitive\
    \ accelerometer, capacitive plates are\nused with the same setup. With a change\
    \ in velocity,\nthe mass pushes the capacitive plates together, thus\nchanging\
    \ the capacitance. The rate of change of\ncapacitance is then converted into acceleration.\
    \ In\na piezoelectric accelerometer, piezoelectric crystals\nare used, which when\
    \ squeezed generate an electric\nvoltage. The changes in voltage can be translated\
    \ into\nacceleration.\nThe data patterns captured by the accelerometer can\nbe\
    \ used to detect physical activities of the user such as\nrunning, walking, and\
    \ bicycling.\n(2) The gyroscope detects the orientation of the phone\nvery precisely.\
    \ Orientation is measured using capac-\nitive changes when a seismic mass moves\
    \ in a partic-\nular direction.\n(3) The camera and microphone are very powerful\
    \ sen-\nsors since they capture visual and audio information,\nwhich can then\
    \ be analyzed and processed to detect\nvarious types of contextual information.\
    \ For example,\nwe can infer a user’s current environment and the\ninteractions\
    \ that she is having. To make sense of the\naudio data, technologies such as voice\
    \ recognition\nand acoustic features can be exploited.\n(4) The magnetometer detects\
    \ magnetic fields. This can\nbe used as a digital compass and in applications\
    \ to\ndetect the presence of metals.\n(5) The GPS (Global Positioning System)\
    \ detects the\nlocation of the phone, which is one of the most\nimportant pieces\
    \ of contextual information for smart\napplications. The location is detected\
    \ using the prin-\nciple of trilateration [28]. The distance is measured\nfrom\
    \ three or more satellites (or mobile phone towers\nin the case of A-GPS) and\
    \ coordinates are computed.\n(6) The light sensor detects the intensity of ambient\
    \ light.\nIt can be used for setting the brightness of the screen\nand other applications\
    \ in which some action is to be\ntaken depending on the intensity of ambient light.\
    \ For\nexample, we can control the lights in a room.\n(7) The proximity sensor\
    \ uses an infrared (IR) LED,\nwhich emits IR rays. These rays bounce back when\n\
    they strike some object. Based on the difference in\ntime, we can calculate the\
    \ distance. In this way, the\ndistance to different objects from the phone can\
    \ be\nmeasured. For example, we can use it to determine\nwhen the phone is close\
    \ to the face while talking. It\ncan also be used in applications in which we\
    \ have\nto trigger some event when an object approaches the\nphone.\n(8) Some\
    \ smartphones such as Samsung’s Galaxy S4 also\nhave a thermometer, barometer,\
    \ and humidity sensor\nto measure the temperature, atmospheric pressure,\nand\
    \ humidity, respectively.\nWe have studied many smart applications that use sensor\n\
    data collected from smartphones. For example, activity detec-\ntion [29] is achieved\
    \ by applying machine learning algorithms\nto the data collected by smartphone\
    \ sensors. It detects activi-\nties such as running, going up and down stairs,\
    \ walking, driv-\ning, and cycling. The application is trained with patterns of\n\
    data using data sets recorded by sensors when these activities\nare being performed.\n\
    Many health and fitness applications are being built to\nkeep track of a person’s\
    \ health continuously using smart-\nphones. They keep track of users’ physical\
    \ activities, diet,\nexercises, and lifestyle to determine the fitness level and\n\
    give suggestions to the user accordingly. Wang et al. [30]\ndescribe a mobile\
    \ application that is based completely on a\nsmartphone. They use it to assess\
    \ the overall mental health\nand performance of a college student. To track the\
    \ location\nand activities in which the student is involved, activity\nrecognition\
    \ (accelerometer) and GPS data are used. To keep\na check on how much the student\
    \ sleeps, the accelerometer\nand light sensors are used. For social life and conversations,\n\
    audio data from a microphone is used. The application also\nconducts quick questionnaires\
    \ with the students to know\nabout their mood. All this data can be used to assess\
    \ the stress\nlevels, social life, behavior, and exercise patterns of a student.\n\
    Another application by McClernon and Choudhury [31]\ndetects when the user is\
    \ going to smoke using context\ninformation such as the presence of other smokers,\
    \ location,\nand associated activities. The sensors provide information\nrelated\
    \ to the user’s movement, location, visual images, and\nsurrounding sounds. To\
    \ summarize smartphone sensors are\nbeing used to study different kinds of human\
    \ behavior (see\n[32]) and to improve the quality of human life.\n5.2. Medical\
    \ Sensors. The Internet of Things can be really\nbeneficial for health care applications.\
    \ We can use sensors,\nwhich can measure and monitor various medical parameters\n\
    in the human body [33]. These applications can aim at\nmonitoring a patient’s\
    \ health when they are not in hospital or\nwhen they are alone. Subsequently,\
    \ they can provide real time\nfeedback to the doctor, relatives, or the patient.\
    \ McGrath and\nScanaill [34] have described in detail the different sensors that\n\
    can be worn on the body for monitoring a person’s health.\nThere are many wearable\
    \ sensing devices available in the\nmarket. They are equipped with medical sensors\
    \ that are\ncapable of measuring different parameters such as the heart\nrate,\
    \ pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration\nrate, and blood glucose\
    \ levels [35]. These wearables include\n8\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nFigure 4: Smart watches and fitness trackers (source:https://www\n\
    .pebble.com/ and http://www.fitbit.com/).\nFigure 5: Embedded skin patches (source:\
    \ MC10 Electronics).\nsmart watches, wristbands, monitoring patches, and smart\n\
    textiles.\nMoreover, smart watches and fitness trackers are becom-\ning fairly\
    \ popular in the market as companies such as Apple,\nSamsung, and Sony are coming\
    \ up with very innovative\nfeatures. For example, a smart watch includes features\
    \ such\nas connectivity with a smartphone, sensors such as an\naccelerometer,\
    \ and a heart rate monitor (see Figure 4).\nAnother novel IoT device, which has\
    \ a lot of promise are\nmonitoring patches that are pasted on the skin. Monitoring\n\
    patches are like tattoos. They are stretchable and disposable\nand are very cheap.\
    \ These patches are supposed to be worn\nby the patient for a few days to monitor\
    \ a vital health\nparameter continuously [15]. All the electronic components\n\
    are embedded in these rubbery structures. They can even\ntransmit the sensed data\
    \ wirelessly. Just like a tattoo, these\npatches can be applied on the skin as\
    \ shown in Figure 5.\nOne of the most common applications of such patches is to\n\
    monitor blood pressure.\nA very important consideration here is the context [34].\n\
    The data collected by the medical sensors must be combined\nwith contextual information\
    \ such as physical activity. For\nexample, the heart rate depends on the context.\
    \ It increases\nwhen we exercise. In that case, we cannot infer abnormal\nheart\
    \ rate. Therefore, we need to combine data from different\nsensors for making\
    \ the correct inference.\nFigure 6: Brain sensing headband with embedded neurosensors\n\
    (source: http://www.choosemuse.com/).\n5.3. Neural Sensors. Today, it is possible\
    \ to understand\nneural signals in the brain, infer the state of the brain, and\n\
    train it for better attention and focus. This is known as\nneurofeedback [36]\
    \ (see Figure 6). The technology used for\nreading brain signals is called EEG\
    \ (Electroencephalography)\nor a brain computer interface. The neurons inside\
    \ the brain\ncommunicate electronically and create an electric field, which\n\
    can be measured from outside in terms of frequencies. Brain\nwaves can be categorized\
    \ into alpha, beta, gamma, theta, and\ndelta waves depending upon the frequency.\n\
    Based on the type of wave, it can be inferred whether\nthe brain is calm or wandering\
    \ in thoughts. This type of\nneurofeedback can be obtained in real time and can\
    \ be used\nto train the brain to focus, pay better attention towards things,\n\
    manage stress, and have better mental well-being.\n5.4. Environmental and Chemical\
    \ Sensors. Environmental\nsensors are used to sense parameters in the physical\
    \ environ-\nment such as temperature, humidity, pressure, water pollu-\ntion,\
    \ and air pollution. Parameters such as the temperature\nand pressure can be measured\
    \ with a thermometer and\nbarometer. Air quality can be measured with sensors,\
    \ which\nsense the presence of gases and other particulate matter in the\nair\
    \ (refer to Sekhar et al. [37] for more details).\nChemical sensors are used to\
    \ detect chemical and bio-\nchemical substances. These sensors consist of a recognition\n\
    element and a transducer. The electronic nose (e-nose) and\nelectronic tongue\
    \ (e-tongue) are technologies that can be\nused to sense chemicals on the basis\
    \ of odor and taste,\nrespectively [38]. The e-nose and e-tongue consist of an\
    \ array\nof chemical sensors coupled with advance pattern recognition\nsoftware.\
    \ The sensors inside the e-nose and e-tongue produce\ncomplex data, which is then\
    \ analyzed through pattern recog-\nnition to identify the stimulus.\nThese sensors\
    \ can be used in monitoring the pollution\nlevel in smart cities [39], keeping\
    \ a check on food quality\nin smart kitchens, testing food, and agricultural products\
    \ in\nsupply chain applications.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\
    9\n5.5. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). RFID is an iden-\ntification technology\
    \ in which an RFID tag (a small chip with\nan antenna) carries data, which is\
    \ read by a RFID reader. The\ntag transmits the data stored in it via radio waves.\
    \ It is similar\nto bar code technology. But unlike a traditional bar code, it\n\
    does not require line of sight communication between the tag\nand the reader and\
    \ can identify itself from a distance even\nwithout a human operator. The range\
    \ of RFID varies with the\nfrequency. It can go up to hundreds of meters.\nRFID\
    \ tags are of two types: active and passive. Active tags\nhave a power source\
    \ and passive tags do not have any power\nsource. Passive tags draw power from\
    \ the electromagnetic\nwaves emitted by the reader and are thus cheap and have\
    \ a\nlong lifetime [40, 41].\nThere are two types of RFID technologies: near and\
    \ far\n[40]. A near RFID reader uses a coil through which we pass\nalternating\
    \ current and generate a magnetic field. The tag has\na smaller coil, which generates\
    \ a potential due to the ambient\nchanges in the magnetic field. This voltage\
    \ is then coupled\nwith a capacitor to accumulate a charge, which then powers\n\
    up the tag chip. The tag can then produce a small magnetic\nfield that encodes\
    \ the signal to be transmitted, and this can\nbe picked up by the reader.\nIn\
    \ far RFID, there is a dipole antenna in the reader, which\npropagates EM waves.\
    \ The tag also has a dipole antenna on\nwhich an alternating potential difference\
    \ appears and it is\npowered up. It can then use this power to transmit messages.\n\
    RFID technology is being used in various applications\nsuch as supply chain management,\
    \ access control, identity\nauthentication, and object tracking. The RFID tag\
    \ is attached\nto the object to be tracked and the reader detects and records\n\
    its presence when the object passes by it. In this manner,\nobject movement can\
    \ be tracked and RFID can serve as a\nsearch engine for smart things.\nFor access\
    \ control, an RFID tag is attached to the\nauthorized object. For example, small\
    \ chips are glued to the\nfront of vehicles. When the car reaches a barricade\
    \ on which\nthere is a reader, it reads the tag data and decides whether it\n\
    is an authorized car. If yes, it opens automatically. RFID cards\nare issued to\
    \ the people, who can then be identified by a RFID\nreader and given access accordingly.\n\
    The low level data collected from the RFID tags can be\ntransformed into higher\
    \ level insights in IoT applications\n[42]. There are many user level tools available,\
    \ in which all the\ndata collected by particular RFID readers and data associated\n\
    with the RFID tags can be managed. The high level data can\nbe used to draw inferences\
    \ and take further action.\n5.6. Actuators. Let us look at some examples of actuators\
    \ that\nare used in the Internet of Things. An actuator is a device,\nwhich can\
    \ effect a change in the environment by converting\nelectrical energy into some\
    \ form of useful energy. Some\nexamples are heating or cooling elements, speakers,\
    \ lights,\ndisplays, and motors.\nThe actuators, which induce motion, can be classified\
    \ into\nthree categories, namely, electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic\nactuators\
    \ depending on their operation. Hydraulic actuators\nfacilitate mechanical motion\
    \ using fluid or hydraulic power.\nPneumatic actuators use the pressure of compressed\
    \ air and\nelectrical ones use electrical energy.\nAs an example, we can consider\
    \ a smart home system,\nwhich consists of many sensors and actuators. The actuators\n\
    are used to lock/unlock the doors, switch on/off the lights or\nother electrical\
    \ appliances, alert users of any threats through\nalarms or notifications, and\
    \ control the temperature of a\nhome (via a thermostat).\nA sophisticated example\
    \ of an actuator used in IoT is\na digital finger, which is used to turn on/off\
    \ the switches\n(or anything which requires small motion) and is controlled\n\
    wirelessly.\n6. Preprocessing\nAs smart things collect huge amount of sensor data,\
    \ compute\nand storage resources are required to analyze, store, and\nprocess\
    \ this data. The most common compute and storage\nresources are cloud based because\
    \ the cloud offers massive\ndata handling, scalability, and flexibility. But this\
    \ will not be\nsufficient to meet the requirements of many IoT applications\n\
    because of the following reasons [43].\n(1) Mobility: most of the smart devices\
    \ are mobile. Their\nchanging location makes it difficult to communicate\nwith\
    \ the cloud data center because of changing net-\nwork conditions across different\
    \ locations.\n(2) Reliable and real time actuation: communicating with\nthe cloud\
    \ and getting back responses takes time.\nLatency sensitive applications, which\
    \ need real time\nresponses, may not be feasible with this model. Also,\nthe communication\
    \ may be lossy due to wireless links,\nwhich can lead to unreliable data.\n(3)\
    \ Scalability: more devices means more requests to the\ncloud, thereby increasing\
    \ the latency.\n(4) Power constraints: communication consumes a lot of\npower,\
    \ and IoT devices are battery powered. They\nthus cannot afford to communicate\
    \ all the time.\nTo solve the problem of mobility, researchers have pro-\nposed\
    \ mobile cloud computing (MCC) [44]. But there are\nstill problems associated\
    \ with latency and power. MCC also\nsuffers from mobility problems such as frequently\
    \ changing\nnetwork conditions due to which problems such as signal\nfading and\
    \ service degradation arise.\nAs a solution to these problems, we can bring some\n\
    compute and storage resources to the edge of the network\ninstead of relying on\
    \ the cloud for everything. This concept\nis known as fog computing [11, 45] (also\
    \ see Section 2.2).\nThe fog can be viewed as a cloud, which is close to the\n\
    ground. Data can be stored, processed, filtered, and analyzed\non the edge of\
    \ the network before sending it to the cloud\nthrough expensive communication\
    \ media. The fog and cloud\nparadigms go together. Both of them are required for\
    \ the\noptimal performance of IoT applications. A smart gateway\n[13] can be employed\
    \ between underlying networks and the\ncloud to realize fog computing as shown\
    \ in Figure 7.\nThe features of fog computing [11] are as follows:\n(1) Low latency:\
    \ less time is required to access computing\nand storage resources on fog nodes\
    \ (smart gateways).\n10\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nSmart\
    \ devices\nSmart gateway\nLocal real time analysis \npreprocessing\nﬁltering\n\
    Cloud data center \nGlobal data analytics\nstorage\ndata\ndata\nFigure 7: Smart\
    \ gateway for preprocessing.\n(2) Location awareness: as the fog is located on\
    \ the edge\nof the network, it is aware of the location of the\napplications and\
    \ their context. This is beneficial as\ncontext awareness is an important feature\
    \ of IoT\napplications.\n(3) Distributed nodes: fog nodes are distributed unlike\n\
    centralized cloud nodes. Multiple fog nodes need to\nbe deployed in distributed\
    \ geographical areas in order\nto provide services to mobile devices in those\
    \ areas.\nFor example, in vehicular networks, deploying fog\nnodes at highways\
    \ can provide low latency data/video\nstreaming to vehicles.\n(4) Mobility: the\
    \ fog supports mobility as smart devices\ncan directly communicate with smart\
    \ gateways\npresent in their proximity.\n(5) Real time response: fog nodes can\
    \ give an immediate\nresponse unlike the cloud, which has a much greater\nlatency.\n\
    (6) Interaction with the cloud: fog nodes can further\ninteract with the cloud\
    \ and communicate only that\ndata, which is required to be sent to the cloud.\n\
    The tasks performed by a smart gateway [46] are col-\nlecting sensor data, preprocessing\
    \ and filtering collected\ndata, providing compute, storage and networking services\n\
    to IoT devices, communicating with the cloud and sending\nonly necessary data,\
    \ monitoring power consumption of IoT\ndevices, monitoring activities and services\
    \ of IoT devices, and\nensuring security and privacy of data. Some applications\
    \ of\nfog computing are as follows [10, 11]:\n(1) Smart vehicular networks: smart\
    \ traffic lights are\ndeployed as smart gateways to locally detect pedes-\ntrians\
    \ and vehicles through sensors, calculate their\ndistance and speed, and finally\
    \ infer traffic conditions.\nThis is used to warn oncoming vehicles. These sensors\n\
    also interact with neighboring smart traffic lights\nto perform traffic management\
    \ tasks. For example,\nif sensors detect an approaching ambulance, they\ncan change\
    \ the traffic lights to let the ambulance\npass first and also inform other lights\
    \ to do so. The\ndata collected by these smart traffic lights are locally\nanalyzed\
    \ in real time to serve real time needs of traffic\nmanagement. Further, data\
    \ from multiple gateways\nis combined and sent to the cloud for further global\n\
    analysis of traffic in the city.\n(2) Smart grid: the smart electrical grid facilitates\
    \ load\nbalancing of energy on the basis of usage and avail-\nability. This is\
    \ done in order to switch automatically\nto alternative sources of energy such\
    \ as solar and\nwind power. This balancing can be done at the edge\nof the network\
    \ using smart meters or microgrids\nconnected by smart gateways. These gateways\
    \ can\nanalyze and process data. They can then project future\nenergy demand,\
    \ calculate the availability and price of\npower, and supply power from both conventional\
    \ and\nalternative sources to consumers.\n7. Communication\nAs the Internet of\
    \ Things is growing very rapidly, there are a\nlarge number of heterogeneous smart\
    \ devices connecting to\nthe Internet. IoT devices are battery powered, with minimal\n\
    compute and storage resources. Because of their constrained\nnature, there are\
    \ various communication challenges involved,\nwhich are as follows [19]:\n(1)\
    \ Addressing and identification: since millions of smart\nthings will be connected\
    \ to the Internet, they will\nhave to be identified through a unique address,\
    \ on the\nbasis of which they communicate with each other. For\nthis, we need\
    \ a large addressing space, and a unique\naddress for each smart object.\n(2)\
    \ Low power communication: communication of data\nbetween devices is a power consuming\
    \ task, specially,\nwireless communication. Therefore, we need a solu-\ntion that\
    \ facilitates communication with low power\nconsumption.\n(3) Routing protocols\
    \ with low memory requirement and\nefficient communication patterns.\n(4) High\
    \ speed and nonlossy communication.\n(5) Mobility of smart things.\nIoT devices\
    \ typically connect to the Internet through\nthe IP (Internet Protocol) stack.\
    \ This stack is very complex\nand demands a large amount of power and memory from\n\
    the connecting devices. The IoT devices can also connect\nlocally through non-IP\
    \ networks, which consume less power,\nand connect to the Internet via a smart\
    \ gateway. Non-IP\ncommunication channels such as Bluetooth, RFID, and NFC\nare\
    \ fairly popular but are limited in their range (up to a\nfew meters). Therefore,\
    \ their applications are limited to small\npersonal area networks. Personal area\
    \ networks (PAN) are\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n11\nbeing\
    \ widely used in IoT applications such as wearables\nconnected to smartphones.\
    \ For increasing the range of such\nlocal networks, there was a need to modify\
    \ the IP stack so as to\nfacilitate low power communication using the IP stack.\
    \ One\nof the solutions is 6LoWPAN, which incorporates IPv6 with\nlow power personal\
    \ area networks. The range of a PAN with\n6LoWPAN is similar to local area networks,\
    \ and the power\nconsumption is much lower.\nThe leading communication technologies\
    \ used in the IoT\nworld are IEEE 802.15.4, low power WiFi, 6LoWPAN, RFID,\nNFC,\
    \ Sigfox, LoraWAN, and other proprietary protocols for\nwireless networks.\n7.1.\
    \ Near Field Communication (NFC). Near Field Communi-\ncation [47–49] is a very\
    \ short range wireless communication\ntechnology, through which mobile devices\
    \ can interact with\neach other over a distance of few centimeters only. All types\
    \ of\ndata can be transferred between two NFC enabled devices in\nseconds by bringing\
    \ them close to each other. This technology\nis based on RFID. It uses variations\
    \ in the magnetic field\nto communicate data between two NFC enabled devices.\n\
    NFC operates over a frequency band of 13.56 MHz, which is\nthe same as high frequency\
    \ RFID. There are two modes of\noperation: active and passive. In the active mode,\
    \ both the\ndevices generate magnetic fields, while in the passive mode,\nonly\
    \ one device generates the field and the other uses load\nmodulation to transfer\
    \ the data. The passive mode is useful in\nbattery powered devices to optimize\
    \ energy use. One benefit\nof the requirement of close proximity between devices\
    \ is that\nit is useful for secure transactions such as payments. Finally,\nnote\
    \ that NFC can be used for two-way communication\nunlike RFID. Consequently, almost\
    \ all smartphones in the\nmarket today are NFC enabled.\n7.2. Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks (WSN) Based on IP for Smart\nObjects. Many times, data from a single\
    \ sensor is not useful\nin monitoring large areas and complex activities. Different\n\
    sensor nodes need to interact with each other wirelessly. The\ndisadvantage of\
    \ non-IP technologies such as RFID, NFC,\nand Bluetooth is that their range is\
    \ very small. So, they\ncannot be used in many applications, where a large area\
    \ needs\nto be monitored through many sensor nodes deployed in\ndiverse locations.\
    \ A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists\nof tens to thousands of sensor nodes\
    \ connected using wireless\ntechnologies. They collect data about the environment\
    \ and\ncommunicate it to gateway devices that relay the information\nto the cloud\
    \ over the Internet. The communication between\nnodes in a WSN may be direct or\
    \ multihop. The sensor nodes\nare of a constrained nature, but gateway nodes have\
    \ suffi-\ncient power and processing resources. The popular network\ntopologies\
    \ used in a WSN are a star, a mesh, and a hybrid\nnetwork. Most of the communication\
    \ in WSN is based on the\nIEEE 802.15.4 standard (discussed in Section 7.3). There\
    \ are\nclearly a lot of protocols that can be used in IoT scenarios.\nLet us discuss\
    \ the design of a typical IoT network protocol\nstack with the most popular alternatives.\n\
    7.3. IoT Network Protocol Stack. The Internet Engineering\nTask Force (IETF) has\
    \ developed alternative protocols for\ncommunication between IoT devices using\
    \ IP because IP is a\nflexible and reliable standard [50, 51]. The Internet Protocol\n\
    for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance has published various\nwhite papers describing\
    \ alternative protocols and standards\nfor the layers of the IP stack and an additional\
    \ adaptation\nlayer, which is used for communication [51–54] between\nsmart objects.\n\
    (1) Physical and MAC Layer (IEEE 802.15.4). The IEEE\n802.15.4 protocol is designed\
    \ for enabling communication\nbetween compact and inexpensive low power embedded\n\
    devices that need a long battery life. It defines standards and\nprotocols for\
    \ the physical and link (MAC) layer of the IP\nstack. It supports low power communication\
    \ along with low\ncost and short range communication. In the case of such\nresource\
    \ constrained environments, we need a small frame\nsize, low bandwidth, and low\
    \ transmit power.\nTransmission requires very little power (maximum one\nmilliwatt),\
    \ which is only one percent of that used in WiFi or\ncellular networks. This limits\
    \ the range of communication.\nBecause of the limited range, the devices have\
    \ to operate\ncooperatively in order to enable multihop routing over\nlonger distances.\
    \ As a result, the packet size is limited to\n127 bytes only, and the rate of\
    \ communication is limited to\n250 kbps. The coding scheme in IEEE 802.15.4 has\
    \ built in\nredundancy, which makes the communication robust, allows\nus to detect\
    \ losses, and enables the retransmission of lost\npackets. The protocol also supports\
    \ short 16-bit link addresses\nto decrease the size of the header, communication\
    \ overheads,\nand memory requirements [55].\nReaders can refer to the survey by\
    \ Vasseur et al. [54]\nfor more information on different physical and link layer\n\
    technologies for communication between smart objects.\n(2) Adaptation Layer. IPv6\
    \ is considered the best protocol for\ncommunication in the IoT domain because\
    \ of its scalability\nand stability. Such bulky IP protocols were initially not\n\
    thought to be suitable for communication in scenarios with\nlow power wireless\
    \ links such as IEEE 802.15.4.\n6LoWPAN, an acronym for IPv6 over low power wireless\n\
    personal area networks, is a very popular standard for\nwireless communication.\
    \ It enables communication using\nIPv6 over the IEEE 802.15.4 [52] protocol. This\
    \ standard\ndefines an adaptation layer between the 802.15.4 link layer\nand the\
    \ transport layer. 6LoWPAN devices can communicate\nwith all other IP based devices\
    \ on the Internet. The choice\nof IPv6 is because of the large addressing space\
    \ available\nin IPv6. 6LoWPAN networks connect to the Internet via a\ngateway\
    \ (WiFi or Ethernet), which also has protocol support\nfor conversion between\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 as today’s deployed\nInternet is mostly IPv4. IPv6 headers are\
    \ not small enough\nto fit within the small 127 byte MTU of the 802.15.4 standard.\n\
    Hence, squeezing and fragmenting the packets to carry\nonly the essential information\
    \ is an optimization that the\nadaptation layer performs.\nSpecifically, the adaptation\
    \ layer performs the following\nthree optimizations in order to reduce communication\
    \ over-\nhead [55]:\n12\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(i) Header\
    \ compression 6loWPAN defines header com-\npression of IPv6 packets for decreasing\
    \ the overhead\nof IPv6. Some of the fields are deleted because they\ncan be derived\
    \ from link level information or can be\nshared across packets.\n(ii) Fragmentation:\
    \ the minimum MTU size (maximum\ntransmission unit) of IPv6 is 1280 bytes. On\
    \ the other\nhand, the maximum size of a frame in IEEE 802.15.4\nis 127 bytes.\
    \ Therefore, we need to fragment the IPv6\npacket. This is done by the adaptation\
    \ layer.\n(iii) Link layer forwarding 6LoWPAN also supports mesh\nunder routing,\
    \ which is done at the link layer using\nlink level short addresses instead of\
    \ in the network\nlayer. This feature can be used to communicate within\na 6LoWPAN\
    \ network.\n(3) Network Layer. The network layer is responsible for\nrouting the\
    \ packets received from the transport layer. The\nIETF Routing over Low Power\
    \ and Lossy Networks (ROLL)\nworking group has developed a routing protocol (RPL)\
    \ for\nLow Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) [53].\nFor such networks, RPL is an\
    \ open routing protocol,\nbased on distance vectors. It describes how a destination\n\
    oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) is built with\nthe nodes after they exchange\
    \ distance vectors. A set of\nconstraints and an objective function is used to\
    \ build the\ngraph with the best path [53]. The objective function and\nconstraints\
    \ may differ with respect to their requirements. For\nexample, constraints can\
    \ be to avoid battery powered nodes\nor to prefer encrypted links. The objective\
    \ function can aim\nto minimize the latency or the expected number of packets\n\
    that need to be sent.\nThe making of this graph starts from the root node. The\n\
    root starts sending messages to neighboring nodes, which\nthen process the message\
    \ and decide whether to join or not\ndepending upon the constraints and the objective\
    \ function.\nSubsequently, they forward the message to their neighbors.\nIn this\
    \ manner, the message travels till the leaf nodes and a\ngraph is formed. Now\
    \ all the nodes in the graph can send\npackets upwards hop by hop to the root.\
    \ We can realize a point\nto point routing algorithm as follows. We send packets\
    \ to a\ncommon ancestor, from which it travels downwards (towards\nleaves) to\
    \ reach the destination.\nTo manage the memory requirements of nodes, nodes are\n\
    classified into storing and nonstoring nodes depending upon\ntheir ability to\
    \ store routing information. When nodes are in a\nnonstoring mode and a downward\
    \ path is being constructed,\nthe route information is attached to the incoming\
    \ message\nand forwarded further till the root. The root receives the\nwhole path\
    \ in the message and sends a data packet along with\nthe path message to the destination\
    \ hop by hop. But there is\na trade-off here because nonstoring nodes need more\
    \ power\nand bandwidth to send additional route information as they\ndo not have\
    \ the memory to store routing tables.\n(4) Transport Layer. TCP is not a good\
    \ option for communi-\ncation in low power environments as it has a large overhead\n\
    owing to the fact that it is a connection oriented protocol.\nTherefore, UDP is\
    \ preferred because it is a connectionless\nprotocol and has low overhead.\n(5)\
    \ Application Layer. The application layer is responsible for\ndata formatting\
    \ and presentation. The application layer in\nthe Internet is typically based\
    \ on HTTP. However, HTTP is\nnot suitable in resource constrained environments\
    \ because\nit is fairly verbose in nature and thus incurs a large parsing\noverhead.\
    \ Many alternate protocols have been developed for\nIoT environments such as CoAP\
    \ (Constrained Application\nProtocol) and MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport).\n\
    (a) Constrained Application Protocol: CoAP can be\nthought of as an alternative\
    \ to HTTP. It is used\nin most IoT applications [56, 57]. Unlike HTTP, it\nincorporates\
    \ optimizations for constrained applica-\ntion environments [50]. It uses the\
    \ EXI (Efficient\nXML Interchanges) data format, which is a binary\ndata format\
    \ and is far more efficient in terms of\nspace as compared to plain text HTML/XML.\
    \ Other\nsupported features are built in header compression,\nresource discovery,\
    \ autoconfiguration, asynchronous\nmessage exchange, congestion control, and support\n\
    for multicast messages. There are four types of mes-\nsages in CoAP: nonconfirmable,\
    \ confirmable, reset\n(nack), and acknowledgement. For reliable transmis-\nsion\
    \ over UDP, confirmable messages are used [58].\nThe response can be piggybacked\
    \ in the acknowledge-\nment itself. Furthermore, it uses DTLS (Datagram\nTransport\
    \ Layer Security) for security purposes.\n(b) Message Queue Telemetry Transport:\
    \ MQTT is a\npublish/subscribe protocol that runs over TCP. It was\ndeveloped\
    \ by IBM [59] primarily as a client/server\nprotocol. The clients are publishers/subscribers\
    \ and\nthe server acts as a broker to which clients connect\nthrough TCP. Clients\
    \ can publish or subscribe to a\ntopic. This communication takes place through\
    \ the\nbroker whose job is to coordinate subscriptions and\nalso authenticate\
    \ the client for security. MQTT is\na lightweight protocol, which makes it suitable\
    \ for\nIoT applications. But because of the fact that it runs\nover TCP, it cannot\
    \ be used with all types of IoT\napplications. Moreover, it uses text for topic\
    \ names,\nwhich increases its overhead.\nMQTT-S/MQTT-SN is an extension of MQTT\
    \ [60],\nwhich is designed for low power and low cost devices. It is\nbased on\
    \ MQTT but has some optimizations for WSNs as\nfollows [61]. The topic names are\
    \ replaced by topic IDs, which\nreduce the overheads of transmission. Topics do\
    \ not need\nregistration as they are preregistered. Messages are also split\n\
    so that only the necessary information is sent. Further, for\npower conservation,\
    \ there is an offline procedure for clients\nwho are in a sleep state. Messages\
    \ can be buffered and later\nread by clients when they wake up. Clients connect\
    \ to the\nbroker through a gateway device, which resides within the\nsensor network\
    \ and connects to the broker.\n7.4. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Bluetooth Low\
    \ Energy, also\nknown as “Bluetooth Smart,” was developed by the Bluetooth\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n13\nSpecial Interest Group. It has a\
    \ relatively shorter range and\nconsumes lower energy as compared to competing\
    \ protocols.\nThe BLE protocol stack is similar to the stack used in classic\n\
    Bluetooth technology. It has two parts: controller and host.\nThe physical and\
    \ link layer are implemented in the controller.\nThe controller is typically a\
    \ SOC (System on Chip) with a\nradio. The functionalities of upper layers are\
    \ included in the\nhost [62]. BLE is not compatible with classic Bluetooth. Let\n\
    us look at the differences between classic Bluetooth and BLE\n[63, 64].\nThe main\
    \ difference is that BLE does not support data\nstreaming. Instead, it supports\
    \ quick transfer of small packets\nof data (packet size is small) with a data\
    \ rate of 1 Mbps.\nThere are two types of devices in BLE: master and slave.\n\
    The master acts as a central device that can connect to various\nslaves. Let us\
    \ consider an IoT scenario where a phone or PC\nserve as the master and mobile\
    \ devices such as a thermostat,\nfitness tracker, smart watch, or any monitoring\
    \ device act\nas slaves. In such cases, slaves must be very power efficient.\n\
    Therefore, to save energy, slaves are by default in sleep mode\nand wake up periodically\
    \ to receive packets from the master.\nIn classic Bluetooth, the connection is\
    \ on all the time even\nif no data transfer is going on. Additionally, it supports\
    \ 79\ndata channels (1 MHz channel bandwidth) and a data rate\nof 1 million symbols/s,\
    \ whereas, BLE supports 40 channels\nwith 2 MHz channel bandwidth (double of classic\
    \ Bluetooth)\nand 1 million symbols/s data rate. BLE supports low duty\ncycle\
    \ requirements as its packet size is small and the time\ntaken to transmit the\
    \ smallest packet is as small as 80 \U0001D707s. The\nBLE protocol stack supports\
    \ IP based communication also.\nAn experiment conducted by Siekkinen et al. [65]\
    \ recorded\nthe number of bytes transferred per Joule to show that BLE\nconsumes\
    \ far less energy as compared to competing protocols\nsuch as Zigbee. The energy\
    \ efficiency of BLE is 2.5 times better\nthan Zigbee.\n7.5. Low Power WiFi. The\
    \ WiFi alliance has recently devel-\noped “WiFi HaLow,” which is based on the\
    \ IEEE 802.11ah\nstandard. It consumes lower power than a traditional WiFi\ndevice\
    \ and also has a longer range. This is why this protocol\nis suitable for Internet\
    \ of Things applications. The range of\nWiFi HaLow is nearly twice that of traditional\
    \ WiFi.\nLike other WiFi devices, devices supporting WiFi HaLow\nalso support\
    \ IP connectivity, which is important for IoT\napplications. Let us look at the\
    \ specifications of the IEEE\n802.11ah standard [66, 67]. This standard was developed\
    \ to\ndeal with wireless sensor network scenarios, where devices\nare energy constrained\
    \ and require relatively long range\ncommunication. IEEE 802.11ah operates in\
    \ the sub-gigahertz\nband (900 MHz). Because of the relatively lower frequency,\n\
    the range is longer since higher frequency waves suffer from\nhigher attenuation.\
    \ We can extend the range (currently 1 km)\nby lowering the frequency further;\
    \ however, the data rate\nwill also be lower and thus the tradeoff is not justified.\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah is also designed to support large star shaped\nnetworks, where a\
    \ lot of stations are connected to a single\naccess point.\n7.6. Zigbee. It is\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.15.4 communication\nprotocol standard and is used for\
    \ personal area networks\nor PANs [68]. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has low power\n\
    MAC and physical layers and has already been explained\nin Section 7.3. Zigbee\
    \ was developed by the Zigbee alliance,\nwhich works for reliable, low energy,\
    \ and cheap communi-\ncation solutions. The range of Zigbee device communication\n\
    is very small (10–100 meters). The details of the network and\napplication layers\
    \ are also specified by the Zigbee standard.\nUnlike BLE, the network layer here\
    \ provides for multihop\nrouting.\nThere are three types of devices in a Zigbee\
    \ network:\nFFD (Fully Functional Device), RFD (Reduced Functional\nDevice), and\
    \ one Zigbee coordinator. A FFD node can addi-\ntionally act as a router. Zigbee\
    \ supports star, tree, and mesh\ntopologies. The routing scheme depends on the\
    \ topology.\nOther features of Zigbee are discovery and maintenance of\nroutes,\
    \ support for nodes joining/leaving the network, short\n16-bit addresses, and\
    \ multihop routing.\nThe framework for communication and distributed appli-\n\
    cation development is provided by the application layer.\nThe application layer\
    \ consists of Application Objects (APO),\nApplication Sublayer (APS), and a Zigbee\
    \ Device Object\n(ZDO). APOs are spread over the network nodes. These are\npieces\
    \ of software, which control some underlying device\nhardware (examples: switch\
    \ and transducer). The device and\nnetwork management services are provided by\
    \ the ZDO,\nwhich are then used by the APOs. Data transfer services\nare provided\
    \ by the Application Sublayer to the APOs and\nZDO. It is responsible for secure\
    \ communication between the\nApplication Objects. These features can be used to\
    \ create a\nlarge distributed application.\n7.7. Integration of RFID and WSN.\
    \ RFID and wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) are both important technologies in\
    \ the IoT\ndomain. RFID can only be used for object identification, but\nWSNs\
    \ serve a far greater purpose. The two are very different\nbut merging them has\
    \ many advantages. The following\ncomponents can be added to RFID to enhance its\
    \ usability:\n(a) Sensing capabilities\n(b) Multihop communication\n(c) Intelligence\n\
    RFID is inexpensive and uses very little power. That is\nwhy its integration with\
    \ WSN is very useful. The integration\nis possible in the following ways [69,\
    \ 70]:\n(a) Integration of RFID tags with sensors: RFID tags\nwith sensing capabilities\
    \ are called sensor tags. These\nsensor tags sense data from the environment and\n\
    then the RFID reader can read this sensed data from\nthe tag. In such cases, simple\
    \ RFID protocols are\nused, where there is only single hop communication.\nRFID\
    \ sensing technologies can be further classified\non the basis of the power requirement\
    \ of sensor tags as\nexplained earlier in the section on RFIDs (active and\npassive)\
    \ (see Section 5.5).\n14\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(b)\
    \ Integration of RFID tags with WSN nodes: the com-\nmunication capabilities of\
    \ sensor tags are limited to a\nsingle hop. To extend its capabilities, the sensor\
    \ tag is\nequipped with a wireless transceiver, little bit of Flash\nmemory, and\
    \ computational capabilities such that it\ncan initiate communication with other\
    \ nodes and\nwireless devices. The nodes can in this fashion be used\nto form\
    \ a wireless mesh network. In such networks,\nsensor tags can communicate with\
    \ each other over a\nlarge range (via intermediate hops). With additional\nprocessing\
    \ capabilities at a node, we can reduce the\nnet amount of data communicated and\
    \ thus increase\nthe power efficiency of the WSN.\n(c) Integration of RFID readers\
    \ with WSN nodes: this\ntype of integration is also done to increase the range\n\
    of RFID tag readers. The readers are equipped with\nwireless transceivers and\
    \ microcontrollers so that\nthey can communicate with each other and therefore,\n\
    the tag data can reach a reader, which is not in the\nrange of that tag. It takes\
    \ advantage of multihop\ncommunication of wireless sensor network devices.\nThe\
    \ data from all the RFID readers in the network\nultimately reaches a central\
    \ gateway or base station\nthat processes the data or sends it to a remote server.\n\
    These kinds of integrated solutions have many applica-\ntions in a diverse set\
    \ of domains such as security, healthcare,\nand manufacturing.\n7.8. Low Power\
    \ Wide-Area-Networks (LPWAN). Let us now\ndiscuss a protocol for long range communication\
    \ in power\nconstrained devices. The LPWAN class of protocols is low bit-\nrate\
    \ communication technologies for such IoT scenarios.\nLet us now discuss some\
    \ of the most common technolo-\ngies in this area.\nNarrow band IoT: it is a technology\
    \ made for a large\nnumber of devices that are energy constrained. It is\nthus\
    \ necessary to reduce the bit rate. This protocol\ncan be deployed with both the\
    \ cellular phone GSM\nand LTE spectra. The downlink speeds vary between\n40 kbps\
    \ (LTE M2) and 10 Mbps (LTE category 1).\nSigfox: it is one more protocol that\
    \ uses narrow band\ncommunication (≈10 MHz). It uses free sections of\nthe radio\
    \ spectrum (ISM band) to transmit its data.\nInstead of 4G networks, Sigfox focuses\
    \ on using\nvery long waves. Thus, the range can increase to a\n1000 kms. Because\
    \ of this the energy for transmission\nis significantly lower (<0.1%) than contemporary\
    \ cell\nphones.\nAgain the cost is bandwidth. It can only transmit\n12 bytes per\
    \ message, and a device is limited to 140\nmessages per day. This is reasonable\
    \ for many kinds of\napplications: submarine applications, sending control\n(emergency)\
    \ codes, geolocation, monitoring remote\nlocations, and medical applications.\n\
    Weightless: it uses a differential binary phase shift\nkeying based method to\
    \ transmit narrow band sig-\nnals. To avoid interference, the protocol hops across\n\
    frequency bands (instead of using CSMA). It sup-\nports cryptographic encryption\
    \ and mobility. Along\nwith frequency hopping, two additional mechanisms\nare\
    \ used to reduce collisions. The downlink service\nuses time division multiple\
    \ access (TDMA) and the\nuplink service uses multiple subchannels that are first\n\
    allocated to transmitting nodes by contacting a cen-\ntral server. Some applications\
    \ include smart meters,\nvehicle tracking, health monitoring, and industrial\n\
    machine monitoring.\nNeul: this protocol operates in the sub-1 GHz band.\nIt uses\
    \ small chunks of the TV whitespace spectrum\nto create low cost and low power\
    \ networks with very\nhigh scalability. It has a 10 km range and uses the\nWeightless\
    \ protocol for communication.\nLoRaWAN: this protocol is similar to Sigfox. It\
    \ targets\nwide area network applications and is designed to be\na low power protocol.\
    \ Its data rates can vary from\n0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, and it can be used within\
    \ an\nurban or a suburban environment (2–5 kms range\nin a crowded urban area).\
    \ It was designed to serve\nas a standard for long range IoT protocols. It thus\n\
    has features to support multitenancy, enable multiple\napplications, and include\
    \ several different network\ndomains.\n7.9. Lightweight Application Layer Protocols.\
    \ Along with\nphysical and MAC layer protocols, we also need application\nlayer\
    \ protocols for IoT networks. These lightweight protocols\nneed to be able to\
    \ carry application messages, while simulta-\nneously reducing power as far as\
    \ possible.\nOMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) is one such protocol.\nIt defines the\
    \ communication protocol between a server and\na device. The devices often have\
    \ limited capabilities and are\nthus referred to as constrained devices. The main\
    \ aims of the\nOMA protocol are as follows:\n(1) Remote device management.\n(2)\
    \ Transferring service data/information between differ-\nent nodes in the LWM2M\
    \ network.\nAll the protocols in this class treat all the network\nresources as\
    \ objects. Such resources can be created, deleted,\nand remotely configured. These\
    \ devices have their unique\nlimitations and can use different kinds of protocols\
    \ for\ninternally representing information. The LWM2M protocol\nabstracts all\
    \ of this away and provides a convenient interface\nto send messages between a\
    \ generic LWM2M server and a\ndistributed set of LWM2M clients.\nThis protocol\
    \ is often used along with CoAP (Constrained\nApplication Protocol). It is an\
    \ application layer protocol\nthat allows constrained nodes such as sensor motes\
    \ or small\nembedded devices to communicate across the Internet. CoAP\nseamlessly\
    \ integrates with HTTP, yet it provides additional\nfacilities such as support\
    \ for multicast operations. It is ideally\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\n15\nsuited for small devices because of its low overhead and\n\
    parsing complexity and reliance on UDP rather than TCP.\n8. Middleware\nUbiquitous\
    \ computing is the core of the Internet of Things,\nwhich means incorporating\
    \ computing and connectivity in\nall the things around us. Interoperability of\
    \ such heteroge-\nneous devices needs well-defined standards. But standard-\n\
    ization is difficult because of the varied requirements of\ndifferent applications\
    \ and devices. For such heterogeneous\napplications, the solution is to have a\
    \ middleware platform,\nwhich will abstract the details of the things for applications.\n\
    That is, it will hide the details of the smart things. It\nshould act as a software\
    \ bridge between the things and the\napplications. It needs to provide the required\
    \ services to the\napplication developers [20] so that they can focus more on\n\
    the requirements of applications rather than on interacting\nwith the baseline\
    \ hardware. To summarize, the middleware\nabstracts the hardware and provides\
    \ an Application Program-\nming Interface (API) for communication, data management,\n\
    computation, security, and privacy.\nThe challenges, which are addressed by any\
    \ IoT middle-\nware, are as follows: [20, 71, 72].\n(1) Interoperability and programming\
    \ abstractions: for\nfacilitating collaboration and information exchange\nbetween\
    \ heterogeneous devices, different types of\nthings can interact with each other\
    \ easily with the help\nof middleware services. Interoperability is of three\n\
    types: network, semantic, and syntactic. Network\ninteroperability deals with\
    \ heterogeneous interface\nprotocols for communication between devices. It\ninsulates\
    \ the applications from the intricacies of\ndifferent protocols. Syntactic interoperability\
    \ ensures\nthat applications are oblivious of different formats,\nstructures,\
    \ and encoding of data. Semantic interop-\nerability deals with abstracting the\
    \ meaning of data\nwithin a particular domain. It is loosely inspired by\nthe\
    \ semantic web.\n(2) Device discovery and management: this feature\nenables the\
    \ devices to be aware of all other devices\nin the neighborhood and the services\
    \ provided by\nthem. In the Internet of Things, the infrastructure is\nmostly\
    \ dynamic. The devices have to announce their\npresence and the services they\
    \ provide. The solution\nneeds to be scalable because the devices in an IoT\n\
    network can increase. Most solutions in this domain\nare loosely inspired by semantic\
    \ web technologies.\nThe middleware provides APIs to list the IoT devices,\ntheir\
    \ services, and capabilities. In addition, typically\nAPIs are provided to discover\
    \ devices based on their\ncapabilities. Finally, any IoT middleware needs to\n\
    perform load balancing, manage devices based on\ntheir levels of battery power,\
    \ and report problems in\ndevices to the users.\n(3) Scalability: a large number\
    \ of devices are expected to\ncommunicate in an IoT setup. Moreover, IoT appli-\n\
    cations need to scale due to ever increasing require-\nments. This should be managed\
    \ by the middleware\nby making required changes when the infrastructure\nscales.\n\
    (4) Big data and analytics: IoT sensors typically collect\na huge amount of data.\
    \ It is necessary to analyze\nall of this data in great detail. As a result a\
    \ lot of\nbig data algorithms are used to analyze IoT data.\nMoreover, it is possible\
    \ that due to the flimsy nature\nof the network some of the data collected might\
    \ be\nincomplete. It is necessary to take this into account\nand extrapolate data\
    \ by using sophisticated machine\nlearning algorithms.\n(5) Security and privacy:\
    \ IoT applications are mostly\nrelated to someone’s personal life or an industry.\n\
    Security and privacy issues need to be addressed in\nall such environments. The\
    \ middleware should have\nbuilt in mechanisms to address such issues, along with\n\
    user authentication, and the implementation of access\ncontrol.\n(6) Cloud services:\
    \ the cloud is an important part of an\nIoT deployment. Most of the sensor data\
    \ is analyzed\nand stored in a centralized cloud. It is necessary for\nIoT middleware\
    \ to seamlessly run on different types\nof clouds and to enable users to leverage\
    \ the cloud\nto get better insights from the data collected by the\nsensors.\n\
    (7) Context detection: the data collected from the sensors\nneeds to be used to\
    \ extract the context by applying\nvarious types of algorithms. The context can\
    \ subse-\nquently be used for providing sophisticated services\nto users.\nThere\
    \ are many middleware solutions available for the\nInternet of Things, which address\
    \ one or more of the\naforementioned issues. All of them support interoperabil-\n\
    ity and abstraction, which is the foremost requirement of\nmiddleware. Some examples\
    \ are Oracle’s Fusion Middleware,\nOpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], and Hydra [23].\
    \ Middle-\nwares can be classified as follows on the basis of their design\n[72]:\n\
    (1) Event based: here, all the components interact with\neach other through events.\
    \ Each event has a type and\nsome parameters. Events are generated by producers\n\
    and received by the consumers. This can be viewed\nas a publish/subscribe architecture,\
    \ where entities can\nsubscribe for some event types and get notified for\nthose\
    \ events.\n(2) Service oriented: service oriented middlewares are\nbased on Service\
    \ Oriented Architectures (SOA), in\nwhich we have independent modules that provide\
    \ ser-\nvices through accessible interfaces. A service oriented\nmiddleware views\
    \ resources as service providers.\nIt abstracts the underlying resources through\
    \ a set\nof services that are used by applications. There is\n16\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\na service repository, where services are published\n\
    by providers. The consumers can discover services\nfrom the repository and then\
    \ bind with the provider\nto access the service. Service oriented middleware\n\
    must have runtime support for advertising services\nby providers and support for\
    \ discovering and using\nservices by consumers.\nHYDRA [23] is a service oriented\
    \ middleware. It\nincorporates many software components, which are\nused in handling\
    \ various tasks required for the devel-\nopment of intelligent applications. Hydra\
    \ also pro-\nvides semantic interoperability using semantic web\ntechnologies.\
    \ It supports dynamic reconfiguration\nand self-management.\n(3) Database oriented:\
    \ in this approach, the network\nof IoT devices is considered as a virtual relational\n\
    database system. The database can then be queried\nby the applications using a\
    \ query language. There\nare easy to use interfaces for extracting data from\n\
    the database. This approach has issues with scaling\nbecause of its centralized\
    \ model.\n(4) Semantic: semantic middleware focuses on the inter-\noperation of\
    \ different types of devices, which commu-\nnicate using different formats of\
    \ data. It incorporates\ndevices with different data formats and ontologies and\n\
    ties all of them together in a common framework.\nThe framework is used for exchanging\
    \ data between\ndiverse types of devices. For a common semantic for-\nmat, we\
    \ need to have \U0001D441 adapters for communication\nbetween \U0001D441 devices\
    \ because; for each device, we need\nadapters to map \U0001D441 standards to one\
    \ abstract standard\n[73]. In such a semantic middleware [74], a semantic\nlayer\
    \ is introduced, in which there is a mapping from\neach resource to a software\
    \ layer for that resource.\nThe software layers then communicate with each\nother\
    \ using a mutually intelligible language (based\non the semantic web). This technique\
    \ allows multiple\nphysical resources to communicate even though they\ndo not\
    \ implement or understand the same protocols.\n(5) Application specific: this\
    \ type of middleware is used\nspecifically for an application domain for which\
    \ it\nis developed because the whole architecture of this\nmiddleware software\
    \ is fine-tuned on the basis of\nrequirements of the application. The application\
    \ and\nmiddleware are tightly coupled. These are not general\npurpose solutions.\n\
    8.1. Popular IoT Middleware\n8.1.1. FiWare. FiWare is a very popular IoT middleware\n\
    framework that is promoted by the EU. It has been designed\nkeeping smart cities,\
    \ logistics, and shop floor analytics in\nmind. FiWare contains a large body of\
    \ code, reusable mod-\nules, and APIs that have been contributed by thousands\
    \ of\nFiWare developers. Any application developer can take a\nsubset of these\
    \ components and build his/her IoT application.\nA typical IoT application has\
    \ many producers of data\n(sensors), a set of servers to process the data, and\
    \ a set\nof actuators. FiWare refers to the information collected by\nsensors\
    \ as context information. It defines generic REST APIs\nto capture the context\
    \ from different scenarios. All the context\ninformation is sent to a dedicated\
    \ service called a context\nbroker. FiWare provides APIs to store the context\
    \ and also\nquery it. Moreover, any application can register itself as a\ncontext\
    \ consumer, and it can request the context broker for\ninformation. It also supports\
    \ the publish-subscribe paradigm.\nSubsequently, the context can be supplied to\
    \ systems using\ncontext adapters whose main role is to transform the data (the\n\
    context) based on the requirements of the destination nodes.\nMoreover, FiWare\
    \ defines a set of SNMP APIs via which we\ncan control the behavior of IoT devices\
    \ and also configure\nthem.\nThe target applications are provided APIs to analyze,\n\
    query, and mine the information that is collected from the\ncontext broker. Additionally,\
    \ with advanced visualization\nAPIs, it is possible to create and deploy feature\
    \ rich applica-\ntions very quickly.\n8.1.2. OpenIoT. OpenIoT is another popular\
    \ open source\ninitiative. It has 7 different components. At the lowest level,\n\
    we have a physical plane. It collects data from IoT devices\nand also does some\
    \ preprocessing of data. It has different\nAPIs to interface with different types\
    \ of physical nodes and\nget information from them.\nThe next plane is the virtualized\
    \ plane, which has 3\ncomponents. We first have the scheduler, which manages the\n\
    streams of data generated by devices. It primarily assigns\nthem to resources\
    \ and takes care of their QoS requirements.\nThe data storage component manages\
    \ the storage and archival\nof data streams. Finally, the service delivery component\n\
    processes the streams. It has several roles. It combines\ndata streams, preprocesses\
    \ them, and tracks some statistics\nassociated with these streams such as the\
    \ number of unique\nrequests or the size of each request.\nThe uppermost layer,\
    \ that is, the application layer, also\nhas 3 components: request definition,\
    \ request presentation,\nand configuration. The request definition component helps\n\
    us create requests to be sent to the IoT sensors and storage\nlayers. It can be\
    \ used to fetch and query data. The request\npresentation component creates mashups\
    \ of data by issuing\ndifferent queries to the storage layer, and finally the\
    \ configu-\nration component helps us configure the IoT devices.\n9. Applications\
    \ of IoT\nThere are a diverse set of areas in which intelligent applica-\ntions\
    \ have been developed. All of these applications are not\nyet readily available;\
    \ however, preliminary research indicates\nthe potential of IoT in improving the\
    \ quality of life in our soci-\nety. Some uses of IoT applications are in home\
    \ automation,\nfitness tracking, health monitoring, environment protection,\n\
    smart cities, and industrial settings.\n9.1. Home Automation. Smart homes are\
    \ becoming more\npopular today because of two reasons. First, the sensor\nand\
    \ actuation technologies along with wireless sensor net-\nworks have significantly\
    \ matured. Second, people today trust\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\

    \ diagram of a smart home system.\ntechnology to address their concerns about\
    \ their quality of\nlife and security of their homes (see Figure 8).\nIn smart\
    \ homes, various sensors are deployed, which\nprovide intelligent and automated\
    \ services to the user. They\nhelp in automating daily tasks and help in maintaining\
    \ a\nroutine for individuals who tend to be forgetful. They help\nin energy conservation\
    \ by turning off lights and electronic\ngadgets automatically. We typically use\
    \ motion sensors for\nthis purpose. Motion sensors can be additionally used for\n\
    security also.\nFor example, the project, MavHome [75], provides an\nintelligent\
    \ agent, which uses various prediction algorithms\nfor doing automated tasks in\
    \ response to user triggered events\nand adapts itself to the routines of the\
    \ inhabitants. Predic-\ntion algorithms are used to predict the sequence of events\n\
    [76] in a home. A sequence matching algorithm maintains\nsequences of events in\
    \ a queue and also stores their frequency.\nThen a prediction is made using the\
    \ match length and\nfrequency. Other algorithms used by similar applications use\n\
    compression based prediction and Markov models.\nEnergy conservation in smart\
    \ homes [77] is typically\nachieved through sensors and context awareness. The\
    \ sen-\nsors collect data from the environment (light, temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ gas, and fire events). This data from heterogeneous\nsensors is fed to a context\
    \ aggregator, which forwards the\ncollected data to the context aware service\
    \ engine. This engine\nselects services based on the context. For example, an\
    \ appli-\ncation can automatically turn on the AC when the humidity\nrises. Or,\
    \ when there is a gas leak, it can turn all the lights off.\nSmart home applications\
    \ are really beneficial for the\nelderly and differently abled. Their health is\
    \ monitored and\nrelatives are informed immediately in case of emergencies.\n\
    Floors are equipped with pressure sensors, which track the\nmovement of an individual\
    \ across the smart home and also\nhelp in detecting if a person has fallen down.\
    \ In smart homes,\nCCTV cameras can be used to record events of interest. These\n\
    can then be used for feature extraction to find out what is\ngoing on.\nIn specific,\
    \ fall detection applications in smart environ-\nments [78–80] are useful for\
    \ detecting if elderly people have\nfallen down. Yu et al. [80] use computer vision\
    \ based tech-\nniques for analyzing postures of the human body. Sixsmith\net al.\
    \ [79] used low cost infrared sensor array technology,\nwhich can provide information\
    \ such as the location, size,\nand velocity of a target object. It detects dynamics\
    \ of a fall\nby analyzing the motion patterns and also detects inactivity\nand\
    \ compares it with activity in the past. Neural networks\nare employed and sample\
    \ data is provided to the system for\nvarious types of falls. Many smartphone\
    \ based applications\nare also available, which detect a fall on the basis of\
    \ readings\nfrom the accelerometer and gyroscope data.\nThere are many challenges\
    \ and issues with regard to smart\nhome applications [81]. The most important\
    \ is security and\nprivacy [82] since all the data about the events taking place\
    \ in\nthe home is being recorded. If the security and trustworthi-\nness of the\
    \ system are not guaranteed, an intruder may attack\nthe system and may make the\
    \ system behave maliciously.\nSmart home systems are supposed to notify the owners\
    \ in case\nthey detect such abnormalities. This is possible using AI and\nmachine\
    \ learning algorithms, and researchers have already\nstarted working in this direction\
    \ [83]. Reliability is also an\nissue since there is no system administrator to\
    \ monitor the\nsystem.\n9.2. Smart Cities\n9.2.1. Smart Transport. Smart transport\
    \ applications can\nmanage daily traffic in cities using sensors and intelligent\n\
    information processing systems. The main aim of intelligent\ntransport systems\
    \ is to minimize traffic congestion, ensure\n18\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ diagram of a smart parking system.\neasy and hassle-free parking, and avoid\
    \ accidents by prop-\nerly routing traffic and spotting drunk drivers. The sensor\n\
    technologies governing these types of applications are GPS\nsensors for location,\
    \ accelerometers for speed, gyroscopes for\ndirection, RFIDs for vehicle identification,\
    \ infrared sensors\nfor counting passengers and vehicles, and cameras for record-\n\
    ing vehicle movement and traffic. There are many types of\napplications in this\
    \ area (refer to [84]):\n(1) Traffic surveillance and management applications:\n\
    vehicles are connected by a network to each other,\nthe cloud, and to a host of\
    \ IoT devices such as GPS\nsensors, RFID devices, and cameras. These devices\n\
    can estimate traffic conditions in different parts of the\ncity. Custom applications\
    \ can analyze traffic patterns\nso that future traffic conditions can be estimated.\
    \ Yu et\nal. [85] implement a vehicle tracking system for traffic\nsurveillance\
    \ using video sequences captured on the\nroads.\nTraffic congestion detection\
    \ can also be implemented\nusing smartphone sensors such as accelerometers\n[86]\
    \ and GPS sensors. These applications can detect\nmovement patterns of the vehicle\
    \ while the user is\ndriving. Such kind of information is already being\ncollected\
    \ by Google maps and users are using it to\nroute around potentially congested\
    \ areas of the city.\n(2) Applications to ensure safety: smart transport does\n\
    not only imply managing traffic conditions. It also\nincludes safety of people\
    \ travelling in their vehicles,\nwhich up till now was mainly in the hands of\
    \ drivers.\nThere are many IoT applications developed to help\ndrivers become\
    \ safer drivers. Such applications mon-\nitor driving behavior of drivers and\
    \ help them drive\nsafely by detecting when they are feeling drowsy or\ntired\
    \ and helping them to cope with it or suggesting\nrest [87, 88]. Technologies\
    \ used in such applications\nare face detection, eye movement detection, and\n\
    pressure detection on the steering (to measure the\ngrip of the driver’s hands\
    \ on the steering).\nA smartphone application, which estimates the\ndriver’s driving\
    \ behavior using smartphone sensors\nsuch as the accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS,\
    \ and cam-\nera, has been proposed by Eren et al. [89]. It can\ndecide whether\
    \ the driving is safe or rash by analyzing\nthe sensor data.\n(3) Intelligent\
    \ parking management (see Figure 9): in a\nsmart transportation system, parking\
    \ is completely\nhassle free as one can easily check on the Internet to\nfind\
    \ out which parking lot has free spaces. Such lots\nuse sensors to detect if the\
    \ slots are free or occupied by\nvehicles. This data is then uploaded to a central\
    \ server.\n(4) Smart traffic lights: traffic lights equipped with sens-\ning,\
    \ processing, and communication capabilities are\ncalled smart traffic lights.\
    \ These lights sense the\ntraffic congestion at the intersection and the amount\n\
    of traffic going each way. This information can be\nanalyzed and then sent to\
    \ neighboring traffic lights\nor a central controller. It is possible to use this\n\
    information creatively. For example, in an emergency\nsituation the traffic lights\
    \ can preferentially give way\nto an ambulance. When the smart traffic light senses\n\
    an ambulance coming, it clears the path for it and\nalso informs neighboring lights\
    \ about it. Technologies\nused in these lights are cameras, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, and data analysis modules. Such systems\nhave already been deployed\
    \ in Rio De Janeiro.\n(5) Accident detection applications: a smartphone appli-\n\
    cation designed by White et al. [90] detects the occur-\nrence of an accident\
    \ with the help of an accelerometer\nand acoustic data. It immediately sends this\
    \ informa-\ntion along with the location to the nearest hospital.\nJournal of\
    \ Electrical and Computer Engineering\n19\nSome additional situational information\
    \ such as on-\nsite photographs is also sent so that the first respon-\nders know\
    \ about the whole scenario and the degree of\nmedical help that is required.\n\
    9.2.2. Smart Water Systems. Given the prevailing amount of\nwater scarcity in\
    \ most parts of the world, it is very important\nto manage our water resources\
    \ efficiently. As a result most\ncities are opting for smart solutions that place\
    \ a lot of meters\non water supply lines and storm drains. A good reference\n\
    in this area is the paper by Hauber-Davidson and Idris [91].\nThey describe various\
    \ designs for smart water meters. These\nmeters can be used to measure the degree\
    \ of water inflow and\noutflow and to identify possible leaks. Smart water metering\n\
    systems are also used in conjunction with data from weather\nsatellites and river\
    \ water sensors. They can also help us predict\nflooding.\n9.2.3. Examples of\
    \ Smart Cities. Barcelona and Stockholm\nstand out in the list of smart cities.\
    \ Barcelona has a CityOS\nproject, where it aims to create a single virtualized\
    \ OS for\nall the smart devices and services offered within the city.\nBarcelona\
    \ has mainly focused on smart transportation (as\ndiscussed in Section 9.2.1)\
    \ and smart water. Smart transporta-\ntion is implemented using a network of sensors,\
    \ centralized\nanalysis, and smart traffic lights. On similar lines Barcelona\n\
    has sensors on most of its storm drains, water storage tanks,\nand water supply\
    \ lines. This information is integrated with\nweather and usage information. The\
    \ result of all of this is\na centralized water planning strategy. The city is\
    \ able to\nestimate the water requirements in terms of domestic usage\nand industrial\
    \ usage and for activities such as landscaping and\ngardening.\nStockholm started\
    \ way back in 1994, and its first step in\nthis direction was to install an extensive\
    \ fiber optic system.\nSubsequently, the city added thousands of sensors for smart\n\
    traffic and smart water management applications. Stockholm\nwas one of the first\
    \ cities to implement congestion charging.\nUsers were charged money, when they\
    \ drove into congested\nareas. This was enabled by smart traffic technologies.\
    \ Since\nthe city has a solid network backbone, it is very easy to\ndeploy sensors\
    \ and applications. For example, recently the\ncity created a smart parking system,\
    \ where it is possible to\neasily locate parking spots nearby. Parking lots have\
    \ sensors,\nwhich let a server know about their usage. Once a driver\nqueries\
    \ the server with her/his GPS location, she/he is guided\nto the nearest parking\
    \ lot with free slots. Similar innovations\nhave taken place in the city’s smart\
    \ buildings, snow clearance,\nand political announcement systems.\n9.3. Social\
    \ Life and Entertainment. Social life and entertain-\nment play an important role\
    \ in an individual’s life. Many\napplications have been developed, which keep\
    \ track of such\nhuman activities. The term “opportunistic IoT” [92] refers\n\
    to information sharing among opportunistic devices (devices\nthat seek to make\
    \ contact with other devices) based on\nmovement and availability of contacts\
    \ in the vicinity. Personal\ndevices such as tablets, wearables, and mobile phones\
    \ have\nsensing and short range communication capabilities. People\ncan find and\
    \ interact with each other when there is a common\npurpose.\nCircle Sense [93]\
    \ is an application, which detects social\nactivities of a person with the help\
    \ of various types of sensor\ndata. It identifies the social circle of a person\
    \ by analyzing\nthe patterns of social activities and the people present in\n\
    those activities. Various types of social activities and the set\nof people participating\
    \ in those activities are identified. It\nuses location sensors to find out where\
    \ the person is and\nuses Bluetooth for searching people around her. The system\n\
    has built in machine learning algorithms, and it gradually\nimproves its behavior\
    \ with learning.\nAffective computing [94] is a technology, which recog-\nnizes,\
    \ understands, stimulates, and responds to the emotions\nof human beings. There\
    \ are many parameters, which are\nconsidered while dealing with human affects\
    \ such as facial\nexpressions, speech, body gestures, hand movements, and\nsleep\
    \ patterns. These are analyzed to figure out how a person\nis feeling. The utterance\
    \ of emotional keywords is identified\nby voice recognition and the quality of\
    \ voice by looking at\nacoustic features of speech.\nOne of the applications of\
    \ affective computing is Camy,\nan artificial pet dog [95], which is designed\
    \ to interact with\nhuman beings and show affection and emotions. Many sen-\n\
    sors and actuators are embedded in it. It provides emotional\nsupport to the owner,\
    \ encourages playful and active behavior,\nrecognizes its owner, and shows love\
    \ for her and increases\nthe owner’s communication with other people. Based on\
    \ the\nowner’s mood, Camy interacts with the owner and gives her\nsuggestions.\n\
    Logmusic [96] is an entertainment application, which\nrecommends music on the\
    \ basis of the context, such as the\nweather, temperature, time, and location.\n\
    9.4. Health and Fitness. IoT appliances have proven really\nbeneficial in the\
    \ health and wellness domains. Many wearable\ndevices are being developed, which\
    \ monitor a person’s health\ncondition (see Figure 10).\nHealth applications make\
    \ independent living possible for\nthe elderly and patients with serious health\
    \ conditions. Cur-\nrently, IoT sensors are being used to continuously monitor\n\
    and record their health conditions and transmit warnings in\ncase any abnormal\
    \ indicators are found. If there is a minor\nproblem, the IoT application itself\
    \ may suggest a prescription\nto the patient.\nIoT applications can be used in\
    \ creating an Electronic\nHealth Record (EHR), which is a record of all the medical\n\
    details of a person. It is maintained by the health system. An\nEHR can be used\
    \ to record allergies, surges in blood sugar\nand blood pressure.\nStress recognition\
    \ applications are also fairly popular\n[97]. They can be realized using smartphone\
    \ sensors. Wang\net al. describe an application [30], which measures the stress\n\
    level of a college student and is installed on the student’s\nsmartphone. It senses\
    \ the locations the student visits during\nthe whole day, the amount of physical\
    \ activity, amount of\nsleep and rest, and her/his interaction and relationships\
    \ with\nother people (audio data and calls). In addition, it also\nconducts surveys\
    \ with the student by randomly popping up\n20\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of a smart healthcare system.\na question in the smartphone. Using all of this\
    \ data and\nanalyzing it intelligently, the level of stress and academic\nperformance\
    \ can be measured.\nIn the fitness sector, we have applications that monitor\n\
    how fit we are based on our daily activity level. Smartphone\naccelerometer data\
    \ can be used for activity detection by\napplying complex algorithms. For example,\
    \ we can measure\nthe number of steps taken and the amount of exercise done\n\
    by using fitness trackers. Fitness trackers are available in the\nmarket as wearables\
    \ to monitor the fitness level of an indi-\nvidual. In addition, gym apparatus\
    \ can be fitted with sensors\nto count the number of times an exercise is performed.\
    \ For\nexample, a smart mat [98] can count the number of exercise\nsteps performed\
    \ on it. This is implemented using pressure\nsensors on the mat and then by analyzing\
    \ the patterns of\npressure, and the shape of the contact area.\n9.5. Smart Environment\
    \ and Agriculture. Environmental\nparameters such as temperature and humidity\
    \ are important\nfor agricultural production. Sensors are used by farmers in\n\
    the field to measure such parameters and this data can be\nused for efficient\
    \ production. One application is automated\nirrigation according to weather conditions.\n\
    Production using greenhouses [99] is one of the main\napplications of IoT in agriculture.\
    \ Environmental parameters\nmeasured in terms of temperature, soil information,\
    \ and\nhumidity are measured in real time and sent to a server for\nanalysis.\
    \ The results are then used to improve crop quality and\nyield.\nPesticide residues\
    \ in crop production are detected using\nan Acetylcholinesterase biosensor [100].\
    \ This data is saved\nand analyzed for extracting useful information such as the\n\
    sample size, time, location, and amount of residues. We can\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\n21\nthus maintain the quality of the crop. Moreover,\
    \ a QR code\ncan be used to uniquely identify a carton of farm produce.\nConsumers\
    \ can scan the QR code and check the amount\nof pesticides in it (via a centralized\
    \ database) online before\nbuying.\nAir pollution is an important concern today\
    \ because it is\nchanging the climate of the earth and degrading air quality.\n\
    Vehicles cause a lot of air pollution. An IoT application\nproposed by Manna et\
    \ al. [39] monitors air pollution on the\nroads. It also tracks vehicles that\
    \ cause an undue amount of\npollution. Electrochemical toxic gas sensors can also\
    \ be used\nto measure air pollution. Vehicles are identified by RFID tags.\nRFID\
    \ readers are placed on both sides of the road along with\nthe gas sensors. With\
    \ this approach it is possible to identify\nand take action against polluting\
    \ vehicles.\n9.6. Supply Chain and Logistics. IoT tries to simplify real\nworld\
    \ processes in business and information systems [101].\nThe goods in the supply\
    \ chain can be tracked easily from\nthe place of manufacture to the final places\
    \ of distribution\nusing sensor technologies such as RFID and NFC. Real\ntime\
    \ information is recorded and analyzed for tracking.\nInformation about the quality\
    \ and usability of the product can\nalso be saved in RFID tags attached with the\
    \ shipments.\nBo and Guangwen [102] explain an information transmis-\nsion system\
    \ for supply chain management, which is based\non the Internet of Things. RFID\
    \ tags uniquely identify a\nproduct automatically and a product information network\n\
    is created to transmit this information in real time along\nwith location information.\
    \ This system helps in automatic\ncollection and analysis of all the information\
    \ related to supply\nchain management, which may help examine past demand\nand\
    \ come up with a forecast of future demand. Supply chain\ncomponents can get access\
    \ to real time data and all of this\ninformation can be analyzed to get useful\
    \ insights. This will\nin the long run improve the performance of supply chain\n\
    systems.\n9.7. Energy Conservation. The smart grid is information and\ncommunication\
    \ technology enabled modern electricity gen-\neration, transmission, distribution,\
    \ and consumption system\n[103].\nTo make electric power generation, transmission,\
    \ and\ndistribution smart, the concept of smart grids adds intel-\nligence at\
    \ each step and also allows the two-way flow of\npower (back from the consumer\
    \ to the supplier). This can\nsave a lot of energy and help consumers better understand\n\
    the flow of power and dynamic pricing. In a smart grid,\npower generation is distributed.\
    \ There are sensors deployed\nthroughout the system to monitor everything. It\
    \ is actually a\ndistributed network of microgrids [104]. Microgrids generate\n\
    power to meet demands of local sites and transmit back\nthe surplus energy to\
    \ the central grid. Microgrids can also\ndemand energy from the central grid in\
    \ case of a shortfall.\nTwo-way flow of power also benefits consumers, who are\n\
    also using their own generated energy occasionally (say, solar,\nor wind power);\
    \ the surplus power can be transmitted back so\nthat it is not wasted. The user\
    \ will also get paid for that power.\nSome of the IoT applications in a smart\
    \ grid are online\nmonitoring of transmission lines for disaster prevention and\n\
    efficient use of power in smart homes by having a smart meter\nfor monitoring\
    \ energy consumption [105].\nSmart meters read and analyze consumption patterns\
    \ of\npower at regular and peak load times. This information is\nthen sent to\
    \ the server and also made available to the user. The\ngeneration is then set\
    \ according to the consumption patterns.\nIn addition, the user can adjust her/his\
    \ use so as to reduce\ncosts. Smart power appliances can leverage this information\n\
    and operate when the prices are low.\n10. Design Considerations in an IoT System\n\
    Now, that we have profiled most of the IoT technologies, let\nus look at some\
    \ of the design considerations for designing a\npractical IoT network.\nThe first\
    \ consideration is the design of the sensors. Even\nthough there might not be\
    \ much of a choice regarding\nthe sensors, there is definitely a lot of choice\
    \ regarding\nthe processing and networking capabilities that are bundled\nalong\
    \ with the sensors. Our choices range from small sub-\nmW boards meant for sensor\
    \ motes to Arduino or Atom\nboards that consume 300–500 mW of power. This choice\n\
    depends on the degree of analytics and data preprocessing\nthat we want to perform\
    \ at the sensor itself. Secondly, there\nis an issue of logistics also. To create\
    \ a sub-mW board, we\nneed board design expertise, and this might not be readily\n\
    available. Hence, it might be advisable to bundle a sensor with\ncommercially\
    \ available embedded processor kits.\nThe next important consideration is communication.\
    \ In\nIoT nodes, power is the most dominant issue. The power\nrequired to transmit\
    \ and receive messages is a major fraction\nof the overall power, and as a result\
    \ a choice of the networking\ntechnology is vital. The important factors that\
    \ we need\nto consider are the distance between the sender and the\nreceiver,\
    \ the nature of obstacles, signal distortion, ambient\nnoise, and governmental\
    \ regulations. Based on these key\nfactors, we need to choose a given wireless\
    \ networking\nprotocol. For example, if we just need to communicate\ninside a\
    \ small building, we can use Zigbee, whereas if we\nneed communication in a smart\
    \ city, we should choose\nSigfox or LoraWAN. In addition, often there are significant\n\
    constraints on the frequency and the power that can be spent\nin transmission.\
    \ These limitations are mainly imposed by\ngovernment agencies. An apt decision\
    \ needs to be made by\ntaking all of these factors into account.\nLet us then\
    \ come to the middleware. The first choice that\nneeds to be made is to choose\
    \ between an open source mid-\ndleware such as FiWare or a proprietary solution.\
    \ There are\npros and cons of both. It is true that open source middleware\nis\
    \ in theory more flexible; however, they may have limited\nsupport for IoT devices.\
    \ We ideally want a middleware\nsolution to interoperate with all kinds of communication\n\
    protocols and devices; however, that might not be the case.\nHence, if we need\
    \ strict compatibility with certain devices and\nprotocols, a proprietary solution\
    \ is better. Nevertheless, open\nsource offerings have cost advantages and are\
    \ sometimes\neasier to deploy. We also need to choose the communication\n22\n\
    Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nprotocol and ensure that it is\
    \ compatible with the firewalls\nin the organizations involved. In general choosing\
    \ a protocol\nbased on HTTP is the best from this point of view. We also\nneed\
    \ to choose between TCP and UDP. UDP is always better\nfrom the point of view\
    \ of power consumption. Along with\nthese considerations, we also need to look\
    \ at options to store\nsensor data streams, querying languages, and support for\n\
    generating dynamic alerts.\nFinally, let us consider the application layer. Most\
    \ IoT\nframeworks provide significant amount of support for cre-\nating the application\
    \ layer. This includes data mining, data\nprocessing, and visualization APIs.\
    \ Creating mashups and\ndashboards of data is nowadays very easy to do given the\n\
    extensive support provided by IoT frameworks. Nevertheless,\nhere the tradeoff\
    \ is between the features provided and the\nresources that are required. We do\
    \ not need a very heavy\nframework if we do not desire a lot of features. This\
    \ call needs\nto be taken by the application developers.\n11. Conclusion\nIn this\
    \ survey paper we presented a survey of the current\ntechnologies used in the\
    \ IoT domain as of 2016. Currently,\nthis field is in a very nascent stage. The\
    \ technologies in\nthe core infrastructure layers are showing signs of maturity.\n\
    However, a lot more needs to happen in the areas of IoT\napplications and communication\
    \ technologies. These fields\nwill definitely mature and impact human life in\
    \ inconceivable\nways over the next decade.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors\

    technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) require latency-aware computation
    for real-time application processing. In IoT environments, connected things generate
    a huge amount of data, which are generally referred to as big data. Data generated
    from IoT devices are generally processed in a cloud infrastructure because of
    the on-demand services and scalability features of the cloud computing paradigm.
    However, processing IoT application requests on the cloud exclusively is not an
    efficient solution for some IoT applications, especially time-sensitive ones.
    To address this issue, Fog computing, which resides in between cloud and IoT devices,
    was proposed. In general, in the Fog computing environment, IoT devices are connected
    to Fog devices. These Fog devices are located in close proximity to users and
    are responsible for intermediate computation and storage. One of the key challenges
    in running IoT applications in a Fog computing environment are resource allocation
    and task scheduling. Fog computing research is still in its infancy, and taxonomy-based
    investigation into the requirements of Fog infrastructure, platform, and applications
    mapped to current research is still required. This survey will help the industry
    and research community synthesize and identify the requirements for Fog computing.
    This paper starts with an overview of Fog computing in which the definition of
    Fog computing, research trends, and the technical differences between Fog and
    cloud are reviewed. Then, we investigate numerous proposed Fog computing architectures
    and describe the components of these architectures in detail. From this, the role
    of each component will be defined, which will help in the deployment of Fog computing.
    Next, a taxonomy of Fog computing is proposed by considering the requirements
    of the Fog computing paradigm. We also discuss existing research works and gaps
    in resource allocation and scheduling, fault tolerance, simulation tools, and
    Fog-based microser... (Show More) Taxonomy of Fog computing based on the requirements.

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Individuals and organizations are
    increasingly becoming dependent on computers and smart devices to deal with daily
    tasks. These devices are generating data via various sensors and applications.
    As a result, organizations are generating and storing huge amounts of data on
    a regular basis [1]. After the proliferation of IoT, data generated by sensors
    has increased enormously. With this sudden increase in the volume of data being
    produced and inability of conventional databases to process various forms of structured
    and unstructured data, big data analytics has attained great attention in recent
    years. Every organization is now prioritizing the analysis of collected data to
    extract useful insights in order to make important decisions [2]. Nowadays, organizations
    need a dynamic IT infrastructure because of the shift to cloud computing due to
    its accessibility, scalability, and pay-per-use features. The most common services
    provided by the cloud are known as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a
    Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), all of which are heading
    towards Anything as a Service (XaaS) [3]. However, data generated from billions
    of sensors, referred to as big data, cannot be transferred and processed in the
    cloud. In addition, some IoT applications need to be processed faster than the
    cloud’s current capability. This problem can be solved by using the Fog computing
    paradigm, which harnesses the processing power of devices located near users (idle
    computing power) to support utilization of storage, processing, and networking
    at the edge [4]. Fog computing is a decentralized computing concept, which does
    not exclusively rely on any central component like cloud computing [5], [6]. It
    is able to overcome the high latency problem of the cloud by using idle resources
    of various devices near users. However, Fog computing relies on the cloud to do
    complex processing. Unlike cloud computing, Fog computing is a decentralized computing
    concept, where the many devices around us, which have computation capacity, are
    utilized. Currently, even a low- specification smartphone has processing capacity,
    sometimes with multiple cores. Hence, many devices like smartphones, switches,
    routers, base stations, and other network management devices equipped with processing
    power and storage capacity can act as Fog devices. The resources of these devices
    are idle outside of peak hours. Many research issues relating to Fog computing
    are emerging due to its ubiquitous connectivity and heterogeneous organization.
    In the Fog computing paradigm, key issues are the requirements and the deployment
    of Fog computing environment. This is because the devices that exist in Fog environments
    are heterogeneous: therefore, the question that arises is how will Fog computing
    tackle the new challenges of resource management and failure handling in such
    a heterogeneous environment? Hence, it is necessary to investigate the very basic
    requirements for all other related aspects such as deployment issues, simulations,
    resource management, fault tolerance, and services. Several reviews [5], [7]–[12]
    have been done on Fog computing. Here, we present the focus and survey domains
    of these review works in brief. Similar concepts of Fog computing, definitions,
    application scenarios, and numerous issues are described by one study [7]. Hu
    et al. [8] presented the hierarchical architecture of Fog computing and technologies
    like computing, communication, and storage technologies, namely resource management,
    security, and privacy protection that support Fog deployment and application.
    Baccarelli et al. [9] surveyed Fog computing and the Internet of Everything (IoE)
    with an integrated point of view of Fog computing and IoE. Varshney and Simmhan
    [10] reviewed various dimensions of application characteristics, system architecture,
    and platform abstractions of edge, Fog, and cloud ecosystems. Perera et al. [11]
    reviewed the Fog computing domain from the platform perspectives of developers
    and end users towards building a sustainable sensing infrastructure for smart
    city applications. Mahmud et al. [5] presented a taxonomy of Fog computing according
    to the identified challenges and its key features. The proposed taxonomy provides
    a classification of the existing works in Fog computing. Mouradian et al. [12]
    reviewed Fog architecture and algorithms based on six different evaluation criteria,
    namely heterogeneity, QoS management, scalability, mobility, federation, and interoperability.
    However, none of the studies had investigated taxonomy based on the requirements
    of infrastructure, platform, and application in Fog computing. Moreover, none
    of them comprehensively investigated fault tolerance, resource management, or
    microservices in Fog computing. We consider the aforementioned current issues
    and discuss these extensively and also highlight how cloud computing-related solutions
    could be employed in the Fog in some cases. The contributions of this review work
    can be summarized as follows: Present the research trends in Fog computing by
    investigating the number of published research works and search occurrences in
    Google Scholar. Review of several Fog computing architectures and presentation
    of a detailed architecture, as most of the previous researchers only presented
    high-level architecture. Present a taxonomy by considering the requirements of
    infrastructure, platform, and application in the Fog computing paradigm. Identify
    Fog computing research gaps in resource allocation and scheduling, fault tolerance,
    simulation tools, and Fog-based microservices. Address the limitations of current
    research works and some open issues in infrastructure, platform, and applications.
    From this survey, the industry and research community will be able to gain insight
    into the requirements for building a Fog computing environment with a better understanding
    of resource management in the Fog. The remainder of this paper is organized as
    follows: Section II surveys definitions and research trends in Fog computing.
    A technical comparison between Fog and cloud paradigms presents in section III.
    Section IV discusses computing paradigms similar to Fog computing. Section V presents
    related works on Fog computing architecture and discusses the components of the
    Fog computing architecture. Section VI shows the taxonomy of Fog computing by
    reviewing its requirements. Section VII presents various application dimension
    of Fog computing. Section VIII discusses current state-of-the-art Fog computing
    technology. Section IX presents open issues and future research direction. Section
    X concludes the paper. SECTION II. Overview of Fog Computing The term ‘Fog computing’
    was proposed in 2012 by researchers from Cisco Systems [13]. Processing application
    logic and data at the edge is not a new concept. The concept of Edge computation
    emerged around the 2000s [14], [15] and another similar concept, cloudlets, was
    introduced in 2009 [16]. Both Cloudlets and Fog computing are the advancements
    of a similar concept, which revolves around processing at the edge level. While
    cloudlets are applied in the mobile network, Fog computing is applied to connected
    things such as IoT, which plays into the concept of IoT [17]. Fog is both a virtualized
    and non-virtualized computing paradigm that provides networking, storage, and
    computation services amid cloud servers and IoT devices [4], [13]. However, these
    services are not completely located at the network edge. The Fog is a distributed
    computing approach that mainly focuses on facilitating applications, which require
    low latency services [18], Fog computing also supports non-latency aware services.
    It is obvious that using idle computation resources near the users will improve
    overall service performance, if the volume of processing were not that high. A
    huge number of heterogeneous nodes will be connected to the Fog. These nodes include
    sensors and actuators among others [13]. Computation is performed in Fog devices
    when necessary and storage facilities are also available for a short period of
    time, at least in most Fog devices. Time-sensitive computation in the Fog is done
    without the involvement of third parties, and in most cases, is done by the Fog
    processing devices. According to Yi et al. [7], the Fog computing paradigm supports
    the running of new services or basic network functions and applications in a sandboxed
    environment similar to cloudlets. However, the subject is still a research challenge
    because the question of how the Fog will provide these service still remains.
    In addition, will the Fog have cloud service providers or will it be like a single
    entity as a whole? Figure 1 shows a basic model of Fog Computing. Fog devices,
    Fog servers, and gateways are the basic computation components in the Fog environment.
    Any device that has computation, networking, and storage capabilities can act
    as a Fog device. These devices include set-top boxes, switches, routers, base
    stations, proxy servers or any other computing device. Fog servers that manage
    several Fog devices and Fog gateways are responsible for translation services
    between heterogeneous devices in the Fog computing environment. Fog gateways also
    provide translation services between IoT, Fog, and cloud layers. New challenges
    in this emerging computing paradigm have emerged in the past couple of years.
    FIGURE 1. A model of Fog computing. Show All In this section, we discuss the various
    definitions of Fog computing and define Fog computing from our point of view.
    In addition, we discuss and analyze research trends in Fog computing. Finally,
    we compare the technical differences between Fog computing and cloud computing.
    A. Definition of Fog Computing Fog computing is a distributed computing paradigm
    where processing is done at the edge of the network with seamless integration
    of the cloud infrastructure. It enables a computing facility for IoT environments
    or other latency sensitive application environments. It is estimated that about
    50 billion “things” will be connected to the Internet by 2020 [19]. Transferring
    all data from all connected devices for processing on the cloud will need massive
    amounts of bandwidth and storage. All devices are not connected to the controller
    via IP but connected by some other IoT industrial protocols. Because of this,
    a translation process is also needed for the processing or storing of information
    from IoT devices. Various researchers have defined Fog computing in different
    ways. Some examples are as follows: “Fog computing is a highly virtualized platform
    that provides compute, storage, and networking services between IoT devices and
    traditional cloud computing data centers, typically, but not exclusively located
    at the edge of network.” [13] “Fog computing is a scenario where a huge number
    of heterogeneous (wireless and sometimes autonomous) ubiquitous and decentralised
    devices communicate and potentially cooperate among them and with the network
    to perform storage and processing tasks without the intervention of third parties.
    These tasks can be for supporting basic network functions or new services and
    applications that run in a sandboxed environment. Users leasing part of their
    devices to host these services get incentives for doing so.” [20] “The term Fog
    computing or Edge Computing means that rather than hosting and working from a
    centralized cloud, Fog systems operate on network ends. It is a term for placing
    some processes and resources at the edge of the cloud, instead of establishing
    channels for cloud storage and utilization.” [21] The first definition of Fog
    computing was presented by Bonomi et al. [13], where they addressed the computing
    paradigm as a highly virtualized platform. However, some IoT devices such as smartphones
    are not virtualized but could also be a part of the Fog infrastructure, as some
    processing could still be done. According to Cisco [22], the Fog computing paradigm
    provides an ideal place to analyze most data near the devices that produce and
    act on that data instantaneously. The Fog is located near things that are able
    to process and act on the data generated. The devices that are within the Fog
    environment are known as Fog devices. These nodes can be deployed at any place
    with a connectivity to the network: on the power pole, on the factory floor, alongside
    the road, alongside the railway line, in a vehicle, inside a shopping mall, on
    an oil rig, etc. A device that has processing, storage, memory, and network capability
    can act as a Fog device. Although the Fog extends the cloud, technically it resides
    in between the cloud and IoT devices and handles processing and storage tasks
    in close proximity to the user. Yi et al. [7] stated that the definition given
    by Vaquero and Rodero-Merino [20] is debatable and a definition that can distinguish
    clearly between Fog computing and other related computing paradigms is still required.
    The definition given by IBM [21] represents Edge and Fog computing as the same
    computing paradigm. According to Shi et al. [23], Fog computing focuses more on
    the infrastructure side while edge computing focuses more on the things’ side.
    Furthermore, Edge computing is not spontaneously associated with any cloud-based
    services such as SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS [5]. In brief, Table 1 summarizes Fog definitions
    provided by various research works. TABLE 1 Summary of Fog Computing Definitions
    Considering the above definitions, we define Fog computing as follows: Fog computing
    is a distributed computing platform where most of the processing will be done
    by virtualized and non-virtualized end or edge devices. It is also associated
    with the cloud for non-latency-aware processing and long-term storage of useful
    data by residing in between users and the cloud. In our definition, we considered
    all devices with computing and storage capacity as Fog devices and also more precisely
    identified the role of the cloud in the Fog computing environment. B. Fog Computing
    Research Trends Growing attention towards processing data closer to the users
    has been observed among industries and the academia in the past few years. Handling
    IoT-generated data at the edge level will help improve overall processing time.
    In this section, we investigate Fog and other related technological trends for
    the past few years in the research community. According to the Gartner hype cycle,
    in July 2017 [24], the peak emerging technology is the smart home, which would
    perform better with the incorporation of the Fog computing environment. A Hype
    Cycle [24] represents common patterns of new trending technologies. Fog computing
    can also enable latency-aware smart home services in a more efficient and convenient
    way, especially for emergency response smart home applications. According to the
    Gartner hype cycle demonstration, some other influencing technologies include
    virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, IoT platforms, smart robots, edge computing,
    and smart workspaces, which are required to support latency-aware applications.
    All these mentioned technologies could benefit from the support of the Fog computing
    paradigm due to latency sensitiveness, connectivity to the cloud, and edge-level
    data processing capability. Except for the autonomous vehicle technology, all
    other aforementioned technologies will reach the market adoption threshold in
    the next 10 years. Besides the hype cycle analysis, we analyzed the search occurrence
    of Fog and other related technologies in Google Scholar. In addition, the number
    of papers available in different digital libraries related to the Fog was also
    analyzed. Google Scholar search occurrences of various similar technologies to
    Fog were investigated in the past few years, as presented in Figure 2. According
    to the data, edge computing is the topmost searched item in Google Scholar compared
    to other similar technologies. However, the search trend decreased by more than
    three times in the past eight years for edge computing. Mobile cloud computing
    and mobile edge computing are the other two top-searched computing paradigm after
    edge computing. The lowest trend observed was for dew computing and Fog dew computing.
    While the trend for edge computing is decreasing, Fog computing related to scholarly
    searches is increasing year by year, and has increased by 2.5 times from 2010
    to 2017. This shows that Fog computing is the fastest growing research area in
    academia and will have a great impact on the industry as well. FIGURE 2. Search
    occurrence of similar technologies like the Fog in Google Scholar. Show All Fog
    computing topic search in the Web of Science shows that the number of scholarly
    articles has more than doubled between 2015 and 2016, as per Figure 3. The first
    paper with ‘Fog computing’ in its title was published in 2012. Since then, about
    564 journal and conference articles have been published on this topic in the four
    major digital libraries (Web of Science, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and ACM),
    as presented in Figure 4. Cloud computing first emerged in 2008 [25]. This shows
    that Fog computing publications have dramatically increased, as no study in this
    area was seen in the couple of years following the introduction of cloud computing
    research in 2008 (see Figure 5). FIGURE 3. No. of Fog computing-related papers
    in the Web of Science (as Feb 2018). Show All FIGURE 4. Number of publications
    with ”Fog computing” in the title in the four major digital libraries. Show All
    FIGURE 5. Published articles with the title cloud computing in the Web of Science.
    Show All From our observation, it is obvious that the interest in Fog computing
    research is rapidly increasing. Idle resources in the form of devices near users
    can be utilized within the Fog computing concept. Thus, a clear direction to market
    the adoption and technological development of Fog deployment has emerged. SECTION
    III. Difference Between Fog and Cloud Computing Paradigm Fog computing architectures
    are based on Fog clusters where multiple Fog devices participate to cooperate
    with the processing. On the other hand, datacenters are the main physical components
    of clouds. Because of this, cloud computing has high operational costs and energy
    consumption. By comparison, energy consumption and operation costs in the Fog
    computing paradigm is low. The Fog is located closer to the user, so the distance
    between users and Fog devices could be one or a few hops, which is also agreed
    by Hu et al. [8]. However, according to Mahmud et al. [26], the distance between
    users to the Fog is one or two hops. Again, Luan et al. [27] argued that the distance
    should be one hop with wireless connectivity. Yet, all agreed with the distance
    between the users to the cloud, which is a multi-hop distance. Due to the distance,
    communication latency for the cloud is always high compared to the Fog. The cloud
    is a more centralized approach while the Fog is a more distributed approach based
    on geographical orchestration [26]. Real-time Interaction is not possible for
    the cloud due to its high latency, but this problem can be easily resolved by
    Fog computing. On the other hand, the rate of failure in the Fog is high because
    of wireless connectivity, decentralized management, and power failure [26], [28]–[30].
    Most devices in Fog environments will be connected wirelessly since smart gadgets
    and handheld devices will be participating in Fog systems [31]. These devices,
    and other network management devices, are mostly decentralized. These devices
    could fail when software is not managed correctly. Users may not be aware of malicious
    software that could lead to device failure. Moreover, Fog processing could fail
    in other cases as well, for example, each Fog device is responsible for performing
    its own application processing. So, the IoT application processing in a Fog device
    always takes second priority. If the Fog device is fully utilized by the application
    of the device itself, then it will fail to do any Fog processing. Hence, the scheduling
    of applications and resources in the Fog is more complex. In addition, failure
    handling in the Fog is competitive because of power failure, which is only an
    issue because the devices run on battery power. Altogether, Table 2 shows the
    technical differences between the cloud and the Fog. TABLE 2 Technical Difference
    Between Fog and Cloud Definitely, it cannot be said that the Fog can replace the
    cloud. We cannot even conclude that the Fog is better than the cloud either, both
    contribute differently via fulfilling different perspectives and requirements.
    SECTION IV. Related Paradigms and Technologies Fog computing uses computing resources
    near underlying networks, located between the traditional cloud and edge devices,
    to provide better and faster application processing and services [13]. Several
    similar computing paradigms exist besides Fog computing such as Mobile Cloud Computing
    (MCC), Mobile-Edge Computing (MEC), Edge Computing, Dew Computing, and Fog-dew
    computing. In cloud computing, all IoT devices are directly connected to the cloud
    and computation totally depends on the cloud. However, all the above similar technologies
    do not exclusively depend on the cloud, but depend on some intermediate devices
    for computation; some of them do not even require a connection to the cloud. Figure
    6 shows the high-level architecture of these technologies. FIGURE 6. High level
    architecture of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Edge
    Computing (EC), Dew Computing (DC), Fog Computing (FC) and Fog Dew Computing (FDC).
    Show All A. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) Remote execution of offloaded mobile
    services is done with the support of MCC near end users [32], [33]. MCC overcomes
    the computational, energy, and storage resource limitation of smart mobile devices.
    Generally, a lightweight cloud server (cloudlet) is placed at the edge of the
    network [34] to overcome these issues. MCC is a mobile computing technology, which
    provides unrestricted functionality, mobility, and storage facility through heterogeneous
    network connectivity. This technology also provides unified elastic computing
    resources by following the pay-per-use model. It also provides access to data,
    application, and cloud via the Internet for mobile users. It is expected that
    this technology will be applied in education, urban and rural development, healthcare,
    and more realistic social networking in the future [32]. Nowadays, many computation-intensive
    applications are widely available, such as Augmented Reality, computer vision
    and graphics, speech recognition, machine learning, planning and decision-making,
    and natural language processing applications. However, simply designing powerful
    mobile devices will not meet the requirements for these applications [33]. Rather,
    the applications require edge processing as well as collaboration with the cloud
    for complex processing. Thus, mobile computing demands fundamental changes to
    cloud computing, for example, a low-latency middle tier, programming models to
    enable seamless remote execution, basic mobile cloud services such as presence
    services, cloud infrastructure optimization for mobile applications, memcache
    services, and so on [33]. The convergence of mobile cloud computing is predicated
    on a reliable, end-to-end network, and high bandwidth, which isdifficult to guarantee
    in harsh environments. One of the solutions to this deep-rooted problem is the
    VM-based cloudlets located at a closer location to the mobile device [34]. B.
    Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) MEC proposes the co-location of computing and storage
    resources at the base stations of cellular networks [35]. MEC could either be
    connected or disconnected to cloud datacenters in a remote location. Hence, MEC
    supports two- or three-tier hierarchical application deployments along with end
    mobile devices [36]. In a MEC ecosystem, a new device called the MEC server needs
    to be deployed near base station towers to provide processing and storage capabilities
    at the edge. Four participants are involved in this computing paradigm, which
    are the mobile end users, network operators, Internet infrastructure provider
    (InPs),and application service provider. Mobile end users are the main consumer
    of the system and request their service via user equipment (UE). Network operators
    manage and maintain the operation of base stations, mobile core network, and MEC
    servers. InPs maintain Internet connectivity and routers. Application service
    providers host the application services in the content delivery networks (CDN)
    or within a data centers. Processing of requests from the UE will search out the
    closest MEC. The MEC server is capable of processing user request instead of forwarding
    it to remote Internet services. In a case where it is not possible to process
    or complete a request at the MEC sever; the request will be forwarded to remote
    CDNs or data centers [35]. According to Klas [36], MEC is the evolution of mobile
    base stations. It is a natural development. It is a collaborative deployment of
    telecommunication and IT networking. This computing paradigm enables new vertical
    business segments and services to individual end users and enterprise consumers.
    Various services could be delivered through this computing paradigm including
    IoT, location services, augmented reality, caching service, video analytics, and
    local content distribution. It can deliver real-time low-latency access of local
    content or by caching content at the MEC server. However, the main limitation
    of this system is the installation of the MEC server, which is specifically dedicated
    to MEC services. Scaling is another big issue with the increase in resource demand
    over time. C. Edge Computing Edge devices or edge servers provide computation
    facilities in Edge computing. In general, edge computing does not spontaneously
    associate with any types of cloud-based services and concentrates more on the
    IoT device side [23]. One study defined the edge as any network or computing resource
    near the path between cloud data centers and data sources [23]. Any smart device
    or sensor could have data sources but the edge is different. For example, a cloudlet
    and a micro datacenter is the edge of the mobile application and cloud, whereas
    the IoT gateway is the edge between IoT sensors and cloud. Similarly, if a cloud
    application is running on a smartphone, then the smartphone is the edge of the
    application and the cloud [37]. The main motivation of edge computing is that
    the computation should be done at a closer location to the data sources. In the
    edge computing concept, things are not only consuming data but also produce data
    by taking part in processing. Edge devices can perform computation task from the
    cloud besides requesting services and content. Data storage, computing offloading,
    processing, and caching will be done by an edge node. The edge device is also
    capable of distributing requests and providing service on behalf of the cloud
    to the users. In such scenarios, edge devices need to be well designed to meet
    privacy requirements, reliability measures, and security concerns [23]. D. Dew
    Computing (DC) In the current computing hierarchy, Dew Computing [38] is situated
    at the ground level of the cloud and Fog computing environment [39]. DC goes beyond
    the concept of service, storage, and network, to a sub-platform, which is based
    on a microservice concept for which its computing hierarchy is vertically distributed
    [39]. The DC approach facilitates resources such as sensors, tablets, and smartphones
    that are seamlessly connected to a network. Because of this, DC covers a wide
    range of ad-hoc-based networking technologies [39]. Skala et al. [39] argued that
    DC is much more useful in everyday life compared to Fog computing. Fog supports
    IoT-based applications, which demand less latency and real-time capability and
    a dynamic network configuration while DC is microservice concept and thus is not
    dependent on any centralized device, server, or cloud. They provide an example
    in which DC could be integrated into a smart traffic control system, where data
    collection and processing units will be located in between the traffic signals.
    These units generate a collective overview of the current traffic conditions.
    In such a way, a car with low fuel will be notified before entering heavy congestion,
    or a hybrid car will be informed of switching to conventional fuel before approaching
    the congestion. As a result, cars with less fuel will be rescued from unwanted
    situations and hybrid cars could reduce exhaust smoke densities significantly.
    Although the concept is microservice-based, the processing is completed in Fog
    devices. In the Fog computing concept, it is not crucial that applications must
    be dependent on the cloud or require the storing of results in the cloud. On the
    other hand, if such traffic processing information were stored, it would help
    strategic decision-making to improve traffic management. Dew computing is an emerging
    research area and its goal is to use the full potential of cloud and local resources
    [40]. E. Fog-Dew Computing In the architecture of Fog-dew computing, IoT devices
    need not have an active Internet connection while being connected to the community
    server. The community server will interact with the cloud and is responsible for
    providing services to the IoT devices [41]. Cloud computing always needs an Internet
    connection, which is the main drawback of the cloud. While the cloud is unable
    to serve users without an Internet connection, Fog-dew computing facilitates offline
    services without an Internet connection. However, there are some exceptions. For
    example, the navigation app, Waze, allows users to navigate offline. This feature
    was also recently added to Google Maps. In this case, a map information file for
    a specific area is downloaded to the user device and allows users to navigate
    during an offline state. Another example is Google Drive and Dropbox, where users
    can delete, create, and update files and folders in offline mode and then sync
    once the device is connected to the Internet. However, these services are not
    purely offline-we may not rely on the Internet directly but we cannot completely
    ignore Internet connection. The situation becomes more complex when a single user
    uses multiple offline devices alongside the complexity that arises in a multiuser
    environment. Such situations could be mitigated with the help of Fog-dew computing.
    In summary, in the Fog computing paradigm, IoT devices are connected to the cloud
    via Fog devices. Fog devices are connected to the cloud through the core network.
    Fog computing is a combination of MEC and MCC [7] but the main goal of all Fog-related
    paradigms is to perform processing at the edge. These related paradigms differ
    from each other based on Internet and cloud connectivity. Also, the amount of
    processing that needs to be done at the edge differs based on service requirements.
    Furthermore, the type of devices that will be used for computation and storage
    purposes is also another issue. In summary, Table 3 shows the characteristics
    of the above-discussed related computing paradigms along with the Fog computing
    paradigm. TABLE 3 Summary of Similar Technologies Like Fog SECTION V. Architecture
    of Fog Computing For market adoption and deployment, Fog computing must have a
    standard architecture. There is no available standard architecture to date. However,
    many research works have presented Fog computing architectures. In this section,
    we firstly discuss the high-level architecture of Fog computing. Furthermore,
    we summarize some proposed architectures for Fog computing. Finally, we present
    a detailed architecture for Fog computing with a comprehensive description of
    each component of the architecture. A. High-Level Architecture of Fog Computing
    In high-level architecture, the Fog computing paradigm has three different layers,
    as shown in Figure 7. The most important layer is the Fog layer. This layer consists
    of all intermediate computing devices. Traditional virtualization technologies
    can be used at this plane, similar to the cloud. However, considering the resource
    availability, employing container-based virtualization is more appropriate. This
    layer accumulates sensor-generated data from the IoT layer and sends an actuation-related
    request after processing. Although it seems that the big data problem is solved
    by processing generated data at the edge level, billions of devices will create
    big data issue. In fact, it is possible to employ small- and medium-scale big
    data processing at this level. Many research works have been undertaken to process
    big data in the Fog plane [47]–[53]. FIGURE 7. High level Fog computing architecture.
    Show All The bottommost layer is the IoT plane, which consists of all connected
    devices. The devices on this plane perform the sensing and actuation process.
    For time-sensitive applications, processing should be done on the Fog plane exclusively
    while the cloud can perform other processing that is not time-sensitive. However,
    the Fog layer will manage what needs to be sent to the cloud and what should not.
    The users are able to get services from both the Fog and cloud based on their
    request. However, the cloud plane will manage complex processing and storage.
    B. Various Proposed Architectures for Fog Computing Layered representation is
    the best way to represent Fog architecture. Many works have been done to quantify
    the layer-based concept of Fog architecture [4], [27], [54]–[58]. From our review,
    we found that researchers have proposed three [27], [56]–[58], four [55], five
    [4], and six [54] layers in the Fog architecture. Everyone has their own justifications
    for their claims. If we ignored the user plane, it is obvious that Fog architecture
    could be defined as three different levels from the high level. As we proceed
    to the more implementation-type level, the number of layers in the architecture
    would vary, giving rise to five [4] and six [54] levels in the Fog computing layer.
    Aazam and Huh [54] presented six different layers based on specific tasks. On
    the other hand, Dastjerdi et al. [4] defined five different layers based on network
    perspective. Other high-level architectures in Fog computing were also presented
    by various researchers including the hierarchical Fog architecture [59], [60],
    OpenFog architecture [61], Fog network architecture [62], Fog architecture for
    Internet of energy [9], Fog computing Architecture based on nervous system [63],
    and IFCIoT architecture [64]. After reviewing the literature stated above, we
    define the components of Fog computing architecture, which is presented in the
    following subsection. C. Components of Fog Computing Architecture Fog computing
    architecture consists of several layers. Each layer and its components are shown
    in Figure 8. In this subsection, we discuss various components of the Fog computing
    architecture. The components are divided into several groups based on their functionality,
    which is defined as the layer. These functionalities will enable IoT devices to
    communicate with various Fog devices, servers, gateways, and the cloud. A detailed
    explanation of each layer is given below, where a smart transportation use case
    is considered in the explanation. FIGURE 8. Components of Fog computing architecture.
    Show All 1) Physical Layer The basic data source for Fog computing is the various
    forms of data emitted by the sensors [57]. These data could be generated from
    smart devices, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, smart homes, the CCTV surveillance
    system, traffic monitoring system, self-driving vehicles, and so on. For instance,
    if we wanted to implement a smart traffic management and monitoring system, we
    need to get updated traffic conditions of all roads from various sensors, roadside
    devices, and cameras, which will help manage traffic signals. It is also necessary
    to predict future traffic demand by collecting data from various GPS sensors.
    Besides physical sensors, the role of virtual sensors is also important [54],
    if a road accident occurred, it would not be possible to decide using just a single
    sensor whether the road should be blocked or traffic should keep going. The road
    might have one or more lanes- one lane may be affected by this occurrence while
    another lane could enable the traffic flow to continue, but the traffic handling
    capacity will be decreased due to this occurrence. In this case, a virtual sensor
    might help obtain an immediate decision on road conditions, traffic multiplexing,
    and traffic rerouting. Hence, the physical layer consists of physical and virtual
    sensors, where any data generation device could fall into any of these groups.
    2) Fog Device, Server, and Gateway Layer The Fog device, Fog server, or Fog gateway
    could be a standalone device or an IoT device [57], [59], [62]. However, it is
    obvious that the Fog server should have a higher configuration than the Fog device
    and gateway since it manages several Fog devices. Various factors are involved
    so that the Fog server can run. These include its role, hardware configuration,
    connectivity, number of devices it can manage, and so on. Whether the Fog server
    is distinct or part of an IoT device is defined by its role. A group of physical
    and virtual sensors will be connected to a Fog device. Similarly, a group of Fog
    devices will be connected to a Fog server. In this context, the Fog server should
    have higher processing and storage capacity compared to the Fog device. A specific
    cluster of Fog devices, which are connected to the same server, can communicate
    with each other when required. In the smart transportation use case, some application
    processing might depend on other Fog clusters. For example, if an application
    needed to find a fuel-efficient route, it might need information about other sensor
    clusters or Fog device clusters. To reach an appropriate decision, processing
    needs to be done in multiple Fog devices and servers. The Fog server and device
    layer are responsible for managing and maintaining information on hardware configuration,
    storage configuration, and connectivity of device and servers. This layer also
    manages the computation requirements requested by various applications. Computation
    requirements depend on data flow and the total number of IoT devices connected
    to the Fog device, as well as the total number of Fog devices connected to the
    Fog server. The communication between several Fog servers is maintained by this
    layer. For example, a Cisco IOx-supported 800 series router can be used as a Fog
    device and Cisco Fog data service devices can be used as the Fog server [65],
    [66]. 3) Monitoring Layer The monitoring layer always keeps track of the system
    performance and resources [54], services, and responses. System monitoring components
    help choose the appropriate resources during operation. Various applications run
    in smart transportation system scenarios. Therefore, it is obvious that a situation
    could arise when resource availability will be negative for computation or storage
    on a Fog device. A similar case could happen to the Fog server. To tackle these
    kinds of situations, the Fog device and servers will seek help from other peers.
    Thus, the system monitoring component will help decide such things efficiently.
    The resource demand component monitors current resource demand and can predict
    future demand for resources based on current resource usage and user activities.
    In this way, the system will be able to deal with any awkward situations where
    resource outage might occur. Performance prediction monitors can predict Fog computing
    performance based on system load and resource availability. This component is
    required to maintain appropriate QoS requirements in service level agreements.
    If SLA violation occurs frequently, then the cost of the system for the provider
    will be increased because of the penalty. Although performance prediction cannot
    eliminate this issue completely, it will be able to minimize overall SLA violation
    by predicting the performance and usage of the system. 4) Pre and Post-Processing
    Layer This layer contains multiple components, which specifically work on basic
    and advanced data analysis. At this level, acquired data are analyzed and filtered,
    and data trimming and reconstruction are also done when necessary. After processing
    the data, the data flow component decides whether the data needs to be stored
    locally or should be sent to the cloud for long-term storage [59]. The main challenge
    in Fog computing is to process data at the edge and minimize the volume of data
    that needs to be stored; this phenomenon is referred to as stream processing.
    In the smart transportation system use case, data will be generated from many
    sensors. These generated data will be analyzed and filtered in real time to get
    insight into the generated data. All generated data might not have any use. In
    some cases, it would not even be a good idea to store all generated data. As an
    example, if data is generated from a sensor each second, the mean value of data
    within a minute or within an hour may be stored depending on application requirements.
    Data can be trimmed in this way and a vast amount of storage space can be saved.
    In another case, if the difference among data values in some period of time is
    not that big, but might affect performance, then less numbers of reading within
    a minute can be taken. In such a way, it will be possible to filter a vast amount
    of generated data. Although the accuracy may not be 100%, application requirements
    might still be fulfilled to some extent. Data reconstruction is one of the components
    of this layer. This module takes care of faulty and incomplete data generated
    by the sensors. Similarly, if one or more sensors fail during operation, this
    component will reconstruct the data based on the data generation pattern to prevent
    interruption or any other application failure. 5) Storage Layer The storage module
    is responsible for storing data through storage virtualization. The data backup
    component ensures availability of data and mitigates the loss of data. In the
    storage virtualization concept, a pool of storage devices connected by a network
    acts as a single storage device, which is easier to manage and maintain. One of
    the key benefits of storage virtualization is to provide enterprise-class functionality
    using less-expensive storage or commodity hardware. Thus, the storage layer facilitates
    storage virtualization in order to minimize the complexity of the storage system.
    In a system, storage might fail at any point during system operation [67]. Therefore,
    it is crucial to backup important data to mitigate any unwanted situations. The
    data backup module in this layer takes care of periodic or customized data backup
    schemes. 6) Resource Management Layer The components in this layer maintain the
    allocation of resources, and scheduling, and deal with energy saving issues. The
    reliability component maintains the reliability of application scheduling and
    resource allocation. Scalability ensures the scalability of Fog resources during
    peak hours where resource demand is high. The cloud deals with horizontal scalability
    while Fog computing aims to provide both horizontal and vertical scalability [9].
    There are many distributed system resources for network, processing, and storage.
    This is a critical issue for distributed resources, which use application processing.
    Thus, resource allocation, deallocation, and reallocation will happen in which
    the resource allocation component manages and maintains resource allocation related
    issues. Another vital issue is that many applications will run in the Fog computing
    environment simultaneously. Hence, proper scheduling of these applications is
    required. The application scheduling component takes care of these applications
    based on various objectives. This layer also has energy saving components, which
    manage resources in an energy-efficient manner. Energy efficiency also positively
    affects the environment and helps minimize operational cost. Reliability components
    handle the requirement for the reliability of a system based on various reliability
    measures and metrics. Fog computing is a complex system that needs to take care
    of all IoT devices, Fog devices, and the cloud. Therefore, a device or connection
    might fail at any level, so reliability management is an important issue. 7) Security
    Layer All security-related issues such as encryption of communications and secure
    data storage will be maintained by the components in this layer, which also preserve
    the privacy of Fog users. Fog computing is intended to be deployed as a form of
    utility computing like cloud computing. However, in the cloud computing concept,
    the user connects to the cloud for services, but in the Fog computing concept
    the user will connect to the Fog infrastructure for the services while the Fog
    middleware will manage and maintain communications with the cloud. Hence, a user
    intending to connect to a service must be authorized by the provider. Therefore,
    the authentication component in the security layer processes authentication requests
    from users, so they can connect to the Fog computing service environment [27].
    To maintain security, it is crucial to maintain encryption between communications,
    so that security breaches by outsiders will not occur. The encryption component
    encrypts all connections from and to IoT devices and to the cloud. Fog computing
    components are mostly connected via a wireless connection, so security concerns
    are crucial. Some services in a smart city or smart house privacy are also an
    issue because of the involvement of user-related data in these types of systems.
    The Fog computing paradigm should not disclose user information without their
    consent. In the current age, the majority of users normally accept the security
    policy of the provider without reading it. Thus, special consideration of privacy
    should be undertaken for such services that involve user-related critical information.
    8) Application Layer Although the Fog was developed to serve IoT applications
    [58], several other applications based on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and CDN
    also support Fog computing. Any application that has latency-aware characteristics
    will be able to take advantage of Fog computing. This includes any type of utility-based
    service that could fit within Fog computing by providing better service quality
    and cost-effectiveness. For example, Augmented Reality-based applications should
    adopt Fog computing because of its nature. It is clear that Augmented Reality
    will transform the modern world in the near future. The needs of real-time processing
    for Augmented Reality applications can be addressed by Fog computing, which can
    maintain continuous improvement of Augmented Reality-related services. SECTION
    VI. Taxonomy of Fog Computing The Fog computing taxonomy is presented in Figure
    9. This taxonomy is derived by considering existing literature and the overall
    viewpoint on Fog computing. The proposed taxonomy focuses on the requirements
    perspective for infrastructure, platform, and application. FIGURE 9. Taxonomy
    of Fog computing based on the requirements of infrastructure, platform, and applications.
    Show All Firstly, by considering infrastructure, we identify infrastructure and
    network requirements, and the types of devices in a Fog computing environment.
    Secondly, for platform resource allocation and scheduling, security and privacy
    concern, service requirements, management, and multitenancy were determined. Finally,
    we defined application requirements, user requirements, and application modeling
    taxonomy for Fog computing. This taxonomy will help the research community and
    enterprises to gain better understanding and insight into the real-world deployment
    of Fog computing requirements, architecture, and devices. Figure 9 shows the taxonomy
    of Fog computing. A detailed description of each branch of the taxonomy is presented
    in this section. A. Infrastructure Fog computing infrastructure requirements depend
    on the network, devices, and their requirements. All Fog devices, network devices,
    and gateways existing in the Fog environment that participates in computation
    are also part of the Fog infrastructure. Infrastructure denotes the physical components
    of the Fog environment. 1) Infrastructure Requirements The many connected tiny
    devices are the primary elements in a Fog computing environment. These devices
    are located everywhere and help to connect all things around us. It is estimated
    that the world will see 50 billion handheld devices by 2020. Beside these devices,
    a huge number of sensors and actuators will also be put in place. Therefore, a
    proper infrastructural facility is needed to support this vast computing environment
    [20]. An example of how the number of sensors is increasing day by day is given
    in The Economist report titled, “Augmented Business”, which describes the implant
    sensors on cattle ears that could help to monitor their activity, health, and
    movements. This could help increase overall productivity. The implant of sensors
    affixed in one cow produces about 200 MB of information in a year. In another
    example, with sensor technology, Rolls-Royce is able to forecast when engines
    will more likely fail. From such a prediction, customers can plan engine changes.
    Heidelberger Druckmaschinen has huge printing presses equipped with more than
    1,000 sensors. These are the examples of distinct uses of sensors in specific
    domains. However, this phenomenon will change completely when the distinct parts
    are connected to generate more efficient and effective decisions. Therefore, the
    Fog infrastructure must have the capability to provide physical resources for
    computation, networking, storage, and memory to achieve efficient Fog computing
    services. 2) Network Requirements The network is one of the key bottlenecks in
    the Fog computing environment, where billions of connected devices generate and
    consume data at the edge of the network [68]. Most of the sensing and actuating
    devices require low bandwidth but a higher number of devices will be connected
    at the same time. Therefore, existing network connection technologies like LAN,
    MAN, WAN, or PAN need to be investigated further and amendments will be needed
    to cope with the Fog computing environment to facilitate countless IoT devices.
    Network operators are increasingly investing in new wireless access technology
    research because of the number of devices per user is increasing day by day. For
    instance, in the cellular mobile network, base stations have a limited number
    of link points [20]. As the number of things increase, these stations will need
    to support increasing numbers of devices. Fog devices must act as a router for
    neighboring IoT devices and as a primary processing unit for IoT application in
    the Fog environment. Each Fog device should have a resilient connectivity to the
    lower and upper layer devices. Mobile ad-hoc networks could act as a basis for
    the Fog network because of their mobility and lower cost feature [20]. Hence,
    connection and mobility are the main requirements for the Fog network. 3) Fog
    Devices Fog computing is basically intended to support IoT-related technologies
    to perform processing at the edge level. Mine projects [69], [70] at the middle
    of the sea, airline fleets or a ship [70] can be equipped with a huge number of
    sensors, so it is impossible to send and store all generated data in real-time
    into the cloud. Some intermediate computation, processing, and services will be
    done by Fog computing devices. Thus, the Fog layer must have sensor management
    devices, Fog processing, and storage devices and Fog gateway devices. All of these
    devices will work collaboratively to manage and perform tasks in the Fog plane.
    Here, we discuss the devices that are needed for Fog computing deployment. a:
    IoT Devices IoT devices are the devices that have sensing and actuating capability.
    A sensor is able to sense the environment, while an actuator acts on it when necessary.
    One of the most common types of sensor in IoT devices is the temperature sensor.
    The temperature sensor has various functions depending on different domains such
    as at home, in factories, and in the agriculture field. This sensor is also used
    to sense the temperature of soil, water, and plants in order to take proper action
    needed to improve service outcome. Another type of useful sensor is the pressure
    sensor, used especially in agriculture, smart vehicles, and aircrafts. Sensors
    are also used to estimate the volume of water used by the agricultural sector
    for cultivation and other uses. Surprisingly, a huge percentage of this water
    is wasted due to leaky irrigation systems and inefficient use of fresh water.
    Efficient use of the pressure sensor will help solve this problem. The pressure
    sensor is able to determine the flow of water and reduce water waste. The pressure
    sensor is also used in smart vehicles to determine the forces acting on it, and
    in aircrafts to determine altitude. Different groups of sensors are used for different
    IoT environments. For example, in healthcare, the most-used sensors are chemical,
    IR, pressure, and temperature sensors as well as other biosensors. On the other
    hand, in a smartphone, the most-used sensors are the gyroscope, GPS, and proximity
    sensors. One of the applications of the proximity sensor is to determine the presence
    of ear to dim or turn off the phone backlight to improve battery efficiency. This
    sensor is also used to monitor parking space since it can determine the presence
    of an object without touching it. It can also be used in a wide temperature range
    and is not affected by color. Its detection process also is not effected by dirt,
    oil, or water. There are many other sensors out there that enable IoT, which include
    GPS sensors, water quality sensors, level sensors, chemical/gas sensors, smoke
    sensors, IR sensors, humidity sensors, sound and vibration sensors, motion sensors,
    acceleration sensors, and machine vision sensors. There are five main types of
    actuators-magnetic or thermal, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical.
    The actuator has a controlling or moving mechanism, a motor, which acts on various
    inputs. The raw application data comes from various sensors like speed sensors,
    cameras, temperature sensors, vehicle monitoring sensors, or GPS sensors. A typical
    sensor generates 10 data samples every second [71]. Sensors convert environmental
    variables such as smoke, heat, light, temperature, humidity, sound, and so on
    into electrical signals. These sensors are varied and can be micro-electro-mechanical
    systems (MEMS)-based, CMOS-based or LED sensors. Communication among sensors could
    be done by ZigBee, Bluetooth, Z-Wave or 6LoWPAN standards for short distance communication
    [72]. There is a necessity for communication among sensors in some cases where
    one sensing output is dependent on other collective sensor outputs. These sensors
    will be connected to Fog devices through wireless connections. However, Fog devices
    collect and process data based on application requirements. Some example of research
    works based on sensors can be improved by taking advantage of Fog computing. Aziz
    et al. [73] proposed a real-time health monitoring system using particular sensors
    in which the proposed architecture was based on GSM and GPS technologies. The
    system specifically monitors the body temperature and blood pressure of patients.
    The study used an Arduino microcontroller, dfrobot GPS/GPRS/GSM module v3.0.3,
    a heartbeat pulse sensor, and a lilypad temperature sensor for hardware implementation.
    In another study, a web-based application was developed for doctors and nurses
    with SMS functionality, which will be used as an emergency case. The system is
    able to generate GPS location, body temperature, and blood pressure. Butt et al.
    [74] investigated wearable technology such as SensHand, Gloves-based system, electromyography-based
    and hybrid systems, leap motion, and smartwatches. The development of these kinds
    of technology must be integrated with the smart home system and Fog-like architecture
    in order to deal with emergency situations. Some devices such as the smartphone
    can be considered as both an IoT and Fog device. In the same way, if some sensors
    and actuators were installed in the Raspberry Pi, the device could also act as
    both an IoT and Fog device. b: Fog Processing Devices Any device that has computing
    capability, storage, and network connectivity can act as a Fog processing device.
    It could be a network controller, switch, router, server, or a video surveillance
    camera. A Cisco 800 series router can be used as a Fog device where the IoT application
    can be run on the device and the device supporting Cisco IOx. To date, only Cisco
    800 series routers are supporting IOx with Linux kernel with virtualization support
    [44]. Most of these devices have a 266-400 MHz MPC8272 processor with 16 KB Cache,
    64 MB random access memory and 20 MB processor board flash memory. The user can
    host an application on these routers. These routers have two cores-Cisco IOS runs
    on one core and another core is used for running IOx services. Another type of
    Fog processing device is the Fog server. A Fog server can control several Fog
    devices in a specific domain. Cisco offers two flavors of Fog computing server
    deployment. One is the Cisco Fog Director, which can be deployed on any type of
    server with Cisco-recommended server specifications [66]. Another example of a
    Fog device manufactured by Cisco is the Fog data services, which are specifically
    designed for IoT [65]. However, Cisco Fog data services can only be deployed on
    Cisco UCS E and C Series Servers. Both will act as Fog servers; however, Cisco
    Fog data services are especially designed for an IoT environment. However, various
    organizations and bodies need to work beyond the proprietary solutions for fast
    technological advancement and technology adoption with a limited budget. Fog devices
    and Fog servers should be deployed in such a way that any type of network management
    device with storage and processing capability can act as a Fog device. Similarly,
    the usual type of server must be able to act as a Fog server. This could be an
    ordinary PC since Fog is not dedicated to performing very complex processing.
    However, further investigation is necessary to explore the minimum system requirement
    for a device that can act as a Fog device or Fog server. Connectivity between
    Fog devices and Fog servers will be via Ethernet or wireless or a serial connection
    in some cases. As an example, Cisco UCS E and C Series Servers, which are generally
    used as Fog servers, are connected to the network via Ethernet. On the other hand,
    Cisco 800 series routers are connected via serial ports that support Fog computation.
    c: Gateway Devices for Fog Many hardware boards are currently available in the
    market including Arduino Yun, Intel Edison, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone Black, Arduino
    + Shields, Netduino, Tessel 2, and so on. These boards are currently used as IoT
    and gateway devices and can also be used as Fog gateway devices and as Fog devices.
    These boards have a built-in processor, wired and wireless adapter, and a USB
    port. Fog computing supports device heterogeneity, where a gateway could also
    be a part of the Fog computing environment. Constant et al. [75] developed a Fog
    gateway using Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi. Their proposed Fog gateway integrated
    the data conditioning process, smart analytics, intelligent filtering, and transfer
    to the cloud, which needs long-term storage and temporal variability monitoring.
    The IoT gateway supports various data types and communication protocols between
    devices and sensors. It also unifies the data format from various sensors. Current
    IoT gateways provide a solution for communication and do not support fully automatic
    configurations of newly added IoT devices [76]. Guoqiang et al. [77] proposed
    a smart IoT gateway with three key benefits. The proposed gateway has a unified
    external interface and pluggable architecture. It has a flexible protocol to translate
    various sensor data into a uniform format. The study designed a customized device
    with a Samsung S5PV210 mobile application processor as its gateway. However, this
    gateway did not have any fault tolerance or security features. B. Platform The
    platform manages applications and infrastructure in the Fog environment. It takes
    care of resource allocation, scheduling, fault tolerance, multi-tenancy, security,
    and privacy in Fog computing. Based on the taxonomy of the Fog, we discuss the
    requirements of the platform for Fog computing in this section. 1) Resource Allocation
    and Scheduling Heterogeneous devices are the main challenges in developing proper
    resource allocation and scheduling in the Fog. If we wanted to use the computation
    power of idle devices, we need to schedule tasks on these devices efficiently.
    Otherwise, IoT application processing in the Fog will face complex issues, which
    will hinder the fulfillment of the latency awareness goal. Two of the key requirements
    for resource allocation and scheduling are availability and efficiency. Resources
    in the Fog are not dedicated, and thus availability should be ensured. On the
    other hand, lack of efficient resource allocation and scheduling might lead to
    unwanted delays in the overall processing. 2) Service Requirements Fog services
    can be defined as single or multiple user requests, where the user will constantly
    be updated of the outcome of the service until he or she has a subscription to
    that service. This means that the service outcome will not be fixed and will keep
    changing until the end of the service. The Fog device and Fog server perform the
    intermediate processing, which occurs in between user request and service output.
    The Fog server may communicate with the cloud for processing and information retrieval
    when necessary. For instance, if we considered selecting the best path based on
    real-time traffic in a smart transportation system, the Fog service will keep
    updating on the best path until the end of the journey. In this case, we need
    to take into account mitigation of fault, service quality, network latency, and
    power consumption in order to maintain the standard of the service. a: Fault Tolerance
    Fault tolerance allows a system to keep performing even when a part of the system
    has failed. This failure might be software failure, hardware failure, or network
    failure. The solution for fault tolerance will result in a fully operational system
    where the system will continue its operation with a lower capability instead of
    shutting down totally [78]. Fault tolerance is mostly investigated in the cloud
    [79]–[89]. However, it is necessary to investigate fault tolerance in the Fog
    as well. Although many research works have addressed the need to explore fault
    tolerance issues [5], [9], [64] in Fog computing, none have actually investigated
    the issue. We discuss in more detail the issue of fault tolerance in Section VIII-B.
    b: Quality of Service (QoS) QoS is an important service requirement for Fog computing,
    which is based on reliability, network delay, throughput, and energy consumption.
    Besides these, resource management, power-consumption model, scheduling policy,
    and power failure handling are also important to ensure QoS. If some sensors fail
    for any reason, the accuracy of the outcome or action could be affected. Fog is
    intended to work with latency-sensitive systems; hence, it should maintain high
    reliability with a strict QoS assurance. Otherwise, the latency awareness criteria
    will not be fulfilled. Madsen et al. [90] suggested that the availability of different
    methodologies and algorithms work with the reliability of network connectivity
    and information, to ensure accuracy, which is crucial for building Fog computing-based
    projects. 3) Security and Privacy In this technological era, people are inevitably
    sharing personal information when using different applications and web services.
    Our personal information is no longer personal; it now belongs to many tech giants
    because we are using their free services on a regular basis [91]. A simple example
    is that if anyone used an Android phone without any security settings, the built-in
    Android OS will automatically run GPS and map services, for which it can collect
    all location-related activities about the user. Therefore, information about when
    and which country a user has visited, where a user has dined in, which route a
    user uses for going to the office, home, and so on will be made available to these
    companies. However, these tech giants might argue that they do not disclose our
    data to others, as they can only see our data in our timeline only. However, a
    recent Facebook incident fails to convince us of the honesty of these tech giants
    [92]. The Fog computing paradigm is completely distributed and not intended to
    be centrally managed most of the time. Sensitive data might be processed in an
    intermediate device when the application does not have full control of the device.
    On the other hand, the user will not have full control over the Fog applications.
    Users will require more protective and innovative ways to retain their privacy
    and protect it from any potential and very harmful entities [20]. Similarly, Fog
    application providers also need to develop security to protect their application
    from unwanted data theft. Three different types of security need to be ensured:
    network connection security, data security, and user privacy. Network connection
    security and data security are applicable from both the user and provider perspectives.
    Moreover, user privacy is also important because Fog processing is carried out
    on user data in most cases. 4) Multi-Tenancy Multiple tenants for the same services
    with an isolated runtime for each tenant are referred to as multi-tenancy service.
    Multi-tenancy is important for Fog because of the limited resources in a Fog environment.
    By enabling multi-tenancy, one instance will run in a Fog device and will serve
    multiple tenants (users). Multi-tenancy could be container-based or could be the
    usual virtualization-based. Container-based virtualization is a more lightweight
    and powerful virtualization solution, which the Fog can adopt, to provide the
    fastest processing solution. Container-based virtualization does not need to emulate
    the operating system to facilitate virtualization; thus, it will be easier to
    manage and migrate. Multi-tenancy is a requirement for the platform, and needs
    to be defined before deployment. Multi-tenancy may incur performance degradation
    and security issues [29]; thus, adequate and secure isolation is needed. 5) Management
    The management of the Fog can be centralized or decentralized. Since the devices
    in a Fog environment belong to different domains, centralized management is not
    always possible. Alternatively, processing of IoT applications will be done in
    different Fog clusters, so management will follow a distributed nature in this
    case. In summary, the management of the platform in a Fog must be defined. In
    the case of decentralized management, similar processes must be deployed for different
    Fog devices to handle management issues. C. Application Applications have to fulfill
    certain requirements to execute in a Fog environment. Here, we discuss the features
    required by the applications for execution. 1) Application Requirements a: Scalability
    The number of IoT devices are increasing very swiftly day by day all over the
    world, which raises a new issue of scalability. Thus, we need to deal with the
    scaling of devices and services in the Fog computing environment. Dependency on
    cloud computing has been observed for IoT application processing by many research
    works, where trillions of IoT devices are involved, such as that of Li et al.
    [93]. However, implementation of the whole application in the cloud in such an
    environment where IoT devices are generating a huge amount of data is neither
    feasible nor efficient. IoT devices are not only stationary but also mobile in
    most cases. Hence, maintaining frequently changing device states and availability
    in the cloud is not an easy task. Also, with the growing number of IoT devices,
    it would be more critical for IoT applications to query and select IoT devices
    [59]. The Fog computing system must be an autonomous system where application
    execution by the participating device will be done automatically including scalability.
    b: Heterogeneity For any IoT system, the heterogeneous device is a fundamental
    characteristic where device heterogeneity co-exists at any level in the Fog computing
    paradigm. Abstraction of device complexity is also required to some extent. Device
    heterogeneity does not only refer to the diversity of services and protocols,
    but also the assortment of horizontal and vertical levels of the Fog architecture
    [59]. To address this heterogeneity, Giang et al. [59], classified three types
    of Fog devices: compute, input/output (IO), and edge nodes. Edge nodes are the
    sensors and the actuators, IO nodes are the resource-limited devices mostly responsible
    for brokering communications, and computing nodes offer computing facilities.
    Of the three types of nodes, IO and compute nodes are mostly dynamic and customizable
    or programmable as required. It is possible to implement all three nodes in a
    single device based on its capability and design goal. The smart gateway is an
    example of such implementation. In order to use the capability of various types
    of devices in an IoT environment, it is obvious that the application must be designed
    in such a way that it might be able to perform its task execution on multiple
    devices regardless of its capacity and location. More precisely, the application
    should able to use maximum available computation resources through middleware.
    c: Interaction Timeliness The perception-action (PA) cycle is the basic function
    of a nervous system, which maintains circular flow between sensory organisms and
    its actions towards the functionality of that sensing. The PA cycle is also a
    characteristic of IoT applications, where the cloud and Fog infrastructure satisfies
    timeliness requirements and application logic for communication. Giang et al.
    [59] identified four interaction models for the PA cycle in a Fog environment.
    Examples of these models are: (i) in a local network, communication between devices,
    which is considered as an immediate cycle action, (ii) interaction with the cloud
    from a device of a local network, which is generally for time-insensitive actions,
    (iii) an interaction generated by the cloud to a device in a local network, which
    requires semi-immediate actions, and (iv) communication among IoT-related applications
    in the cloud. However, their work considered the role of the Fog server, which
    manages and maintains several Fog devices in a specific cluster. On the other
    hand, PA interaction can be divided into immediate, semi-immediate, and delayed
    action to leverage IoT application requirements more efficiently. Delayed action
    can be performed on the type of processing that does not have any timeliness issues
    and could be processed by the cloud infrastructure. d: Mobility Device mobility
    is a natural probability and is one of the key requirements for implementing an
    IoT platform [59]. From the Fog perspective, it is not only the edge devices that
    will be mobile but also computing and storage devices in the Fog layer. Managing
    mobile devices in two different planes and syncing them with each other is challenging.
    To ensure resource availability and successful task completion, task distribution,
    duplication, and migration is required. This mechanism is already considered in
    the cloud but there is a need to reinvestigate them by considering mobility [94].
    2) User Requirements User requirements can be changed by various constraints.
    First of all, a user may want to complete the submitted task within a specific
    time binding, which is referred to as the deadline. Secondly, the user may set
    some constraints for the budget. Thirdly, in the case of some users, they may
    not care about the budget but the response time is of utmost importance. Fourthly,
    some users may want tolerable accuracy. This means that the user may not seek
    accurate results but rather fast results that could be provided with some reasonable
    errors. Aazam and Huh [54] suggested that pre-allocation and prediction of resources
    rely on user behavior and the probability of future utilization of resources.
    Dastjerdi et al. [4], [95] stated that edge devices perform optimization by considering
    user behavior and network condition. 3) Application Modeling Two types of application
    modeling are possible by considering the requirements of applications in the Fog.
    Most IoT devices generate tuples periodically, which can be considered as a stream.
    These streams need to be processed in real time to get accurate results. Alternatively,
    the application that does the processing based on previously stored sets of data
    could include microservice-based applications. The advantage of microservice is
    that it can bind all functionality and required libraries in a single service,
    which can run above the microservice controller without dependency. Hence, application
    modeling in Fog could be stream-based or microservice-based. SECTION VII. Dimension
    of Fog Computing-Based Applications Several applications require a Fog computing
    infrastructure to provide smooth services. These include smart transportation
    systems, Augmented and Virtual reality, healthcare, video streaming, smart homes,
    and smart cities. Requirements of platform and applications are also needed in
    order to provide services. In this section, we discuss some research works, which
    specifically address the application of Fog computing. We evaluate each work based
    on their contribution on the Fog infrastructure, platform, and applications as
    defined in our taxonomy. It is obvious that all three kinds of services are interrelated.
    However, each researcher only focused on one or more of these aspects. Mapping
    related works with our proposed taxonomy will help in finding the research gaps
    in Fog computing applications. A. Smart Transportation System Several research
    works have been carried out on smart transportation systems that use Fog computing.
    In this section we discuss a few works that have been done on the Fog-based smart
    transportation system and then identify key issues that need to be addressed.
    Truong et al. [96] pproposed a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANETs) architecture
    called Fog Software Defined Networking (FSDN), which combines SDN and Fog together
    to provide a better solution. As SDN has programmability, flexibility, global
    knowledge, and scalability features and Fog has location awareness and time sensitivity,
    the combination of these two will leverage on the key challenges in VANETs. The
    proposed system is able to augment communication among vehicles, infrastructure,
    and base stations via centralized control, besides reducing latency and optimizing
    the utilization of resources. However, the central SDN controller of the proposed
    system is where the bottleneck of the proposed system occurs. The system is focused
    on infrastructure and network requirements. The Fog controller is used for service
    implementation. The work did not focus on platform and application requirements.
    Investigation of VANETs in Fog has also been done in Giang et al. [97], where
    they explored how smart transportation applications (VANETs) are developed using
    the Fog Computing approach. Driving vehicles in an urban area requires immediate
    decision on various activities such as route changing, lane change, slowing down
    speed, looking at obstacles, and so on. Hence, applications need to gather all
    related details to act on these activities. The authors discussed Fog-based smart
    transportation application requirements such as programming abstraction and application
    models. The work explored application modeling but not other application aspects
    nor infrastructure or platform. B. Vehicles as Fog Infrastructure Hou et al. [98]
    proposed the idea of Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC), which will use the vehicle
    as an infrastructure for computation and communication. The VFC architecture utilizes
    vehicle computation resources by providing service to the edge devices located
    near them. It will aggregate abundant resources of each moving car by which service
    quality can be enhanced. Using quantitative analysis on different scenarios, they
    discovered an interesting relationship among connectivity, mobility, communication
    capability, and parking behavior. These four characteristics help us understand
    resource utilization of vehicle resources, which will help achieve better utilization
    of unused resources. C. Augmented and Virtual Reality Augmented Reality applications
    are extremely time sensitive; a small delay can lead to serious errors in user
    experience. Thus, Fog computing-based solutions will have great potential in this
    domain [4]. These statements are also applicable for connected Virtual Reality
    (VR) or VR-based games. Zao et al. [99] proposed an augmented brain computer interaction
    game, which utilized the Fog and cloud infrastructure. The Fog performed real-time
    analysis such as signal processing that needs to classify the brain state and
    other analyses such as model classification updated from the cloud. However, their
    work only focused on the Fog infrastructure but neglected most aspects regarding
    platform and application. D. Healthcare The Fog computing approach also enables
    real-time sensor-based healthcare services. Rahmani et al. [100] proposed a Fog-assisted
    system architecture for the healthcare system. A smart e-health gateway is the
    key component of this architecture, which will process the generated data from
    the sensors and generate an Early Warning Score (EWS) to notify for any medical
    emergency. They considered many aspects of our taxonomy; but it is necessary to
    investigate each aspect extensively, which this study did not. Another Fog-based
    healthcare architecture was proposed by Mahmud et al. [26]. Their work mainly
    focused on network delay, power consumption, and communication optimization in
    Fog-based healthcare service. However, platform, application, and user requirements
    were not investigated. E. Smart City Smart city-related applications need to process
    sensor data on a real-time basis, where Fog computing can play a major role. Giordano
    et al. [101] proposed a Rainbow architecture, which supports various applications
    in a smart city. The proposed Rainbow framework evaluated three smart city applications
    including noise pollution mapping, urban drainage networks, and smart street.
    The work proposed a distributed agent-based approach in the intermediate layer
    in between the physical infrastructure and cloud. However, the work did not focused
    on application and platform aspects except for application modeling. Table 4 shows
    a summary of the above-discussed Fog-based applications mapped to our proposed
    taxonomy. In summary, it can be concluded that most of the works have focused
    on infrastructure and application modeling. There is a research gap on application-
    and platform-related aspects, which need to be explored further. TABLE 4 Evaluation
    of Existing Works on Fog Applications SECTION VIII. State-of-the-Art Fog Computing
    In this section, we focus on some existing research works on Fog computing. We
    discuss research works from four different research areas of Fog computing. These
    areas are resource allocation and scheduling, failure handling, simulation tools,
    and microservices. A. Resource Allocation and Scheduling in Fog Computing Fog
    computing is fast evolving and growing rapidly due to its edge-level computation
    and heterogeneous nature. In this section, we present several research works,
    which have been done in the past couple of years. We also summarize the presented
    research works with a comparative discussion to address research gaps in this
    area. Most of the reviewed works are related to resource allocation and scheduling
    in the cloud and Fog environment. However, some works have only been done in the
    Fog environment. 1) Resource Allocation and Scheduling for Fog-Cloud Environment
    Alsaar et al. [102] proposed resource allocation methods for a collaborative platform
    composed of Fog and cloud paradigms. Their proposed algorithm is grounded on linearized
    decision tree rules by considering three different conditions for managing user
    request and for balancing workload. The conditions are VM capacity, completion
    time, and service size. Each condition has two branches: the VM capacity branches
    out to enough or not enough; the completion time consists of now or later, and
    the service size is divided into small or large. In some cases, this includes
    services in the queue, which will be represented with yes or no. They utilized
    1/m/m/1, with (1)/ representing cloud broker, /(m) for many paths, /(m) for many
    Fog brokers, and /(1) for IoT device users. Using this method, the total overhead
    for big data processing in the system was reduced. In their work, the availability
    of cloud servers and the Fog was guaranteed and a fast response time to satisfy
    QoS was achieved. The SLA for users was also different, where shared and reserved
    resource was provided. However, availability and QoS were not studied extensively.
    Deng et al. [103] presented a framework for workload allocation in the cloud and
    Fog environment to examine power consumption-delay trade-off issues. They defined
    the workload allocation problem into primary and sub-problems, which can be solved
    via related sub-systems. They employed a Hungarian algorithm and Generalized Benders
    Decomposition (GBD) algorithm to solve the problem. Numerical and simulation results
    were presented to prove that the Fog is a complement to the cloud. However, the
    complex nature of workload and resource was not studied in their work. Brogi et
    al. [104] prototyped a tool known as ‘FogTorch ∏ ’ which is capable of fulfilling
    hardware, software, and QoS requirements before deploying a composite application
    in the Fog infrastructure. The proposed tool manipulates Monte Carlo simulations
    and only considers communication link QoS. Resource consumption and QoS assurance
    terms were undertaken for classifying the eligibility of deployments. The proposed
    algorithm was based on the preprocessing phase and backtracking search phase.
    To find eligible deployment, the preprocessing used input from results derived
    by the backtracking search algorithm. However, availability and latency are more
    important in the Fog environment compared to resource consumption and communication
    links. In order to ensure efficient use of resources and network infrastructure
    in the Fog and cloud environment, Taneja and Davy [105] proposed a Module Mapping
    Algorithm, which efficiently deploys IoT Application Modules in the composite
    Fog-Cloud Infrastructure. They employed lower-bound searches and compared function
    algorithms to find an eligible network node in the Fog and cloud. The Module Mapping
    algorithm returned a map with nodes, which are appropriate for completing the
    computation operation. If the application requires faster processing, the application
    will be deployed close to the source device. However, the work considered CPU,
    RAM, and bandwidth to find the best resources. In such a case, the cloud resource
    will always be the best resource, so it will be necessary to consider other parameters
    such as response time and availability of the specified resources. Yin et al.
    [52] studied a Fog-assisted big data streaming scenario, where Fog devices are
    responsible for preprocessing raw data for applications hosted in the cloud using
    the unused resources of Fog devices. In their work, the software-defined network
    (SDN) controller continuously adjusted the volume of data to be sent to the Fog
    device for pre-processing. The collaborative computation problem was defined as
    a social welfare maximization problem and a hybrid alternating direction method
    of multiplier (H-ADMM) algorithm was proposed to minimize computation burden via
    the dynamic distribution of Fog devices, cloud, and SDN using message exchanging.
    The formulation of social welfare maximization problem determined the size of
    data that will be assigned to a Fog device. During the formulation, loss of information
    value by preprocessing and the operation cost of the Fog and cloud were considered.
    The work completely depended on the cloud for post-processing, but pre- and post-processing
    could have been done in the Fog to support time-sensitive real-time applications.
    Aazam et al. [106] proposed a dynamic resource estimation algorithm by integrating
    the historical record of cloud service customer (CSC) in a Fog environment based
    on the relinquish probability. The minimum relinquish probability value is 0.1
    and this value will be increased based on the history of the user. However, for
    fair resource estimation, the relinquish probability will be 0.3 for new customers.
    For existing and returning customers, the characteristics of the customer are
    known, so the probability value can be calculated easily. In this way, resource
    underutilization could be minimized and the chances of profit loss will be low.
    2) Resource Allocation and Scheduling for a Fog Environment A resource allocation
    strategy based on priced timed Petri nets (PTPNs) was proposed by Ni et al. [107]
    for Fog computing. The main idea of this work is that the user can choose the
    satisfying resources autonomously from a pre-allocated resource group. With credibility
    evaluation for both users and Fog infrastructure, their proposed strategy comprehensively
    considers the cost for time and price to complete the tasks. The user that has
    a high credit limit will be able to allocate highly reliable resources to complete
    their tasks. Due to the dynamic nature of creditability of users and resources,
    there will be some deviation in calculating them properly. To maintain QoS, the
    resources will be ordered according to their processing capacity and divided into
    several groups. Moreover, users with similar credibility will be assigned to several
    groups. Pooranian et al. [108] proposed a simple algorithm to find an optimal
    solution for resource allocation. They considered the problem as a bin packing
    penalty aware problem where servers are bins and VMs are the pack. Based on idle
    energy, maximum frequency, and maximum energy, each server will be palatalized
    and rewarded. The method will calculate how many VMs could be allocated in t time
    slot on a server. The VMs will be served based on their frequency and time limitations.
    As a consequence of penalty, a server will be punished in the form of being banned
    from use for a few iterations. Once the server passes the iteration freeze, it
    will return to the stream to perform further computation. The penalty and reward
    methods are applied to minimize exponentially increasing energy consumption. Sun
    and Zhang [63] proposed a crowd-funding algorithm for a Fog environment, integrating
    idle resources in the local network. An incentive mechanism was used to encourage
    resource owners to participate in the computation and enthusiastically perform
    their tasks. Through the comprehensive reward and punishment mechanism, it is
    ensured that the participant will positively perform the tasks. This work is similar
    to the above-described literature proposed by Pooranian et al. [108]. However,
    in this case, the reward and punishment go to the participant rather than the
    physical server. 3) Summary of Resource Allocation and Scheduling in Fog Based
    on the related research on resource allocation and scheduling in the Fog, a summary
    is presented in Table 5. From this table, we can see that most of the researchers
    have focused on resource allocation in the Fog. More research works are therefore
    required to investigate resource sharing and workload allocation. Also, further
    investigation is needed to address energy-efficiency, load balancing, SLA, and
    QoS in the Fog. We identified two major issues in Fog computing research. Firstly,
    researchers tend to use a synthetic workload to validate their methods and algorithms.
    Secondly, most of the researchers used cloud-based simulations, which are not
    that convincing because the Fog is more heterogeneous and dynamic in nature. Thus,
    further investigation into workload generation and simulations in the Fog need
    to be undertaken. TABLE 5 Summary of Resource Allocation and Scheduling Research
    in Fog B. Fault Tolerance in Fog Computing The Fog computing paradigm is a highly
    distributed heterogeneous platform where the probability of device failure is
    very high compared to the cloud. Since the Fog is evolving, no study has yet been
    done on fault tolerance in Fog computing. However, fault tolerance has been mostly
    studied in the cloud computing paradigm. Often, fault tolerance is measured by
    availability. In the cloud, faults are handled by proactive fault tolerance and
    reactive fault tolerance techniques at either the workflow level or task level.
    Reactive fault tolerance techniques are used to reduce the impact of failures
    on a system when the failures have actually occurred. Techniques based on this
    policy are job migration, checkpoint/restart, replication, rollback and recovery,
    task resubmission, user-defined exception handling, and workflow rescue. Proactive
    fault tolerance predicts the faults pro-actively and replaces the suspected components
    with other working components; thus, avoiding recovery from faults and errors.
    Proactive Fault Tolerance uses self-healing, preemptive migration, and software
    rejuvenation, which are the few proactive fault tolerance techniques in the cloud.
    According to Sharma et al. [110], the causes of failure in the cloud varies, and
    include software and hardware failure, service failure, overflow failure, power
    outage, outdated systems, network failure, cyber attacks, and human errors. It
    is crucial to handle faults in Fog computing for which the fault needs to be considered
    at every step, not only for processing but also for the transmit-and-receive process
    [111]. In this section, we discuss some existing research works on fault tolerance
    in cloud computing. We specifically focus on resource and task failure mechanisms.
    Then, we summarize the existing works and present a research direction for failure
    handling in Fog computing. Jiang and Hsu [112] proposed a two-level standby design
    for handling server failure in the cloud system. In their proposed system, cold
    and warm standby of the system is made available. Once any server fails, the warm
    standby system will replace the failed server and the failed server will be sent
    to the repair house. After repairing, the system will be placed in the cold standby
    group. The systems in the cold standby group are in a completely switched off
    mode. The work proposed a model to determine the necessary number of cold and
    warm standby systems in the cloud. However, this type of hardware failure handling
    is not suitable for the Fog because most of the time Fog computing devices will
    not be under the property of the Fog provider. Hence, task migration is the best
    solution for hardware failure and this should be reactive in most cases, except
    where the Fog device belongs to the provider. Latiff et al. [113] proposed a cloud-scheduling
    scheme based on a check-pointed league championship algorithm. They employed a
    task migration method for independent task execution failure. In their proposed
    method, the system state will be saved periodically by check-pointing, so the
    task need not start from the beginning once it fails. When the task fails, it
    will be assigned to an underloaded VM and the league championship algorithm will
    be employed to schedule the failed tasks. Wu et al. [114] proposed a fault tolerance
    technique using migration to the cloud. The failure handling method is proactive,
    which always monitors the host and continuously tries to predict the chances of
    failure. If the prediction becomes true, the system will look up other available
    resources and then migration will be performed. The proposed method will monitor
    CPU temperature, memory usage, and CPU fan speed, etc. To employ such a technique
    in Fog computing, further investigation is needed because the types of device
    in Fog are diverse. A combined method of check-pointing and migration-based proactive
    failure handling was proposed by Egwutuoha et al. [115] for HPC and cloud. In
    the proposed method, the authors used a Lm-sensors open source software tool for
    computer health monitoring. From the monitoring data, they defined rule-based
    monitoring depending on temperature, fan speed, voltage, and processor utilization
    to predict failure. The rules are denoted as 1, 2, and 3, representing normal,
    warning, and critical state, respectively. They employed three different policies
    for migration. The first depends on the necessity lease additional node. The second
    removes the node, which is unhealthy based on the state. In the third, the critical
    state publishes to the head node. Finally, the system administrator is notified
    for further action. This type of approach might increase the overhead in the Fog;
    however, further exploration is essential. A recent study shows that proactive
    fault tolerance is the best solution for the cloud compared to redundant solutions
    [88]. However, failure prediction accuracy is the key factor for these kinds of
    solutions. Their work considered software, hardware, and unstable behavior to
    predict the failure of the infrastructure. More specifically, they defined failure
    based on an error formula err=(ActualTime−PredictedTime)/ActualTime×100% , which
    was derived from [118] and [119]. A combination of the proactive and reactive
    method was applied by Gao et al. [118] to handle task failure in the cloud environment.
    The crash detection method and replication factor were proposed in this work to
    handle failures. Table 6 shows a summary of the investigated literature on fault
    tolerance in the cloud. TABLE 6 Summary of Investigated Fault Tolerance Literature
    in Cloud Because of its unstable nature of failure and heterogeneous characteristics,
    the hybrid failure handling method is more appropriate for the Fog computing environment.
    C. Simulation Tools for Fog Computing Simulation and modeling in Fog computing
    are still in their infancy. However, a few research works have been done on Fog
    computing simulation, which are focused on some specific aspect of Fog computing.
    Aazam and Huh [54] focused on resource prediction and pricing in Fog computing.
    The Proposed Fog-based resource management model is able to estimate the required
    resources based on the probability of user behavior of future resource use. Validation
    and performance evaluation was done using simulation. However, they did not consider
    service heterogeneity, QoS, or device mobility factors. Another work proposed
    by Dastjerdi et al. [4] focused on dag of the query for incident detection in
    a smart city use case. Both of these works used CloudSim [119] to validate their
    method along with an experimental evaluation. The first toolkit for Fog simulation
    was developed by Gupta et al. [120], known as iFogSim. The toolkit is used for
    the simulation and modeling of IoT resource management techniques in the Fog and
    edge computing paradigms. The most challenging problem is the design of resource
    management techniques, which determine analytic application distribution among
    edge devices, which will improve the throughput and reduce latency. The proposed
    simulator is capable of measuring the impact of resource management techniques
    in terms of network congestion, latency, cost, and energy consumption. The simulator
    was validated using two use cases and the authors also proposed a Fog computing
    environment architecture. Challenges in Fog computing deployment are include incorporating
    Fog with Emerging Technologies such as 5G Technologies [121], Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV), and Software-defined Networking (SDN). In this case, a simulator
    with container, SDN, and NFV support is crucial. Table 7 presents the key features
    of these two simulators that are mostly used by various researchers for Fog computing
    simulation. These two simulation tools did not focus on network parameters such
    as bandwidth distribution of the link and round-trip delay of the various media.
    These two parameters heavily affect the simulation results where minimization
    of latency is the key goal in a Fog computing environment. Secondly, both tools
    did not consider container-based virtualization. In a Fog computing environment,
    there are many devices that will participate in computation, where hypervisor-based
    virtualization is nearly impossible to implement due to the lower memory and processing
    power of these devices. TABLE 7 Simulation Tools Used for Fog Simulation and Their
    Key Features D. Fog-Based Micro Services A microservice is an independent process
    and Software-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that interacts by message passing. The
    SOA of microservice does not hinder or favor any specific programming model. It
    provides design and implementation guidelines for distributed applications to
    partition each component independently. Each of the components addresses a specific
    functionality. The functionality of the components can be accessed by message
    passing and is possible to implement in any mainstream programming language internally.
    In this way, this principle helps developers and project managers to develop each
    module independently and test it with a few related functions. Some microservices,
    also known as high-level microservices, are mainly responsible for coordination
    with other microservices [124]. The organizational approach of microservices accelerates
    the development cycle, nourishes ownership, encourages innovation, improves scalability,
    and enhances the maintainability of software applications. Using this approach,
    software becomes a small independent service and interacts over unambiguous APIs.
    These services are preserved via self-contained small teams [125]. The agility
    and independent distributed nature of microservice deployment makes it a good
    solution for Fog-based IoT application development. Independent processes and
    interaction via message passing features has made microservices more convenient
    for IoT applications. In the Fog, there is a limitation of resources, so developing
    microservices in the Fog will minimize the growing complexity of the big system
    by dividing it into a set of small independent services. Microservice is taking
    modularity to a subsequent level by incorporating high cohesion and loose coupling
    of distributed systems. 1) Current Research Aspects of Microservice Recently,
    microservice-based applications have started gaining popularity [124]. Fog-based
    microservices have not been investigated extensively; hence, it is an open research
    area. However, some research works have been done in this emerging research area,
    with most of the efforts being related to IoT. Butzin et al. [126] investigated
    the use of microservices in IoT and claimed that the architectural goal of IoT
    and microservices are similar. However, they actually have different features
    in terms of various aspects. First of all, microservice has a self-containment
    feature where all dependencies and libraries are packed with the application in
    a single image. On the other hand, for IoT, all libraries are not generally wrapped
    with the application. However, both use similar types of virtualization and web
    protocols. Microservice also has a continuous integration and delivery feature
    while in IoT these are not available or only partly exist. Vresk and Čavrak [127]
    proposed a microservice-based middleware for IoT to support device heterogeneity,
    various communication protocols, and services. They presented a data model and
    address model for microservice-based IoT. Brito et al. [128] proposed a service
    orchestration architecture for Fog using microservices. The authors defined the
    resource manager as a microservice. Khazaei et al. [129] proposed a generic programmable
    self-managing microservice-based platform for IoT. In the platform, microservices
    will exist in all layers in a cascading manner and an autonomic management system
    will scale the microservice. A similar type of IoT framework was proposed by Sun
    et al. [130]. In their architecture of nine components, all are microservices
    except for the core service. The work proved that microservices are far better
    than the monolithic approach in terms of scalability, flexibility, and platform
    independence. However, still, microservice-based IoT architecture suffers from
    various issues such as faults in the network, network delay, message serialization,
    cooperative transaction processing, and other distributed computing scenarios.
    Li et al. [131] proposed a cooperative-based model specifically for smart sensing
    devices; it is possible to enhance the performance of such a service by undertaking
    a micro-service based concept. Krivic et al. [132] proposed a management solution
    for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) device communication in an IoT system using collaborative
    microservice. They argued that microservices could act as the agent in an agent-based
    system since each microservice is responsible for performing a specific task and
    acts collaboratively to achieve the system goal. Container-based virtualization
    is the best solution for deploying microservices since the container supports
    OS virtualization and packs all dependencies in a single image. A container is
    able to manage physical hardware resource needed by an application with its OS
    kernel utilities [133]. 2) Microservices and IoT Applications Many research works
    have suggested Fog-based processing for IoT applications in smart transportation
    systems [96]–[98], Augmented and Virtual Reality [99], [134], [135], and healthcare
    [26], [136], [137]. Fog computing is also suitable for video streaming, smart
    homes, smart cities, and CDN. The common characteristics of these applications
    are time-sensitiveness, which make Fog computing a promising emerging computing
    paradigm. The main drawback of the Fog, however, is resource limitation and failure.
    Thus, using microservices for Fog-based IoT applications will minimize these drawbacks.
    Microservices are standalone, lightweight, and easily deliverable. To mitigate
    resource limitation, the microservice-based container is the best solution so
    far. In the same way, it will also minimize the cost of failure by deploying the
    application immediately. Many open research issues can be addressed by implementing
    Fog-based micro services; these include service management, scheduling, monitoring,
    fault tolerance, security, and privacy. E. Fog Based Mobile Computing The number
    of smartphone and mobile device users in urban areas as well as in rural areas
    is increasing day by day. As a result, mobile users are now requesting high-volume
    content collaboratively. Providing service for all requested contents in an area
    where mobile users are densely populated is a really challenging task for service
    providers [138]. The high number of concurrent content requests will only make
    the situation worse. One of the best solutions to cope with this problem is to
    offload content near the users, so that the users could get better service. This
    content offloading process can be supported by mobile Fog computing. In mobile
    Fog computing, content will be offloaded to the Fog device, which is located closer
    to the users. However, content management in Fog nodes is a current research issue.
    Depending on the demand of the contents, offloading should be distributed on the
    Fog nodes. Constant monitoring and efficient cache management is crucial to deal
    with resource-limited Fog nodes. A few research works have been done on mobile
    Fog computing. This section chronologically discusses the research works that
    have been done in this particular research area in the past couple of years. Hong
    et al. [94] proposed a high-level programming model that supports large-scale
    geospatially distributed time-sensitive applications. The proposed Mobile Fog
    programming model has two design goals. The initial goal is to provide a simplified
    application development for an enormous number of heterogenous devices, which
    are distributed in a wide area. The next goal is the dynamic scaling of resources
    based on resource demand. They developed an API for their programming model and
    evaluated it using two application models: vehicle tracking using a camera and
    traffic monitoring using a Mobility-driven distributed Complex Event Processing
    (MCEP) system. However, they did not focus on process placement or process migration.
    Shi et al. [139] proposed a P2P inspired communication model between the mobile
    device cloud and mobile nodes to share resources and computation task among mobile
    devices. In their work, they utilized a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    for implementing microservices. This work introduced the M2M approach in Fog computing
    while the classical Fog is actually hierarchy based. Content offloading in the
    mobile Fog was investigated by Khan et al. [138]. They defined mobile Fog as co-located
    self-organizing mobile nodes, which offer distributed resources at the edge. The
    aim of this work was to collaborate nodes for content caching, which will maximize
    the availability of the content and minimize operational cost. The proposed coalition
    game helps find the best co-located candidates near the users for sharing storage
    and self-organizing. Wang et al. [140] proposed a three-layer hierarchy framework
    using a Fog structure to bridge the communication between WSNs and the cloud.
    They designed a routing algorithm for bridging communication by considering the
    number of hops and energy consumption. They defined the Fog node as a sink, which
    will transfer data from sensor to the cloud. The proposed framework consists of
    routing layer, Fog layer, and sink layer. In the Fog layer, a sink acts as the
    Fog nodes as well to minimize transmission delay. However, there is a lack of
    security and privacy concern being addressed in mobile Fog computing. Roman et
    al. [141] addressed security and privacy for all edge-level computing. This included
    a usual thread in a network system mobile Fog that requires extra measures of
    authentication, trust, access control, protocol, and network security. SECTION
    IX. Open Issues and Future Research Directions A. Infrastructure-Related Issues
    The Fog is an evolving technology, expanding in such a way that it needs to reach
    market adoption to support all kinds of time-sensitive applications. The Fog has
    become an enactment of research efforts by various academies and industries. One
    of the key initiatives is the Open Fog Consortium (OpenFog), which was founded
    by the ARM, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Princeton University in November
    2015 [31]. Foxconn, General Electric, Hitachi, Sakura Internet, ShanghaiTech University,
    and ZTE are the contributing members of this nonprofit consortium. They are accelerating
    digital innovation with the blending of 5G wireless technology, IoT, and embedded
    AI by providing open interoperable architecture. However, many open challenges
    exist for this sprout-level computing paradigm. In this section, we discuss the
    research challenges and address the future directions for Fog computing research.
    Figure 10 shows some important research issues in Fog computing. FIGURE 10. Fog
    computing research issues. Show All 1) Deployment Issues From the deployment viewpoint,
    OpenFog is defined as an N-tier environment. However, the excessive increase in
    number of levels in the Fog layer might cause latency problems in the newly emerging
    Fog computing paradigm. Therefore, the number of tiers based on the use case must
    be determined. Deployment decisions will be undertaken based on requirements such
    as type and amount of task that will be done by each tier, total number of sensors,
    Fog device capability, in between the latency and reliability of Fog devices.
    Still, it is necessary to investigate how these requirements will be fulfilled.
    Application and resource scaling is also an important issue during deployment.
    Based on the requirement of the application and resource, scaling and shrinking
    without interrupting current services could be undertaken. In this regard, placement
    might also affect Fog deployment. 2) Standard Architecture for Fog Computing Up
    until now, there has been no defined standard architecture for Fog computing.
    The OpenFog consortium released two versions of the Fog architecture in February
    2016 [61] and February 2017 [142]. Their first draft was an initial overview of
    the Fog architecture. In their second draft, the Fog architecture was discussed
    in more detail. In their proposed architecture, they considered many key aspects
    of Fog architecture including performance, manageability, security, data analytics,
    and control. However, further research needs to be undertaken to explore and gain
    deeper insight into each layer with proper validation. 3) Interoperability and
    Federation of Fog Because of the Fog, users are able to process their request
    near them, which will minimize latency. However, what will happen if an increasing
    number of multiple latency-aware applications requests are sent in one shot to
    the Fog device and the Fog device is unable to handle that many requests? Will
    it be passed to the cloud for processing? If it is passed to the cloud, then latency
    requirements will not be satisfied. Thus, interoperability and federation among
    Fog clusters and Fog servers are necessary. Hence, if a Fog device is fully utilized,
    it will send requests to peer Fog devices or Fog servers for processing instead
    of sending them to the cloud. B. Platform-Related Issues 1) Resource Management
    Resources are most dynamic and heterogeneous in a Fog environment because of the
    diversity of devices and their available resources. All devices known as Fog devices
    are responsible for performing the computation of their own application. For example,
    a computer that relies on office staff to perform some ordinary email and documentation
    works might be a part of the Fog and might also act as a Fog device. In such a
    case, the amount of resources available for Fog computation is dynamic but predictable
    via the analysis of the long-term activity of its resources. This prediction is
    necessary because once the Fog task execution starts, and over a period of time,
    the status of the resources might change due to the request by the application
    for which the device is responsible for. If we compared this to the cloud, it
    is possible to know how much resources are currently available and whether or
    not they are exclusively used for cloud-based application requests. However, the
    Fog aims to use idle resources available on any Fog device with Fog computation
    always taking second priority. Hence, resource allocation and scheduling in the
    Fog is more challenging than traditional resource allocation and scheduling in
    the cloud. 2) Failure Management Fog device failure probability is always high
    because the devices are distributed and the management of Fog devices is not central.
    Hence, the devices could fail for many reasons; this could be due to hardware
    failure, software failure, or because of user activity. Besides these problems,
    some other reasons include connectivity, mobility, and power source, which also
    play a big role. Most of the devices in a Fog environment might be connected via
    wireless connections; it is obvious that wireless connections are not always reliable.
    The majority of devices that are connected via wireless are mobile, so these devices
    could change location to different clusters frequently. One other characteristic
    of these devices is that they are battery powered and might fail anytime. Hence,
    dealing with the complex nature of failure is very difficult. Also, it is necessary
    to ensure SLA by defining QoS parameters. So, the question is: What are the SLAs
    and how should they be defined? Also: What QoS parameters must be considered,
    so that the consumer and providers can retain a win-win situation? 3) Communication
    Between Different Layers The Fog should ensure uninterrupted connection with the
    devices to ensure application requirements of time-sensitive applications are
    met. If the application were to control an autonomous car or drone and if it were
    responsible for emergency surveillance, then failure in connectivity might cause
    serious harm. Even if connectivity to the cloud fails, the Fog still needs to
    ensure continuous connectivity. Thus, cross-layer connectivity among IoT devices,
    Fog, and cloud are of the utmost importance. The connection type and protocols
    used by IoT devices and Fog devices might be different. Therefore, how these issues
    will be handled is an important research issue. 4) User Participation Management
    Efficient Fog service management depends on the participation of users in Fog
    computation. However, how can user participation be managed? How do we deploy
    minimum resources in the case where no one wants to participate? We need to address
    these problems clearly with a feasible solution. One of the methods to increase
    user participation is through incentive and reward-based policies. With such policies,
    any user that participates in Fog computation will benefit. Even a user, who participates
    to complete his own request, will be rewarded by getting some discount based on
    his participation. However, this area needs to be addressed because the overall
    success of Fog computation depends on the participation of Fog devices, which
    are owned by various people and organizations. 5) Security and Privacy Fog devices
    are managed by different operators based on their location and ownership. Nobody
    would want to contribute to Fog computation if device control were compromised.
    Thus, how the security of a participant device will be maintained if the device
    were to take part in Fog computation is a big question. Another key security issue
    for this scenario is participant user data security. A participant device might
    have critical information. How will safety be guaranteed in such a case? On the
    other hand, critical data might be processed in a device, which is owned by a
    black hat hacker. How will safety and privacy be ensured then? Security issues
    also exist during cross-layer communication. Similar to the distributed nature
    of the Fog, security management should also be distributed, which will not be
    dependent on any central component. C. Application-Related Issues 1) Application
    Service Management Billions of IoT devices will be handled by the Fog paradigm,
    which will handle time-sensitive and time-insensitive applications. The degree
    of service, availability, and quality is most diverse in the Fog. Hence, service
    management is a typical issue for the entire Fog realm. Services should be microservice-based,
    so that agility and management issues can be handled properly. Further research
    is necessary to explore the possibility of Fog-based solutions. 2) Application
    Modeling Modeling Fog applications is complex because the application should collect
    data from different IoT devices, which use different protocols and sets of codes.
    Thus, it is challenging to model generic applications, which can be deployed with
    minimal effort. To solve this issue, a standard form of communication protocol
    is necessary, so that the modeled application can communicate and work with different
    types of IoT devices. SECTION X. Conclusion The Fog computing paradigm is currently
    in its infancy, so an extensive investigation is required for this emerging technology.
    In this survey, we presented and discussed the overview, architecture, state-of-the-art
    and other similar technologies in Fog computing. Based on the literature, we derived
    a taxonomy for Fog computing by analyzing the requirement of Fog infrastructure,
    platform, and applications. We also covered resource allocation and scheduling,
    fault tolerance, simulation tools, and microservices in Fog computing. Finally,
    we presented some challenging and open research issues. We strongly believe that
    this comprehensive survey will bring to light IoT application execution for a
    Fog computing environment as well as point towards the direction for current and
    future research in this rapidly growing research area. In this way, this computing
    paradigm, which is still immature, will be propelled towards achieving market
    adoption in the near future. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors would like to sincerely

    Precision Agriculture (PA), as the integration of information, communication and
    control technologies in agriculture, is growing day by day. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity.
    Nevertheless, their usage in this field is usually limited to specific scenarios
    of high cost, and they are not adapted to semi-arid conditions, or do not cover
    all PA management in an efficient way. For this reason, we propose a flexible
    platform able to cope with soilless culture needs in full recirculation greenhouses
    using moderately saline water. It is based on exchangeable low-cost hardware and
    supported by a three-tier open source software platform at local, edge and cloud
    planes. At the local plane, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) interact with crop devices
    to gather data and perform real-time atomic control actions. The edge plane of
    the platform is in charge of monitoring and managing main PA tasks near the access
    network to increase system reliability against network access failures. Finally,
    the cloud platform collects current and past records and hosts data analytics
    modules in a FIWARE deployment. IoT protocols like Message Queue Telemetry Transport
    (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are used to communicate with
    CPS, while Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI) is employed for southbound
    and northbound access to the cloud. The system has been completely instantiated

    WSN Wireless Sensor Networks 1. Introduction New trends in agriculture seek to
    manage crops in controlled environments such as greenhouses, which enable the
    recreation of the quasi–optimal parameters that plants need to improve the production
    or duplicate the environmental conditions of specific geographical areas to locally
    obtain products that are usually imported. Moreover, severe weather variations
    that impact on crop production can be avoided with a tight management of temperature,
    humidity and lighting. Modern agriculture aims at increasing crop yield in terms
    of production and quality. One of the advances in modern agriculture is the spread
    of soilless culture Resh (2012), also known as hydroponics, which further increases
    productivity. However, in comparison to open field vegetable crops, the fertiliser
    requirements are eight to ten times higher. For this reason, these agricultural
    systems also require an intense use of water and fertilisers that have to be managed
    in a efficient way. In open hydroponic systems where drainage is released into
    the environment, up to 31% of nitrates and a 48% of potassium applied are discharged,
    implying pollution and eutrophication of land and water. European Union policies
    try to reduce the environmental costs of intense agriculture through different
    instruments and directives (Common Agricultural Policy - CAP, Nitrates Directive
    - 91/676/EEC, Water framework Directive - 2000/60/IEC). As an alternative to open
    hydroponic systems, full re-circulation systems (also known as closed systems)
    were initially developed in The Netherlands, but the percentage of producers that
    use them in their greenhouses in the rest of Europe is very low, mainly because
    these systems need to be designed and adjusted to the specific conditions where
    production is taking place. The adoption of re-circulation using moderately saline
    water, as is the case of Mediterranean areas, requires detailed information of
    crop response to salinity, in order to optimise management of drainage recirculation.
    However, one of the main problems of closed recirculating systems is the build-up
    of salts in the nutrient solution. It is well known that salinity severely limits
    the productivity of crops and, as a difference from Northern European countries,
    the electrical conductivity of the water used for irrigation in Mediterranean
    areas is usually high. In order to avoid discharge of drainage and maintain the
    electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution at optimal levels for plant growth
    in these areas, it is necessary to add low conductivity water, which can be obtained
    from a purification unit based on a reverse osmosis system. However, these sophisticated
    systems requires high degrees of automation. In recent years high monitoring and
    control capacities are obtained in agronomic systems thanks to the use of new
    information and communication technologies. These combine with industrial automation
    to enable Precision Agriculture (PA) (Gebbers & Adamchuk, 2010). Current sensors
    offer highly accurate values of the status of crops, and actuators are able to
    manage irrigation, change climate factors or enrich the soil with the needed nutrients
    (Mulla, 2013). When appropriate, computer intelligence techniques are also put
    into play to further improve production in PA by reducing diseases and the need
    for human intervention in regular activities. This is a must in extreme PA cases
    such as the previously discussed hydroponics one, where natural resources of common
    agriculture are left aside and even more precise control actions must be carried
    out. Hence, automation is, without doubt, the future of agriculture, but new frameworks
    improving the modularity of hardware and software units, and assuring the precise
    management of crops in an efficient way are needed. Recently the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has implied the integration of communication capabilities to sensors and
    actuators (Atzori, Iera, & Morabito, 2010), which is highly relevant in the PA
    domain (Ray, 2017). Now it is possible to obtain hardware solutions powered with
    firmware that interconnects these final devices with gateways through wireless
    channels and using open and/or regulated protocols that avoid proprietary solutions.
    Wireless sensor networks (WSN) further evolve this with communication topologies
    that reduce infrastructure costs and reduce power consumption, hence reducing
    costs in PA exploitation (Riquelme et al., 2009). These novel sensors and actuators
    also need evolved automation nodes potentially acting as IoT gateways. Hence,
    traditional control units installed at the crop side are now considered Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), involving hardware nodes with computing, storing and communications
    capabilities to control and interact with industrial processes (An et al., 2016).
    CPS is now the scientific-agreed term used for networked (distributed) embedded
    systems to gather data from sensors, communicate with actuators and cooperate
    among them to cover automation needs. At the same level of importance as IoT or
    CPS, cloud computing (Voorsluys, Broberg, & Buyya, 2011) has been the last hit
    in PA (Choudhary, Jadoun, & Mandoriya, 2016). Here an extra level of flexibility
    is offered by a remote software platform providing monitoring and control management.
    These software platforms can be easily extended on demand and avoid the installation
    of complex systems at the local level. In cloud computing, crop data are gathered
    through a communication channel offered by local controllers (e.g., CPS nodes)
    that, additionally, can also allow certain control actions. All data are saved
    by a software entity usually virtualised in a data centre that offers Platform
    as a Service (PaaS) resources. The access to crop monitoring and control features
    is finally offered by web services accessible from a number of platforms, including
    desktop computers and smart phones. Lately, a trendy paradigm not exploited in
    agriculture is fog and edge computing. Traditionally, these paradigms are focused
    on improving system reaction by reducing network delay, since computing nodes
    are close to end devices. However, in the PA area, network performance requirements
    are more relaxed, though a critical issue is the reliability of the channel connecting
    the crops with the control modules. The solution proposed here is to move part
    of the data analytics and control features from the cloud to nodes close to end-devices
    in the network path. This implies a reliable management of CPS actions requiring
    high accuracy and, additionally, intermediate data filtering capabilities. In
    this frame, the solution presented in this paper covers the needs for fully automated
    PA scenarios including the mentioned special case of Mediterranean areas, through
    a three-tier open source software platform that distributes computing at CPS,
    edge and cloud planes, according to the needs of each action. IoT communication
    technologies are used to connect sensors and actuators with CPS nodes. Here, atomic
    control actions are executed at CPS level, while greenhouse main control actions
    are orchestrated by an edge layer composed of four control modules for irrigation,
    climate, nutrition and auxiliary tasks. They are powered by Network Function Virtualisation
    (NFV), so they can be instantiated at different nodes along the network path,
    from the crop to the cloud. IoT communication protocols such as Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are used
    to communicate CPS nodes with these subsystems. Finally, the cloud layer is given
    by a FIWARE middleware that stores, processes and enables management web services
    for remote monitoring and control. The cloud module of the platform communicates
    with the rest of system nodes using the Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI),
    in the form of a southbound NGSI to link with edge subsystems, and a northbound
    NGSI to allow access to final applications. According to the state of the art
    presented later, the next novelties are presented in this work: • Highly-flexible
    three-tier architecture for PA that fosters software and hardware modularity across
    the different abstraction levels of the solution. • An NFV-based solution is proposed
    in an edge layer to perform local operation decisions in a PA-based environment,
    which can be deployed opportunistically at different levels of the network. •
    Efficient and reliable PA operations are assured through distributing responsibilities
    between edge and CPS planes, avoiding problems originated from network failures
    when using a remote cloud control. • Full instantiation of the proposal with a
    real field deployment validating the operation of the system in the challenging
    area of hydroponics. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents
    the works in the literature that aim at solving the PA problem using new information
    and communication technologies. The overall proposed platform is described in
    Section 3, while Section 4 gives details about the FIWARE-based cloud and edge
    solution. Then, a real prototype of the system is described in Section 5. Section
    6 focuses on the real operation of the platform, describing main procedures and
    including validation results extracted from the prototype. Finally, conclusions
    and future works are presented in Section 7. 2. State of the art The first steps
    in PA were focused on the automatic control of actuators on the basis of sensor
    data gathered from crops. Usually, in these systems sensors and actuators were
    wired with an automation node. The control area has evolved gradually, as can
    be seen in the rule-based scheme presented by Canadas, Sanchez-Molina, Rodriguez,
    and del Aguila (2017), or the event-driven solution described by Pawlowski, Sanchez-Molina,
    Guzman, Rodriguez, and Dormido (2017). However, the real advance in the last years
    in PA has been in the line of integrating new information and communication technologies
    to support farmers in management and decision making. The first solutions using
    communication networks in controlled agriculture were based on common Internet
    technologies used in common PC applications. Marhaenanto, Soni, and Salokhe (2013),
    for instance, presented a crop management system that uses remote desktop and
    regular client/server applications. Another set of proposals in this line are
    based on using Web connections to directly access crop sensors and control actuation
    nodes, such as by Bajer and Krejcar (2015). Here, a set of Arduino nodes that
    are wired with sensors and actuators are managed through the Internet, accessing
    a Web application available in the firmware. IoT integration in PA has implied
    an evolution in the way actuators and sensors communicate with gateway nodes and
    even the Internet. Regarding communication technologies, new IoT-capable nodes
    integrate new transceivers able to save energy and create network topologies adapted
    to field conditions, where cellular or WiFi-like base stations are rare. As the
    proposal of Akka and Sokullu (2017) shows, multi-hop topologies using wireless
    sensor networks can allow the routing of data messages through the communication
    nodes to reach a gateway with Internet connectivity. Here, the ZigBee technology
    is used, as by Lamprinos and Charalambides (2015), where gathered data is finally
    accessible through a Web server available in the gateway. More recent advances
    in the IoT area include network protocols to connect with remote devices through
    Internet by using application-level messaging optimised for reducing data rates.
    S. Muthupavithran, Akash, and Ranjithkumar (2016) used the MQTT protocol to collect
    data from sensor nodes at greenhouses for monitoring purposes, for instance. These
    protocols allow the collection and analysis of data at intermediate cloud middleware,
    as discussed by Shukla, Panchal, and Patel (2015). Kaloxylos et al. (2014) presented
    a more developed system in this line. Here, data from a real deployment of sensors
    is gathered by a gateway using ZigBee, and then sent to a data cloud powered by
    FIWARE through Web-based protocols. The work exploits the idea of open interfaces
    to create multiple client applications accessing the cloud module. However, IoT
    protocols are not used and a quite preliminary version of FIWARE is employed.
    Martinez, Pastor, Alvarez, and Iborra (2016) presented research on the cloud plane
    to manage crops in PA environments. Here the FIWARE core, together with a set
    of additional enablers, are used to connect with IoT gateways through several
    protocols, such as MQTT or CoAP, and current and historical data are maintained
    in the cloud for analytics purposes. The FIWARE performance is evaluated for PA
    in terms of a set of synthetic tests, but a real development of the proposal is
    not given. The same research group have presented (Lopez-Riquelme, Pavon-Pulido,
    Navarro-Hellin, Soto-Valles, and Torres-Sanchez (2017)) a real system, but it
    is limited by the technologies and functionalities offered. Data is collected
    from the crops through a Web-based protocol over GPRS and only monitoring features
    are included in the system. An evolution of exclusively cloud-based platforms
    is the inclusion of intermediary processing stages in the data path. Liu (2016)
    performed local preprocessing at data collection gateways, before sending monitoring
    information to the cloud. This idea is further exploited by Ferrandez-Pastor,
    Garca-Chamizo, Nieto-Hidalgo, Mora-Pascual, and Mora-Martnez (2016), where a set
    of IoT protocols and technologies are also evaluated in a real hydroponic deployment.
    However, in these works a lack of flexibility is noticeable in the way edge computing
    is implemented, and this layer is exclusively oriented to data fusion. In general,
    these works in the literature partially cover IoT interconnection, data collection
    and access through clouds, and only some initial edge computing approaches are
    found. Realistic systems offering (1) flexibility in the hardware used at crop
    site, (2) edge computing nodes at which to filter data powered by NFV, and (3)
    efficient and reliable execution of both sensing and control tasks, are not common
    in current works. In this line the current paper presents an integral crop management
    system supporting up-to-date IoT technologies and protocols and supported by FIWARE,
    which divides essential PA tasks in control modules instantiated in virtualised
    nodes that orchestrate atomic tasks to be executed at local CPS. 3. System architecture
    The overall control architecture of the solution presented to cover PA management
    needs is depicted in Fig. 1. It is essentially distributed into three main planes:
    crop (local) CPS tier, edge computing tier, and data analytics and smart management
    at the cloud. The CPS and cloud planes are designed to be respectively deployed
    at the local crop premises and remote data servers, respectively. The intermediate
    layer for edge computing comprises a set of virtualised control modules in the
    form of NFV nodes that can be instantiated along the network path, from the field
    facilities to the cloud plane on the Internet. This increases versatility in the
    deployment of the solution, at the same time connectivity performances with the
    CPS layer are met. Download : Download high-res image (426KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Overall architecture of the PA platform. The cloud, edge
    and CPS planes are separated by dotted lines. The edge computing modules are instantiated
    as NFV elements, allowing their placement at the most convenient network level.
    At the crop premises, sensors and actuators for PA automation are deployed and
    connected with CPS nodes. Examples of sensors are solar radiation, humidity, temperature,
    CO2, pH meter, electrical conductivity, liquid consumption (flow meters) or pressure
    sensors, while some of the actuators considered are soil and water nutrition pumps,
    valves and activation of devices (watering and ventilation devices, lighting,
    or automated windows). These are connected with CPS units through wired channels
    using industrial serial (usually RS485) or direct digital/analogue I/O connections.
    For wireless communications, 6LowPAN is used to connect with data-loggers, which
    include several sensors. All the CPS units are interconnected with the Internet
    through an access network using multiple technologies, such as microwave radio
    links, fibre optic or DSL. In this architecture, low level operations that require
    minimum latency and high reliability in the communication with sensors or actuators
    are executed at CPS nodes. These are considered as atomic actions, such as closing
    a window, execute an irrigation mandate for a period of time or ventilating until
    a CO2 level is reached. Additionally, there are emergency reactive actions locally
    implemented in the CPS nodes that require real-time operation and can be launched
    without the human or edge plane supervision. An example of these are the opening
    of windows and turning on ventilation if the greenhouse inner temperature reaches
    a predefined threshold. The second processing and managing level of the layered
    architecture is the edge computing plane, which includes a set of NFV-powered
    control modules in charge of orchestrating the CPS layer. The subsystems of the
    edge layer make up the main operative control of the greenhouse and they are in
    charge of irrigation, climate, nutrition and auxiliary tasks, including alarms
    and energy management. At this layer, data fusion and aggregation is carried out
    to offload analytics functions usually performed in the cloud, given that the
    cloud part of the platform could serve a multitude of crops and users. The edge
    control modules are virtualised through NFV techniques that allow their instantiation
    at different levels in the network path, and they communicate with CPS nodes using
    IoT communication protocols such as MQTT or CoAP. MQTT is especially considered,
    given that it is more addressed to the management of industrial processes, however,
    CoAP is also supported for particular non-critical monitoring tasks not involving
    control. As depicted in Fig. 1, the data cloud serves as the interface between
    users and the core platform. Here is where the current status of the crop and
    configuration parameters are maintained. The NGSI interface is used to send data
    updates and receive notifications upon data changes. A change in configuration
    parameters triggers control actions that are managed by edge subsystems. Moreover,
    as can be seen in the diagram, special analytics coupled with concrete service
    needs are performed using the cloud as data source. For the communication between
    final applications and the analytics module, a REST interface transporting JSON
    data is used. 4. FIWARE-based cloud and edge solution Here we present the details
    of the cloud and edge planes of the instantiated architecture. We have used the
    FIWARE platform to provide the main software modules. In our particular case,
    the ORION Context Broker1 is chosen to provide access to the greenhouse status
    information stored in it, providing different methods to register/update, request
    and subscribe for certain data records; Comet2 is included to provide persistence
    to the data; and the IoT Device Management Generic Enabler (IDAS) is chosen to
    connect with IoT devices. This section discussed how FIWARE is used at edge and
    cloud layers of the architecture illustrated in Fig. 1. 4.1. Edge computing plane
    The edge computing plane can be deployed according to the features and requirements
    of the target PA scenario. This way, it is possible to move the edge computing
    plane next to the cloud or, by contrast, to instantiate this logic next to the
    local deployment. This can be done thanks to virtualisation. Control modules in
    the edge plane are developed as NFV nodes, which allows us to easily move the
    components according to the aforementioned requirements. For this reason, each
    control module provided by our solution is instantiated in a specific virtualised
    image that is launched opportunistically depending on the scenario requirement.
    Images are hosted by a Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) that allows remote
    management through a proper API. As depicted in Fig. 2, each control module comprises
    a Context Broker, two IoT Agents of the IDAS GE for CoAP and MQTT communications,
    and the Comet GE provides persistence to the data. Hence, each IoT Agent acts
    as intermediary between the information provided by the CPS layer and the Context
    Broker. Additionally, a specific software entity (Smart Module in the figure)
    is responsible for managing the tasks related to the specific control module.
    Download : Download high-res image (420KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Edge computing plane. Each NFV-based control module is instantiated as
    a compact FIWARE domain that interconnects the cloud and CPS planes, and performs
    smart control actions offloading the cloud and providing extra reliability. For
    the case of the MQTT support, the MQTT IoT Agent acts as broker to provide the
    meeting point of the publish/subscribe scheme to allow communications with CPSs.
    We have defined the next MQTT topics (the notation is simplified for the sake
    of clarity, but details can be found in the IoT Agent Step by Step guide3): •
    , , … : a specific topic is created for each of the CPSs instantiated in our platform,
    where the corresponding CPS is configured as publisher and the control modules
    at the edge plane are set as subscribers. • , , and : one topic is created for
    each control module virtualised in our architecture. This way, they can manage
    the CPSs involved in their activities by sending concrete instructions. Hence,
    each control module is configured as publisher for its corresponding topic, and
    the CPSs are configured as subscriber for each of them. By using a Context Broker
    per control module, we can perform edge computing tasks without accessing the
    cloud plane. In the concrete case illustrated in Fig. 2, for instance, the software
    unit in charge of irrigation intelligence is subscribed to the information of
    interest in the local Context Broker, being notified this way with changes received
    from the related CPS, including soil moisture and temperature, among others. In
    the same way, each of the decisions made by the smart module provokes changes
    in data records within the Context Broker, which in turn generates the publication
    of MQTT requests through the IoT Agent that finally reaches the related CPS. 4.2.
    Cloud plane Computer intensive tasks or those requiring a global view are undertaken
    at the elements deployed into the Cloud plane, which have been also virtualised
    in high-end servers. Figure 3 describe all the functionality provided by the cloud
    plane. Again, an instance of the Context Broker is used to maintain data records
    and handle NGSI interfaces. As a difference from the Context Broker instances
    included at the edge plane, the one included here maintains high-level data records
    about the status of the crop, including also filtered or preprocessed values coming
    from the edge level. An NGSI subscription is maintained by a Comet instance to
    save historical data, and another one is used to feed Big Data routines. Final
    management services interact with these two components in order to obtain all
    needed information to perform final decisions that are supervised by human operators.

    Fig. 3. Cloud computing plane. A virtual representation of the greenhouse state
    is maintained in a high-end FIWARE deployment, which is complemented with Big
    Data analytics to better support the human intervention. Data analytics are enabled
    by a distributed file-system that saves information among several machines. We
    have employed the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for this purpose. Another
    FIWARE enabler called Cygnus is in charge of taking data records from the Context
    Broker and saving them in Hadoop. Finally, our data analytics component will compute
    all the reasoning processes to assist decisions to be carried out by management
    services. 5. Prototype The target greenhouse of the system is the Experimental
    Greenhouse of CEBAS-CSIC illustrated in Fig. 4, a governmental research facility
    in Murcia, south-east of Spain, with geographical coordinates 38.1079837° N, −1.0355991°
    E and 120 m of elevation. It has a surface of 462.5 m2 (25 m × 18.5 m) and is
    between 5 and 7.5 m in height. Beside the greenhouse, we have built a room of
    60 m2 for the machinery and control systems. Download : Download high-res image

    greenhouse. The growing rows and the raffia thread to maintain the tomato plants
    are visible in the main view, while the humidifier module and climate sensors
    are shown in the small photo. Plants of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are selected
    for the pilot system, one of the most economically important and extended crops
    in south Europe. Tomato is produced in 38% of the European greenhouse surface,
    so this prototype is potentially extensible to many other greenhouses. However,
    thanks to the flexibility of the solution proposed, it can be easily deployed
    for other crop species. Additionally, the software in charge of formulating the
    nutrient solutions, can be easily adapted to the nutritional needs of other crops.
    The tomatoes were transplanted in a soilless system in a first cycle on 17th October
    2016 and were harvested on 26th may 2017 (7 months). Plants were grown in 19 rows,
    54 plants per row, and they were guided with raffia thread to conduce the plant
    growth. A second cycle was carried out between 7th June 2017 and 30th November
    2017, but this time reducing the number of plants to 486. The plants were grown
    in the greenhouse under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity and irrigation.
    The maximum temperature was established to 27°C and the reference humidity was
    60%. The plants were daily irrigated with a nutrient solution containing , , ,
    , and micro-nutrients. Drainage volume, pH and electrical conductivity in the
    greenhouse is daily controlled too. The mineral composition (anions and cations)
    and microbiological control of the irrigation nutrient solution and drainage are
    analysed weekly, to ensure that the calibration of the software is correct. Since
    the idea is to design a system suitable for Mediterranean crops, the substrate
    used in the demonstration is coco peat, which is a challenging material regarding
    turbidity of the drainage and the microbial content. In the following subsections,
    we describe the main parts of the greenhouse facilities and the deployment of
    computing nodes to deal with edge and cloud planes of the architecture. 5.1. Greenhouse
    facilities The greenhouse has a set of equipment mainly deployed inside a machinery
    room beside the crop. These facilities are composed of several hardware units
    described in the following subsections, and all of them are managed by our three-tier
    control system, whose particular implementation is also detailed. 5.1.1. Nutrient
    solution unit The nutrient solution unit is where all nutrients needed for optimal
    plant growth are mixed, and it is controlled by a CPS and finally orchestrated
    by the edge computing nutrition control module. This unit consists of five fertilisers
    tanks and one acid tank used to adjust pH. All of them with a volume of 500 l.
    The unit provides the crops rhizosphere with the 12 essential elements to complete
    their life cycle: nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, iron, copper,
    manganese, boron, zinc, molybdenum. As detailed in Fig. 5, the content of these
    six tanks are mixed with the disinfected drainages, tap water and high quality
    water from the osmosis system, to prepare a nutrient solution in the nutritive
    solution tank of 3000 l. For this, we have installed magnetic pumps for each fertiliser,
    level sensors for the tanks, electrical valves, flow meters, and an electromechanical
    stirrer in the main tank. The nutrition control module (edge computing layer)
    controls the nutrient solution based on the electrical conductivity, pH and temperature
    measured on the impulsion pipe of the pump, which finally irrigates the crop,
    taking the nutrient solution from the tank. Download : Download high-res image

    and irrigation in the greenhouse. Low quantities of water and nutrients are needed
    thanks to a complete automated system that adapts nutrition according to a formula
    tuned at the cloud plane and executed by edge control modules. 5.1.2. Irrigation
    unit Three intermediate tanks are used to work with different nutrient solutions
    to make easier the experiments, as can be seen in Fig. 5. The solution to be used
    is pumped to irrigate the crop during 5 min and several times, with an estimated
    flow of 3000 . Irrigation and drainage flows are measured by flow meters that
    provide digital inputs to the CPS calibrated to . The whole process is controlled
    by the irrigation control module in the edge computing layer. Untreated drainage
    water is collected in a tank with a capacity of 1000 l, which is later pumped
    and pre-filtered to remove impurities of every nature and consistency. 5.1.3.
    Disinfection unit The filtered water is conducted through the disinfection unit
    (lower part of Fig. 5), which was initially based on ultraviolet treatment to
    reduce or eliminate microbial content, and thus reduce the appearance of diseases.
    Lately the system has been replaced by another unit based on a reactor of electrolysis,
    which has shown to be more effective, as the results presented in Section 6.2
    indicate. A precise dimensioning of the process using our system allows the totally
    effective treatment of illnesses that are transmitted by water pathogens. This
    unit is able to treat a maximum of 200 of drainage. The disinfected water is stored
    in a 5000 l tank with control level, where it is analysed. The electrical conductivity,
    pH and temperature are measured on the impulsion pipe of the pump, which sends
    back the water to the main nutritive solution tank. The whole process is controlled
    by a CPS, following the parameters indicated by the nutrition control module in
    the edge layer. 5.1.4. Purification unit The system has a purification unit with
    a reverse osmosis equipment that transforms tap water into low electrical conductivity
    water that can be mixed with drainages and tap water to prepare final nutrient
    solutions. The pilot has a purification unit able to generate 100 of low electric
    conductivity in a 5000 l tank, together with a flow meter, valves and pump needed
    to inject the water, which are connected with a CPS and controlled by the nutrition
    control module in the edge layer. 5.1.5. Climate unit The greenhouse has an IPv6
    over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) deployment, where sensors
    are directly interconnected using Internet protocols, to measure the temperature,
    humidity, solar radiation and CO2. A CPS device is provided with peripherals dedicated
    to manage the different climatic devices. Although the platform is capable of
    managing up to thirteen climatic systems, the physical facilities of the prototype
    greenhouse has currently the following hardware: • Ventilation system with four
    overhead motorised windows. • Thermal-shade screen system on the roof, with an
    electro-mechanical traction system for opening and closing. It gets 48% of shadow
    and 55% of energy saving. • Air cooling system, which consists of a humidifier
    module and three helical extractors. The extractors have a flow of 38,000 . •
    Air fog system, used to humidify and cool the greenhouse through water evaporation.
    It has a pressure pump of 1 HP and 25 l, and an air compressor of 4 HP and 50
    l. • Heating system with a 100,000 kcal boiler, a stainless steel heat exchanger
    and 1 HP pumps for three distribution units. A broad range of sensors from the
    market were considered to fulfil the operation and environmental requirements
    of the platform. They were studied within the DrainUse project4 attending to the
    functionality provided and cost, and the finally selected ones are included in
    Table 1, indicating the model and main operation features. The operation of these
    sensors have been validated through the two cycles of tomato crop, presenting
    correct reads after the initial calibration procedure carried out in the CPS and
    6LoWPAN logger. Table 1. Sensors used in the prototype greenhouse, including relevant

    programmed and supervised by humans using the management services when required,
    with the intelligent support provided by data analytics. New high-level configuration
    parameters in the cloud Context Broker trigger notifications and changes in the
    Context Broker of edge control modules, which in turn are in charge of managing
    the operation of the individual greenhouse areas through mandating their corresponding
    CPSs. 5.2.1. CPS deployment Each control module in the edge computing plane has
    been initially assigned with a master CPS unit, resulting in a fully distributed
    system. The nutrition master CPS unit is in charge of controlling the nutrient
    solution, disinfection and purification hardware units, that is, the complete
    water cycle except for the irrigation action itself, which is carried out by a
    separate master CPS unit (and edge computing module). Unlike many commercial fertigation
    systems, we have decided to separate irrigation from nutrition control in order
    to have more flexibility to implement intelligent irrigation programs, apart from
    simply considering time and volume. Finally, the climate hardware unit is managed
    by the corresponding master CPS unit and control module. The three master CPS
    nodes (and edge control modules) are complemented by an auxiliary CPS and control
    module in charge of energy monitoring, alarms management and other auxiliary tasks
    as access control. Concrete implementations of emergency procedures in the auxiliary
    CPS include the described high temperature case, but also the lack of enough water
    flow from input pipes and additional support for energy cuts. In the first case,
    the human operator is warned of the water flow problem by the application described
    in Section 5.2.3, using the regular communication channel through the edge and
    cloud planes. However, to cover power cuts, the auxiliary CPS is equipped with
    a GSM modem and a backup battery to warn a human technician with an SMS message.
    The contact number can be configured in the user application described later.
    The master CPS consists of an IPex16 controller from Odin Solutions (OdinS), which
    is shown in Fig. 6, with a 32-bit CPU, 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD,
    Ethernet, USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485 and 16 I/O ports, which can be configured
    by software as digital or analogue input/outputs. It supports 3G, 6LowPAN, Sigfox
    and LoRA. Each master CPS is able to manage eight additional slave I/O boards
    using CAN. The configuration of the controllers is done easily through its web
    server, and it permits us to configure atomic reactive (high priority) tasks independently
    from the MQTT commands received from the edge computing layer. In our case the
    communication of the CPSs with the network is through LAN. The communication among
    master and slave CPS nodes is done through CAN bus, allowing distances up to 1
    km. This permits to distribute CPSs along the facilities. Download : Download

    contains the power meters of the installation. Figure 8 presents a diagram with
    the connection of different sensors with an IPex16-based CPS unit, indicating
    as well the MQTT protocol they use to communicate with the edge layer. As it depicts,
    both sensors and actuators use direct I/O lines for connection. Thus, by configuring
    analogue inputs, e.g., measurements such as temperature, humidity or pH can be
    transmitted from the sensor to the corresponding edge control module. Digital
    inputs are used for counters and, digital outputs are used to actuate over the
    elements of the greenhouse. Remote sensors that cannot be easily wired with the
    CPS are interconnected with 6LoWPAN. Download : Download high-res image (206KB)

    with sensors through the IPex16 CPS unit. The prototype system has 134 I/O wired
    signals distributed among all IPex16-based CPSs, and also some wireless signals
    using 6LowPAN. Most of the data collected come from wired digital outputs to solenoid
    valves, pumps, other motors (p.e. windows, screens systems) and analogue inputs
    from sensors (temperature, humidity, radiation, CO2, etc.). We also have a set
    of digital inputs from the different flow meters (liquids consumption). Sensors
    interconnected through 6LoWPAN are wired with Mex06 data loggers from OdinS, which
    are low-power devices especially prepared for remote control and monitoring. They
    include a 16-bit CPU, 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, 1xRS232, 1xSDI-12
    and, what is of relevance, 1xRF 802.15.4 g over which 6LowPAN operates. Mex06
    loggers are especially designed for outdoor settings such as the agricultural
    scenarios, since it is provided with a water and dust-proof enclosure. It is prepared
    to be provided with a battery and a solar panel. The operation of these units
    have been validated connecting sensors deployed along the crop: temperature, humidity
    and solar radiation. Both IPex16 (CPS) and Mex06 (wireless data logger), have
    been adapted by OdinS within the DrainUse project. Hence, the firmware of theses
    units have been improved as a result of this research to serve as generic-purpose
    MQTT units for high-precision automation environments. 5.2.2. Deployment of computing
    nodes In the current deployment, edge control modules are virtualised in a local
    server installed at the crop premises, while the cloud plane is set-up in a high-end
    server at the Computer Science Faculty (University of Murcia). Within the machinery
    room (beside the greenhouse) we have installed a common computer with PC architecture.
    It is comprised by an Intel Core i5-7400 CPU (3.00 GHz and Quad Core architecture),
    16 GB of RAM and a hard disk of 1 TB. The computer runs Centos 7, and LibVirt/KVM
    is used to create four virtual machines, one per control module. Virtual machines
    are provided with 4 GB of RAM and 50 GB of hard disk capacity. This is enough
    to run the local Context Broker instances, which deals with only a part of the
    system, save data, and execute IoT agents. The cloud server is a PowerEdge R200,
    with an Intel Xeon x3360 (2.83 GHz and Quad Core architecture), 32 GB of RAM and
    two hard disks of 500 GB each. It also runs Centos 7 and LibVirt/KVM. A single
    virtual machine is used here for the global Context Broker, data saving, Big Data
    processes and to host management with web services. The virtual machine uses 16
    GB of memory and 200 GB of hard disk capacity. Good performances are obtained
    at the moment, but given the flexibility of our architecture, more resources could
    be added by modifying or moving virtual images. The Context Broker version used
    has been Orion 1.7.0, which is supported by Comet release 6. Exclusively for the
    cloud computing plane, it is also used Cygnus 1.0 and Hadoop 2.8. 5.2.3. User
    management service Regarding the management services identified in Fig. 3, we
    have developed a set of web services in HTML5 with a friendly graphical view to
    monitor and control the main functions of the system. Figure 9 includes a screen
    shot of the application area to manage climate. The view in the image includes
    tools to monitor the status of the climatic equipment of the greenhouse. Green-shaded
    parts indicate that these modules are active, such as the air-fog system, ventilation
    and cooling. Current values for temperature, humidity, radiation and air quality
    are also displayed. Usually all the greenhouse facilities are automatically managed
    by edge control modules according to general configuration parameters dictated
    at the cloud plane, by using this application. In this software it is possible
    to set the range of climatic parameters, or the base components of the nutrition
    solution, among others. Manual management of greenhouse facilities is also possible
    providing the required credentials. Download : Download high-res image (699KB)

    of individual automated modules at the greenhouse. 6. System operation This section
    describes the validation of the architecture and prototype from two different
    perspectives. First, an operation example with a real task is described attending
    to the three tiers of the architecture, with the aim of clarifying the function
    of each part of the system. Second, the platform is used in two cycles of a real
    crop and main results are analysed. 6.1. Reference operation example Given that
    the nutrition management is the most interesting operation from the PA point of
    view, here we include a complete description of the tasks carried out to actuate
    on the greenhouse and assure a proper irrigation with fertilisers. The explanation
    is split into the cloud, edge and CPS planes, following the sequence of tasks
    executed. 6.1.1. Cloud level In this layer, on the basis of a nutrient percentage
    table, the nutrition recipe (mixture) is calculated “theoretically” (there are
    no physical actions). To do this, a set of calculations assure that a final set
    of volumes of water sources and fertilisers comply with the plant needs. The steps
    are: 1. The first time the software presented in Section 5.2.3 is used, the following
    parameters must be defined: (a) Available fertilisers in the facilities. (b) Water
    components based on analysis carried out beforehand in laboratory of each external
    water source. 2. For a new nutrition mixture the next parameters are defined:
    (a) Volume of the mixture. (b) Nutrient percentage table with the cations–anions
    equilibrium concentration. (c) Selection of the fertiliser cubes and water sources
    from the list of available ones. (d) Target irrigation tank. (e) Desired pH and
    maximum electrical conductivity (ECmax). 3. Calculate the volume of different
    waters to be used so that ECmax is not exceeded, maximising the use of drainage
    water and reducing the cost of the mixture. 4. Compensate the excess of nutrients
    with a dilution recalculating the volumes of waters. The excess of nutrients are
    due to the already provided nutrients in the waters used. 5. Recalculate the mixture
    electrical conductivity considering the missing nutrients to be added. If ECmax
    is exceeded, a new dilution is needed in the previous step. 6 Add the missing
    nutrients As a result, the volumes of different water sources and fertilisers
    are sent to the edge level, together with the target pH and irrigation tank. 6.1.2.
    Edge level This layer is in charge of creating the mixture transmitted from the
    cloud level by orchestrating the greenhouse equipment (valves, pumps, sensor readings,
    etc). Hence, after receiving the different volumes it generates a complete set
    of operations to create the mixture. To do so, the next steps are followed: 1.
    Sequential discharge of waters in the nutritive solution tank. 2. Agitator activation.
    3. Sequential discharge of fertilisers in the nutritive solution tank. 4. Water
    recirculation through a pipe with sensors, to analyse the resulting mixture. 5.
    pH adjustment by discharges from the acid tank. 6. Pouring into the irrigation
    tank selected. 7. Cleaning the nutritive solution tank using purified water. After
    these steps have taken place, a set of atomic tasks are generated and transferred
    to the CPS level. For instance, for the first point, the sequential discharge
    of waters will be decomposed in atomic operations where a specific digital output
    is activated until the required volume is discharged. During all this process,
    the CPS will provide updated information by notifying its new status thanks to
    the MQTT protocol. Only after validating the received information, the next step
    will take place following the same procedure. Hence, each control module in the
    edge layer is responsible for orchestrating and managing the operations that are
    executed by the CPS level by sending atomic operations and by subscribing to the
    MQTT topics where the information coming from the CPS nodes will be published.
    6.1.3. CPS level This control layer executes the atomic tasks received from the
    edge layer. CPS nodes are in charge of executing sensor readings and control loops,
    sending these data to the edge layer by using the appropriate topics of the MQTT
    protocol. In this sense, no other complex logic is executed at this level, searching
    for the robustness in this part of the platform. Examples of task executed in
    CPSs are the next ones: • . Activate/deactivate a digital output, such as a valve,
    pump, etc. • . This is also an atomic task with a control loop, which can be used
    to activate a valve associated to a flow meter (irrigation by volume). • . Analogue
    sensor reading for a defined sample time. As previously indicated, the auxiliary
    CPS also includes emergency procedures to perform reactive local tasks without
    supervision. Some examples are: • Send SMS messages when a power cut is detected.
    The auxiliary CPS has a backup battery and a GSM modem to send these messages.
    • Send SMS messages when a lack of water supply from input pipes is detected.
    • Close the valves of water supply when the water consumption exceeds a threshold
    and send an SMS message. Probably the pipe circuit of the greenhouse is damaged.
    • Take reactive actions in case of adverse climatic conditions for the plants,
    such as opening windows or switching on ventilation. 6.2. System validation We
    have collected agronomic results of two cycles of the tomato crop. In the last
    cycle we decided to reduce the plan density to increase ventilation and lighting.
    The main figures of merit are included in Table 2, attending the production per
    m2, ha and the total production in kg. The revenue in market price is also included
    at the end. Table 2. Main numbers of the first and second cycle of the tomato
    crop managed by the PA system. Empty Cell First cycle Second cycle Period 17/10/2016–26/05/2017
    07/06/2017–30/11/2017 Number of plants 1026 486 Plants per m2 2.2 1.2 Plants per
    ha 21.829 10.340 Total production (kg) 3056 3596 Fruit per plant (kg) 3.0 7.4
    Fruit per ha (kg) 65.037 76.511 Revenue (€ ) 58.533 68.860 The results indicate
    that, although the number of plants is lower in the second cycle, the total production
    has been even better than in the first cycle. This fact is clearly visible in
    the amount of fruit per plant. This improvement has been possible thanks to the
    reduction of the plant density, as said above, but also because of the lack of
    diseases, since the new disinfection unit based on a reactor of electrolysis has
    been more effective. Data obtained with the closed-loop hydroponic system (real
    data) have been compared with the needs of a regular open-cycle crop (estimation).
    The main comparative indicators for the two cycles of the crop are included in
    Table 3, including real and estimated values. To obtain the estimated data of
    water consumed in open cycle, we have assumed that the total water spent on irrigation
    (195,647 l and 140,000 l) would come from tap water to prepare the nutrient solution.
    The estimation of these volumes assume that the percentage of drainage reused
    in the close water cycle is added as new water in this case. The nutrients used
    in the open cycle are estimated following the same approach, considering that
    the new water needs extra nutrients as compared with the water gathered from drainages
    in the close cycle. Table 3. Comparison between open water cycle (OC) and close
    water cycle (CC) in terms of water and macronutrient consumption in the two crop

    can be seen in the results included in Table 3, the closed cycle represents a
    significant economic saving in the volume of water for irrigation, since the greenhouse
    is reusing 39% and 28% of the total water needed in the first and second crop
    cycles, respectively. The closed cycle has also meant a significant saving in
    the amount of fertilisers used in the nutrient solution. The differences in water
    savings between crop cycles are due to the crop periods, since the second one
    was carried out during summer and the plants require more water. Nutrient consumption
    also vary due to this fact, but also because of a variation in the water used
    and a better adaptation of the nutrients to the plant in the second cycle. From
    the results it can be said that good production levels have been obtained, at
    the same time water and nutrient consumption maintain clearly below the needs
    of regular open crops. And this has been obtained even with the target of validating
    the PA operation, with no especial focus on maximising revenues. There are important
    lessons learned after these two crop cycles. Attending to the hardware deployment,
    it has been relevant how well flow meters measure water intakes and detect circuit
    anomalies due to obstructions. Regarding the overall architecture of the control
    system, it is important to indicate that our initial conception was a static solution
    based on a single CPS acting as master unit, with several slave boards. This approach
    is similar to commercial turnkey systems available in the market, where the whole
    management is centralised on a controller or computer. These greenhouse control
    systems tend to be robust and also allow Internet access, but we experienced the
    lack of modularity, delocalisation and, above all, the lack of the flexibility
    provided by virtualisation. Flexibility is, in fact, particularly relevant when
    inserting extra services or moving the control functions to an evolved hardware.
    For this reason, our three-tier control system aims at a modular turnkey system,
    reducing engineering time in setting-up and maintenance. 7. Conclusions The work
    presented in the paper describes the design, development and evaluation of a system
    that covers extreme PA requirements by using automation, IoT technologies, and
    edge and cloud computing through virtualisation. A multi-tier platform has been
    developed, based on: (1) a CPS local layer connected with greenhouse facilities;
    (2) a novel edge computing plane where to insert control modules in virtualised
    nodes near the access network; and (3) a cloud segment provided with higher computing
    and data analytics resources to support crop management decisions. Cloud and edge
    planes are powered by FIWARE, including the use of regulated data formats and
    network interfaces, and a proper connection with local and global data analytics
    modules has been developed. The edge plane is powered with NFV technology to increase
    flexibility in deploying control modules. When deployed under the access network,
    higher levels of system reliability are reached, since sporadic network cuts do
    not affect control decisions. The whole system has been implemented in a real
    greenhouse in the south-east of Spain, including details about the main functional
    units that are controlled by our PA management platform. Moreover, two cycles
    of tomato crop have been used to, first, validate of the good operation of the
    architecture and, second, analyse the improvements of our system as compared with
    a regular open crop. Savings of more than 30% in water consumption have been obtained,
    which is highly relevant in our semi-arid area, and up to 80% in some nutrients.
    As a relevant future result, we are currently porting the platform to a urban
    farming setting in frames of the HIDROLEAF project. In this environment we make
    use of intermodal containers to create portable crops. This implies extreme climatic
    environments that makes the most of our PA platform. Moreover, we expect to continue
    evaluating the system in future crop cycles to further improve operations and
    adapt our decision support capabilities finally offered as management services
    to human operators. Acknowledgements This work has been sponsored by the Spanish

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\
    \ in Section 7;\nand conclusions and future directions are presented in Section\
    \ 8.\nTable 2. Common wireless nodes used in the agriculture domain.\nSr #\nWN1\n\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,
    “information security”, “information transparency”, “agriculture”, “agricultural”,
    “agribusiness”, “agriculture safety”, “agriculture security”, “agriculture traceability”,
    “food safety”, “food security”, “food traceability”, “food supply”, “food trade”,
    “food value chain management”, “agriculture value chain management”, “agri-food
    value chain management”, “agricultural trade” Databases ScienceDirect, Web of
    Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library, Emerald, Google
    Scholar, IEEE Xplore Search strings (“blockchain” OR “information security” OR
    “information transparency”) AND (“agriculture” OR “agricultural” OR “agribusiness”
    OR “agriculture safety” OR “agriculture security” OR “food safety” OR “food security”
    OR “food traceability” OR “food supply” OR “food trade” OR “agriculture traceability”
    OR “food value chain management” OR “agriculture value chain management” OR “agri-food
    value chain management” OR “agriculture trade”) 3.3. Study selection and evaluation
    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    studies. Note: Node size depends on the quantity of connected components. From
    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    A review [45]; How blockchain technology along with other technologies such as
    AI, IoT, Big Data revolutionize the current agri-food industry As blockchain technology
    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    in the agri-food supply chain can share the same business rules and transaction
    data, transaction transparency were improved. (1) May have regulation problem
    if involved in the international trade. • There are two main areas in the literature
    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value

    and data would be increased Hybrid approach (1) Part of the data are stored in
    the blockchain, and the rest are direct shared with other partners (1) High cost
    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. Main challenges Possible solutions

    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future studies in the
    area of blockchain technology and agri-food value chain management. Acknowledgment

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size

    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain
    have become two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. Blockchain technology
    has the ability to automate payment in cryptocurrency and to provide access to
    a shared ledger of data, transactions, and logs in a decentralized, secure, and
    trusted manner. Also with smart contracts, blockchain has the ability to govern
    interactions among participants with no intermediary or a trusted third party.
    AI, on the other hand, offers intelligence and decision-making capabilities for
    machines similar to humans. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on blockchain
    applications for AI. We review the literature, tabulate, and summarize the emerging
    blockchain applications, platforms, and protocols specifically targeting AI area.
    We also identify and discuss open research challenges of utilizing blockchain
    technologies for AI. An overview of AI systems and features in relation to blockchain

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Blockchain is one the most hyped innovations
    these days, and it has been gaining a lot of traction as a horizontal technology
    to be widely adopted in various fields [1]–[3]. Since its inception in 2008, blockchain
    continued to emerge as a disruptive innovation that will revolutionize the way
    we interact, automate payments, trace and track transactions [4]. Blockchain can
    be highly cost effective in eliminating the need for a centralized authority to
    govern and verify interactions and transactions among several participants. In
    blockchain, every transaction is cryptographically signed and verified by all
    mining nodes which hold a replica of the entire ledger which contains chained
    blocks of all transactions. This creates a secure, synchronized and shared timestamped
    records that cannot be altered [5]. Another prominent field that is gaining huge
    traction is artificial intelligence(AI) which allows a machine to have cognitive
    functions to learn, infer, and adapt based on data it collects. Recent market
    research predicts that AI market will grow up to 13 trillion US dollars by the
    year 2030. The massive production and generation of data by sensing systems, IoT
    devices, social media, and web applications have contributed to the rise of AI
    [6]. Such data can be utilized by various machine learning and deep learning techniques
    [7] to perform variety of analytics. To date, the majority of machine learning
    and deep learning methods of AI rely on a centralized model for training in which
    a group of servers run a specific model against training and validating datasets
    and many organizations like Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon manage the huge
    volumes of data to make informed decisions [8]. However, the centralized nature
    of AI may lead to the possibility of data tampering, as data can be subject to
    hacking and manipulation as it is managed and stored in centralized manner [9].
    Moreover, the data provenance and authenticity of the sources generating the data
    are not guaranteed [10]. This may lead to AI decision outcomes that can be highly
    erroneous, risky, and dangerous. The concept of decentralized AI has been recently
    emerging. Decentralized AI is basically a combination of AI and blockchain [8].
    The decentralized AI enables to process and perform analytics or decision making
    on trusted, digitally signed, and secure shared data that has been transacted
    and stored on the blockchain, in a distributed and decentralized fashion, without
    Trusted Third Parties or intermediaries [8], [9]. AI is known to work with huge
    volumes of data, and blockchain has now been foreseen as a trusted platform to
    store such data. The feature of blockchain smart contracts gives the ability to
    program the blockchain to govern transactions among participants involved in decision
    making or generating and accessing the data [11]. Smart contract-based autonomous
    systems and machines can learn and adapt to changes over time, and make trusted
    and accurate decision outcomes that are verified and validated by all mining nodes
    of the blockchain. Such decisions cannot be refuted, and can be traced, tracked
    and verified by all participating entities. AI techniques that utilize blockchain
    can offer decentralized learning to facilitate a trust and secure sharing of knowledge
    and decision outcomes across a large number of autonomous agents, which can contribute,
    coordinate, and vote on further decisions [12], [13]. To date, the literature
    lacks comprehensive reviews and studies on the role that blockchain plays in the
    context of AI. Existing literature reveals that researchers studied blockchain
    and AI in isolation, and their applications in various vertical domains and businesses
    [14]–[27]. A couple of studies discussed the integration of AI and blockchain,
    and the implications of such integration on the way we live, work, interact, and
    transact [9], [28]. The primary contributions of this paper can be summarized
    as follows: We give an overview of blockchain basics and key features and how
    these features can be leveraged for AI. We discuss how the integration of AI and
    blockchain can help in developing a new ecosystem of decentralized economy. In
    addition, we outline the key benefits brought by this integration. We present
    a detailed taxonomy of blockchain platforms, architecture and infrastructure types,
    and consensus protocols, along with existing decentralized AI applications. We
    report and discuss multiple practical use cases of AI applications and implementations
    utilizing blockchain in different vertical domains. We identify and outline open
    research challenges in adopting and leveraging blockchain features for future
    AI applications. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses
    the background of blockchain and AI technologies and how blockchain helps in transforming
    existing AI techniques. Section III presents the detailed taxonomy and Section
    IV describes blockchain applications for AI. Various open research challenges
    and issues are categorized in Section V. Section VI concludes the paper. SECTION
    II. Background In this section, we give an overview of blockchain and AI and discuss
    how blockchain technology can be leveraged to transform, in many radical ways,
    AI and its applications. A. Blockchain Blockchain is a distributed, open source,
    immutable, public digital ledger which is distributed among networked peers [4].
    Fundamentally, blockchain is a chain of blocks that make up the ledger. This ledger
    holds a permanent record of transactions and interactions that took place among
    participants accessing the distributed and decentralized blockchain network [11].
    Each block contains the details of the transaction and the asset exchanges (i.e.,
    Ether or Bitcoin) that took place between the users [4], [11]. Smart Contracts
    are codes that can be executed by the blockchain mining nodes. A smart contract
    is a self-executing code that can verify the enforcement of predefined terms and
    conditions [29]. Instead of validating digital currencies, as in Bitcoin, the
    blockchain mining nodes execute, verify and store data in blocks. A smart contract
    is triggered by consigning a transaction to its Ethereum address and executing
    it depending on the input given for that transaction. Ethereum is a blockchain
    based open source distributed platform that enables to program smart contracts
    [11]. Ethereum uses Ether as a currency for making payments for the transactions
    carried out on the Ethereum blockchain. Each participant in the Ethereum network
    is identified uniquely by an Ethereum Address (EA). Conventional blockchain is
    a very expensive medium for storing large amounts of data. For example, storing
    large files or documents on Bitcoin blockchain is very expensive as the size limit
    per block is limited to one megabyte [35]. To solve this problem, a decentralized
    storage medium is used for storing such data and hashes of the data are linked
    with the blockchain blocks or used within the blockchain smart contract code.
    Among the popular decentralized storage technologies are the Interplanetary File
    System (IPFS) [35], Swarm [36], Filecoin [37], BigChainDB [38], Storj [39], and
    many others. IPFS is a peer-to-peer, distributed and decentralized file system
    that is connected across nodes of computers that share a common file system [35].
    It is content-addressable, which means that the contents of IPFS can be accessed
    using IPFS hash addresses. Moreover, this file system becomes indisputable, since
    it works similar to the blockchain network by having a list of nodes, and does
    not allow any tampering of files. Therefore, providing high throughput and content-addressed
    block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. In addition, due to its
    decentralized nature, there is not a single point of failure i.e., if one device
    gets disconnected, the file can still be accessed [35]. B. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) The field of AI research defines itself as the study of “intelligent agents,”
    i.e., any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize
    its chance of success at some goal [40]. Most AI systems in development today
    are typically specialized expert systems that use a database of knowledge to make
    decisions. However, many researchers are working to build AI systems that can
    apply truly intelligent decision making processes to a restricted set of problems,
    some of which may positively impact our daily lives. Table 1 shows few emerging
    trends in AI applications such as explainable AI [9], [30], digital twins [31],
    automated machine learning [32], hybrid learning models [33], and lean and augmented
    data learning [34], and the perceived benefits of using blockchain technologies.
    By integrating AI and blockchain technologies, decentralized AI applications and
    algorithms can be developed, with access to an identical view of a secure, trusted,
    shared platform of data, logs, knowledge, and decisions. Such platform can also
    be used to host a trusted trail of all records taken by AI algorithms before,
    during, and after the learning and decision making process [19]. TABLE 1 Latest
    Trends in AI Applications and Benefits of Using Blockchain FIGURE 1. An overview
    of AI systems and features in relation to blockchain and IoT-enabled ecosystems.
    Show All C. How Blockchain Can Transform AI Many shortcomings of AI and blockchain
    can be addressed effectively by combining both technological eco-systems [19],
    [41]. AI algorithms rely on data or information to learn, infer, and make final
    decisions. The machine learning algorithms work better when data are collected
    from a data repository or a platform that is reliable, secure, trusted, and credible.
    Blockchain serves as a distributed ledger on which data can be stored and transacted
    in a way that is cryptographically signed, validated, and agreed on by all mining
    nodes. Blockchain data are stored with high integrity and resiliency, and cannot
    be tampered with. When smart contracts are used for machine learning algorithms
    to make decisions and perform analytics, the outcome of these decisions can be
    trusted and undisputed. The consolidation of AI and blockchain can create secure,
    immutable, decentralized system for the highly sensitive information that AI-driven
    systems must collect, store, and utilize [41]. This concept results in significant
    improvements to secure the data and information in various fields, including medical,
    personal, banking and financial, trading, and legal data. Figure 1 shows that
    AI can benefit from the availability of many blockchain platforms for executing
    machine learning algorithms and tracing data that are stored on decentralized
    P2P storage systems. These data are typically originated by smart connected products
    that include variety of sources such as IoT devices, swarm robots, smart cities,
    buildings, and vehicles. The features and services of the cloud can be also harnessed
    for off-chain machine learning analytics and intelligent decision making, and
    for data visualization. Some of the significant features (as listed in Table 2)
    of leveraging blockchain for AI can be summarized as follows: Enhanced Data Security.
    Information held within blockchain is highly secure. Blockchains are very well
    known for storing sensitive and personal data in a disk-less environment. Blockchain
    databases hold data that are digitally signed, which means only the “respective
    private keys” must be kept secure [42]. This allows AI algorithms to work on secure
    data, and thereby ensuring more trusted and credible decision outcomes. Improved
    Trust on Robotic Decisions. Any decision made by AI agents becomes dysfunctional
    when it is difficult for consumers or users to understand and trust. Blockchain
    is well known for recording transactions in decentralized ledgers on a point-by-point
    basis, making it easier to accept and trust the decisions made, with confidence
    that the records have not been tampered with, during the human-involved auditing
    process [42]. Recording the decision making process of an AI system on a blockchain
    would increase transparency and it would gain public trust to understand the robotic
    decisions [43]. The need for a third party auditor can be eliminated in a swarm
    robotic ecosystem, where the consensus in the swarm can be achieved through an
    absolutely decentralized approach [42]–[44]. Collective Decision Making. In a
    robotic swarm ecosystem, all the agents need to work in coordination to achieve
    the swarm goal [44]–[46]. The decentralized and distributed decision-making algorithms
    have been adopted in many robotic applications, without the need for a central
    authority. Robots take decisions by voting and outcomes are determined by majority
    rules. Each robot can cast its vote in the form of a transaction, where blockchain
    is public for all robots which can be utilized for verification of voting results.
    This process is repeated by all robots until the swarm comes to a decisive conclusion.
    Decentralized Intelligence. For taking smart high level decisions which involve
    multiple agents to perform different subtasks that have access to the common training
    data (e.g., in case of supervised learning), different individual cybersecurity
    AI agents can be combined to provide fully coordinated security across the underlying
    networks and to solve scheduling issues [45], [47]. High Efficiency. Multiuser
    business processes, which involve multiple stakeholders such as individual users,
    business firms, and governmental organizations, are inherently inefficient due
    to multiparty authorization of business transactions. The integration of AI and
    blockchain technologies enables intelligent Decentralized Autonomous Agents (or
    DAOs) for automatic and fast validation of data/value/asset transfers among different
    stakeholders [48]. TABLE 2 Key Features and Benefits of Blockchain Integration
    With AI SECTION III. Taxonomy This section presents a detailed taxonomic discussion
    of key concepts to enable blockchain technologies for AI applications. Figure
    2 shows the classification tree of existing works found in the literature which
    we categorized in terms of decentralization of AI methodologies and operations,
    blockchain infrastructure and types, and the underlying consensus protocols utilized
    for distributed decentralized transaction validations across underlying networks.

    AI applications operate autonomously in order to perform informed decisions by
    executing different planning, search, optimization, learning, knowledge discovery,
    and knowledge management strategies. However, the decentralization of AI operations
    is a complex and challenging task. 1) Autonomic Computing One of the key goals
    of AI applications is to enable fully (or partially) autonomous operations whereby
    multiple intelligent agents (i.e., small computer programs) perceive their constituent
    environments, preserve their internal states, and perform specified actions accordingly
    [49]. In order to operate autonomously, modern computing systems need to handle
    massive heterogeneity at all verticals including data sources, devices, data processing
    systems, data storage systems, and application interfaces, to name a few. The
    enablement of multiagent systems at all verticals does not only facilitate the
    handling of heterogeneity but it also helps in establishing inter-layer and intralayer
    operability across entire systems [50]. The blockchain architecture can play a
    vital role by ensuring operational decentralization and keeping permanent footprints
    of interactions between users, data, applications, devices, and systems which
    leads toward the development of fully decentralized autonomous systems. 2) Optimization
    Finding a set of best solutions from all possible solutions is one of the main
    features of AI-enabled applications and systems [51]. Modern AI applications and
    systems operate in various environments including pervasive and ubiquitous environments
    (e.g., edge computing systems), resource-constrained environments (e.g., mobile
    devices/systems), geographically bounded systems (e.g., personal area networks,
    wireless local area networks, etc.), and centralized massively parallel and distributed
    computing systems (e.g., cloud computing systems) [52]. Based upon application-level
    and system-level objectives, the optimization strategies work in constrained or
    unconstrained environments [53]. These strategies facilitate finding best solutions
    such as selecting most relevant data sources in pervasive environments, best candidate
    edge or cloud servers for data and application processing, or enabling the resource-efficient
    data management in large-scale distributed computing environments. Current optimization
    strategies are executed with centralized control considering system-wide/application-wide
    optimization objectives which results in extraneous and irrelevant data processing
    and inferior system/application performance [54]. The enablement of decentralized
    optimization strategies using blockchain opens a new window of research and development
    opportunities. The decentralized optimization leads to increased system performance
    by processing highly relevant data. The decentralized optimization is also beneficial
    when multiple strategies with different optimization objectives need to be run
    simultaneously across applications and systems. 3) Planning AI applications and
    systems execute planning strategies in order to collaborate with other applications
    and systems and solve complex problems in new environments. Planning strategies
    help in operational efficiency and resilience of AI applications and systems by
    taking current input state and executing different logic and rule-based algorithms
    to reach predefined goals [55]. Currently, the centralized planning is complicated
    and time consuming task; therefore, blockchain based decentralized AI planning
    strategies are needed to offer more robust strategies with permanent tracking
    and provenance history. The blockchain is also useful for devising critical and
    immutable plans for strategic applications and mission critical systems. 4) Knowledge
    Discovery and Knowledge Management Modern AI applications handle large amounts
    of data streams and require support for centralized big data processing systems.
    The centralized knowledge discovery and knowledge management benefits the provisioning
    of application-wide and system-wide intelligence, however, the applications enable
    customized knowledge patterns for specific groups of users, applications, devices,
    and systems [56]. The decentralization of knowledge discovery processes and decentralized
    knowledge management is envisaged to provide personalized knowledge patterns considering
    the needs of all stakeholders in the system. In addition, the blockchain technologies
    can facilitate in secure and traceable knowledge transfer among different stakeholders
    in AI applications and systems. 5) Perception Intelligent agents and bots in AI
    applications and systems continuously collect, interpret, select, and organize
    data from their ambient environments using centralized perception strategies which
    results in monolithic data collection [57]. The decentralized perception strategies
    can facilitate the collection of data from different views. The blockchain based
    decentralization facilitates tracing the perception trajectories, secure transfer
    of collected data, and immutable data storage. The decentralized perception strategies
    are useful because the applications and systems do not need to collect the data
    streams for successful and high quality perceptions repeatedly. Considering the
    permanent nature of blockchain, only the footprints of successful perceptions
    should be stored on blockchain. 6) Learning The learning algorithms stay at the
    heart of AI applications in order to enable automation and knowledge discovery
    processes. Learning algorithms vary in terms of supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised,
    ensemble, reinforcement, transfer, and deep learning models. These learning models
    solve different machine learning problems from classification to clustering and
    regression analysis to frequent pattern mining. Conventional learning models are
    trained and deployed using centralized infrastructure to achieve global intelligence.
    The decentralized learning models can help in achieving highly distributed and
    autonomous learning systems that support fully coordinated local intelligence
    across all verticals in modern AI systems [58], [59]. In addition, the blockchain
    enables immutable and highly secure versioning of learning models by maintaining
    provenance and historical aspects of data. However, considering the permanent
    nature of smart contracts, learning models need to be trained and tested well
    prior to deployment on blockchain. 7) Search AI applications need to operate in
    large and sparse search spaces (i.e., big datasets or multivariable high dimensional
    datastreams); therefore, efficient search strategies become the essence of AI
    technologies. The search strategies are designed by considering different factors
    such as completeness, complexity (i.e., time and space), and optimality. These
    strategies generally operate on nonlinear data structures such as trees and graphs
    whereby the algorithms start their expansion from an initial state and gradually
    expand until finding the required variable or completing the traversals in whole
    search spaces. Normally, search strategies are implemented using large-scale centralized
    and distributed infrastructure in order to maximize the operational efficiency
    [60]. However, their implementation using decentralized infrastructure needs careful
    investigation. It is envisaged that instead of deploying core search strategies,
    blockchains and decentralized infrastructure should be used to permanently and
    securely store successful search traces and traversal paths which could provide
    optimal search solutions of similar operations in the future. 8) Reasoning Logic
    programming is an essential component of AI applications that allows to develop
    inductive or deductive reasoning rules to reach decisions. The centralized reasoning
    in AI applications leads toward generalized global behavior across all application
    components [61]. To handle this issue, blockchain based distributed reasoning
    strategies are envisaged to facilitate the development of personalized reasoning
    strategies which could be more beneficial during perception, learning, and model
    deployment. In addition, smart contract based decentralized distributed reasoning
    on blockchain ensures the availability of unforgettable reasoning processes which
    may help in future executions of similar reasoning strategies. B. Decentralized
    AI Operations AI Applications generally handle large amounts of data for better
    and versatile decision making. However, centralized data storage using clouds,
    data centers, and clusters, becomes a major bottleneck for developing highly secure
    and privacy preserving AI applications. In addition, learning model development
    and deployment become tedious in some situations. Table 3 shows comparisons of
    some recent blockchain implementations that could potentially be adopted for AI
    applications. TABLE 3 Key Features and Benefits of Blockchain Platforms 1) Decentralized
    Storage The centralized data storage becomes highly susceptible in terms of privacy
    and security when it involves personal and sensitive data about users, locations,
    activities, health records, and financial information. In addition, large-scale
    data collection exposes the scaling and capacity related issues of centralized
    infrastructure where AI applications need to process, transform, and store big
    datasets. Blockchain-based decentralized storage infrastructure facilitate in
    cryptographically secure data storage across the participating networks [38],
    [62]–[64]. In these systems, each node keeps a client-centric (a client could
    be a user, application, or node performing transactions on the blockchain) publicly
    encrypted copy of whole database in order to ensure data availability for desired
    clients. The respective clients can mine and use their own data whenever needed.
    Sharding and Swarming are core solutions for decentralized storage [65]–[67].
    Sharding is the process of creating logical partitions of databases whereby each
    partition is assigned a unique key which is used to access it. The shards are
    further grouped together and their collected storage is supported by a group of
    nodes in the network in the form of swarms. Swarms reduce latency in AI applications
    by enabling parallel data access from multiple nodes in the network. In addition,
    scalability and reliability of storage increases because of geographically distributed
    multiparty decentralized storage systems. A few emerging decentralized data storage
    systems include Storj, Swarm, Sia, FileCoin, and IPFS which are further reviewed
    later in Section IV-A. 2) Data Management In addition to efficient decentralized
    storage, AI applications need to manage the data such that highly relevant, accurate,
    and complete datasets are collected from reliable data sources. Traditionally,
    AI applications run centralized data management schemes which execute across all
    the nodes in the underlying network [68]. These strategies include data filtration,
    data segmentation, context-aware data storage and routing in underlying networks,
    temporal data management and intelligent data management schemes. Considering
    decentralized storage networks and immutability constraints in blockchains, centralized
    data management becomes hugely inefficient because it will not only increase data
    duplication in case of minor changes in the data but it will also need to transfer
    similar datasets repeatedly. In case of big datasets, this massive data transfer
    will lead toward quick bandwidth overloading and increased backhaul network traffic;
    therefore, decentralized data management becomes essential for blockchain based
    AI applications. The decentralized data management schemes are envisaged to be
    deployed at node levels in the network considering temporal and spatial attributes
    in the data. In addition, the decentralized data management schemes can put the
    metadata on the blockchain in order to maintain security and provenance of the
    data. The actual data could be stored in traditional large-scale storage systems
    such as cloud data centers and clusters. In the case of client-centric small datasets,
    the metadata and actual data are stored on the blockchain and data are managed
    across the network using token-based incentives for nodes storing different shards
    or participating in the swarms. 3) Learning Model Development Learning plays key
    role in AI applications to understand the environment from current data and perform
    informed decision making based on new data. Normally, learning models are trained
    and tested before actual deployment in the real systems. The centralized training
    is costly because the models need to learn from the whole datasets and tend to
    be prone to overfitting (i.e., produce outputs based on memorized data), however,
    modern AI applications need to handle continuously evolving data streams. The
    decentralization of learning model development process is a feasible approach
    in order to develop resource-efficient learning models for client applications
    [58]. Decentralized learning algorithms take the input datasets from relevant
    swarms and shards and produce highly personalized learning models for each client.
    In addition, blockchain technologies can facilitate the maintenance of provenance
    of data as well as immutable history of learning models which may evolve over
    a certain period of time. Further the decentralized learning models could become
    benchmark for similar clients in the blockchain network where the users do not
    need to train the model from scratch, rather, they can incrementally build their
    own models by tuning and training new models. Once trained efficiently, the learning
    models could be tested using multiple smart contracts in decentralized applications.
    4) Model Deployment The real performance of a trained model is assessed after
    deployment in production environments. However, the model deployment is a frequent
    and iterative process whereby developers need to continuously improve the models
    and correct the biases (i.e., producing a specific set of decisions by ignoring
    rest of possible decisions) in order to produce highly effective and informed
    decisions. The model deployment in centralized systems is a straightforward iterative
    process, however, it becomes challenging when deployed in decentralized systems
    [69]. Smart contract based model deployment addresses these challenges by permanently
    recording the changes and maintaining the immutable versioning of different models.
    In addition, model sharing between different AI applications becomes secure and
    more trustworthy since the developers can track the provenance and all footprints
    of any specific version of a model. C. Blockchain Types for AI Applications Blockchain
    technologies are categorized as permissioned (i.e., only authorized users can
    access the blockchain applications in private, consortium, or cloud based settings)
    or permissionless (i.e., publicly accessible for all users via the Internet) systems.
    1) Public Public blockchains are known to be permissionless systems where users
    can download the blockchain code into their own systems, modify it, and use it
    according to their own requirements [4], [11]. In addition, public blockchains
    are easily accessible and open for read and write operations by all participants
    on the network. Due to their openness, user identities and transactional privacy
    information on these blockchain are managed using anonymous and pseudonymous data
    on the network. Also, these public blockchains use complex protocols for security
    and consensus mechanisms. The asset and data transfer at these blockchains use
    native tokens (i.e., cryptocurrencies or value pointers) for each public blockchain.
    Public blockchains are widely adopted due to their massive decentralization and
    openness, however, the participants (i.e., users/validators) on these blockchains
    are always unidentified. Hence, these blockchains are always prone to malicious
    security attacks which can result in massive value and data theft. Public blockchains
    need consensus of at least 51% validators and use complex mathematics to break
    security codes which result in large energy consumption and are also prone to
    attack in case the attackers gain control on 51% validators on the network. The
    transaction approval time on public blockchains is relatively longer when compared
    with private and consortium blockchains. Typically, a transaction on public blockchain
    is approved in 10 minutes or more but this approval time depends on the number
    of participants on the network and the mathematical complexity of employed consensus
    algorithms. 2) Private A private blockchain is managed by a single organization.
    Unlike public blockchains, the private blockchains are designed as permissioned
    systems where users and participants in the systems are pre-approved for read/write
    operations and are always known within the network [87]. Private blockchains are
    comparatively faster due to known identities of validators and pre-approved participants
    in the network; therefore, it requires less complex mathematical operations to
    validate transactions on the network. In addition, private blockchains can transfer
    any kind of indigenous data, values, and assets within the network. The approval
    of transactions and asset transfers are managed using voting or multiparty consensus
    algorithms which consume low energy and enable fast transactions. The transaction
    approval time on private blockchains usually remains lower than one second. 3)
    Consortium Consortium blockchains (also known as federated blockchains) are operated
    by a group of organizations. The groups are usually formed based on the mutual
    interests of participating organizations [88]. Different groups such as banks,
    governmental organizations, and private blockchain companies offer different types
    of federated blockchains. Like private blockchains, consortium blockchains operate
    as permissioned systems, however, few participants can perform both read and write
    operations on the blockchain. Usually, all the participants on the network can
    read the data on the blockchain, however, a few authorized and trusted users can
    write the data on the blockchain. The consortium blockchains are comparatively
    faster than public blockchains because the participants are always pre-approved
    with known identities. In addition, these blockchains consume less energy because
    of voting based or multiparty approval based consensus protocols. A typical transaction
    on federated blockchains gets approval within one second. 4) Blockchain-as-a-Service
    (BaaS) Cloud service providers are focusing on blockchain technologies due to
    massive adoption and acceptance by governments and large enterprises. Major cloud
    vendors like Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM are enabling their environments to develop
    and test blockchain services for their customers [89], [90]. The emergence of
    BaaS is envisaged to benefit both private and consortium blockchain companies
    whereby their major focus remains on value addition through application development,
    testing, and deployment without considering underlying network, storage, and computational
    infrastructure. The enablement of BaaS not only leads toward new cross-industry
    public-private consortia but it also helps in leveraging new business opportunities
    and business-customer interaction models. Developers are also empowered with single-click
    provisioning of BaaS services in order to write the smart contracts. Since the
    major cloud vendors already offer a large plethora of cloud services for AI applications,
    the integration of BaaS with AI services is opening a new world of opportunities
    for application developers. D. Decentralized Infrastructure for AI Applications
    Traditionally blockchain architectures were designed as linear infrastructure
    based on the combination of linked list data structures and hashing strategies.
    However, nonlinear infrastructure based on graph theory and queuing information
    models are also emerging to cater the needs of real-time applications and handle
    big data. 1) Linear Infrastructure The single chain based blockchain architectures
    grow linearly whereby new blocks are appended at the end of the chain. Early decentralized
    systems operate on single chains, however, these systems have multiple issues.
    Single chains scale up slowly and compromise the real-time performance of decentralized
    applications [4], [11]. In addition, separate single chains are required for each
    business scenario therefore value, information, and asset exchange in multiple
    chains is impossible. Single chain blockchains for AI applications can be used
    for single task AI applications performing search, optimization, and learning,
    or operating autonomously in homogeneous environments. Single chain based blockchains
    could be more useful when, instead of executing the AI applications using smart
    contracts, only the performance histories need to be stored permanently. For example,
    how a deep learning model is producing accurate results when applied to the diagnosis
    of liver cancer in radiology applications. Another example could be the successful
    search footprints of remote industrial robots. Since AI applications usually operate
    in unconstrained environments therefore putting whole AI application components
    on blockchain is not a feasible choice. 2) Nonlinear Infrastructure Nonlinear
    blockchain architectures are implemented in the form of multichain architectures
    whereby blockchain topologies are used in the form of parent-child chains, main-side
    chains, and parallel chains [91]. The multi-chain architectures are not only scalable
    for real-time performance but also support diverse business scenarios and cross-chain
    value transfers. In multi-chain architecture one or more chains keep information
    about other chains and serve(s) as main chain. Rest of the chains serve as side,
    child, or parallel chains. The child and side chains normally operate similarly,
    however, in child chains, the business scenarios are tightly linked with parent
    chains but side chains can totally operate independently from main chains. The
    parallel chains operate independently from other chains. The value transfer between
    different chains is performed using “pegging” approach where a two-way peg process
    is executed for bidirectional value transfer at a fixed exchange rate between
    chains. The exchange value is represented by native coins or tokens in the blockchain.
    The detailed discussion on nonlinear blockchains is presented in following studies
    for interested readers [71]. Nonlinear blockchains for AI applications facilitate
    the execution of multiple interrelated or independent AI tasks in the decentralized
    applications. In addition, the scalability features allow to execute AI applications
    in both development and deployment phases in parallel. AI components in production
    environment are deployed on the main/parent chain while the training and testing
    applications are deployed on the testnets or side chains. Nonlinear architectures
    also benefit emerging applications such as those using reinforcement and adaptive
    learning algorithms where the main applications need to continuously update their
    performance by retraining the learning models. In this case, learning models are
    developed on side chains and deployed on main chains. E. The Role of Consensus
    Protocols for AI Applications This subsection presents common consensus protocols
    and how they can impact the performance of AI applications on blockchain. Table
    4 shows different implementations of these protocols. TABLE 4 Consensus Protocols
    Used by Blockchain Platforms 1) Proof or Work (PoW) PoW is the pioneer consensus
    protocol proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous founder of cryptoccurency
    and decentralized distributed ledger technologies. Popular public blockchain systems,
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, validate transactions after participation of at
    least 51% nodes on the underlying network using PoW consensus protocol [4], [11].
    Since the validating nodes operate anonymously and in large quantity, these nodes
    need to mine the blocks by solving a complex and random mathematical problem and
    break the hash code to read the transactions on the blockchain. The successful
    nodes transmit the solution on peer-to-peer network to receive the rewards. New
    transactions and data are permanently added to the blockchain when 51% nodes on
    the network successfully solve the mathematical problem. Although PoW proved to
    be highly adopted consensus protocol, in large networks it consumes gigantic amount
    of energy and increases delay in transaction approvals. AI applications have high
    frequency of write operations because the intelligent algorithms continuously
    update the decision structures for informed decisions. Therefore, PoW protocols
    become performance bottleneck in real-time AI applications. In addition, 51% attack
    on the underlying network can compromise the security of AI applications. 2) Proof
    of Stake (PoS) PoS based consensus protocols solve the high energy consumption
    issue of PoW [92]. The PoS protocols work by defining big stakeholders on the
    blockchain network and allowing them to create new blocks. These protocols select
    the validators based on different criteria (i.e., random validators, delegated
    validators, high frequency transacting validators, or validators holding coins
    for longer period). PoS proved to be energy-efficient when compared with PoW and
    it also indirectly solves the security problem by stopping the anonymous validators
    and allowing only those validators who own the native currency of the blockchains.
    However, the validators have nothing to lose on the blockchain if they do not
    validate the transactions; therefore, it may cause delay while creating new blocks.
    PoS could be useful for delay-tolerant AI applications but these protocols are
    not suitable when AI applications need to handle streaming data, detect changes,
    and performed real-time informed decisions. 3) Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
    BFT is the majority voting algorithm that rules out validations from malicious
    nodes on the blockchain network [81]. The malicious nodes are already part of
    the blockchain but contain malicious intent code that can directly/indirectly
    lead to incorrect validations and corrupt the data stored on the blockchain. Since
    all nodes are part of blockchain networks, it becomes challenging for BFT protocol
    to find these malicious nodes. Although its implementation is difficult, BFT algorithms
    are historically used in critical systems such as airplane engine systems, large-scale
    sensory systems, and nuclear systems. Different variants of BFT protocols are
    used. Simple BFT handles fault tolerance as long as at least two-third non-faulty
    nodes are present on the network. Other BFT algorithms handle the fault tolerance
    by enforcing digital signatures and restricting communications between peer nodes
    on the network. Considering successful implementations of BFT algorithms in critical
    systems, BFT based consensus could become handy for AI applications. 4) Proof
    of Activity (PoAc) The PoAc protocol is a hybrid of PoW and PoS. This protocol
    initially works on empty blockchains using PoW algorithm and solves the 51% attack
    problem [93]. Initially, PoAc protocol solves complex mathematical problems and
    the validators start receiving the rewards which increases their stake on blockchains.
    The protocol then enables PoS algorithm for validators having acceptable stake
    on the blockchain. PoAc has been proven to be efficient in terms of security,
    storage, and network communication. Therefore, it could become handy for AI applications
    requiring less data availability and more security. 5) Proof of Burn (PoB) The
    PoB protocol allows the validators only if they spend their coins by sending to
    a public, verifiable, unspendable, and invalid address. Once the users burn their
    coins, they are immediately allowed to create new blocks and get rewarded [94].
    PoB benefits the users by allowing them to invest initially and create their stake
    on the blockchain and become authorized validators. It also solves the energy
    consumption problem of PoW. In addition, coin burning strategy reduces the number
    of coins on the blockchain; therefore, coin value increases gradually. Coin burning
    also benefits in balancing the number of coins on the blockchain, spending unsold
    coins, and paying for transaction fees on the network. AI applications can harness
    PoB protocols if they want to incentivize the users in order to maintain the value
    of underlying decisions. For example, the applications which need to maintain
    a specific level of accuracy, a certain number of clusters, or minimum number
    of objects to be found, can burn the learning models and search trees in order
    to maintain the value across the blockchain. 6) Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) Instead
    of engaging all users in the validation process, PoET protocols find a leader
    who can create new blocks on the chain. A PoET protocol works by associating a
    random timer with each node on the network and the node with minimum expiry is
    selected as the leader [95]. The leader node creates the new blocks and transmits
    its signature to the whole network. A PoET protocol continuously executes the
    random leader selection algorithm and finds new leaders all the time. It also
    enables to find malicious users in case the same nodes are selected as leaders
    or the minimum timer value is frequently assigned to specific nodes. PoET solves
    the energy consumption problem of PoW but due to random timer assignment, AI applications
    could become slow since the system needs to wait until the expiry of time. PoET
    could be useful when used with delay-tolerant applications. 7) Proof of Capacity
    (PoC) Traditional PoW algorithms become computationally intensive because they
    need to find random nonce values in order to unlock the blocks. The PoC protocol,
    also known as proof of space, works as an alternative protocol by discovering
    the hard drive space on the nodes of the blockchain network [96]. Instead of random
    generation, it stores all possible nonce values on hard drive and finds the matching
    nonce-hash pairs to unlock the blocks. Using PoC, the nodes with large disk space
    get more stake with high probability. 8) Proof of Authority (PoA) PoA solves high
    energy consumption issue of PoW. PoA protocols also solve the problem of dependency
    in PoS whereby validators must have monetary stake on the blockchain. A PoA protocol
    works by delegating authoritative control to specific nodes that collectively
    form the consensus based on majority votes to create new blocks on the network
    [100]. PoA is proved to be energy efficient and minimal delay consensus protocol
    but it is more suitable for private networks in order to delegate the validation
    authority to legitimate stakeholders. Therefore, blockchain implementers must
    consider legal identity of validators, a well-defined eligibility criteria to
    act as validator, and a universal eligibility criteria for all stakeholders to
    act as validators. Despite their energy efficiency and cost effectiveness, the
    security threats to PoA always remain high due to security attacks on validators
    who can potentially become a source of attack across the network. However, PoA
    could be used as an alternate consensus protocol for those AI applications that
    are deployed on private or consortium networks since all the validators are known
    across the system. 9) Proof of Importance (PoI) PoI protocols are similar to their
    PoA counterpart whereby validating nodes are ranked considering frequency of successful
    validations. The validators with high frequency get more importance on the blockchain
    and their approved transactions or blocks over-weigh other validators on the network
    because PoI sets the minimum threshold that must be met by nodes for successful
    validations [101]. Since the importance of validators is established considering
    their previous successful validations, a PoI protocol ensures high trust between
    participating nodes. Therefore, this protocol can be useful for AI applications
    on public blockchains. However, in private and consortium networks, PoI can lead
    to serious conflicts among stakeholders because important stakeholders can potentially
    monopolize the whole network. Although we discussed the major implementations,
    a thorough study of literature reveals that there are many other consensus protocols
    that could be potentially used for AI applications. Since these studies are relevantly
    either new or not widely accepted yet, we do not discuss these works in this paper.
    Interested readers may explore Proof of Luck [102], Proof of Exercise [103], Proof
    of Ownership [104], Proof of Vote [105], and Proof of Retrievability [106] for
    further discussions on consensus protocols. SECTION IV. Blockchain-Enabled AI
    Applications In this section, we describe works reported in the literature on
    how blockchain can be leveraged in AI to improve the reliability, security, transparency,
    trust, and management of data and algorithms in AI applications. A. Decentralized
    Data Storage and Management With AI The combination of AI and blockchain technologies
    has paved the way for many stable systems that support the interaction of multiple
    agents; therefore, providing an excellent platform for safe and secure data management,
    storage and transfer. Some of the key systems that utilize this combination are
    discussed in this subsection. A decentralized, multiagent approach for vehicle
    routing in a large-scale dynamic environment is proposed in [107] and [108]. This
    approach is based on environment-centric coordination mechanism, inspired by ant
    colonies. The authors propose an approach where intelligent agents scrutinize
    the environment on behalf of vehicles and forecast a congestion. This anticipatory
    vehicle information is collected and distributed in a decentralized fashion. This
    approach fits the distributed nature of the traffic domain and ensures that scalability
    requirements are more easily met when compared to centralized systems. This approach
    can route vehicles more efficiently by using forecast information; thus, avoiding
    congested routes and providing better guidance in rerouting. Further, the experimental
    results of this decentralized approach indicate a performance improvement of 35%
    in terms of speed; therefore, helping drivers reach their destinations faster
    [107], [108]. The intelligent approach utilized by multiple agents in a decentralized
    environment guarantees to not only avoid existing congestions but also to prevent
    congestions in the near future. The combination of AI and blockchain technology
    adds progressive value to biomedical research and healthcare sector [109]. The
    authors present a novel, decentralized model to assess the value of time and the
    combined value of personal data in an AI-moderated healthcare data exchange on
    the blockchain. An overview of AI and blockchain technologies is presented in
    this paper which may be used to accelerate biomedical analysis, improve predictive
    analysis techniques and empower patients with new tools to manage and control
    their own data and help them monetize their exclusive personal data with incentive
    benefits to undergo perpetual monitoring of their health. An AI-blockchain based
    system can dramatically simplify data acquisition. They allow the user to upload
    her/his data directly to the system and grants permission to use her/his data
    if it were bought through the system using transparent pricing formula determined
    by a data value model and it guarantees fair tracking of all data usage activities.
    Mamoshina et al. [109] discuss various promising machine learning techniques in
    practice and in development that include capsule networks, recursive cortical
    networks, and many other advances that are being made in symbolic learning and
    natural language processing. However, techniques such as transfer learning, recurrent
    neural networks, and generative adversarial networks are building up acceptance
    to be applied to the blockchain based decentralized personal data marketplaces.
    The integrated features of these technologies can play a significant role in healthcare
    assistance too. Socially assistive robots can be employed in elderly care assistance
    as discussed in [110]. As there is an increasing demand for elder care and a shortage
    of professional caregivers, socially assistive robots are one of the most promising
    technologies that can act as a communication interface and identify the needs
    of the elderly or seriously ill patients. These robots aim to create a positive
    user experience, motivate the patients and to improve the quality of life by assisting
    the patients in regular exercise, reduce stress levels and for personal caregiving
    [110]. Though AI techniques are efficient classifying and analyzing large datasets
    in the healthcare sector with the availability of huge volumes of raw medical
    data from the sensors of connected IoT devices, there are severe issues of integrity
    in terms of data collection and storage [43]. Also, it is a jeopardy to trust
    a robotic agents’ decision or activity in the medical field where all medical
    records need to be accurate and tamper-proof during a critical decision-making
    process. However, the combination of blockchain and AI technology could personalize
    medicine, quadrate treatments and health recommendations based on a patient’s
    medical history, genetic lineage, stress levels, geography, atmospheric conditions,
    past medical conditions and aid in improving trust on robotic decisions. The information
    can be securely stored on a distributed, decentralized and immutable patient record,
    as well as a graph-based relationship database, can be formulated [43] for storing
    unstructured data and the relationships amongst the data. Figure 3 presents an
    outline of the combined features of AI and blockchain technologies for the medical
    field which include various stages such as diagnosis, analytics, critical decision
    making and validation of medical test reports, etc. FIGURE 3. Collective intelligence
    for decentralized healthcare. Show All Machine learning algorithms can use the
    graph database to extract data, classify patterns and predict future prescriptions.
    Bayesian network, a graph database built on relationships of cause and effect,
    is an example of machine learning algorithms that use graph data to compute latent
    variables [43]. The vitality of a Bayesian network lies in its capability to regulate
    probabilities and predictions. When applied to health data, it can make effective
    predictions between unrelated data. The relationship of all entities in the healthcare
    graph database (such as physicians, specialists, medical researchers, drug manufacturers,
    patients, etc. and their activities which include treatment methods, prescriptions,
    and intake of drugs by patients) can be recorded on the immutable transaction
    log. The importance of handling vast volumes of data, exponential increase in
    computing power, and tremendous growth in people’s acceptance of connected applications
    and systems to register actions have become top priorities in AI and machine learning
    research [111]. Since artificial neural networks require large sets of data and
    high computing power for training purposes, a significant amount of resources
    to create powerful data centers to acquire large datasets have become essential
    [40], [112]. Woods [111] emphasizes the importance of combining AI techniques
    and blockchain infrastructure to tackle the security threats faced by the Internet,
    where bots-bots and human-bots interactions have increased, as 52% of the web
    traffic is generated by bots. Due to increased bot traffic, it is estimated that
    in the near future the bot-bot communications will outpace the human-bot interactions.
    Bots will need to be able to query each other for identification and then look
    up the history of the data and ratings before interactions. During an audit process,
    the query information and data can be stored on blockchain and a higher level
    of transparency and security can be achieved [111]. The integration of blockchain
    and machine learning technologies is a stronger combination that provides an immutable,
    strong consensus mechanism, ultra-secure decentralized, self-sovereign identity
    which has the stupendous potential to rebalance and improve machine learning algorithms.
    B. Decentralized Infrastructure for AI Blockchain infrastructure introduced three
    new characteristics to the traditional distributed architectures which include
    decentralized and shared control, immutable audit trails, and native asset exchanges
    [11]. Combined with AI techniques, this infrastructure provides users with qualitatively
    new data models, shared control of AI training data and models, and leads to improved
    trustworthiness on data. AI requires huge data, which is provided by blockchain,
    to produce better data models. This subsection discusses existing decentralized
    infrastructure and frameworks for AI applications. An open source platform that
    incentivizes individuals to build a distributed and decentralized AI agents thereby
    creating a synergy between distributed AI and decentralized blockchain is carried
    out by ChainIntel [113]. ChainIntel is aimed to deploy and use AI models in decentralized
    applications (DApps). This platform aims to reinforce and consign the execution
    of AI models to various parts of the network, enabling scalable, robust and smart
    applications. ChainIntel is currently working to allow distributed AI model execution,
    where some parts of a deep neural network run on local devices and other parts
    run on a set of active nodes in the ChainIntel P2P network [113]. This work aims
    to incorporate various AI features into decentralized applications such as facial
    recognition, speech and image recognition, semantic analysis, disparity identification,
    smart homes, smart cities and countless more domains. Decentralized networks such
    as Ethereum and IPFS can handle the huge computational resources and data storage
    respectively, thereby providing a high level of privacy and tamper-proof records
    [44], [113]. This open-source decentralized AI platform aims to phase out monopolization
    of AI services provided by big companies in which the miner-nodes should be optimized
    to solve a huge number of matrix computations and directs it to be effectively
    decentralized. The energy-based infrastructure can reap huge benediction by combining
    the AI and blockchain technologies and their features. Mylrea and Gourisetti [114]
    have explored how blockchain technology could possibly modernize and automate
    energy and IoT infrastructure toward a stable system. The author highlights how
    AI enabled blockchain solutions can assist in increasing cyber resilience and
    augmenting the exchange of energy resources in a distributed environment by using
    encryption techniques and by automating the transaction. Mylrea and Gourisetti
    [114] discuss how AI-enabled blockchain solutions can help to analyze huge datasets
    gathered from numerous platforms such as frequency and load changes, industrial
    control anomalies and frequency changes, and classify the datasets into weighted
    relationships, which can be tracked and automated with the help of blockchain
    technology. Artificial neural networks are being employed to analyze and understand
    the data patterns whereas blockchain based smart contracts can be exercised to
    secure the energy data and its transactions on the decentralized network. An overall
    vision for transforming the energy market and utility industries with blockchain,
    robotics, and AI techniques is presented in Figure 4. A key-less signature blockchain
    infrastructure (KSBI) is highlighted in this work, as KSBI differs from PoW and
    retains integrity of original data and its ability to scale to industrial applications
    to add one trillion data items to the blockchain each second, and to verify the
    data item from the blockchain within the next second [114]. Optimization and security
    issues in the energy grid can be resolved and improved by blockchain by providing
    a verifiable distributed ledger which helps in improving transparency and integrity
    in the energy delivery sector [114]. If implemented successfully, this approach
    can replace traditional energy meters with a dynamic and decentralized distributed
    ledger. This disruptive combination may endow stakeholders and investors in renewable
    energy infrastructure with the power to vote, efficiently automate the energy-bidding
    auction, and monitor and deliver services based on the agreements made on smart
    contracts in a transparent and distributed environment [114]. Yu et al. [115]
    designed a high-performance blockchain platform for smart devices. This platform
    enables a stable connection between devices through the node-to-node mapping mechanism
    using technologies such as distributed network architecture, intelligent devices
    node mapping, as well as PBFT-DPOC consensus algorithm. Yu et al. [115] propose
    a new Delegated Proof of Contribution (DPOC) algorithm to facilitate any node
    to run as a Block Producer (BP). In this method, all the candidates need to contribute
    their own hardware infrastructure which includes computing power, storage, and
    bandwidth, such that all nodes take part in the voting process. The final ranking
    is determined by votes and miner’s weight-sum seniority ranking. During this voting
    process, many super-nodes and substitute nodes are generated. The super-nodes
    reach consensus by generating blocks through the PBFT algorithm [115] and each
    block has the digital signature of remaining BP nodes. If a node is found to be
    dishonest or inactive in the network during the block verification process, it
    is blacklisted and replaced with a substitute node. This platform tested the transaction
    throughput and system delay of the intelligent device blockchain and compared
    it with the performance of public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum [115].
    The experimental results showed that the intelligent device blockchain has higher
    transaction throughput and lower transaction latency than that of Bitcoin and
    Ethereum and provided higher efficiency. FIGURE 4. Future energy industry leveraging
    capabilities of blockchain and AI. Show All C. Decentralized AI Applications Decentralized
    Intelligence and collective decision making can play the main role in identifying
    the malicious behavior of byzantine robots. Byzantine robots are those that exhibit
    malicious or faulty behavior arbitrarily in a swarm environment. Strobel et al.
    [46] propose a proof of concept for handling security issues in swarm robotic
    ecosystems using the blockchain technology. This approach utilizes the decentralized
    nature of smart contracts to build a secure swarm systematization mechanism to
    analyze and exclude the byzantine members from the swarm. This scheme was designed
    analogous to classical approaches and the behavior of robots is determined by
    a probabilistic finite state machine which consists of two phases i.e., exploration
    state and dissemination state [46]. Each robot in the swarm saves a copy of safety
    measurement on the blockchain for identifying byzantine robots. The blockchain
    based approach creates a number of voting transactions sent by the robots to their
    neighbors in the swarm and all these votes get stored in the blockchain. This
    approach proved that a blockchain based swarm ecosystem preserves the integrity
    of the transactions and provides a direct interface for securely storing the record
    of events in a decentralized log [46]. This approach also demonstrated that the
    transactions can be verified even if some of the swarm members are lost or leave
    the swarm. In the blockchain based network, keys that are publicly available are
    the foremost available information for an agent to transfer information in a secure
    manner [114]. With respect to swarm robots, a robot can send information to a
    specific robot and only a robot that possesses a matching private key will be
    able to read the message; hence, the possibility of a data breach can be prevented.
    Digital cryptography of the blockchain ensures that the robots are allowed to
    use their private keys for encrypting a message. The other robots can then decrypt
    the message by using the public key of the sender [114]. Digital signature cryptography
    can ensure the information origin authentication and entity authentication between
    different robots in a swarm and improve the security during information exchanges.
    An analysis of a decentralized intelligent transportation system with distributed
    intelligence based on classification techniques is discussed in [108]. Researchers
    conducted an exploratory study on a fully distributed architecture to enable cooperative
    sensing and management in an intelligent transportation system [108]. This proposed
    system envelops the process of capturing and managing the road data, thereby enabling
    services to improve the efficiency of transportation systems. The main contribution
    of this work comprises of two real-world scenarios related to the prediction of
    traffic data. The first one being able of detecting traffic congestions and the
    second one for predicting the pollution level using C4.5 classification technique.
    The AI techniques embedded within the decentralized system help to predict and
    respond to critical incidents and events that may occur in a dynamic transportation
    environment and provide a befitting solution in a timely manner [108]. The reference
    architecture of the proposed system makes use of a data distribution platform
    and collaborative learning nodes connected through gateways to different subsystems
    to analyze the best traffic routes and to deal with congestion problems. In this
    work, the prediction of traffic congestion and other anomalies are performed using
    C4.5 classification technique which is used to generate decision trees from a
    set of training data a framework named ’KEEL’ has been used for providing basic
    parametrization which is well known to handle continuous attribute value ranges,
    to prune the result decision trees, and to predict traffic congestion and pollution
    in a city. Osaba et al. [108] have performed the experiments based on real-world
    situations, with traffic congestion prediction in Lisbon, Portugal and the prediction
    of pollution in Pisa, Italy. A complete operation of this collaborative learning
    unit in a real scenario is showcased with a web application which was simulated
    in a laboratory. Intelligent Precision farming can utilize the emerging technologies
    and decentralized business models to tackle the challenges faced by the agricultural
    sector. The lack of food security has affected 925 million people worldwide, including
    42.2 million in the United States alone [116]. With the advent of applied science,
    IoT technology has gained acceptance across various industries. But due to the
    their constrained resources, underdeveloped standards, and absence of security
    in design and development of their software components, IoT devices remain insecure
    when connected in a distributed environment and abstain to provide a robust structure
    [117]. From an agricultural production perspective, IoT sensors, AI agents and
    blockchain technology can be conjointly implemented for crop/variety selection,
    irrigation method selection, reduce costs, predict yield, monitor crop health,
    improve yield, improve crop quality, predict input side demands and output aggregation
    needs leading to optimization of the supply chain and to enhance profits of all
    stakeholders involved in the agricultural production sector. IoT sensors can be
    installed in farming fields to capture data and send information in order to optimize
    production. These IoT sensors can monitor the nutrient levels in soil and the
    images captured by sensors can help in monitoring the growth of crops periodically
    [116]. AI agents, on the other hand, can augment IoT devices to improve the agro-supply
    chain process via predictive analytics, which helps farmers to grow crops according
    to historical weather patterns in any specific region and monitor the crop growth
    with real-time data. Figure 5 shows the benefits and features of combining AI,
    IoT and blockchain technologies. Blockchain ensures that everyone involved in
    the network has access to all transactions; hence, reducing the time spent on
    logistics of agricultural commodity trading and also reducing food safety contingency
    [116]. An intelligent data-driven decision can assist farmers and stakeholders
    in making optimum decisions for farming plans to be customized for each farmer
    based on weather, soil, pest, and crop data on a real-time basis. FIGURE 5. Intelligent
    precision farming with blockchain. Show All Another prominent field to benefit
    from bringing together blockchain technology and AI is the supply chain industry.
    When incorporated together, both these technologies have the potential to remodel
    the entire process into an ’autonomous’ supply chain system [118]. Blockchain
    based research for supply chain industry concentrated on proof of concept experimental
    systems employing a decentralized application platform [118]. Most of the work
    in the literature was based on post supply chain management for the detection
    of counterfeited products as well as for the proof of delivery of these products
    that may involve multiple transporters. Applying AI techniques to the blockchain-based
    business transaction flows can assist to refine the supply chain by automating
    the entire process [118]. AI platforms, when consolidated with blockchain, can
    capture data from point of sale systems, history of purchase information, identify
    data patterns and perform a predictive analysis which includes predicting future
    demand, predicting sales patterns, identifying potential issues in advance, optimizing
    routes to reach the destination, and handling network traffic. When unified with
    blockchain technology and modern cryptography, federated learning can be used
    to improve the privacy of users’ data by ensuring that data are never stored in
    the cloud [119]. Snips AIR is an AI-powered voice platform that takes advantage
    of blockchain technology to ensure that users’ data are safe. While existing AI-powered
    voice assistants are pragmatic, there is a potential risk of placing the user’s
    personal data at risk, as the conversations with the voice assistants are stored
    in the cloud. The technology behind Amazon Echo and Google Home is AI-powered
    and it stores the history of users’ commands and conversations to respond in a
    smarter way for future commands [119]. Snips AIR ensures that all the personal
    details of a user remain well within the walls of connected homes instead of storing
    it on the cloud and that no one has the access to user’s data. The environs of
    Snips incentivizes the users using tokens to store their encrypted data to its
    blockchain based system [119]. Further, the data are aggregated by application
    developers, as the AI training is done on the blockchain network following the
    concept of decentralized learning. Thereby, users need not have to reveal their
    personal data or trade-off their privacy. Snips AIR is aimed to be delivered by
    2019 for consumers and it can be an alternative to Siri, an intelligent assistant
    that offers an easier way to get things done on IOS applications and stores the
    conversation data on the cloud [119] and assures that users’ data are never at
    risk. Robotic agents triggered by AI algorithms have been widely used to explore
    the deep seabed to find mineral resources, archeological findings or to access
    the underwater treasures in order to claim ownership or discovery rights by individuals
    or organizations. These algorithms and techniques assist the swarm to identify
    obstacles, gather and analyze information on ocean currents, and traverse via
    the most efficient path to reach the goal thereby saving energy. Ferrer [44] and
    Brambilla et al. [45] outline the nature of swarm robots to purview the objective
    and to record the key information about the discovery such as the location of
    the discovered object, time, date, etc. However, the swarm may not always be monitored.
    Any malicious attacker may gain access to freely observe and tamper with the emergent
    behavior of the swarm, as the swarm ecosystem is designed to expedite autonomously
    [120]. However, when swarm agents are powered with blockchain, it can record the
    discovery documents mechanized with cryptographic techniques such as hashing and
    time-stamping. The documents’ hash can be included on the blockchain based smart
    contracts and the discovery report itself can be securely stored in a decentralized
    file system, such as the IPFS. Figure 6 shows how blockchain technology helps
    to secure the discovery report generated by ocean exploration robots on the IPFS
    and records its hash on the immutable smart contract. This hash will represent
    the exact content of the document and can be encoded into the decentralized network
    without the document’s content being exposed [35], [44]. The hash of the document
    provides a secure, immutable and time stamped function about the recordings of
    various events during the discovery process and when a specific attestation took
    place following the consensus received from all active participants during a transaction
    in a particular time period. Proof of existence and Proof of discovery can be
    fortified by re-computing the hash and by comparing it with the original document
    hash stored in the blockchain based smart contract. This technique can be further
    explored to be implemented in various applications such as landmine detection,
    disaster relief missions, and military rescue operations which have precarious
    challenges for humans to work. FIGURE 6. Blockhain-based unmanned intelligent
    ocean bed exploration. Show All Unsupervised machine learning algorithms and techniques
    have been extensively used for medical image analysis to achieve a high level
    of accuracy [121]. This approach is proved to improve detection of nodules, classification,
    and sizing, while also reducing false-positive rates in abnormality detection
    [122]. However, cross-institutional sharing of sensitive medical data and records
    becomes a complex pursuit with the potential to improve the techniques for clinical
    effectiveness and patient’s privacy [43], [123]. In a patient-clinic ecosystem,
    there is a primary need for developing a robust system where data owners share
    their information in a secure environment and trust the decisions deduced by the
    AI agents. With the expeditious advancement in computational power and machine
    learning algorithms, blockchain technology can help facilitate a mechanism to
    compensate an AI service provider for the development and execution of novel machine
    learning algorithms [122]. Machine learning algorithms consume a considerable
    amount of time to diagnose a particular health condition by speculating on a radiology
    image or CT scan for instance. Peterson et al. [122] recommend that, by utilizing
    blockchain technology, the AI service provider can publish the diagnostic report
    images containing information about a single diagnostic service performed for
    a patient on the blockchain. Further, the AI service provider who develops the
    machine learning algorithms can be allowed to execute their algorithms over the
    images and publish the AI diagnosis output on the blockchain. By doing so, the
    radiologists at the clinic could compare his or her diagnoses with the result
    published on the blockchain [122]. The AI service providers can be incentivized
    only when the diagnosis results match with that of the diagnosis of the radiologists.
    As the service providers are incentivized for every accurate diagnosis, they are
    bound to improve the definiteness of their machine learning algorithms. Thereby,
    blockchain implements an invincible record of the complete diagnosis reports of
    both AI service providers and hospitals. AI techniques and deep learning algorithms
    extract high-level, complex abstractions as data representations through a hierarchical
    learning process [124], uses data sciences and analytics which can be used to
    deduce the next course of actions of the treatment by evaluating outcomes and
    blockchain can hold the record to improve healthcare services. Recently, the banking
    industry has started investing in a wide range set of projects and start-ups providing
    blockchain based solutions as this technology provides a high level of safety
    for storing and transmitting data, distributed and transparent network infrastructure,
    decentralization and low cost of operations [125]. Banks have increased conducting
    tests of decentralized asset technology and implementing blockchain in the business
    process. As blockchain itself holds an immutable ledger that records all transactions
    in the chain, if a large number of transactions are being processed by the network,
    a huge volume of data gets collected and AI techniques can be used to process
    and classify the data. Telcoin [125] is a new cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum
    blockchain which will be distributed and accepted by telecom operators, enabling
    financial payments, remittances, credit, and various financial services on the
    blockchain. Telcoin suggests that the combined features of blockchain and machine
    learning can contribute to various applications like anticipating money laundering
    as AI is better in pattern classification and detection of irregularities in large
    amounts of data can be handled with blockchain technology. Figure 7 presents a
    model of AI and blockchain technology that can be used in the banking and finance
    institutions. Another remarkable outcome of combining both technologies is the
    handling of a fluctuating range of cryptocurrencies where AI techniques can help
    reduce the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies [125]. Xiong et al. [126] developed
    a neural network model that harnesses the potential of deep learning financial
    time series in the presence of strong noise which proved that, with huge volumes
    of datasets, AI techniques perform better than other traditional models. Machine
    learning techniques can analyze the price and details of various stock exchanges
    and predict the future forecasts accurately and decentralized contracts can be
    used to freeze the price of currency for a fixed amount of time [125]. FIGURE
    7. Combining AI and blockchain for banking and finance. Show All The property
    Management Sector has begun to explore and apprehend the collective potential
    of blockchain and AI [127]. These technologies can create boundaries by breaking
    the monopolistic power of firms and hotels using blockchain. Problems faced by
    the property management sector such as inventory management can be managed by
    blockchain and details on bed stock and hotel capacity can be managed by learning
    techniques of AI. The Dutch land registry department is considering to consolidate
    AI and blockchain technology into the real estate industry [128]. The land registry
    department envisions that these new technologies when allied can improve the legal
    dependence and patronage of business to create a stable process. The Dutch government
    has already been involved in utilizing the revolutionary benefits of blockchain
    in various fields such as financing, supply chain, and logistics industry [129].
    This organization now aims to implement the inherent benefits of combining both
    technologies where implementation of AI is aimed to constitute self-learning systems
    which can predict the outcome whilst blockchain technology can be used for handling
    and managing huge volumes of data resources saved and produced by the land registry
    department [128]. Another remarkable pursuit in the property sector is the acceptance
    of these technologies by the government of Singapore in a program called ’Smart
    Nation,’ which attempts to diminish the paramountcy of sellers over investors
    and buyers [129]. This is an $73 million worth project that endows the private
    sectors to test all their new innovations and solutions which includes technology
    and building management in the real estate sector. With big data, property investors
    and developers can predict the trends of real estate and merchandise movements.
    AI techniques can be used for comparative market analysis which helps users to
    get a thorough knowledge of the investment and blockchain technology-based smart
    contracts can help in minimizing the transmission process and improving the transparency
    of payments, thereby saving millions of dollars for investors [129]. To this point,
    we discussed early implementations of decentralized AI applications in various
    sectors. However, persistent efforts are still needed in order to fully enable
    decentralized AI. Considering the limitations in current implementations and our
    vision of enabling fully decentralized AI applications and systems, in the next
    section we discuss the major open research challenges in this important research
    area. SECTION V. Open Research Challenges In this section, we discuss and highlight
    to-date challenges for combining AI and blockchain technologies. Some of the foreseeable
    challenges related to the unification and integration of both technologies are
    listed below: Privacy. Public blockchain ledgers enable secure and authentic data
    processing, however, collected data are publically accessible and available for
    all readers. This can be a point of privacy evasion and concern. In addition,
    pervasive sensing systems in IoT continuously collect consumers’ personal and
    sensitive data and putting this data on open ledgers could lead towards privacy
    issues. Using private blockchain ledgers, the data privacy could be ensured by
    enabling encryption and allowing controlled access of the ledgers. However, such
    private blockchain platforms will limit the access and exposure of the large amount
    of data that can be necessary for AI to process and preform accurate and correct
    decision making and analytics. Scalability and Side Chains. Scalability is one
    of the major concerns for today’s blockchain platform. For cryptocurrency blockchain
    platforms, bitcoin blockchain can perform an average of 4 transactions per seconds,
    while Ethereum can perform an average of 12 transactions per second. Such performance
    is really unacceptable when compared with Facebook which handles millions of transactions
    every second including likes, posts, and comments. Side chains (known also as
    side channels) are used to accelerate the performance of blockchains, in which
    transactions are settled between parties in a quick manner outside the main chain,
    and settled only once per day on the main chain [91]. Many new emerging types
    of blockchains improve significantly the consensus algorithms of mining nodes.
    For example, platforms like Algorand and IoTA can provide substantially better
    performance than that of Ethereum and Hyperledger blockchains [130], [131]. However,
    more work is still needed to improve the scalability to be comparable to that
    of Facebook and its likes. Blockchain Security. The decentralized power found
    in blockchain can suffer from abuses and misuses. Though blockchain provides robust
    schemes for securing IoT and predictive analysis, the blockchain systems are vulnerable
    to cyber-attacks as that of 51% attack [26]. The consensus mechanism depending
    upon the hashing power of the miner can be compromised, in which the decentralized
    platform becomes centralized around a few mining farms that control consensus
    and settlement finality. This security problem is more evident in public blockchains
    such as Ethereum and bitcoin. Private blockchain platforms suffer less from this
    problem, as consensus protocols are predefined among parties. Furthermore, the
    execution environment of the mining nodes is not protected, especially for private
    blockchain platforms with a few mining nodes as that of Hyperledger, in which
    the execution outcomes can be tampered with. To remedy this problem, newly emerging
    blockchain platforms are equipped with hardware to offer execution in a Trusted
    Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX [132]. Smart Contracts Vulnerabilities
    and Deterministic Execution. It is crucial to ensure that the implementation of
    a smart contract is free of bugs and vulnerabilities and secure against attacks.
    It is important to safeguard the code and the information on the network, as they
    may be vulnerable to attacks. For example, the smart contract for the DAO which
    was built on the Ethereum platform had serious code vulnerability and was hacked
    in 2016. This resulted in a loss of 3.6 million Ethers. There is a definite need
    for blockchain engineering, addressing this issue posed by smart contract programming
    and other applications running on blockchain [133]. The vulnerability issues are
    due to poor and negligent programming practices in the languages used to write
    the smart contracts code (as that of Solidity and Chaincode). Testing smart contracts
    for vulnerabilities has become of a critical importance, and some tools have been
    developed to assess the security state of a smart contract code [134]–[136]. Furthermore,
    as of today, the execution outcomes of smart contracts are all deterministic and
    cannot be probabilistic. This can pose a key challenge for decentralized AI in
    which AI and machine learning-based decision making algorithms get executed as
    smart contracts by the mining nodes, in which the execution outcome are not usually
    deterministic, but rather random, unpredictable and most often approximate. This
    entails a novel solution to deal with approximate computation and to devise consensus
    protocols for mining nodes for agreeing on results with a particular degree of
    certainty, accuracy, or precision, and with data input that might be highly fluctuating
    as that of IoT and sensory readings. Trusted Oracles Smart contracts are designed
    to be invoked by external events or outside functions invoked by blockchain participants.
    Smart contracts are not designed to automatically trigger events, or initiate
    retrieval of data on their own. In other words, the contracts cannot pull data
    from the outside world. Data and events have to be pushed to the contracts. To
    remedy such shortcomings, trusted oracles (which are basically trusted external
    parties or nodes) are being proposed as alternatives, and used to push events
    and data to the smart contracts. Oracles add a level of complexity and insecurity
    for ensuring and managing trust, in which a completely decentralized system becomes
    centralized around a group of oracles that must be trusted. Voting among trusted
    oracles is typically employed to reach consensus [137]. AI-specific Emerging Consensus
    Protocols. Existing consensus protocols considers network and middleware layers
    of blockchain systems by enabling different proof of X protocols (as discussed
    in section III-E). A large plethora of research opportunities are available for
    future researchers to explore if the application level consensus protocols could
    be designed considering proofs based on quality of learning models, efficient
    search strategies, quality and provenance of data, and quality of optimization.
    Fog Computing Paradigm. Fog computing is a newly emerging computing paradigm that
    allows for localized computing and storage close to the source of data being generated
    by customers or IoT devices. Fog nodes are typically used to augment the long
    delay incurred by computing and storage at the cloud environment. Fog nodes can
    be thought of as a local small-scale cloud. In the context of AI and blockchain,
    future fog nodes have to be equipped with AI and machine learning capabilities
    as well as enabled with blockchain interface, whereby localized management, access,
    and control of data are performed by the fog nodes. Lack of Standards, Interoperability,
    and Regulations. To date, blockchain technology standards are yet to be devised.
    Work is in progress by IEEE, NIST, ITU, and many standards bodies to put forward
    standards for blockchain interoperability, governance, integration, and architecture
    [138], [139]. Moreover, at local and global level, governmental and institutional
    guidelines, rules, laws, regulations, and policies need to put in place for blockchain
    deployment, arbitration, and dispute handling, in the context of AI applications
    and especially for public blockchain transactions involving financing and automated
    payments using cryptocurrencies. This entails research directed at devising models
    and proof of concepts that can play a key role in defining the right set of technical
    standards for blockchain architectural models, services, deployment and interoperability.
    Quantum Computing. It is envisaged that future quantum computing will have the
    ability to break public key encryption in which private keys can be determined.
    Current blockchain relies on digital signatures which use public key encryption.
    Many experts believe that quantum computing may render the underlying security
    of blockchain breakable by the year 2027 [140], [141]. This entails serious research
    on quantum-safe and secure blockchain that withstand such breakability, and still
    guarantees high performance and scalability. Also this entails sound migration
    plans and interoperability with quantum-resilient blockchain platforms. Governance.
    Deploying, constructing, and managing a blockchain platform among different participants
    and stakeholders is a tedious task. Even with a private of consortium blockchain,
    serious issues arise related to the type of blockchain to deploy (e.g., Hyperledger
    or Ethereum), who administers and troubleshoots the blockchain, the deployment
    location of the blockchain nodes, who writes the smart contracts, settlement of
    disputes, selection of trusted oracles, mechanisms for off-chain activities, deployment
    of side channels, regulations and standards to comply with, and many others. This
    entails research targeted at devising sound governance models. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    In this paper, we surveyed and reviewed the current state-of-the-art related to
    the use and applicability of blockchain features for AI. We gave an overview of
    blockchain and decentralized storage on how blockchain technology can enhance
    and solve key issues related to AI. Moreover, we presented a detailed taxonomic
    discussion and comparisons of common blockchain implementations in terms of decentralized
    AI operations, blockchain types and infrastructure, and consensus protocols. An
    extensive analysis of blockchain applications for intelligent multi-agent systems
    is reviewed with respect to decentralized data management and infrastructure for
    AI. Various features of AI for blockchain applications are also summarized. Our
    literature review shows that adopting blockchain for AI applications is still
    in its infancy, and there exists many research challenges to be addressed and
    tackled in areas related to privacy, smart contract security, trusted oracles,
    scalability, consensus protocols, standardization, interoperability, quantum computing
    resiliency, and governance. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    \ has opened productive ways to cultivate soil with the use\nof low-cost hardware\

    \ farmers are\nagriculture experts but, usually, do not have experience in IoT\

    based on IoT paradigms deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain\
    \ knowledge and\nexperience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural\
    \ applications. Internet of things\nparadigms are used as resources to facilitate\
    \ the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules\nand smart processes\
    \ are implemented using a distributed model based on edge and fog computing\n\
    paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed using these technologies.\
    \ The aim is to help\nfarmers to develop smart systems both, in current and new\

    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\

    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\
    \ IoT protocols.\nLayer\nProtocols\nSession/Application\nMQTT, CoAP, AMQT, HTTP,\

    WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave, ZigBee, LoraWan, IEEE 802.15.4, LTE, ...\n\
    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\
    \ model based on design and integration of edge and fog communication levels.\n\
    Cloud services and machine learning processes are integrated using this method.\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\
    \ control processes.\nObject/Thing\nContext\nSensori\n(ID, time, date, location,\

    \ state)\n3.2. Integration: Architecture Development\nIn the previous phase objects\
    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\
    \ has algorithm\nthat analyse the data provided, looks for speciﬁc patterns, and\
    \ uses the results of this analysis\nto develop optimal parameters for creating\
    \ the model. The model is reﬁned as the number of\niterations and the richness\
    \ of the data increase.\n6.\nCommunicating test results in statistical terms.\
    \ Models based on machine learning algorithms\nwill produce approximations and\
    \ not exact results. Quality of results must be analysed in the\nsame context.\
    \ The testing community will need to determine the level of conﬁdence within a\n\
    certain range.\n7.\nModel evolution. Support to develop new AI services or modiﬁcations\
    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\
    \ control\nIn all of them, the services based on AI are not yet installed. In\
    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\
    \ that deploy the necessary hardware and software\nresources using the proposed\
    \ method Figure (Figure 7) shows agricultural subsystems and model\ndeployed on\
    \ distributed nodes.\nFigure 7. Greenhouse design. Fog and edge nodes relations\
    \ on agriculture subsystems.\nIntelligent irrigation control is installed in an\
    \ experimental greenhouse based on tomato\nhydroponic cultivation (Table 4). Following\
    \ the proposed method, the experimental phases are:\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ Communication and Context\nIrrigation process, soil parameters, environmental\
    \ conditions inside and outside the greenhouse\nand energy consumption deﬁne objects\
    \ and context. Sensors, actuators and processes and their\nrelationship (context)\
    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\
    \ for\neach object/thing, where GH1 is the location ID of greenhouse.\nAll objects\
    \ are interoperable using MQTT protocol. Publisher and subscriber communication\n\
    model that implement this protocol allows interconnect all devices and things.\
    \ Broker device are\ninstalled on fog node. Publishers and subscribers are implemented\
    \ on different nodes.\n4.3. Hardware Devices and Software Modules\nTwo edge nodes\
    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\
    \ expert users\ndesigns basic control algorithms. After learning and training\
    \ process, these algorithms will be adjusted\nand modiﬁed following the results\
    \ of the expert system (machine learning). The aim is to optimize\nresources (water,\
    \ energy) without losing productivity. Two main control processes are executed\
    \ in\ntwo edge nodes and one machine learning process is implemented in a fog\
    \ node. Table 5 shows these\nprocesses and their relationship. Algorithms are\
    \ implemented in Python and developed using open\nsource criteria. Minimal hardware\
    \ embedded devices requirements are shown in Table 6.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ and Testing\nIn facilities already automated, edge nodes are interleaved between\
    \ the installed controllers\nand actual sensors and actuators. Some new sensors\
    \ are installed to complete services designed\n(energy meter). In current facilities\
    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\
    5.\nInfer future irrigation decisions using the information and modelling tools.\

    \ IoT technology:\nAzure [45], Ubidots [46], Thingspeak [47], are some examples\
    \ of companies that provide IoT\nservices. These platforms are built with similar\
    \ architectures and provide, usually, the same resources:\nApplication Programming\
    \ Interface (API) communication between clients and IoT server.\nAll these platforms\
    \ provide dashboard designs to monitor data using HMI formats pre-built.\nUsing\
    \ API services, processes in fog node are implemented to send new data to each\
    \ dashboard.\nThe API Documentation speciﬁes the structure of the data that is\
    \ exchanged between your devices and\nthe Ubidots and Mobile-Alerts Cloud, along\
    \ with code examples and libraries to speed up the project.\nFigure 12 shows a\
    \ dashboard (interface HMI) designed by users on Ubidots cloud platform. The system\n\
    can use standard protocols in the different layers and platforms that implement\
    \ these protocols.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n18 of 21\nFigure 12. Dashboards designed\
    \ for irrigation programming and monitoring.\n5. Conclusions and Future Work\n\
    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\
    \ allow to optimize and improve the results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.J.F.-P.\
    \ and J.M.G.-C. performed the analysis. Model design was proposed by F.J.F.-P.\
    \ and\nM.N.-H. Experimental work on IoT was implemented by M.N.-H. and F.J.F.-P.,\
    \ experimental work on greenhouse\ncrop growing was developed by J.M.-M.\nFunding:\

    With the deep combination of both modern information technology and traditional
    agriculture, the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture,
    has come. Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and
    automation. However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development
    of agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three
    typical development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility
    agriculture, and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and
    11 key applications are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies
    and applications, 6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access
    control, privacy-preserving, blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography
    and key management, physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems)
    are summarized and discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture
    are analyzed and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2)
    information technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural
    equipment as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments
    based on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate
    that agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more
    technologies (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable
    energy management system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented
    reality, and cyber security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the
    future research directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry
    in the world, and it plays an important role in social stability and economic
    development [1]. Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion
    and the limited grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number
    of studies on smart agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both
    the improvement in productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress
    of science and technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is
    used to help readers understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture
    development (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). • Agriculture 1.0: the
    traditional agricultural era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human
    and animal resources, the main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of
    operation. • Agriculture 2.0: the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century),
    the main issue was the inefficient use of resources. • Agriculture 3.0: the era
    of high-speed development of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the
    main issue was the low level of intelligence. • Agriculture 4.0: the era of smart
    agriculture (which is characterized by unmanned operations, begin at 2017) is

    \a\nAbstract: The growing need for food worldwide requires the development of\
    \ a high-performance,\nhigh-productivity, and sustainable agriculture, which implies\
    \ the introduction of new technologies\ninto monitoring activities related to\
    \ control and decision-making. In this regard, this paper presents\na hierarchical\
    \ structure based on the collaboration between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\n\
    and federated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for crop monitoring in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nThe integration of UAVs with intelligent, ground WSNs, and IoT\
    \ proved to be a robust and\neﬃcient solution for data collection, control, analysis,\
    \ and decisions in such specialized applications.\nKey advantages lay in online\
    \ data collection and relaying to a central monitoring point, while\neﬀectively\
    \ managing network load and latency through optimized UAV trajectories and in\
    \ situ\ndata processing. Two important aspects of the collaboration were considered:\
    \ designing the UAV\ntrajectories for eﬃcient data collection and implementing\
    \ eﬀective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate approximation)\
    \ at the network level for the transmission of the\nrelevant data. The experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where diﬀerent\ncrops and\
    \ methods are developed. The results demonstrate that the collaborative UAV–WSN–IoT\n\
    approach increases the performances in both precision agriculture and ecological\
    \ agriculture.\nKeywords: unmanned aerial vehicles; wireless sensor networks;\

    \ data consensus; Internet of Things; precision agriculture\n1. Introduction\n\
    The need for high-performance, high-productivity, and sustainable agriculture\
    \ results from the\nrapid growth of the human population. This requires permanent\
    \ monitoring and intelligent processing\nof the measured data collected from the\
    \ ﬁeld, correlated with the weather forecasts, to produce\nagronomic recommendations.\
    \ In the last few years, new technologies in agriculture, and especially in\n\
    precision agriculture (PA), have been leveraged for increased productivity and\
    \ eﬃcient input dosage [1].\nMost importantly, in PA, farmers need to know exact\
    \ and timely details about crop status. These details\nabout certain parameters,\
    \ obtained by measurements both from the ground and in the air, constitute\ninput\
    \ data to specialized systems of process management in the PA. Some relevant examples\
    \ might\ninclude for example, irrigation control, pesticide dosage, pest control,\
    \ etc. For acquisition and complex\nprocessing of the collected data, integration\
    \ of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) under\
    \ novel frameworks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), has been shown to\n\
    contribute to increases in agricultural yields [2]. Such advanced systems are\
    \ modeled as well-speciﬁed\nSensors 2020, 20, 817; doi:10.3390/s20030817\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 817\n2 of 25\nagent-based solutions with sensors and UAVs. Although\
    \ the contributions of UAVs and WSNs, taken\nseparately, are well documented and\
    \ important in the sustainable growth of agricultural production,\nthe integration\
    \ of these components together within an IoT framework is expected to signiﬁcantly\n\
    improve the solutions for monitoring, production modeling, prediction, and decision-making.\n\
    Relevant applications of UAV–WSN systems are presented in Reference [3–6]. In\
    \ viticulture,\nas a special type of PA, the soil and air parameters modify grape\
    \ yield and quality. For this purpose,\na solution based on the collaborative\
    \ system mini UAV (quadrotor type)–WSNs to monitor parameters,\nlike temperature\
    \ and humidity, to prevent the frost in fragmented vineyards is proposed in Reference\
    \ [3].\nThe UAV is considered as communication relay between sensors and a base\
    \ station. A real application\nfor monitoring sensitive parameters in vineyards\
    \ with both agro-meteorological stations and UAV\nplatforms is presented in Reference\
    \ [4]. In order to obtain a precise monitoring of the speciﬁc indicators,\nthe\
    \ data from the ground are correlated with the data collected by a UAV platform\
    \ with 8 rotors\nprovided with a professional thermal camera. The study was conducted\
    \ over a period of two years.\nFor data acquisition on large areas, a ﬁxed wing\
    \ type UAV, used as data mule from the ground WSN,\nis proposed in Reference [5].\
    \ In addition, the UAV has attached an high deﬁnition (HD) camera for the\ndetection\
    \ of certain plant diseases. Experimentally, a small tank has been added to spray\
    \ diﬀerent\ninsecticides, fertilizers, herbicides, etc. Both UAV and WSN are low\
    \ cost and not robust for only\ndemonstration purposes. In addition, in Reference\
    \ [6], a low cost agro-meteorological monitoring\nsystem in a vineyard was designed\
    \ and developed. The optimal positioning of the sensors was made\nwith the help\
    \ of the multispectral image analysis, acquired by UAV.\nGiven recent evolutions\
    \ in UAV technologies, cost reduction, and new regulations of aviation\nauthorities\
    \ regarding the usage and deployment of such systems (e.g., European Aviation\
    \ Safety\nAgency (EASA) [7] and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [8]), such\
    \ aerial robotic platforms\nare increasingly used in agriculture for diﬀerent\
    \ tasks, the most important being crop monitoring [9].\nAccording to EASA, the\
    \ UAVs should be safely integrated into the existing aviation context in a\nproportionate\
    \ way [7]. For large scale applications, in which UAVs are ﬂying beyond line-of-sight,\n\
    compliance with strict regulatory frameworks is essential.\nAdoption of a UAV-based\
    \ solution for image acquisition in agriculture applications is more\ncost eﬀective\
    \ and ﬂexible in comparison with satellite or manned aircraft alternatives [10].\
    \ Both\nﬁxed- wing [11,12] and rotary-wing type [3,13] UAVs are frequently used\
    \ in various applications in\nagriculture, while accounting for the risk of crashes\
    \ [9] and potential damages. Equipped with speciﬁc\nsensors in modular payloads\
    \ [14], such as high resolution RGB [15], infrared, multispectral [16,17],\nthermal\
    \ cameras [18,19], and also LIDAR [10], UAVs are able to create precise maps of\
    \ crop state or\nevolution [17], health plant assessment [20], diseases [21],\
    \ soil characteristics, evaluate losses caused\nby ﬂoods [11], etc. In the crop\
    \ monitoring, the following characteristics are analyzed from UAV\nimages [9]:\
    \ the crop water stress, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the canopy and the air\
    \ temperature,\nthe photochemical reﬂectance index, and the vegetation indices.\n\
    Although UAVs with diﬀerent propulsion systems are now available, most applications\
    \ in PA\nuse UAVs driven by electric motors due to their compact size, reduced\
    \ maintenance and operational\ncosts and, not the least, their alignment with\
    \ the current regulatory context and tendencies towards the\nreduction of global\
    \ carbon emissions [22].\nThe small-scale data acquisition by the WSN helps farmers\
    \ to take actions like crop irrigation,\nfertilizer usages, deciding on the optimum\
    \ stages of sowing, and harvesting [23]. Moreover, WSNs\nemployed in PA lead to\
    \ large amounts of data. Thus, data collection by WSNs is an important\ncontribution\
    \ to the development of farm management information systems (FMIS) [24,25].\n\
    The WSN has multiple functions at the ﬁeld level: data acquisition of various\
    \ parameters\n(e.g., temperature in soil and air, humidity in soil and air, solar\
    \ radiance, soil nutrients, the presence of\npests and weeds, chlorophyll content\
    \ in plants, etc.), distributed processing of data by establishing\nconsensus—if\
    \ it is the case, establishing the relevant data and its storage, low level data\
    \ fusion, and\ndata transmission. New sensor node designs oﬀer reduced costs [26];\
    \ see, for example, the detailed list\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n3 of 25\nof sensors\
    \ used in PA given in Reference [10]. As in many other large-area monitoring applications,\n\
    for communication or local processing reasons, the sensors are grouped into sensor\
    \ networks, the\ncommunication being made by radio. A WSN network will include\
    \ measurement nodes (sensory\nnodes) and data collection, processing, and transmission\
    \ nodes (sink or cluster head).\nRegarding PA, there is no rigorous theory of\
    \ sensor placement because it depends on the\nparticularities of the soil and\
    \ the weather. Sensor groups need to comply broadly with the need for\nsensory\
    \ and communication coverage. In Reference [27], two examples of sensor location\
    \ topologies\nare given: grid and random. From the point of view of communication\
    \ with the sink node, the most\nused are the star and mesh topologies. The wireless\
    \ communication protocols used in WSN for PA are\nthe following [10]: 6LoWPAN,\
    \ ZigBee (both being the most suitable for the mesh topology), LoRaWAN,\nGSM,\
    \ BLE, and Wi-Fi.\nIn PA, WSNs are used, most often, for parameter monitoring,\
    \ but they can also be integrated into\ncontrol systems as sensors. Direct speciﬁc\
    \ applications of WSN in control systems for PA are the energy\neﬃcient automated\
    \ control of irrigation [28] and smart automated fertilization [29].\nThe performance\
    \ of the crop monitoring can be improved by UAV–WSN collaboration [30].\nThe collaborative\
    \ aspects in an integrated UAV (aerial agents)–WSN (ground agents) architecture\
    \ for\ndiﬀerent applications was recently presented in a review paper [22], where\
    \ the diﬀerent functional\ncomponents of the system and how they collaborate with\
    \ each other was highlighted. In Reference [31],\nthe authors presented an integrated\
    \ UAV–WSN–IoT system, named FarmBeats, which is an end-to-end\nplatform for data\
    \ collection from various sensors, cameras, and drones in agricultural applications.\n\
    An unlicensed TV White Spaces is used to setup a high bandwidth link from the\
    \ farmer’s home to an\nIoT ground station at a distance for collecting data from\
    \ UAVs and WSNs.\nIn order to interconnect the UAVs and terrestrial WSNs into\
    \ hybrid networks and, at the same\ntime, to ensure a safe airspace sharing with\
    \ aircrafts, multiple organizations are contributing [22]:\nInternational Civil\
    \ Aviation Organization, EASA, Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned\n\
    Systems, International Telecommunications Union, etc. Satellite connection is\
    \ required for two reasons.\nOne-way communication, such as obtaining the GPS\
    \ location of the UAVs or the sensory nodes (if any)\nis one reason. The second\
    \ reason is a possible data transmission or remote control (via two-way\nsatellite-intermediated\
    \ internet).\nIn Reference [32], the authors discuss the information system design\
    \ supporting agriculture\ndata management. Enabling advanced data processing in\
    \ the form of sensor fusion and clustering\nmechanisms for improved network topologies\
    \ in generic applications has been discussed [30]. Eﬀective\ndata gathering mechanisms\
    \ [33] and higher level IoT architectures [34] are key and current topics\nof\
    \ interest.\nWe believe that the challenges of UAV–WSN–IoT integrated systems\
    \ can come from several\ndirections: (a) precise localization of the ground sensors\
    \ with the aid of a preliminary ﬂight; (b) sensor\nstates periodically inspected\
    \ by UAV; (c) establishing of the WSNs as sensor clusters able to cover, both\n\
    from the sensorial and from the communication point of view the monitored area;\
    \ (d) establishing\nthe cluster heads (CH), named base stations, of the WSNs able\
    \ to communicate data to UAVs;\n(e) transmitting commands to change the strategy\
    \ and parameters of the sensor networks, (f) data\nacquisition from WSNs through\
    \ UAVs, (g) special trajectory planning and tracking, (h) the aggregation\nof\
    \ information collected by the UAV with the information collected by WSN for the\
    \ purpose of\nmeasuring and interpreting the parameters with increased accuracy,\
    \ (i) remote control via Internet,\nand (j) edge and cloud computing.\nIn a hierarchical\
    \ structure, the data processing architecture of the integrated system is based\
    \ on\nthree levels: consensus, edge computing [35], and cloud computing.\nFor\
    \ the main activity, the data collection from CH, UAV must have a predeﬁned trajectory,\
    \ properly\ndesigned, and accounting for the following limitations:\n•\nWaypoint\
    \ passing: a UAV has to pass above the CH to extract the relevant data from that\
    \ area\n(covered by the corresponding WSN sub-network);\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n\
    4 of 25\n•\nObstacle avoidance: UAVs avoid obstructions or prohibited areas along\
    \ the ﬂight plan;\n•\nGuaranteed communication: to ensure that the data has been\
    \ fully collected, enough time has to\nbe spent in the CH neighborhood;\n•\nEﬃciency:\
    \ reduce at a minimum the energy consumption for that trajectory (consider the\
    \ length\nof the trajectory and its complexity).\nThe integration of UAV–WSN based\
    \ systems for PA in IoT is a mandatory step to create an\nadvanced FMIS [25].\n\
    Due to the integration, the system can become “smart” by using elements of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence\nlike self-adaptation and decision, optimal trajectory, data transmission\
    \ of relevant parameter values,\nenergy eﬃciency, and neural networks for data\
    \ and image processing. Not in the least, the sensors must\nbe placed optimally,\
    \ considering the terrain characteristics. Battery life is an important design\
    \ point\nof the ground sensor algorithms by reducing to a minimum the number of\
    \ wireless communications\nneeded to transfer the information. The radio interface\
    \ is the critical factor in increasing battery life.\nBased on the frequency of\
    \ the data collection and radio transmissions the nodes can have a battery\nlifetime\
    \ ranging from several months up to one year. Therefore, the intelligent collaboration\
    \ between\nUAV and WSN can lead to optimization of parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption, sensing coverage,\nrisk, data acquisition, and processing time\
    \ [36]. To this end, bio-inspired optimization heuristics and\ngenetic algorithms\
    \ were applied to the aforementioned agents.\nThe optimal WSN coverage by the\
    \ aid of UAV platforms is implemented in Reference [37] as an\noptimization problem,\
    \ formulated by means of the travelling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the\n\
    best path of the UAV for data collection with minimum energy consumption.\nUsing\
    \ UAV as data mule for multi WSNs is an energy-eﬃcient method to increase the\
    \ networks’\nlife. To this end, the authors in Reference [38] apply the successive\
    \ convex optimization technique.\nThe proposed system presents the following integration\
    \ aspects:\n-\nGroup the sensors in clusters and determine the cluster heads,\
    \ the methodology proposed by the\nauthors in Reference [30];\n-\nPath planning\
    \ based on speciﬁc conditions for eﬃcient data collection; and\n-\nIntelligent\
    \ data collection and processing.\nThe main contributions consist in the following:\
    \ (i) implementation of a multilevel, collaborative\nUAV–WSN system structure\
    \ for agriculture applications, (ii) a speciﬁc path planning for ﬁxed\nwing–type\
    \ UAV with the purpose of robust and eﬃcient data collection, (iii) obtaining\
    \ relevant data\nfrom sensors for the purpose of saving energy, and (iv) edge–fog–cloud\
    \ computing algorithms for\nsubsequent data processing. Thus, the main challenge\
    \ is related to improving data extraction and\ncommunication in large scale heterogeneous\
    \ monitoring system. The key problem is focused on\nimproving the performance\
    \ of such systems through better algorithms and synchronization among the\ntwo\
    \ subsystems: the ground sensor network and the robotic aerial platforms, implemented\
    \ as UAVs,\nfor data collection and relaying.\nThe rest of the paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 describes the concept, the methodology,\nand key aspects\
    \ that have been addressed for the proper design and implementation of the system.\n\
    Section 3 presents the experimental results and performances after implementing\
    \ the system on an\nexperimental farm. Section 4 highlights the conclusions, as\
    \ well as future work.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Requirements for Integrated\
    \ UAV-WSN-IoT Systems\nFor the design of reliable and robust large-scale monitoring\
    \ system the requirements have to\nﬁrst be validated. The main challenges for\
    \ such collaborative systems were considered to be: sensing\ncoverage in accordance\
    \ to mission objectives, communication coverage by the hybrid UAV–WSN\nsystem\
    \ using various types of radio links, from low-power, low-data rate to high throughput\
    \ long\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n5 of 25\ndistance for streaming, energy eﬃciency,\
    \ and, not in the least, computing eﬃciency. The decentralized\narchitecture for\
    \ crop ﬁeld monitoring described in this paper is designed to overcome the challenges\n\
    mentioned above and to account for the data generation patterns at the ﬁeld level.\
    \ While the proposed\ndata fusion mechanisms and processing of centralized in-ﬁeld\
    \ data at CH level manage to reduce data\nvolume and ensure the ﬂow of information\
    \ up to the level of events, an additional intermediate level is\nappended to\
    \ the data stream, in order to reach the server. To this end, we consider both\
    \ mobile agents\n(UAV) and multiple ﬁxed agents (ground sensors (SNs)). The system\
    \ diagram is presented in Figure 1.\nThe mobile agent can perform the following\
    \ functions: data mulling, image acquisition, relay, and\nstate inspection of\
    \ WSNs. The ﬁxed agents acquire data from the ﬁeld (agricultural ﬁeld—soil and\
    \ air),\nprocess data locally (relevant data extraction, data consensus), and\
    \ ﬁnally transmit data to the UAV by\nmeans of CHs. The system is composed of\
    \ four main processing levels (Table 1): Sensor level, Fog\nComputing level, Internet/Cloud\
    \ Computing level, and Data Management and Interpretation level.\nThis is a multi-WSN–UAV\
    \ structure with higher level integration in internet-based systems for decision\n\
    support. The data from WSNs are collected by a UAV, transmitted at a ground control\
    \ station (GCS),\nand, from here via the internet, to the Data Interpretation\
    \ module. Analytics functionality ranges from\nbasic statistical indicators to\
    \ trend and event detectors and up to basic statistical learning models that\n\
    have the ability to anticipate evolutions in the monitored ground phenomena.\n\
    Another important requirement of the integrated system is the correlated or complementary\n\
    interpretation of the data from the sensory agents, either mobile or ﬁxed. For\
    \ example, when the soil\nmoisture is too high, the soil sensors show the maximum\
    \ value and cannot discern whether a ﬂood has\noccurred. This can be accurately\
    \ determined from aerial images taken by the UAV. In addition, the\ndegree of\
    \ humidity in plants and the degree of foliage development can be observed either\
    \ from the\nground or from the air (images), and a more precise determination\
    \ results from the fusion of the two\ndata sets.\nOther types of similar systems\
    \ were surveyed and can include the use of swarms of multi-copter\ntype UAVs,\
    \ which oﬀer better positioning accuracy for data collection while trading oﬀ\
    \ energy eﬃciency\nand autonomy. Ground sensor network implementation can also\
    \ be a diﬀerentiating factor with two\nmain approaches: random deployment of sensor\
    \ nodes in the area of interest, according to a minimum\nexpected sensing coverage\
    \ density, or deterministic, grid-like placement. Intermediate data processing\n\
    steps from the ﬁeld level to the decision level are commonly accepted as an important\
    \ mechanism to\nbalance network loads and improve communication latency.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n5 of 25 \n \nthe challenges mentioned above and\
    \ to account for the data generation patterns at the field level. \nWhile the\
    \ proposed data fusion mechanisms and processing of centralized in-field data\
    \ at CH level \nmanage to reduce data volume and ensure the flow of information\
    \ up to the level of events, an \nadditional intermediate level is appended to\
    \ the data stream, in order to reach the server. To this end, \nwe consider both\
    \ mobile agents (UAV) and multiple fixed agents (ground sensors (SNs)). The system\
    \ \ndiagram is presented in Figure 1. The mobile agent can perform the following\
    \ functions: data mulling, \nimage acquisition, relay, and state inspection of\
    \ WSNs. The fixed agents acquire data from the field \n(agricultural field—soil\
    \ and air), process data locally (relevant data extraction, data consensus), and\
    \ \nfinally transmit data to the UAV by means of CHs. The system is composed of\
    \ four main processing \nlevels (Table 1): Sensor level, Fog Computing level,\
    \ Internet/Cloud Computing level, and Data \nManagement and Interpretation level.\
    \ This is a multi-WSN–UAV structure with higher level \nintegration in internet-based\
    \ systems for decision support. The data from WSNs are collected by a \nUAV, transmitted\
    \ at a ground control station (GCS), and, from here via the internet, to the Data\
    \ \nInterpretation module. Analytics functionality ranges from basic statistical\
    \ indicators to trend and \nevent detectors and up to basic statistical learning\
    \ models that have the ability to anticipate \nevolutions in the monitored ground\
    \ phenomena. \nAnother important requirement of the integrated system is the correlated\
    \ or complementary \ninterpretation of the data from the sensory agents, either\
    \ mobile or fixed. For example, when the soil \nmoisture is too high, the soil\
    \ sensors show the maximum value and cannot discern whether a flood \nhas occurred.\
    \ This can be accurately determined from aerial images taken by the UAV. In addition,\
    \ \nthe degree of humidity in plants and the degree of foliage development can\
    \ be observed either from \nthe ground or from the air (images), and a more precise\
    \ determination results from the fusion of the \ntwo data sets. \nOther types\
    \ of similar systems were surveyed and can include the use of swarms of multi-copter\
    \ \ntype UAVs, which offer better positioning accuracy for data collection while\
    \ trading off energy \nefficiency and autonomy. Ground sensor network implementation\
    \ can also be a differentiating factor \nwith two main approaches: random deployment\
    \ of sensor nodes in the area of interest, according to \na minimum expected sensing\

    \ must be considered. The ﬁrst is the trajectory planning\nfor collecting data\
    \ from sensors (CHs), and it must take into account certain requirements, such\
    \ as\nthe complete and safe acquisition of data, on one hand, and minimize energy\
    \ and time consumption,\non the other hand [39].\nUnder certain reasonable assumptions\
    \ (known environment, known limitations), the UAV tasks\nreduce to computing a\
    \ trajectory which respects constraints and minimizes a cost (length, total energy\n\
    consumption, etc.), while simultaneously respecting various constraints (internal\
    \ dynamics, stall\nvelocity constraints or exogenous ones, those imposed by the\
    \ environment, such as obstacle avoidance\nand waypoint passing through).\nThe\
    \ particularity lies in the fact that many of the UAV-speciﬁc constraints are\
    \ non-convex [40],\ne.g., the variable of interest z (depending of time t) has\
    \ to stay outside some bound (e.g., outside of\nan interdicted region and/or maintain\
    \ a minimal velocity). If z(t) is the UAV position, the velocity\nrestrictions\
    \ are usually written as follows:\nv ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\n.z(t)\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\
    \ ≤ v.\n(1)\nBoth bounds (lower—v and upper—v) may depend on a variety of factors.\
    \ Hard constraints are\nimposed by the UAV physics: upper bound given by the engine\
    \ characteristics and lower bound by\nthe requirement to avoid stall. Note that\
    \ this work neglects the inﬂuence of wind: velocity is usually\nmeasured against\
    \ the ground (e.g., through a GPS), but, in fact, the UAV “feels” the addition\
    \ of its own\nand of the wind velocities. This may lead to an unexpected stall\
    \ or, at least, improper behavior. Usual\ntechniques are to provide more conservative\
    \ bounds in Equation (1) and to restrict the ﬂight to normal\nweather conditions.\n\
    Waypoints are introduced, in a practical mission, because data has to be gathered\
    \ from a cluster\nnode. Thus, the question of minimum communication time arises\
    \ [41]: It is necessary to remain in a\nspeciﬁc neighborhood for a deﬁned time\
    \ interval ∆ti. To correctly describe such a constraint, we require\na tuple (ωi,\
    \ ∆ti, ri , Ri), where ωi is the corresponding cluster node position (the center\
    \ of the circle in\nFigure 2), and ri and Ri are, respectively, the minimum and\
    \ the maximum radius of the permitted\ncommunication area. Because there are perturbations\
    \ due to trajectory control errors or other causes,\nthe real trajectory is included\
    \ in a ﬂight lane (Figure 2a). The ﬂight lane was experimentally established\n\
    at 30 m, under reasonable assumptions about wind speed. The trajectory z(t) has\
    \ to stay near the\nwaypoint for a least amount of time ∆ti determined by the\
    \ quantity of data which has to be transferred:\nri ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\fωi − z(t)\n\
    \f\f\f\n\f\f\f ≤ Ri, t ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti].\n(2)\ncondition (2) is often impractical\
    \ to check due to the continuous nature of z(t) and because of the\nvarying time\
    \ interval [ti, ti + ∆ti]. The usual approach is to sample the constraint and\
    \ to estimate the\npath length by assuming the bounds (1) on the velocity. To\
    \ this end, we consider:\n\f\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\fz\n\x10\nti\n\x11\n− ωi\n\f\f\f\f\n\
    \f\f\f\f = ri,\n(3)\nwith ti given such that ti ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti]) holds; it is\

    is known to be larger than ∆ti and a “tangential” pass (like the one enforced\

    \ mode to increase arbitrarily the data-gathering\ntime [42]. Making the reasonable\
    \ assumption that the loitering rl\ni radius respects the condition\nri < rl\n\
    i < Ri, means that the UAV can orbit the waypoint ωi for an indeﬁnite period of\
    \ time [43]. From\nthe viewpoint of trajectory generation, the only relevant question\
    \ remains the places at which the\nUAV inserts/dislodges onto/from the loitering\

    \ waypoint with respect to the previous and next waypoints in the sequence\n(such\
    \ as to reduce unnecessary inﬂexions in the trajectory). The switch between normal\
    \ and loitering\nmodes will be done at pre-determined points: the trajectory enters\
    \ loitering mode at a point ω−\ni and\ndislodges from it at a point ω+\ni (which\
    \ lie on the loitering circle and are from/towards the direction\nof the previous/next\

    \ of the algorithm are:\n▶\nThe UAV has two modes of functioning, loiter mode\
    \ and segment tracking mode, which are\ndecided by the supervisor (in the sense\
    \ that within the collection of waypoints a priori computed,\nsome of them are\
    \ labeled as loiter points).\n▶\nIn both cases, the algorithm provides a heading\
    \ which is the reference to be tracked by the\nUAV. This is in line with standard\
    \ practices, where the heading is decided through some design\nprocedure and the\
    \ velocity and pitch and roll angles are decided at the auto-pilot level (usually\n\
    the velocity is maintained constant and the roll and pitch are taken as needed\
    \ between admissible\nbounds).\n▶\nThe decisions taken by the algorithm and supervisor\
    \ are, ultimately, related to the distance\nbetween the current position and some\
    \ point of interest. To do so, we consider some circles of\ninterest, deﬁned as\
    \ follows:\n#\nCommunication circle: the UAV communicates with the ground-based\
    \ cluster head only\nwhen it is within the communication radius.\n#\nWaypoint\
    \ update circle: it is impractical to assume that the UAV passes through the exact\n\
    coordinates of the current waypoint. Thus, we update the active segment (by advancing\n\
    through the list of waypoints) whenever we are close enough to the end-point of\
    \ the\ncurrent segment.\n#\nLoitering circle: whenever the UAV is required to\
    \ spend a signiﬁcant time in communication\nwith the current cluster head, the\
    \ decision to start loitering is taken. The loitering radius is\nrestricted to\
    \ be less than the communication radius and larger than the physical limitations\n\
    imposed by the roll angle bounds (a tighter circle means a larger roll angle).\n\
    #\nProximity circle: the procedure employed in the algorithm takes (whenever there\
    \ is\nintersection between the circle and the current segment) the heading angle\
    \ in the direction\nof the intersection point (the one closest to the end-point\
    \ of the segment).\n▶\nWhen the last waypoint is covered, the UAV returns to base\
    \ (by default, we consider this to be\nthe initial point on the trajectory).\n\
    Without being exhaustive, some of the most relevant updates in the algorithm are:\n\
    In segment tracking mode:\n1.\nAt the current time, we consider the UAV position\
    \ (x,y), the segment determined by the current\n(CP) and next waypoint (CP + 1):\n\
    \x10\nwi\nx, wi\ny\n\x11\n,\n\x10\nwi+1\nx\n, wi+1\ny\n\x11\n.\n2.\nWe compute\
    \ the projection of the current point onto the current segment (PP). We identify\
    \ three\npossible cases by checking the relative position of the projection wrt\
    \ the segment’s end points\n(described by W): inside the segment (0 ≤ W ≤ 1)),\
    \ outside and located before the initial segment\nend (W < 0); outside and located\
    \ after the initial segment end (W > 1);\n3.\nWe compute the distance (D) from\
    \ the current point to the segment and the circle of radius L\n(proportional with\
    \ the UAV velocity) and further used to compute the heading vector.\n4.\nWe consider\
    \ the following cases:\ni.\nThe UAV is too far away, and the projection point\
    \ lies before the segment start point. Then,\nthe heading angle points towards\
    \ the projection point.\nii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and the projection\
    \ point lies before the segment start point.\nThen, the heading angle points towards\
    \ the start point.\niii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close to the segment end point,\
    \ or its projection onto the segment\nlies after the end point. Then, the current\
    \ segment is updated, and the procedure jumps to\nstep 4i.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 817\n10 of 25\niv.\nThe UAV is too far away, and its projection lies onto the\
    \ interior of the segment. Then,\nthe heading vector points towards the projection.\n\
    v.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and its projection lies onto the interior of\
    \ the segment.\nThe heading angle is taken as the vector of length L in which\
    \ the tip lies on the segment\n(there are two possible tips; the one closer to\
    \ the segment end point is considered).\n5.\nGo to step 1.\nIn the loitering mode:\n\
    1.\nSelect the loitering center as the current waypoint.\n2.\nConstruct the circle\
    \ of radius L and centered in the current position of the UAV.\n3.\nIf the circle\
    \ does not intersect the loitering circle, move towards the projection point situated\
    \ on\nthe loitering circle.\n4.\nIf the proximity circle intersects the loitering\
    \ circle, take the heading vector along the tangent at\nthe intersection point\
    \ between loitering circle and proximity circle (there are two solutions, we\n\
    selected depending on the desired loitering rotation—clockwise or counterclockwise).\n\
    Note that all steps where a decision regarding the trajectory update is taken\
    \ consist in fact in a\ndecision about the UAV’s heading. Thus, for trajectory\
    \ tracking, only the heading angle is used as\ncontrol input. This suﬃces for\
    \ relatively simple trajectories and is robust against wind disturbances\n(as\
    \ later shown in the simulations).\n2.3. Relevant Data Extraction\nThe collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level, cluster head level,\
    \ UAV level\nup to the cloud. Alongside these steps, information is gradually\
    \ extracted through various methods\nthat enable local decisions based on the\
    \ conﬁguration of the system (thresholding, consensus, symbolic\naggregate approximation,\
    \ etc.).\nIn-ﬁeld data processing is ensured both at local level (independent\
    \ data ﬁltering) and decentralized\nat network level (through data exchange between\
    \ neighbor sensory nodes). The proposed data\nprocessing mechanisms, tailored\
    \ for in-ﬁeld level, are designed in order to ensure a substantial\nweighted average.\
    \ This step is found as ‘Enable consensus dialog’. Once the convergence is reached,\n\
    each node performs a routine for results analysis basically seeking to discover\
    \ and mark nodes with\ndivergent values. This information remains available alongside\
    \ the consensus value so that it can be\ninterrogated by the higher level of data\
    \ processing if needed. This is found in Figure 4 as ‘Analyze\nresults step’.\n\
    Aggregated data sets are achieved through diﬀerent methods. All seek for relevant\
    \ data points,\naiming to a reduced size set and providing at the same time a\
    \ satisfying reconstruction of the initial\ndata. The proposed method for data\
    \ aggregation is based on the minimum and maximum values\nextraction, computed\
    \ as global extremes for a predeﬁned period of time (e.g., a day). It is obvious\
    \ that\nthis method is suitable only for measurements that have a periodic behavior,\
    \ with smooth variations\nduring the day. A measurement for which this method\
    \ is suitable is the soil temperature. Conversely,\nchange detection is commonly\
    \ used for irregularly-shaped data sets. This method follows extraction of\nlocal\
    \ extreme points where trend changes occur.\nGiven a set of data points (xi, yi),\
    \ i = 1, . . . , n, trend ti is computed for each sequence\nmeasurements such\
    \ that for a measure m, (5),(6),(7) has to be true. If ti , ti+1, then it means\
    \ that a trend\nchange has occurred, and the data point (xi, yi) is added to the\
    \ relevant data set.\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni > δm ⇒ tm\ni = 1,\n(5)\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni\

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ interact directly with the physical world to form the “object end” of IoT \n\
    (also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that provides computing,\
    \ storage and \nother resources performs fusion processing and intelligent analysis\
    \ of the sensing data from the \nobject end and performs execution control to\
    \ constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back \nend”) of IoT. The communication\
    \ infrastructure of the connection object end and the cloud end \nconstitutes\
    \ the “network end” of IoT. According to the different functions implemented by\
    \ physical \nentity services in the IoT, IoT architecture established by the current\
    \ service-oriented approach can \nbe divided into the following two categories:\
    \ cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT \narchitecture. In the\
    \ cloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ \nbasic physical information collection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information \nto the cloud, but does not provide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational \nprocessing and knowledge mining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of \ntheir typical representatives\
    \ is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the \nuID\
    \ center of the nonprofit standardization organization initiated by the university\
    \ of Tokyo, Japan. \nAs shown in Figure 1, its architecture consisted of ucode\
    \ tags such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR \nbeacons, user terminals, a ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For \nsoftware developers,\
    \ the main challenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud\
    \ \nservice platform that supports massive item information management and data\
    \ processing. The \ncloud platforms that have been established so far mainly include\
    \ Xively and Aneka [17]. \n \nFigure 1. uID IoT architecture [16]. \nIn recent\
    \ years, under the impetus of organizations such as Internet Protocol for Smart\
    \ Objects \n(IPSO) Alliance, resource-constrained intelligent goods and sensing\
    \ nodes can access the internet \nthrough the IP protocol and become devices that\
    \ can be directly addressed in the network space \n[18]. Based on the service-oriented\
    \ design method, researchers have proposed a variety of software \narchitecture\
    \ reference models for building IoT systems. M2M was a standard IoT architecture\
    \ being \ndeveloped by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)\

    \ non-intelligent terminal devices to \ncommunicate with other intelligent terminal\

    \ of protected agriculture and the experience of other scholars, we \nproposed\
    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\
    \ layer through the \nnetwork layer for further processing and analysis. \n(2).\
    \ Network layer: The network layer is the infrastructure of IoT, which includes\

    \ The transmission \nmedium can be wired technology such as CAN bus and RS485\
    \ bus or wireless technology like \nZigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa and NB-IoT. The network\
    \ layer not only transmits various kinds of \nagricultural related information\

    \ control commands of the application layer to the perception layer, so that the\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \  can ensure food safety and quality at each \nlink of the production, from the\
    \ cropland to the consumer (Figure 6), which could help consumers \nestablish\
    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\

    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\

    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    1. Introduction\nSmart campuses and universities require an IT infrastructure\
    \ similar to the one needed by smart\ncities, smart buildings, or smart homes,\
    \ which make use of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions [1–4] to\ninteract with\
    \ the sensor and actuation systems of a university. Similarly to smart cities,\
    \ but in contrast\nto most smart homes and buildings, smart campuses must provide\
    \ long-distance communications,\nas many university campuses cover an area that\
    \ can reach thousands of square meters. For instance,\nthe campus of the authors\
    \ of this article (Campus of Elviña, University of A Coruña, Spain) occupies a\n\
    26,000 m2 area. Nonetheless, such an area can be considered small when compared\
    \ with the largest\nuniversity campuses in the world: Berry College (Floyd County,\
    \ Georgia, United States) covers 109.26\nkm2 of land [5], Duke University campuses\
    \ (Durham, North Carolina, United States) are deployed on\n37.83 km2 [6], and\
    \ the campus of Stanford University (Stanford, California, United States) occupies\
    \ 8180\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479; doi:10.3390/app9214479\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n2 of 24\nacres (33 km2) [7]. These ﬁgures mean that\
    \ smart campuses should make use of speciﬁc long-distance\ncommunications infrastructure\
    \ that provides indoor and outdoor connectivity to the deployed IoT\ngateways,\
    \ sensors and actuators, while guaranteeing reduced energy consumption and thus\
    \ optimized\nIoT node battery life.\nA smart campus and university is managed\
    \ according to its strategic plan (a framework of its\nmain priorities and commitments).\
    \ As a result, universities devote ﬁnancial resources to implement a\nbroad range\
    \ of actions (e.g., related to digital transformation, services, applications,\
    \ events, facilities,\nhuman resources, governance, educational programs, or innovation)\
    \ that are fundamentally designed\nto meet their institutional objectives. The\
    \ strategic plan is driven by the university mission, vision, and\ncore values\
    \ (further detailed in Section 2). For instance, a number of universities around\
    \ the world\nhas committed to make tangible contributions to the United Nations\
    \ Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs). Note that the provided smart campus services\
    \ may be similar to the ones of a smart city,\nbut adapted to the needs of a university\
    \ (e.g., mobility/transport services, energy/grid monitoring,\nresource consumption\
    \ efﬁciency, user behavior monitoring, or guidance applications). However, there\n\
    are other services that are speciﬁc for a university environment, such as the\
    \ services for analyzing the\nbehavior of students in certain outdoor activities\
    \ or their attendance to lectures.\nIn addition, there are other relevant differences\
    \ with respect to smart cities regarding the\narchitectures and technologies that\
    \ can be applied to smart campuses and universities:\n•\nSmaller size. Although,\
    \ as it has been previously mentioned, there are really large campuses, most\n\
    of them are not as large as cities and, in fact, there are many urban universities\
    \ with buildings\ninside a city. Such a smaller size enables using certain communications\
    \ technologies that do not\nneed to reach very long distances. In addition, since\
    \ often less devices require to be deployed than\nin a smart city, architectures\
    \ can be less complex and need less routing layer devices, what usually\nreduces\
    \ response time and infrastructure deployment cost.\n•\nInfrastructure management.\
    \ Frequently, in a smart campus/university all buildings and related\ninfrastructure\
    \ are managed by the same organization (i.e., the university), often making it\
    \ easier\nto take certain measures to ease the deployment of the required infrastructure\
    \ communications\nand architecture than in a smart city. In contrast, in a city\
    \ most space is occupied with private\nbuildings that are managed by people that\
    \ do not work for the city council, so certain infrastructure\ndeployments can\
    \ be difﬁcult when having to deal with the different necessities of multiple people.\n\
    •\nHomogeneity.\nA smart university can enforce the use of certain technologies\
    \ and speciﬁc\narchitectures, while a smart city in general will have to deal\
    \ with a greater heterogeneity in\nsuch areas, which usually require complex solutions\
    \ to integrate the numerous previously existing\ncomputational systems.\nDue to\
    \ the previously mentioned differences, it is essential to study speciﬁcally\n\
    the most\nappropriate architectures and technologies for developing smart campuses\
    \ and universities.\nIn contrast to previous reviews and surveys on smart campuses/universities,\
    \ which are presented\nas systematic literature reviews [8,9], are focused on\
    \ deﬁning certain generic concepts/applications [10],\nor are centered on speciﬁc\
    \ technologies [11–16], this article provides a holistic review that analyzes\
    \ the\napplication of the latest key technologies and architectures for the development\
    \ of smart campuses\nand universities, including the following contributions,\
    \ which have not been found together in the\nprevious literature.\n•\nAfter deﬁning\
    \ the essential characteristics of a smart campus and a smart university, the\
    \ most\ncommon communications architectures are detailed together with their evolution:\
    \ from traditional\ncloud-based to the latest ones based on edge computing.\n\
    •\nThe application of blockchain to such architectures is studied as a tool to\
    \ create a distributed\nimmutable log that provides transparency and cybersecurity\
    \ to higher education and smart\ncampus applications.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n\
    3 of 24\n•\nThe characteristics of the most relevant smart campus deployments\
    \ and initiatives are analyzed.\n•\nThe latest smart campus deployments are enumerated\
    \ and multiple examples of their applications\nare described.\n•\nThe most recent\
    \ communications technologies for outdoor and indoor smart campus applications\n\
    are studied.\n•\nThe main challenges that will be faced by university planners,\
    \ IoT vendors, and developers\nare listed.\nThe rest of this paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 deﬁnes the concept of smart campus and\nits main features.\
    \ Section 3 details the latest communications architectures for smart campuses\
    \ and\nsmart universities. Section 4 analyzes the potential applications of blockchain\
    \ for deploying higher\neducation and smart campus applications. Section 5 describes\
    \ the most relevant smart campuses that\nhave been already deployed, emphasizing\
    \ their main applications and communications technologies.\nFinally, Section 6\
    \ indicates the main challenges for university planners, IoT vendors, and developers,\n\
    and Section 7 is devoted to the conclusions.\n2. Deﬁnitions of Smart Campus and\
    \ Smart University\nIt must be ﬁrst clariﬁed that the term “smart campus” has\
    \ been used in the past to refer to digital\nonline platforms that manage university\
    \ content [17,18] or to the set of techniques aimed at increasing\nuniversity\
    \ student smartness [19–21]. However, in this article, the concept of smart campus\
    \ refers\nto the hardware and software required to provide advanced intelligent\
    \ context-aware services and\napplications to university students and staff. In\
    \ addition, the term smart university refers to the\nhardware and software used\
    \ to develop tools to fulﬁll the key dimensions of the university mission:\n•\n\
    Improve the teaching, learning, and assessment processes involved in higher education.\n\
    •\nFoster research and innovation.\n•\nEmpower community-based knowledge transfer\
    \ and a shared vision among the various\nuniversity stakeholders (e.g., teachers,\
    \ students, administration, non-proﬁt organizations, research\ninstitutions, citizens,\
    \ industries, and governments).\nSuch characteristics make smart campus and universities\
    \ unique and enable differentiating from\nother concepts like smart cities. Nonetheless,\
    \ smart campuses/universities are similar to smart cities\nin the way they are\
    \ organized, which revolves around six smart areas [22]:\n•\nSmart governance.\
    \ It allows university staff and students to take part in different decisions\
    \ that\nneed to be made on a university or on a speciﬁc campus.\n•\nSmart people.\
    \ It is related to the engagement of the university users in teaching and learning\n\
    processes or their attendance to certain events.\n•\nSmart mobility. In the case\
    \ of a smart campus, this ﬁeld deals with the different issues related\nto the\
    \ available transport systems, which should be efﬁcient, green, safe, and may\
    \ provide\nintelligent services.\n•\nSmart environment. This ﬁeld is related to\
    \ smart solutions able to monitor, protect, and actuate on\nthe environment while\
    \ also managing the available resources in a sustainable way. For instance,\n\
    smart environment systems provide solutions for monitoring waste, water consumption,\
    \ or air\nquality. In addition, this ﬁeld is usually related to the deployment\
    \ of systems to control and\nmonitor the energy consumed, generated and distributed\
    \ throughout a campus.\n•\nSmart living. It is responsible for monitoring the\
    \ multiple living factors involved in the daily\ncampus activities, including\
    \ the ones related to health, safety or user behavior. Thus, smart living\nservices\
    \ can perform the following [23,24]:\n–\nEstimate room occupation and determine\
    \ student classroom attendance.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n4 of 24\n–\nControl\
    \ the access to classroom/lab equipment.\n–\nProvide teaching interaction services\
    \ and context-aware applications.\n•\nSmart economy. This smart ﬁeld deals with\
    \ the productivity of a campus in relation to concepts\nlike entrepreneurship\
    \ or innovation.\nAs a summary, Figure 1 illustrates the main ﬁelds and technologies\
    \ related to the deployment\nof a smart campus/university. The inner circle contains\
    \ the six previously mentioned smart ﬁelds.\nThe contiguous outer circle references\
    \ some of the most relevant technologies required to provide\nsolutions for such\
    \ six smart ﬁelds, including IoT, Augmented Reality (AR), Cyber-Physical Systems\n\
    (CPSs), or UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). Note that some of such technologies\
    \ are the same as the\nones proposed by Industry 4.0 [25], so commercial and industrial\
    \ deployments are already available in\nother ﬁelds outside smart campuses [26,27].\
    \ Moreover, there are also vertical ﬁelds like cybersecurity\nthat affect several\
    \ of the cited technologies, since their contribution is key to avoid potential\
    \ issues [28].\nFinally, the most external circle of Figure 1 indicates speciﬁc\
    \ smart areas that are usually involved\nin the daily activities carried out in\
    \ a smart campus/university. For example, smart plug-and-play\nobjects [29] may\
    \ be involved in many university activities, whereas certain environmental sensors\
    \ are\nessential for actuating on smart buildings [30]. There are also other ﬁelds,\
    \ like smart agriculture, that\nmay be speciﬁc for smart campuses that include\
    \ in their premises areas for growing certain crops that\nmay require the use\
    \ of autonomous decision-support systems [31].\nRobots \nand UAVs\nBig Data\n\

    Figure 1. Main ﬁelds and technologies of a smart campus.\n3. Smart Campus/University\
    \ Communications Architectures\nSeveral authors have previously proposed different\
    \ smart campus architectures, but it\ncan be stated that, in general, they can\
    \ be classiﬁed as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n\
    5 of 24\narchitectures [32,33] that revolve around two main paradigms (IoT and\
    \ cloud computing [34]), which\nare usually helped by Big Data when processing\
    \ and analyzing the collected information.\nAn example of smart campus architecture\
    \ based on cloud computing is presented in [35], where\nthe authors deployed a\
    \ smart campus platform in three months by using Commercial Off-The-Shelf\n(COTS)\
    \ hardware and Microsoft Azure cloud services. With respect to IoT, its use has\
    \ been proposed\nfor easing the deployment of architectures that allow for implementing\
    \ learning, access control, or\nresource water management applications [10,36].\n\
    Some researchers have also proposed alternative paradigms for creating smart campuses.\n\
    For instance, the authors of [37] propose an opportunistic communications architecture\
    \ that allows for\nsharing data through infrastructure-less services. The main\
    \ novelty behind the proposed architecture\nis the concept of Floating Content\
    \ node, which is a computing device that produces data that can be\nshared among\
    \ users located in nearby areas. Similar architectures have been proposed, but\
    \ they have\nbeen focused on improving certain aspects like security [38].\nSome\
    \ of the latest smart campus architectures have suggested the use of the different\
    \ types of\nthe edge computing paradigm (e.g., mobile edge computing or fog computing),\
    \ which have already\nbeen successfully applied to other smart ﬁelds [39]. The\
    \ main advantage of edge computing is its\nability to ofﬂoad part of the processing\
    \ tasks from the cloud, delegating such tasks to the so-called\nedge devices,\
    \ which are physically located close to the IoT nodes. Thanks to this approach,\
    \ the amount\nof communications transactions with the cloud and latency response\
    \ are reduced, while also being\nable to provide location-aware services [40,41].\n\
    For example, the authors of [42] make use of edge computing devices to improve\
    \ their smart\ncampus architecture. Such devices are focused on delivering services\
    \ related to content caching and\nbandwidth allocation. A similar approach is\
    \ presented in [43], where the researchers provide smart\ncampus services through\
    \ edge computing devices embedded into street lights. In the case of the work\n\
    detailed in [44], the authors propose a smart campus platform called WiCloud that\
    \ is based in mobile\nedge computing, which allows for accessing the platform\
    \ servers through mobile phone base stations\nor wireless access points. Finally,\
    \ it is worth mentioning the smart campus system presented in [45],\nwhich makes\
    \ use of fog computing nodes to enhance user experience.\nTo clarify the previously\
    \ mentioned architectures, Figure 2 illustrates their evolution. In this\nﬁgure,\
    \ at the top, the traditional cloud-based architecture is depicted, which is composed\
    \ by two main\nlayers:\n•\nNode layer: it consists of multiple IoT nodes and computing\
    \ devices, whose data are collected\nthrough IoT gateways and routers in order\
    \ to send them to the cloud where they are stored.\n•\nCloud layer: it is essentially\
    \ a central server or a group of servers where the main processing tasks\nare\
    \ carried out. In addition, the cloud allows for interacting with third parties,\
    \ it presents the\nstored data to remote users and enables interconnecting the\
    \ multiple IoT networks that may be\nscattered through different physical locations.\n\
    The architecture depicted at the bottom of Figure 2 on the left represents a fog\
    \ computing\narchitecture. In this case, besides the node layer and the cloud,\
    \ there is a third layer (the fog layer),\nwhich is made of fog devices. Such\
    \ devices provide different local fog services to the IoT nodes and\nare also\
    \ able to exchange data among them to collaborate in certain tasks. A fog computing\
    \ device is\nusually implemented on a Single-Board Computer (SBC), which is essentially\
    \ a reduced-size low-cost\ncomputer (e.g., Raspberry Pi and Orange Pi PC) that\
    \ can be easily deployed in the campus facilities.\nFinally, the third and more\
    \ evolved architecture of Figure 2 is the one at the bottom, on the right,\nwhich\
    \ illustrates a typical edge computing smart campus architecture. Such an architecture\
    \ is basically\nan enhanced version of the previously mentioned fog computing-based\
    \ architecture, but through its\nedge computing layer it provides more computing\
    \ power, thanks to the use of cloudlets. A cloudlet is\noften a high-end computer\
    \ that is able to perform compute-intensive tasks, like the ones related to\n\
    complex data processing or image rendering.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n6 of 24\n\

    4. Blockchain for Smart Campuses and Universities\nBoth academia [11–13] and public\
    \ entities like the European Commission [46] have recently\nconsidered the improvement\
    \ of the architectures described in the previous section by using Distributed\n\
    Ledger Technologies (DLTs) like blockchain. Such a technology can be used for\
    \ implementing higher\neducation and smart campus applications, due to their ability\
    \ to provide data exchanges among entities\nthat do not necessarily trust each\
    \ other [47]. In addition, the use of blockchain enhance smart campus\napplications\
    \ that need transparency, data immutability, privacy, and security. Furthermore,\
    \ blockchain\nallows for developing Decentralized Apps (DApps) based on Peer-to-Peer\
    \ (P2P) transactions whose\nprocesses can be automated through the use of smart\
    \ contracts, which can execute pieces of code in an\nautonomous way [48].\nNowadays,\
    \ there are many blockchain platforms, like Ethereum [49], Hyperledger Fabric\
    \ [50],\nor the popular Bitcoin [51], that can be used in multiple practical applications\
    \ [52–55]. However, it is\nimportant to emphasize that blockchain is not the best\
    \ technology for every application that needs to\nperform trustworthy data exchanges.\
    \ For example, in many cases where smart campus applications\nare deployed in\
    \ a private network, a traditional database is powerful enough and usually provides\n\
    faster transactions than a blockchain. Therefore, to decide whether a blockchain\
    \ is necessary, smart\ncampus developers may use a decision framework [56] and,\
    \ thus, detect certain necessary features,\nlike the need for decentralization,\
    \ transaction transparency, cybersecurity (e.g., data redundancy and\nprotection\
    \ against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks), or the lack of trust among entities\
    \ (including\nrespect to government agencies and banks).\nDue to the previously\
    \ mentioned beneﬁts, different authors have proposed the use of blockchain\nand\
    \ other DLTs for developing applications for smart campuses and universities.\n\
    Speciﬁcally,\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n7 of 24\nblockchain has been suggested\
    \ for guaranteeing education certiﬁcate authenticity [57,58], managing\ndigital\
    \ copyright information [59], verifying learning outcomes [60,61], or enhancing\
    \ e-learning\ninteraction [62]. More potential smart campus applications and a\
    \ deeper analysis on their characteristics\ncan be found in [11–13,46].\n5. Analysis\
    \ of Recent Smart Campus and University Deployments\n5.1. Relevant Deployments\n\
    In the literature, there only a few papers that present descriptions on actual\
    \ smart campuses.\nAn example of such a paper is [63], where the authors detail\
    \ the development of the smart campus of\nToulouse III Paul Sabatier university\
    \ (France). Speciﬁcally, the smart campus is called neOCampus and\ninvolves multiple\
    \ projects able to run on an open data platform that, for instance, can use collaborative\n\
    WiFi. Similarly, in [64], the authors describe a smart campus based on cloud computing,\
    \ SOA, and\nIoT that has been deployed in the Moncloa Campus of International\
    \ Excellence of the Universidad\nPolitécnica de Madrid (Spain). In the mentioned\
    \ article, two applications are detailed: one for\nmonitoring diverse environmental\
    \ parameters, and another for determining people ﬂows inside the\ncampus. A similar\
    \ smart campus is described in [65], where the authors propose an IoT and cloud\n\
    computing based architecture for the Wuhan University of Technology smart campus\
    \ (China) that is\naimed at supporting diverse applications.\nIoT is also key\
    \ in the West Texas A&M University smart campus [66], which is deployed in a\n\
    176-acre land that includes 42 different buildings. Such a smart campus is focused\
    \ on providing\nIoT-related and secure services, and has tested systems for smart\
    \ parking or environmental monitoring.\nAnother interesting work can be found\
    \ in [33], where it is detailed the Birmingham City University\nsmart campus (United\
    \ Kingdom). The aim of the proposed smart campus is essentially to create a\n\
    scalable and ﬂexible SOA architecture where service integration and orchestration\
    \ can be carried out\neasily through the use of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).\n\
    Finally, it is worth mentioning the work presented in [67], where it is described\
    \ from a theoretical\npoint of view the smart campus of Sapienza (Rome, Italy),\
    \ including the author’s approach for\nproviding services in a scalable way.\n\
    As a summary, Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the most relevant smart\
    \ campus\ndeployments, including details on their location, size, used hardware,\
    \ and their explicit support\nfor advanced architectures (fog and edge computing\
    \ enabled architectures) and blockchain-enabled\napplications.\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\

    \ Applications\nBoth indoor and outdoor applications can be deployed in a smart\
    \ campus/university [8], but such\nsmart applications differ in their requirements.\n\
    The most relevant difference is that, in indoor\nenvironments, IoT nodes can be\
    \ usually powered through the electrical grid and can make use\nof ﬁxed communications\
    \ infrastructure (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi access points). In contrast, outdoors,\
    \ IoT\nnodes usually depend on batteries and need to exchange data at relatively\
    \ long distances (at least\nseveral hundred meters, up to 2 kilometers). The following\
    \ are some of the most relevant applications\nfor both scenarios:\n•\nSmart mobility\
    \ and intelligent transport services. This kind of applications require outdoor\n\
    communications coverage from traditional Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)\
    \ or speciﬁc\nvehicular networks [71,72].\nFor instance, researchers of Soochow\
    \ University proposed to\nuse in their campus an automatic gate access system\
    \ and diverse services for smart parking,\nbus positioning or for renting bicycles\
    \ [68]. Similar services have been suggested by other\nuniversities for providing\
    \ a smart parking service [73], electric mobility [74,75], smart electric\ncharging\
    \ [76], the use of autonomous vehicles [77], or for locating the campus buses\
    \ [78,79].\n•\nSmart energy and smart grid monitoring. These applications are\
    \ used for controlling and\nmonitoring the generation, distribution, and consumption\
    \ of the campus energy sources (e.g.,\nphotovoltaic systems or wind generators).\
    \ Speciﬁcally, in the last years, multiple authors focused\ntheir research on\
    \ the study of smart campus microgrids [80–82], smart grids [83,84], and smart\n\
    energy systems [85,86].\n•\nResource consumption efﬁciency. The use of the resources\
    \ of a campus can be monitored\nthrough speciﬁc systems for garbage collection\
    \ [87], water management [69], power consumption\nmonitoring [88,89], and other\
    \ solutions aimed at preserving sustainability [16].\n•\nInfrastructure and building\
    \ control and monitoring. The state of certain buildings and assets that\nare\
    \ scattered throughout the campus can be monitored and controlled remotely. For\
    \ instance,\nsolutions have been suggested for monitoring campus greenhouses [90],\
    \ for controlling the\nHeating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems\
    \ of the campus buildings [91] or for\nautomating critical infrastructure supervision\
    \ through Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) [92].\n•\nGreen area monitoring. The\
    \ health of the trees of campus can be monitored remotely through IoT\nsensor-based\
    \ systems [93].\n•\nUser pattern and behavior monitoring. The smart campus services\
    \ and infrastructure can be\noptimized thanks to the analysis of the user patterns\
    \ and behaviors. For instance, mobility\npatterns, user activities, or social\
    \ interactions can be determined through smartphone apps [94,95],\nby monitoring\
    \ WiFi communications [96,97] or by collecting data from smartphone sensors [98],\n\
    wearables, or even garments [99].\n•\nGuidance and context-aware applications.\
    \ These applications often depend on sensors and\nactuators spread across the\
    \ campus and can help people by giving useful contextual information\nand indications\
    \ on how to reach their destination. For instance, there is interesting research\
    \ on\nguidance systems to aid hearing and visually impaired people [100] or for\
    \ navigating the campus\npaths [101,102]. There are also augmented reality applications\
    \ that provide relevant contextual\ninformation on the campus or that are able\
    \ to guide the users through it [103–105].\n•\nClassroom attendance. Different\
    \ student monitoring systems have been proposed, which make\nuse of IoT and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence to control student classroom attendance [106] and their access\n\
    to sport facilities [107].\n•\nRemote health monitoring. Some of the latest smart\
    \ campus applications are aimed at monitoring\nthe health of certain campus users\
    \ in real-time [108] or at measuring student stress [109] and\nhealth consciousness\
    \ [110].\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n11 of 24\n•\nSmart card applications. Although\
    \ smart cards have been used for a long time by universities [111],\nthey can\
    \ still provide useful services for a smart campus, like information retrieval,\
    \ mobile\npayments, library usage, access control, or e-learning [112–114].\n\
    Instead of a smart card,\nthe latest developments suggested the use of the Near-Field\
    \ Communications (NFC) interface of\na smartphone to provide the mentioned smart\
    \ campus applications [115]. Due to the multiple\npotential applications of smart\
    \ cards, some authors also proposed to mine the data collected from\nthe student\
    \ transactions to infer their behavior [116,117].\n•\nTeaching and Learning applications.\
    \ The technologies embedded into a smart campus/university\ncan also help students\
    \ to learn through their mobile phones [118] or have an ubiquitous\nuser-centered\
    \ personalized learning and training experience with advanced analytics [119,120].\n\
    These technologies also allow teachers to make use of speciﬁc learning services\
    \ (e.g., online\nprogramming contests [121]), sophisticated online teaching platforms\
    \ [122], and to implement\nnovel teaching paradigms like Flipped Classroom [123]\
    \ or ampliﬁcation [124].\n•\nResearch and innovation activities.\nSmart campus/university\
    \ technologies can be used to\nencourage collaboration and cooperation among people\
    \ (e.g., international networks of living\nlabs). For instance, crowdsourcing\
    \ can be used to collect data of people with different proﬁles\n(e.g., students,\
    \ teachers, researchers, and administrative staff) and create large-scale datasets\
    \ for\nfurther research and novel applications [125].\n•\nCommunity-based knowledge\
    \ transfer applications. Smart campus and university technologies\ncan be explored\
    \ to beneﬁt the global community [126], either by increasing their awareness about\n\
    sustainability issues [127] or by making citizens actively involved as central\
    \ players of smart\nenvironments [128].\n•\nLocation-aware applications. In many\
    \ situations the information given to smart campus users\ndepends on their location.\
    \ Such a location-aware data may include information on content,\nactivities,\
    \ projects, services, tools, knowledge, or events [129–132].\n•\nSecurity services.\n\
    Smart campus managers can make use of the multiple sensors and\nrecording devices\
    \ to monitor the campus status and increase physical security through video\n\
    surveillance [133] and location-aware applications [134]. In addition, it is essential\
    \ to protect the\nprivacy of campus user data when making use of wireless communications\
    \ [135] and preventing\ncyber-attacks [66].\n5.3. Communications Technologies\n\
    In the past, researchers have used diverse technologies for connecting remote\
    \ outdoor IoT nodes\nwith smart campus platforms. Note that such technologies\
    \ may differ a great deal from one scenario\nto another, as the distance to be\
    \ covered and the kind obstacles found in the environment (especially,\nmetallic\
    \ objects [136]), severely condition signal propagation.\nFor instance, in [35],\
    \ the authors propose the design of an IoT-based smart campus that makes\nuse\
    \ of BLE and ZigBee for providing short and medium-range communications. Nonetheless,\
    \ note\nthat ZigBee nodes can act as relays in a ZigBee mesh, so that the exchanged\
    \ information can reach long\ndistances [137].\nWiFi (i.e., the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac\
    \ standards) is another popular technology that has already\nbeen suggested for\
    \ providing indoor connectivity for smart campuses [64].\nBluetooth beacons\n\
    can be also used in smart campus applications [138,139], but they usually are\
    \ restricted to indoor\nenvironments, as their outdoor use requires the deployment\
    \ of dense networks whose management is\ncomplicated [140].\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 4479\n12 of 24\nDue to the popularity of mobile phones, the main cell phone\
    \ communications technologies (i.e.,\n2G/3G/4G) have been suggested for providing\
    \ smart campus services [141,142]. 5G technologies are\nstill being deployed worldwide,\
    \ but their use has already been proposed due to their ability to provide\nfast\
    \ communications and reduce response latency in smart campus applications [122].\n\
    Despite the good perspectives of 5G for the next decade, nowadays, Low-Power Wide\
    \ Area\nNetwork (LPWAN) technologies are arguably one of the best alternatives\
    \ for smart campus applications\nthat require low-power and long-distance IoT\
    \ communications [143]. Some of the most popular\nLPWAN technologies are SigFox\
    \ [144], LoRaWAN [145], and NB-IoT [146], existing other emerging\ntechnologies\
    \ like Ingenu Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA) [147], Weightless-P [148], or\n\
    NB-Fi [149].\nLoRaWAN deﬁnes the communication protocol and the system architecture\
    \ for the network\nand uses LoRa as the physical layer. Although there are several\
    \ recent works on the application of\nLoRa/LoRaWAN to multiple scenarios [150],\
    \ only a few of them are focused on the deployment of\nsmart campuses services\
    \ [66,70,151–153]. For example, the authors of [152] analyze the indoor and\n\
    outdoor performance of LoRaWAN on a French smart campus. In addition, other researchers\
    \ [153]\nproposed a smart campus air quality system whose communications were\
    \ carried out by LoRaWAN\nnodes. Another example can be found in [70], where the\
    \ authors make use of a radio planning\nsimulator to determine the optimal location\
    \ of LoRaWaN nodes that provide smart campus services in\noutdoor applications.\n\
    There are also short-distance communications technologies that can be useful in\
    \ smart campus\napplications. For instance, ANT+ transceivers are often embedded\
    \ into chest straps to monitor\nperformance and health in sports. Another example\
    \ of popular short-distance communications\ntechnology is Radio Frequency IDentiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID), which is commonly used in university access\ncontrol and payment systems\
    \ [28].\nTable 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the latest and most popular\
    \ communications\ntechnologies for smart campus applications.\nMoreover, Table\
    \ 3 compares the communications\ntechnologies of the most relevant smart campus\
    \ solutions. Such a Table also indicates whether the\nprovided references detail\
    \ the network planning of the proposed solution and, as it can be observed,\n\
    only a couple of works give details about it.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n13 of\

    6. Future Challenges\nDespite the evolution of smart campuses and universities\
    \ in the last years thanks to the\ntechnological advances achieved in ﬁelds like\
    \ IoT, cloud computing, and certain communications\nparadigms, future university\
    \ planners, IoT vendors, and developers will still face relevant challenges\n\
    in the following areas.\n•\nScalability. As a campus can cover a large area, where\
    \ a large number of users can request smart\nservices, it is essential for applications\
    \ to be easily scalable in order to adapt its performance to\nthe number of simultaneous\
    \ users.\n•\nService ﬂexibility. A smart campus/university should be able to provide\
    \ multiple services, which\nmay differ depending on the physical area where they\
    \ are provided (e.g., depending on the\nfaculty), on the speciﬁc user that request\
    \ them (e.g., access privileges may differ between a student\nand a professor),\
    \ or on the speciﬁc goal (e.g., advancing to more effective teaching and learning\n\
    services may differ substantially from the design of smart environment applications).\n\
    •\nLong-distance low-power communications. Since campuses usually cover areas\
    \ of thousands\nof square meters that often involve monitoring outdoor smart IoT\
    \ objects (e.g., street lights,\nirrigation systems), it is key to consider in\
    \ the smart campus architecture the use of long-distance\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9,\
    \ 4479\n15 of 24\nwireless communications technologies whose energy consumption\
    \ should be as low as possible\nto maximize IoT node battery life.\n•\nNew communications\
    \ technologies. Although this article has analyzed the currently most relevant\n\
    communications technologies, smart campus designers should be aware of the latest\
    \ advances on\ncommunications in order to include them in the designed architecture.\
    \ For instance, some authors\nare already suggesting potential applications for\
    \ 6G technologies [155,156].\n•\nBlockchain integration. DLTs like blockchain\
    \ can be really useful to guarantee operational\nefﬁciency, data transparency,\
    \ authenticity, and security. This aspect is a key enabler to develop\nnovel decentralized\
    \ smart applications (i.e., DApps) and to leverage new artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    paradigms such as big data, machine learning, or deep learning. These paradigms\
    \ need to rely\non trustworthy datasets in order to reach their full potential\
    \ and produce new data model-based\napplications.\nNevertheless, smart campus\
    \ designers have to use blockchain with caution,\nconsidering their advantages\
    \ and disadvantages. In addition, the incorrect use of smart contracts\ncan be\
    \ a problem, since they are able to trigger certain automatic behaviors that can\
    \ have serious\neconomic or personal consequences.\n•\nLack of smart campus standards\
    \ and public initiatives. Although, in the last years, smart city\ninitiatives\
    \ have proliferated worldwide, there are only a few speciﬁcally related to smart\
    \ campuses\nand universities. In addition, there is not a common framework for\
    \ designing or deploying them,\nso future developers will have to keep compatibility\
    \ and interoperability issues in mind.\n•\nSeamless integration of outdoor and\
    \ indoor smart campus applications.\nDue to their\ncommunications needs, outdoor\
    \ and indoor applications may differ in the underlying\ntechnologies, so it is\
    \ necessary to design architectures and devices that allow for switching between\n\
    communications transceivers. This means that, although the lower layers of the\
    \ communications\nprotocol may differ, the upper layers are compatible so that\
    \ they are able to provide seamless\ncommunications among users, IoT objects,\
    \ and the computing devices scattered throughout\na campus.\n7. Conclusions\n\
    This article examined how higher education can leverage the opportunities created\
    \ by the latest\nand most relevant IT technologies. After analyzing the basics\
    \ on smart campuses and universities, this\nwork has focused on studying the potential\
    \ of IoT, blockchain, and the most recent communications\narchitectures and paradigms\
    \ (e.g., fog/edge computing) for developing novel smart campus and\nsmart university\
    \ applications. In addition, the latest key deployments as well as their communications\n\
    technologies have been detailed and analyzed. Finally, the main future challenges\
    \ are listed in order to\nallow future university planners, IoT vendors, and developers\
    \ to create a roadmap for the design and\ndeployment of the next generation of\
    \ smart campuses and universities.\nAuthor Contributions: T.M.F.-C. and P.F.-L.\

    tables Abstract The Internet of Robotic Things is an emerging vision that brings
    together pervasive sensors and objects with robotic and autonomous systems. This
    survey examines how the merger of robotic and Internet of Things technologies
    will advance the abilities of both the current Internet of Things and the current
    robotic systems, thus enabling the creation of new, potentially disruptive services.
    We discuss some of the new technological challenges created by this merger and
    conclude that a truly holistic view is needed but currently lacking. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics communities have so far been driven
    by different yet highly complementary objectives, the first focused on supporting
    information services for pervasive sensing, tracking and monitoring; the latter
    on producing action, interaction and autonomous behaviour. For this reason, it
    is increasingly claimed that the creation of an internet of robotic things (IoRT)
    combining the results from the two communities will bring a strong added value.1–3
    Early signs of the IoT-robotics convergence can be seen in distributed, heterogeneous
    robot control paradigms like network robot systems4 or robot ecologies,5 or in
    approaches such as ubiquitous robotics6–8 and cloud robotics9–12 that place resource-intensive
    features on the server side.13,14 The term ‘Internet of robotic things’ itself
    was coined in a report of ABI research1 to denote a concept where sensor data
    from a variety of sources are fused, processed using local and distributed intelligence
    and used to control and manipulate objects in the physical world. In this cyber-physical
    perspective of the IoRT, sensor and data analytics technologies from the IoT are
    used to give robots a wider situational awareness that leads to better task execution.
    use cases include intelligent transportation15 and companion robots.16 Later uses
    of the term IoRT in literature adopted alternative perspectives of this term:
    for example, one that focuses on the robust team communication,17–19 and a ‘robot-aided
    IoT’ view where robots are just additional sensors.20,21 Cloud computing and the
    IoT are two non-robotic enablers in creating distributed robotic systems (see
    Figure 1). IoT technologies have three tenets22: (i) sensors proliferated in the
    environment and on our bodies; (ii) smart connected objects using machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communication; and (iii) data analytics and semantic technologies transforming
    raw sensor data. Cloud computing provides on-demand, networked access to a pool
    of virtualized hardware resources (processing, storage) or higher level services.
    Cloud infrastructure has been used by the IoT community to deploy scalable IoT
    platform services that govern access to (raw, processed or fused) sensor data.
    Processing the data streams generated by billions of IoT devices in a handful
    of centralized data centres brings concerns on response time latency, massive
    ingress bandwidth needs and data privacy. Edge computing (also referred to as
    fog computing, cloudlets) brings on-demand and elastic computational resources
    to the edge of the network, closer to the producers of data23. The cloud paradigm
    was also adopted by the robotics community, called cloud robotics9–12 for offloading
    resource-intensive tasks,13,14 for the sharing of data and knowledge between robots24
    and for reconfiguration of robots following an app-store model.25 Although there
    is an overlap between cloud robotics and IoRT, the former paradigm is more oriented
    towards providing network-accessible infrastructure for computational power and
    storage of data and knowledge, while the latter is more focused on M2M communication
    and intelligent data processing. The focus of this survey is on the latter, discussing
    the potential added value of the IoT-robotics crossover in terms of improved system
    abilities, as well as the new technological challenges posed by the crossover.
    Figure 1. The scope of this review paper is the IoT as enabler in distributed
    robotic systems. IoT: Internet of Things. As one of the goals of this survey is
    to inspire researchers on the potential of introducing IoT technologies in robotic
    systems and vice versa, we structure our discussion along the system abilities
    commonly found in robotic systems, regardless of specific robot embodiment or
    application domains. Finding a suitable taxonomy of abilities is a delicate task.
    In this work, we build upon an existing community effort and adopt the taxonomy
    of nine system abilities, defined in the euRobotics roadmap,26 which shapes the
    robotic research agenda of the European Commission. Interestingly, these abilities
    are closely related to the research challenges identified in the US Robotics roadmap27
    (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Mapping between the system abilities defined in the
    multi-annual roadmap of euRobotics26 – along which this review is structured –
    and the research challenges identified in the roadmap for US Robotics.27 Basic
    abilities Perception ability The sensor and data analytics technologies from the
    IoT can clearly give robots a wider horizon compared to local, on-board sensing,
    in terms of space, time and type of information. Conversely, placing sensors on-board
    mobile robots allows to position them in a flexible and dynamic way and enables
    sophisticated active sensing strategies. A key challenge of perception in an IoRT
    environment is that the environmental observations of the IoRT entities are spatially
    and temporally distributed.28 Some techniques must be put in place to allow robots
    to query these distributed data. Dietrich et al.29 propose to use local databases,
    one in each entity, where data are organized in a spatial hierarchy, for example,
    an object has a position relative to a robot, the robot is positioned in a room
    and so on. Other authors30,31 propose that robots send specific observation requests
    to the distributed entities, for example, a region and objects of interest: this
    may speed up otherwise intractable sensor processing problems (see Figure 3).
    Figure 3. Distributed cameras assist the robot in locating a charging station
    in an environment. The charging station was placed between a green and yellow
    visual marker (location A). Visual markers of the same colours were placed elsewhere
    in the environment to simulate distractors. Visual processing is performed on-demand
    on the camera nodes to inform the robot that the charging station is at location
    A and not at the distracting location B (Image from Chamberlain et al.30) (c)
    2016 IEEE. A key component of robots’ perception ability is getting knowledge
    of their own location, which includes the ability to build or update models of
    the environment.32 Despite great progress in this domain, self-localization may
    still be challenging in crowded and/or Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied
    indoor environments, especially if high reliability is demanded. Simple IoT-based
    infrastructures such as an radio frequency identification (RFID)-enhanced floor
    have been used to provide reliable location information to domestic robots.33
    Other approaches use range-based techniques on signals emitted by off-board infrastructure,
    such as Wi-Fi access points34 and visible light,35 or by IoT devices using protocols
    such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB),36 Zigbee37 or Bluetooth lowenergy.38,39 Motion ability
    The ability to move is one of the fundamental added values of robotic systems.
    While mechanical design is the key factor in determining the intrinsic effectiveness
    of robot mobility, IoT connectivity can assist mobile robots by helping them to
    control automatic doors and elevators, for example in assistive robotics40 and
    in logistic applications.41 IoT platform services and M2M and networking protocols
    can facilitate distributed robot control architectures in large-scale applications,
    such as last mile delivery, precision agriculture, and environmental monitoring.
    FIROS42 is a recent tool to connect mobile robots to IoT services by translating
    Robot Operating System (ROS)43 messages into messages grounded in Open Mobile
    Alliance APIs?. Such an interface is suited for robots to act as a mobile sensor
    that publishes its observations and makes them available to any interested IoT
    service. In application scenarios such as search and rescue, where communication
    infrastructure may be absent or damaged, mobile robots may need to set up ad hoc
    networks and use each other as forwarding nodes to maintain communication. While
    the routing protocols developed for mobile ad hoc networks can be readily applied
    in such scenarios, lower overhead and increased energy efficiency can be obtained
    when such protocols explicitly take into account the knowledge of robot’s planned
    movements and activities.44 Sliwa et al.45 propose a similar approach to minimize
    path losses in robot swarms. Manipulation ability While the core motivation of
    the IoT is to sense the environment, the one of robotics is to modify it. Robots
    can grasp, lift, hold and move objects via their end effectors. Once the robot
    has acquired the relevant features of an object, like its position and contours,
    the sequence of torques to be applied on the joints can be calculated via inverse
    kinematics. The added value of IoT is in the acquisition of the object’s features,
    including those that are not observable with the robot’s sensors but have an impact
    on the grasping procedure, such as the distribution of mass, for example, in a
    filled versus an empty cup. Some researchers attached RFID tags to objects that
    contain information about their size, shape and grasping points5. Deyle et al.46
    embedded RFID reader antennas in the finger of a gripper: Differences in the signal
    strength across antennas were used to more accurately position the hand before
    touching the object. Longer range RFID tags were used to locate objects in a kitchen47
    or in smart factories,48,49 as well as to locate the robots themselves.50 Higher
    level abilities Decisional autonomy Decisional autonomy refers to the ability
    of the system to determine the best course of action to fulfil its tasks and missions.26
    This is mostly not considered in IoT middleware:51–53 applications just call an
    actuation API of so-called smart objects that hide the internal complexity.28
    Roboticists often rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning techniques54,55
    based on predictive models of the environment and of the possible actions. The
    quality of the plans critically depends on the quality of these models and of
    the estimate of the initial state. In this respect, the improved situational awareness
    that can be provided by an IoT environment (see “Perception ability” section)
    can lead to better plans. Human-aware task planners56 use knowledge of the intentions
    of the humans inferred through an IoT environment to generate plans that respect
    constraints on human interaction (see Figure 4). Figure 4. The vacuum cleaning
    robot adapts its plan to avoid interference in the kitchen (Figure from Cirillo
    et al.56) (c) 2010 ACM. IoT also widens the scope of decisional autonomy by making
    more actors and actions available, such as controllable elevators and doors.40,57
    However, IoT devices may dynamically become available or unavailable,58 which
    challenges classical multi-agent planning approaches. A solution is to do planning
    in terms of abstract services, which are mapped to actual devices at runtime.59
    Interaction ability This is the ability of a robot to interact physically, cognitively
    and socially either with users, operators or other systems around it.26 While
    M2M protocols60 can be directly adopted in robotic software, we focus here on
    how IoT technologies can facilitate human–robot interaction at functional (commanding
    and programming) and social levels, as well as a means for tele-interaction. Functional
    pervasive IoT sensors can make the functional means of human–robot interaction
    more robust. Natural language instructions are a desirable way to instruct robots,
    especially for non-expert users, but they are often vague or contain implicit
    assumptions.61,62 The IoT can provide information on the position and state of
    objects to disambiguate these instructions (see Figure 5). Gestures are another
    intuitive way to command robots, for instance, by pointing to objects. Recognition
    of pointing gestures from sensors on-board the robot only works within a limited
    field of view.63 External cameras provide a broader scene perspective that can
    improve gesture recognition.64 Wearable sensors have also been used, for example,
    Wolf et al.65 demonstrated a sleeve that measures forearm muscle movements to
    command robot motion and manipulation. Figure 5. Depending on the state of the
    environment, a natural language instructions results in different actions to be
    performed (Image from Misra et al.62) (c) 2016 SAGE. Social body cues like gestures,
    voice or face expression can be used to estimate the user’s emotional state66
    and make the robot respond to it.67,68 The integration with body-worn IoT sensors
    can improve this estimate by measuring physiological signals: Leite et al.69 measured
    heart rate and skin conductance to estimate engagement, motivation and attention
    during human–robot interaction. Others have used these estimates to adapt the
    robot’s interaction strategy, for example, in the context of autism therapy70
    or for stress relievement.71 Tele-interaction robots have also been used besides
    IoT technologies for remote interaction, especially in healthcare. Chan et al.72
    communicate hugs and manipulations between persons via sensorized robots. Al-Taee
    et al.73 use robots to improve the tele-monitoring of diabetes patients by reading
    out the glucose sensor and vocalizing the feedback from the carer (see Figure
    6). Finally, in the GiraffPlus project?, a tele-presence robot was combined with
    environmental sensors to provide health-related data to a remote therapist. Figure
    6. The robot acts as a master Bluetooth device that reads out glucose sensors
    and transfers them to the caregivers. The robot is then used to provide verbal
    information concerning the patient’s diet, insulin bolus/intake, and so on (Image
    from Al-Taee et al.73) (c) 2017 IEEE. Cognitive ability By reasoning on and inferring
    knowledge from experience, cognitive robots are able to understand the relationship
    between themselves and the environment, between objects, and to assess the possible
    impact of their actions. Some aspects of cognition were already discussed in the
    previous sections, for example, multi-modal perception, deliberation and social
    intelligence. In this section, we focus on the cognitive tasks of reasoning and
    learning in an IoRT multi-actor setting. Knowledge models are important components
    of cognitive architectures.74,75 Ontologies are a popular technique in both IoT
    and robotics for structured knowledge. Example ontologies describing the relationship
    between an agent and its physical environment are the Semantic Sensor Network,76
    IoT-A77 and the IEEE Ontologies for Robotics and Automation78 (ORA). For example,
    Jorge et al.79 use the ORA ontology for spatial reasoning between two robots that
    must coordinate in providing a missing tool to a human. Recent works??? harness
    the power of the cloud to derive knowledge from multi-modal data sources, such
    as human demonstrations, natural language or raw sensor data observations?, and
    to provide a virtual environment for simulating robot control policies. In an
    IoRT environment, these knowledge engines will be able to incorporate even more
    sources of data. In the IoT domain, cognitive techniques were recently proposed
    for the management of distributed architectures.80,81 Here, the system self-organizes
    a pipeline of data analytics modules on a distributed set of sensor nodes, edge
    cloud and so on. To our knowledge, the inclusion of robots in these pipelines
    has not yet been considered. If robots subscribe themselves as additional actors
    in the environment, then this gives rise to a new strand of problems in distributed
    consensus and collaboration for the IoT, because robots typically have a larger
    degree of autonomy than traditional IoT ‘smart’ objects, and because they are
    able to modify the physical environment leading to complex dependencies and interactions.
    System level abilities Configurability This is the ability of a robotic system
    to be configured to perform a given task or reconfigured to perform different
    tasks.26 IoT is mainly instrumental in supporting software configurability, in
    particular to orchestrate the concerted configuration of multiple devices, each
    contributing different capabilities and cooperating to the achievement of complex
    objectives. However, work in IoT does not explicitly address the requirement of
    IoRT systems to exchange continuous streams of data while interacting with the
    physical world. This requirement is most prominent in the domains of logistic
    and of advanced manufacturing, where a fast reaction to disruptions is needed,
    together with flexible adaptation to varying production objectives. Kousi et al.82
    developed a service-oriented architecture to support autonomous, mobile production
    units which can fuse data from a peripheral sensing network to detect disturbances.
    Michalos et al.83 developed a distributed system for data sharing and coordination
    of human–robot collaborative operations, connected to a centralized task planner.
    Production lines have also been framed as multi-agent systems84,85 equipped with
    self-descriptive capabilities to reduce set-up and changeover times. General purpose
    middlewares have also been developed to support distributed task coordination
    and control in IoRT environments. The Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform86 is a
    general purpose middleware for IoRT environments (see Figure 7). It manages the
    handover of functionality for services using real and virtual robots, for example
    reserving a real assistant robot using a virtual robot on the smartphone. Figure
    7. The Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform is a two-layered platform. The LPF configures
    a robotic system in a single area. The GPF is a middle-layer between the LPFs
    of different areas and the service applications (Image from Nishio et al.86).
    LPF: local platform; GPF: global platform (c) 2013 Springer-Verlag. Configurability
    can be coupled with decision ability to lead to the ability of a system to self-configure.
    Self-configuration is especially challenging in an IoRT system since the configuration
    algorithms must take into account both the digital interactions between the actors
    and their physical interactions through the real world. The ‘PEIS Ecology’ framework5
    includes algorithms for the self-configuration of a robot ecology: complex functionality
    is achieved by composing a set of devices with sensing, acting and/or computational
    capabilities, including robots. A shared tuple-space blackboard allows for high
    level collaboration and dynamic reconfiguration.87 Adaptability This is the ability
    of the system to adapt to different work scenarios, environments and conditions.26
    This includes the ability to adapt to unforeseen events, faults, changing tasks
    and environments and unexpected human behaviour. The key enablers for adaptability
    are the perception, decisional and configuration abilities as described above.
    Hence, we will now discuss relevant application domains and supporting platforms.
    Mobile robots are used in precision agriculture for the deployment of herbicide,
    fertilizer or irrigation.88 These robots need to adapt to spatio-temporal variations
    of crop and field patterns, crop sizes, light and weather conditions, soil quality,
    and so on.89 Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) can provide the necessary information,90,91
    for example, knowledge of soil moisture may be used to ensure accurate path tracking.92,93
    Gealy et al.94 use a robot to adjust the drip rate of individual water emitters
    to allow for plant-level control of irrigation. This is a notable example of how
    robots are used to adjust IoT devices. Some platforms supporting adaptation of
    IoRT have also been showcased in the context of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL).
    Building on OSGi, a platform for IoT home automation, AIOLOS exposes robots and
    IoT devices as reusable and shareable services, and automatically optimizes the
    runtime deployment across distributed infrastructure, for example, by placing
    a shared data processing service closer to the source sensor.95,96 Bacciu et al.97,98
    deploy recurrent neural networks on distributed infrastructure to automatically
    learn user preferences, and to detect disruptive environmental changes like the
    addition of a mirror.99 Dependability Dependability is a multifaceted attribute,
    covering the reliability of hardware and software robotic components, safety guarantees
    when cooperating with humans and the degree to which systems can continue their
    missions when failures or other unforeseen circumstances occur. In this section,
    we follow the classification of means of dependability identified by Crestani
    et al.100 A first means of dependability is to forecast faults or conflicts. For
    instance, robots in a manufacturing plant must stop if an operator comes too near.
    IoT technology can provide useful tools to realize this. Rampa et al.101 mounted
    a network of small tranceivers in a robotic cell and estimated the user position
    from the perturbations of the radio field. Other researchers embedded sensors
    in clothing and on the helmet. Qian et al.102 developed a probabilistic framework
    to avoid conflicts of robot and human motion, by combining observations from fixed
    cameras and on-board sensors with historical knowledge on human trajectories (see
    Figure 8). Figure 8. Sensory data from laser and global cameras are fed to the
    perception module, together with human motion patterns learned by the modelling
    module. Then three types of abstracted observations are inputted to the controller:
    PAO, PRO and RSO. Using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, a suitable
    navigational policy is generated (Image from Qian et al.102). PAO: people’s action
    observation; PRO: people-robot relation observation; RSO: robot state observation
    (c) 2013 SAGE. In a marine context, acoustic sensor networks have been used to
    provide information on water current and ship positions to a path planner for
    underwater gliders, to avoid collisions when they come to the surface103 or to
    preserve energy.104 A second means of dependability is robust system engineering.
    This can take new forms in an IoRT system. For instance, mobile wireless communication
    is a key enabler for industry 4.0, where both field devices, fixed machines and
    mobile AGV are connected. IoT protocols such as WirelessHart or Zigbee Pro were
    designed to address the industry concerns on reliability, security and cost.105
    When mobility is involved, however, these protocols must be complemented by meshing
    technologies to cope with handovers and with the massive presence of metal.106,107
    The last means is fault tolerance, which allows the system to keep working even
    when components fail. Redundancy is key to fault tolerance, and the IoRT enables
    redundancy of sensors, information and actuation. Data fusion from both on-board
    and environment sensors, however, requires a good understanding of the spatial
    and temporal relationship between the observations from different sensors. Such
    relationships have been explicitly modelled, for example, in the Positioning Ontology79
    (POS), or implicitly learned as part of modular deep neural network controller.108
    Conclusion Robotics and IoT are two terms each covering a myriad of technologies
    and concepts. In this review, we have unravelled the added value of the crossover
    of both technology domains into nine system abilities. The IoT advantages exploited
    by roboticists are mostly distributed perception and M2M protocols. Conversely,
    the IoT has so far mostly exploited robots for active sensing strategies. Current
    IoRT incarnations are almost uniquely found in vertical application domains, notably
    AAL, precision agriculture and Industry 4.0. Domain-agnostic solutions, for example,
    to integrate robots in IoT middleware platforms, are only emerging. It is our
    conviction that the IoRT should go beyond the readings of ‘IoT-aided robots’ or
    ‘Robot-enhanced IoT’. We hope that this survey may stimulate researchers from
    both disciplines to start work towards an ecosystem of IoT agents, robots and
    the cloud that combines both the above readings in a holistic way. Declaration

    \ essential to increase the productivity of \nagricultural and farming processes\
    \ to improve yields and cost-\neffectiveness with new technology such as the Internet\
    \ of Things \n(IoT). In particular, IoT can make agricultural and farming \nindustry\
    \ \nprocesses \nmore \nefficient \nby \nreducing \nhuman \nintervention through\
    \ automation. In this study, the aim to \nanalyze recently developed IoT applications\
    \ in the agriculture \nand farming industries to provide an overview of sensor\
    \ data \ncollections, technologies, and sub-verticals such as water \nmanagement\
    \ and crop management. In this review, data is \nextracted from 60 peer-reviewed\
    \ scientific publications (2016-\n2018) with a focus on IoT sub-verticals and\
    \ sensor data collection \nfor measurements to make accurate decisions. Our results\

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\
    \ summarised in Table I. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\

     \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nFrom our observations from the 60 peer-reviewed \npublications\
    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\

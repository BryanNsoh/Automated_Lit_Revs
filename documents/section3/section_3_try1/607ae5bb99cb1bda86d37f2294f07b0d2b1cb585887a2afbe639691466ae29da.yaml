    The smart city model is used by many organizations for large cities around the\
    \ world to significantly enhance and\nimprove the quality of life of the inhabitants,\
    \ improve the utilization of city resources, and reduce operational costs.\nThis\
    \ model includes various heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical Systems\
    \ (CPS), Internet of Things\n(IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cloud Computing,\
    \ and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, in order to\nreach these important\
    \ objectives, efficient networking and communication protocols are needed to provide\
    \ the\nnecessary coordination and control of the various system components. In\
    \ this paper, we identify the networking\ncharacteristics and requirements of\
    \ smart city applications, and identify the networking protocols that can be used\
    \ to\nsupport the various data traffic flows that are needed between the different\
    \ components. In addition, we provide\nillustrations of networking architectures\
    \ of selected smart city systems, which include smart grid, smart home energy\n\
    management, smart water, UAV and commercial aircraft safety, and pipeline monitoring\
    \ and control systems.\nKeywords: Smart city, Cyber-physical systems (CPS), Networking\

    1\nIntroduction\nA number of large cities around the world are inves-\ntigating\
    \ applying the smart city model to heighten the\nliving quality of their inhabitants\
    \ and enhance the uti-\nlization of the city infrastructure and resource s. Var-\n\
    ious advanced technologies and techniques supporting\nsuch models provide smart\
    \ services to improve the per-\nformance and operations in healthcare, transportation,\n\
    energy, education, and many other fields. At the same\ntime these services reduce\
    \ operational costs and resource\nconsumption in smart cities. Examples of these\
    \ technolo-\ngies are Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), the Internet\nof Things\
    \ (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), robotics,\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ fog computing, cloud\ncomputing, and big data analytics. Utilizing these tech-\n\
    nologies provides many advantages and services for smart\ncities. WSNs are used\
    \ to provide real-time monitoring\nof the conditions of smart city resources,\
    \ and infrastruc-\ntures [1]. The IoT facilitates the integration of the physical\n\
    objects in a city network [2]. CPS are used to provide\n*Correspondence: ihjawhar@gmail.com;\

    \ the article\nuseful interactions between the cyber world and the phys-\nical\
    \ world in smart cities [3]. Robotics and UAVs are used\nto provide automation\
    \ and offer useful services for smart\ncities [4]. Such services include enhancement\
    \ delivery of\nservices, environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring,\nsecurity\
    \ and safety controls, and telecommunication ser-\nvices [5]. Fog computing is\
    \ used to provide low latency\nsupport, location awareness, better mobility support,\
    \ and\nstreaming and real-time support for smart city applica-\ntions [6]. Cloud\
    \ computing provides a scalable and cost\neffective computation and data storage\
    \ platform to sup-\nport smart city applications [7]. Big data analytics is used\n\
    to provide intelligent and optimized short and long term\ndecisions based on collected\
    \ data to enhance smart city\nservices [8].\nThese advanced technologies are used\
    \ to implement\na number of smart city services [9–11]. Examples of\nthese smart\
    \ services are intelligent transportation ser-\nvices that can be used to enhance\
    \ route planning and\ncongestion avoidance in city streets, provide intelligent\n\
    traffic light controls and parking services, enhance vehicu-\nlar safety, and\
    \ enable self-driving cars. Other examples are\nsmart energy services that provide\
    \ better energy decisions\nfor more efficient energy consumption in smart cities.\n\

    \ used to\nsupport smart grids, and smart buildings, as well as pro-\nvide better\
    \ utilization of renewable energy. Other smart\nservices involve structural health\
    \ monitoring as well as\nreal-time monitoring of water networks, bridges, tun-\n\
    nels, train and subway rails, and oil and gas pipelines.\nAdditional services\
    \ include smart services for environ-\nmental monitoring and smart services for\
    \ public safety\nand security.\nThese smart city services do not only need the\
    \ various\nadvanced technologies discussed here, but also need reli-\nable and\
    \ robust networking and communication infras-\ntructures to enable efficient exchange\
    \ of messages among\nthe different components of the systems that provide a\n\
    particular service. Smart city services are designed at\ndifferent scales, which\
    \ require various networking and\ncommunication technologies for their implementation\n\
    and operations. Furthermore, different network and com-\nmunication models and\
    \ approaches can be utilized for\nsmart city services. This paper investigates\
    \ the commu-\nnication and network issues of smart city systems. It also\ninvestigates\
    \ networking technologies, architectures, and\ncommunication requirements for\
    \ such systems. The suit-\nability of existing network protocols for different\
    \ smart\ncity services will be discussed. Although there are sig-\nnificant research\
    \ efforts to investigate different issues in\nsmart cities and provide solutions\
    \ for these issues, very\nlittle research has been done to investigate the network-\n\
    ing and communication parts of smart city systems, which\nconstitute the main\
    \ objective of this paper.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section\
    \ 2\nprovides an overview of related work in this field.\nSection 3 includes an\
    \ overview of some smart city appli-\ncations. Section 4 presents networking architectures\
    \ and\ncommunication requirements for smart city applications.\nSection 5 offers\
    \ an illustration of selected smart city\nsystems. Section 6 discusses open issues\
    \ in the area of\nnetworking and communication for smart city systems.\nFinally,\
    \ Section 7 concludes the paper and provides some\nfuture research directions.\n\
    2\nRelated work\nThere are a few papers published addressing the network\nand\
    \ communication issues for smart cities. In this section\nwe discuss some of the\
    \ work presented in these papers.\nZanella et al. [2] provided an interesting\
    \ study that ana-\nlyzed the current technologies available for deploying IoT\n\
    for a smart city. In addition, the authors presented and\ndiscussed a proof-of-concept\
    \ implementation of IoT in\nthe city of Padova, Italy. There are generally two\
    \ com-\nmon approaches to offer data access to things in IoT. The\nfirst is using\
    \ multi-hop mesh networks with short-range\ncommunication in the unlicensed spectrum\
    \ among the\nnetwork nodes. The second is using long-range cellular\ntechnologies\
    \ in the licensed frequency band. A new com-\nmunication technology is introduced\
    \ to provide alter-\nnative connectivity for IoT named LPWAN (Low-Power\nWide\
    \ Area Network) [12]. From its name, this com-\nmunication technology can provide\
    \ low-rate, long-range\ntransmission in the unlicensed frequency bands using star\n\
    topology. These features can be very useful for some smart\ncity applications.\
    \ Leccese et al. [13] introduced a smart\ncity application of fully controlled\
    \ street lighting using a\nZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX while the applica-\n\
    tion is controlled by Raspberry-Pi Card. Sanchez et al. [14]\nintroduced a smart\
    \ city testbed for IoT experimentation\nnamed SmartSantander.\nSome work more\
    \ related to our contribution in this\npaper is investigating network architectures\
    \ for smart\ncities. Wan et al. [15] presented an event-based communi-\ncation\
    \ architecture that helps manage and facilitates coop-\neration among Machine\
    \ to machine (M2M) components\nin smart cities. The authors also conducted a case\
    \ study\nusing this architecture for vehicular applications. Gaur\net al. [16]\
    \ proposed a multi-level smart city architecture\nbased on semantic web technologies.\
    \ This architecture\nis mainly for wireless sensor networks applications in a\n\
    smart city. It consists of 4 levels: Data Collection, Data\nProcessing, Integration\
    \ and Reasoning, and Device Con-\ntrol and Alerts. Jin et al. [17] studied distinct\
    \ IoT network\narchitectures with focus on Quality of Service (QoS) for\ndifferent\
    \ smart city applications.\nThe last paper [17] is the closest to our contribu-\n\
    tions in the paper, thus we will elaborate on it. The\nauthors presented five\
    \ different IoT network architec-\ntures: (1) Autonomous Network Architecture,\
    \ (2) Ubiqui-\ntous Network Architecture, (3) Application-Layer Overlay\nNetwork\
    \ Architecture, (4) Service-Oriented Architecture,\nand (5) Participatory Sensing.\
    \ The autonomous network\narchitecture is usually not directly linked to public\
    \ net-\nworks such as the Internet. It can be connected though\ngateways if this\
    \ link is needed. This network architecture\nis suitable for some smart city applications\
    \ such as auto-\nmatic parking management in which most of the network\nconnections\
    \ are mainly to support the application. The\nQoS requirements in this network\
    \ architecture are mainly\ndependent on the requirements of the application.\n\
    In the ubiquitous network architecture, smart objects\nincluding the sensors and\
    \ actuators are part of the Inter-\nnet. Information from these smart objects\
    \ can be obtained\nby authorized users and applications through the Internet\n\
    directly or through intermediate servers which serve as\nsinks that gather data\
    \ from the connected smart objects.\nThe servers’ option can provide better scalability\
    \ and\nresource efficiency than the direct access option. The\nsmart objects can\
    \ be connected to the Internet through\nmultitier and multiradio. This network\
    \ architecture is\nsuitable for smart city applications such as structure\nJawhar\
    \ et al. Journal of Internet Services and Applications            (2018) 9:26\
    \ \nPage 3 of 16\nhealth monitoring in which multiple software applica-\ntions\
    \ can collect and analyze different structures’ health\nin a city. The QoS of\
    \ such network architecture can be\nchallenging due to the level of heterogenous\
    \ network\ncomponents used. The application layer overlay network\narchitecture\
    \ is suitable for large scale networks with a\nlarge number of distributed nodes.\
    \ These nodes can be\nlogically structured in clusters with cluster heads that\n\
    can run in-network data processing task to reduce net-\nwork traffics. In this\
    \ network architecture ad hoc and/or\nmesh are used. One application of this network\
    \ archi-\ntecture is using a wireless sensor network (WSN) for\nenvironmental\
    \ monitoring. The QoS for applications suit-\nable for such architecture is generally\
    \ tolerable to some\nlevel. The service-oriented network architecture is based\n\
    on an innovative network architecture, called Informa-\ntion Driven Architecture\
    \ (IDRA) [18]. In this architecture\ndifferent network functions such as addressing,\
    \ naming,\nforwarding, and routing are provided as network services.\nThese network\
    \ services can be utilized to provide differ-\nent network configurations to suit\
    \ different applications.\nAlthough, this approach can be very useful, flexible\
    \ and\ncan provide advanced network features, it requires new\nnetwork components\
    \ technology. The participatory sens-\ning network architecture is considered\
    \ a special case and\na new model of IoT. In this model, residents through their\n\
    consumer devices collect, analyze, and share sensor data.\nThis can be called\
    \ “human-as-a-sensor”. In this mode,\nwireless communications such as WiFi, GPRS,\
    \ and 3G are\nused. Some possible applications of this architecture are\nenvironmental\
    \ monitoring, intelligent transportation, and\nhealthcare. QoS in such network\
    \ can be challenging as\nhumans are the main source of data and humans can be\n\
    lazy, privacy-worried, error-prone, and misbehaving.\nUnlike other related work,\
    \ our contributions in this\npaper is mainly in investigating networking architec-\n\
    tures focusing on the communication characteristics and\nrequirements of the main\
    \ smart city applications includ-\ning smart buildings, smart grids, gas and oil\
    \ pipeline\nmonitoring and control, smart water network, intelli-\ngent transportation,\
    \ manufacturing control and monitor-\ning, and unmanned aerial vehicle applications\
    \ for smart\ncities. The works we studied usually focus on a sin-\ngle attribute\
    \ or characteristic such as quality of service\nin [17]. We considered several\
    \ communication charac-\nteristics and requirements including bandwidth, delay\n\
    tolerance, power consumption, reliability, security, het-\nerogeneous network\
    \ support, network type, and mobility\nsupport. In addition, we studied the suitability\
    \ of different\nnetworking protocols for different smart city applications.\n\
    These protocols are IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.15.1\n(Bluetooth), IEEE 802.11a,\
    \ IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g,\nIEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), Cellular 3G,\
    \ Cel-\nlular 4G/LTE, and Satellite. With this, we are providing\na comprehensive\
    \ study in networking architectures and\nprotocols for smart city systems.\n3\n\
    Smart city applications\nDevelopment and operation of smart city applications\n\
    can face many challenges. To identify and understand\nthese challenges, we discuss\
    \ some important smart city\napplications used or proposed for different domains.\
    \ We\nhighlight their benefits as well as their development and\noperational challenges.\
    \ This will help us identify the type\nof support needed by the networking platforms\
    \ designed\nfor smart city applications.\nIn the energy domain, smart city applications\
    \ are used\nto add values such as efficiency, reliability, and sustainabil-\n\
    ity of the production and distribution of electric power\nin smart grids [19].\
    \ A smart grid is a renovated electri-\ncal grid system that uses information\
    \ and communication\ntechnology (ICT) to collect and act on available informa-\n\
    tion about the behavior of suppliers and consumers in an\nautomated fashion. A\
    \ smart grid uses CPS to provide self-\nmonitoring and advanced control mechanisms\
    \ for power\nproductions and consumer needs to increase grid effi-\nciency and\
    \ reliability. In addition, CPS systems are used\nto control the processes of\
    \ generating renewable energy\nfrom hydropower plants [20] and wind power plants\
    \ [21].\nFurthermore, some applications are used to monitor and\ncontrol energy\
    \ consumptions in smart buildings [3]. The\nbuildings’ equipment such as HVAC\
    \ (Heating, Ventilating,\nand Air-Conditioning) systems, appliances, and lighting\n\
    systems are controlled with CPS. Smart building sys-\ntems are usually equipped\
    \ with different types of sensor\nnodes that monitor the current energy usage\
    \ and envi-\nronmental conditions. These sensors report their obser-\nvations\
    \ and measurements to a centralized monitoring\nand control system. The control\
    \ system implements intel-\nligent algorithms to control the sub-systems used\
    \ in the\nbuildings to optimize energy usage based on the sensed\nobservations\
    \ and current operational and environmental\nconditions.\nIn the transportation\
    \ domain, an important smart city\napplication area that recently received high\
    \ attention is\nintelligent transportation. Vehicular safety applications\nconstitute\
    \ one of the most important classes of such\napplications. There are many safety\
    \ applications for vehi-\ncles including lane change warning messages, emergency\n\
    breaking, collision avoidance mechanisms, and blind spot\nmonitoring. These applications\
    \ provide fully automatic\nor semi-automatic actions to enhance driving safety.\
    \ The\nmost important features of such applications are the real-\ntime and reliability\
    \ support in detection and response.\nAll aspects of vehicular safety applications\
    \ including\nthreat observations, decision making, communication,\nand actions\
    \ must be reliable and able to run in real-time.\nThis imposes a serious restriction\
    \ on how the software\nJawhar et al. Journal of Internet Services and Applications\
    \            (2018) 9:26 \nPage 4 of 16\nis designed and how well it supports\
    \ high levels of\nintegration across all the devices involved to ensure real-\n\
    time and reliable responses. In addition, self-driving cars\nare considered as\
    \ important smart city applications [22].\nSince they practically integrate all\
    \ the mentioned features\nin addition to vision and monitoring components to allow\n\
    the vehicle to navigate the roads based on sensed data\nand intelligent software\
    \ that interprets and responds to\nthis data in real-time. Another intelligent\
    \ transportation\napplication include intelligent traffic light controls, which\n\
    include monitoring devices across multiple locations to\naccurately predict traffic\
    \ patterns and adjust traffic lights\nto optimize flow. One example of such domain\
    \ is dis-\ncussed in [23].\nIn addition, smart city systems can be used to protect\n\
    water networks and to make them smarter, more efficient,\nmore reliable, and more\
    \ sustainable. CPS systems can be\nembedded within water networks to provide some\
    \ moni-\ntoring and control mechanisms and to add smart features\nto the operations\
    \ of water distribution [24]. One of these\nfunctions is to provide early warning\
    \ mechanisms to iden-\ntify problems in water networks. For examples, leaks and\n\
    pipe bursts can be easily detected while fast and tempo-\nrary solutions can be\
    \ applied to reduce water waste and to\nminimize further risks or damages to the\
    \ network.\nOther smart city applications include greenhouse mon-\nitoring that\
    \ aims to provide efficient control for suitable\nclimate, soil, lighting, and\
    \ water level in greenhouses [25].\nIn addition, some applications involve autonomous\
    \ oper-\nation of unmanned vehicles using CPS systems. Such sys-\ntems provide\
    \ networks that connect the payloads on the\nunmanned vehicles like sensors, actuators,\
    \ cameras, stor-\nage, communication devices, and microcontrollers [26].\nAdditional\
    \ smart city systems are also used to auto-\nmate, control, monitor, and enhance\
    \ manufacturing pro-\ncesses [27]. Finally, monitoring and controlling oil, and\n\
    gas pipelines is another one of the applications for smart\ncities. We discuss\
    \ the corresponding architecture and\nfeatures of this and other important applications\
    \ in the\nsection illustrating selected smart city systems later in this\npaper.\n\
    4\nSmart city networking architectures and\ncommunication requirements\nIn this\
    \ section, we investigate the different networking\nand communication requirements\
    \ of the various smart\ncity applications, as well as the protocols that can be\n\
    used to connect the components used to support such\napplications.\n4.1\nNetworking\
    \ characteristics, requirements, and\nchallenges of smart city systems\nTable\
    \ 1 describes the various smart city applications along\nwith the appropriate\
    \ networking protocols that can be\nused, the bandwidth requirements, the delay\
    \ tolerance,\npower consumption level, reliability and security require-\nments,\
    \ heterogeneity of the networking links, whether\nthey use wired communication,\
    \ wireless communication,\nor both, and the mobility characteristics for each\
    \ of these\napplications.\n4.1.1\nNetwork protocols\nAs shown in the table, applications\
    \ with short range com-\nmunication such as smart buildings, and smart water\n\
    networks can use protocols from the personal area net-\nwork (PAN) class such\
    \ as IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), and\n801.15.1 (Bluetooth). These protocols are generally\
    \ char-\nacterized by lower bandwidth, low energy consumption,\nand short range.\
    \ Applications requiring longer ranges\nsuch as intelligent transportation, and\
    \ manufacturing and\ncontrol use protocols, which are in the local area network\n\
    (LAN) class, such as IEEE 802.11 (WiFi). Applications\nrequiring wide range communication\
    \ such as UAVs and\nsmart grid can use protocols that are in the wide area\nnetwork\
    \ (WAN) class such as IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), cel-\nlular, and satellite. All of\
    \ these protocols have provisions\nto support asynchronous and synchronous data\
    \ connec-\ntions. The former can be used with smart city applications\nwith best\
    \ effort traffic, which can tolerate delay, while\nthe latter can be used with\
    \ applications that generate\ntraffic requiring more stringent quality of service\
    \ (QoS)\nrequirements such as larger bandwidth and limited delay.\nSuch applications\
    \ involve real-time and multimedia com-\nmunication. In addition, these protocols\
    \ have reliability\nand security services. However, most of the security fea-\n\
    tures require more processing, and can cause added delay\nand energy consumption.\
    \ Consequently, these considera-\ntions should be taken into account before enabling\
    \ such\nfeatures.\n4.1.2\nBandwidth\nAlso, the table shows that certain applications,\
    \ such as\nintelligent transportation, have low bandwidth require-\nments. Others,\
    \ such as smart buildings, gas and oil\npipeline monitoring, and UAVs require\
    \ more bandwidth.\nHowever, even inside the same type of applications, the\nbandwidth\
    \ requirements can range from low to medium\nor even high, depending on the type\
    \ of data that is gen-\nerated. For example, telemetric and control data such\
    \ as\nUAV ground-to-air control commands only require small\nbandwidth, while\
    \ UAVs taking images and videos, and\ntransmitting them to ground base units require\
    \ consider-\nably larger bandwidth.\n4.1.3\nDelay tolerance\nIn addition, it is\
    \ shown that some applications have\nlow tolerance for end-to-end delay. Such\
    \ applications\ninclude intelligent transportation. This is the case, since\n\

    \ being transmitted needs to arrive\nwithin microseconds in order to allow the\
    \ control sys-\ntems to react within an acceptable time frame to avoid\ncar imminent\
    \ danger or life-threatening collisions. On\nthe other hand, other smart city\
    \ applications have\nhigher tolerance for delay. These applications include\n\
    ones that rely on the collection of information and\nmonitoring data for later\
    \ analysis. Examples of such\napplications\ninclude\nUAVs\ntaking\nimages\nfor\n\
    later\nprocessing.\n4.1.4\nPower consumption\nPower consumption is also an important\
    \ requirement for\nsmart city applications. However, as shown in the table,\n\
    some applications that have local high energy sources\nsuch as smart grid systems,\
    \ can tolerate protocols with\nhigher power consumption levels. Other applications,\n\
    which have energy sources with limited capacities have\nmedium power requirements.\
    \ Such applications include\nintelligent transportation. Other applications have\
    \ very\nlimited energy sources and require protocols with low or\nvery low energy\
    \ consumption characteristics. Such appli-\ncations include gas and oil pipeline\
    \ monitoring, smart\nwater networks, and UAVs.\n4.1.5\nReliability\nReliability\
    \ is another important parameter in smart city\napplications, and the table shows\
    \ that most applications\neither have medium reliability requirements such as\
    \ smart\nwater networks, while others have high reliability require-\nments such\
    \ as smart grid, and intelligent transportation.\n4.1.6\nSecurity\nWith respect\
    \ to security, most applications require\nmedium to high security. For example,\
    \ applications such\nas manufacturing control and monitoring require medium\n\
    security, while others such as smart grid have high secu-\nrity requirements due\
    \ to the sensitivity of the data and\ncriticality of the functions that are performed.\n\
    4.1.7\nHeterogeneity of network protocols\nMost smart city systems include networking\
    \ protocols,\nwhich connect the various components within the system.\nExamples\
    \ of such systems include include smart buildings,\nand intelligent transportation.\
    \ In such cases, these pro-\ntocols must be able to co-exist without interfering\
    \ with\neach other. In addition, appropriate mapping of the vari-\nous control\
    \ information inside the headers at the various\nlayers of the networking stack\
    \ of the different heteroge-\nneous protocols and networks must be done to ensure\n\
    seamless and efficient operation.\n4.1.8\nWired/wireless connectivity\nThe table\
    \ also shows that some smart city applica-\ntions such as gas and oil pipeline\
    \ monitoring, and UAVs\nmostly involve wireless communication. Others, such as\n\
    smart buildings and intelligent transportation involve\nboth wired as well as\
    \ wireless communication. In such\nJawhar et al. Journal of Internet Services\
    \ and Applications            (2018) 9:26 \nPage 6 of 16\ncases, communication\
    \ within a particular physical system\ncan use wired networking (e.g. inside a\
    \ UAV), while wire-\nless communication can be used to connect the physical\n\
    system with other similar physical systems, or backbone\nand infrastructure networks.\n\
    4.1.9\nMobility\nFinally, mobility is another important characteristic of\nsmart\
    \ city applications. The table shows that some sys-\ntems have low or medium mobility\
    \ such as smart grid, gas\nand oil pipeline monitoring, and smart water networks.\n\
    Other systems have high mobility such as intelligent trans-\nportation, and UAVs.\
    \ Consequently, the networking pro-\ntocols that are used to connect medium to\
    \ high mobility\nsmart city systems must be robust and adapt well to\nnode mobility\
    \ without consuming too much bandwidth\non control messages and related processing\
    \ to readjust to\nchanges in the network topology.\n4.2\nAdditional issues and\
    \ challenges\nIn addition to the requirements and characterization of\nthe links\
    \ between nodes in smart city systems, we identify\nthe following additional issues\
    \ and challenges, which must\nbe considered.\n4.2.1\nInteroperability\nSmart city\
    \ systems rely on various heterogeneous net-\nworking protocols at the physical\
    \ and data link layers,\nwhich use different medium access control (MAC) strate-\n\
    gies Interoperability between these protocols is important\nin order to provide\
    \ seamless integration of the underly-\ning technologies. The IEEE 1905.1 protocol,\
    \ which was\ndesigned to provide convergent interface between physi-\ncal/data\
    \ link layers and the network layer is intended to\nplay such a role for digital\
    \ home networks [28]. Develop-\nment of similar protocols to expand the support\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart city systems is a good area for future\nresearch.\n4.2.2\n\
    Availability\nSoftware and hardware availability are essential compo-\nnents of\
    \ smart city systems due to the criticality and real-\ntime nature of a lot of\
    \ the related applications. Software\navailability can be achieved by ensuring\
    \ that the various\nservices are available to the corresponding applications.\n\
    On the other hand, hardware availability is obtained by\nensuring that the various\
    \ devices that are needed to pro-\nvide networking contestability and efficient\
    \ performance\nare readily available anytime and anywhere. One way to\naccomplish\
    \ these objectives is through redundancy of\nboth software and hardware components\
    \ and systems.\nThis was already considered and studied for IoT devices\n[29,\
    \ 30]. Furthermore, considerations to attain availability\nneed to be incorporated\
    \ as a part of the design objectives\nof networking and communication protocols\
    \ for smart\ncity systems.\n4.2.3\nPerformance\nPerformance is always an important\
    \ consideration for any\ntype of architecture, and this is also the case for smart\n\
    city systems. In order to achieve this essential objective,\nmore evaluation needs\
    \ to be done for the various net-\nworking protocols at the various layers of\
    \ the architecture,\nespecially at the data link, network and transport layers.\n\
    These three layers are critical components in order to sup-\nport traffic of various\
    \ QoS requirements. In addition, the\nmiddleware layer can be used to provide\
    \ proper interface\nand convergence services between these layers and the\napplication\
    \ layer.\n4.2.4\nManagement\nAnother important aspect of smart city system net-\n\
    working is management of the thousands or even mil-\nlions of devices that are\
    \ involved in many applications.\nFor example, to achieve energy management in\
    \ smart\nbuildings thousands of sensor and actor devices can be\ndeployed in each\
    \ building. Efficient protocols are needed\nto provide effective management of\
    \ fault, configuration,\naccounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) aspects\n\
    of these devices. The Light-weight machine-to-machine\n(LWM2M) [31] standard is\
    \ being done by the Open\nMobile Alliance to specify the interface between M2M\n\
    devices and servers. On the other hand, the NETCONF\nLight protocol [32] is designed\
    \ by IETF to provide mech-\nanisms to install, manipulate and delete the configuration\n\
    of network devices. Similar efforts are encouraged for\nsmart city systems in\
    \ order to offer standard mechanisms\nand services to efficiently manage and control\
    \ the commu-\nnication of devices at the various levels of the architecture.\n\
    4.2.5\nScalability\nIt is important for smart city systems to be able to accom-\n\
    modate new devices without appreciable loss in the qual-\nity of the provided\
    \ services and associated network traffic\nflows. This can be accomplished through\
    \ virtualization\nand extensibility in the platforms and their operations. An\n\
    extensible IoT architecture was proposed in [33], which\nconsists of three layers:\
    \ Virtual object, Composite virtual\nobject, and Service layer. The design must\
    \ have objec-\ntives of automation, intelligence, and zero-configuration\nfor\
    \ objects and related devices in order to achieve scal-\nability and interoperability.\
    \ More research is desirable in\norder to extend this strategy to smart city systems.\n\
    4.2.6\nBig data analytics\nHuge amounts of data is collected by smart city systems\n\
    and the corresponding IoT devices that are spread out\nover a considerably larger\
    \ geographic area. Analyzing and\nextracting useful information from this data\
    \ can provide\nJawhar et al. Journal of Internet Services and Applications   \
    \         (2018) 9:26 \nPage 7 of 16\nconsiderable advantages for businesses and\
    \ government\ninstitutions. In addition, communication and collection\nof a very\
    \ large number of messages in a timely fashion\naccording to their priority, delay-tolerance,\
    \ and size is vital\nto the efficient operation of smart city systems. In order\
    \ to\nreduce the amount of exchanged traffic, local processing,\ncompression,\
    \ and aggregation of the generated messages\nneed to be done at the lower and\
    \ intermediate levels of the\nnode hierarchy and geographic areas. Consequently,\
    \ More\nresearch is needed to provide proper convergence and\nmapping of the networking\
    \ parameters between the vari-\nous layers of the networking stack at the data-generating\n\
    nodes (e.g. sensors, IoT devices, etc.), the intermediate\nrouters, processing\
    \ servers (typically in the cloud), and\nactor nodes at the other end of the communication\
    \ cycle.\n4.2.7\nCloud computing\nCloud computing is an important component of\
    \ any smart\ncity as it can provide scalable processing power and data\nstorage\
    \ for different smart city applications [34]. Cloud\ncomputing has powerful processing\
    \ capabilities, large and\nscalable data storage, and advanced software services\
    \ that\ncan be utilized to build different support services to provi-\nsion diverse\
    \ smart city applications. Cloud computing can\nbe used as the main control and\
    \ management platform\nused to execute smart city applications. Different sensors\n\
    and actuators of smart city applications can be connected\nto the city’s cloud\
    \ computing services to collect, pro-\ncess, store the sensors’ data and perform\
    \ management\ntasks for different smart city applications. As the col-\nlected\
    \ data from a smart city can also become big data\nas huge amounts of data are\
    \ collected throughout the\ncity. Cloud computing can provide the necessary power-\n\
    ful platforms for storing and processing this big data to\nenhance operations\
    \ and planning.\nThe communication between city sensors and actua-\ntors and cloud\
    \ computing can involve different commu-\nnication requirements to smoothly support\
    \ smart city\napplications. These requirements should be supported\nby the network\
    \ architectures deployed in the smart city.\nSmart applications rely on the integration\
    \ between sen-\nsors and actuators on one side and the cloud on the\nother and\
    \ cannot performed well unless there is a good\nnetwork that provides good communication\
    \ services con-\nnecting both sides. Another issue that arises when using\ncloud\
    \ computing for a smart city is that the cloud ser-\nvices are either offered\
    \ at a centralized location or across\nmultiple distributed platform in various\
    \ locations. The\ndistributed cloud computing approach can provide better\nquality\
    \ and reliability support for different cloud appli-\ncations [35]. However, there\
    \ is usually a need to provide\ngood communication links among the distributed\
    \ cloud\ncomputing facilities available in different places. Another\nissue arising\
    \ when using the cloud is the reliability and\nperformance of the networks connecting\
    \ all components\non both sides. With the Internet in the mix, there are prob-\n\
    lems with delays, lost packets and unstable connections.\nCareful planning and\
    \ management of network resources\nand communication models in addition to the\
    \ design and\narchitecture of the smart city application is necessary to\naccount\
    \ for these issues. Yet, there are some unavoidable\naspects such as the transmission\
    \ delays.\n4.2.8\nFog computing\nWhile cloud computing can provide many advanced\
    \ and\nbeneficial services for smart city applications, it can-\nnot provide good\
    \ provisions for distributed applications\nthat need real-time, mobility, low-latency,\
    \ data streaming,\nsynchronization, coordination, and interaction support\nservices.\
    \ This is mainly due to the transmission delays\nimposed by the large distances\
    \ to be covered between the\nsmart city censors and devices and the cloud platforms.\
    \ In\naddition, it is difficult for cloud computing to manage and\ndeal with a\
    \ large number of heterogenous sensors, actua-\ntors, and other devices distributed\
    \ over a large-area. Fog\ncomputing was lately introduced to offer more localized,\n\
    low latency, and mobility services. Fog computing allows\nto move some functionalities\
    \ from the cloud closer to the\ndevices [36]. This approach aims to enable different\
    \ IoT\napplications through distributed fog nodes that provide\nlocalized services\
    \ to support these IoT applications. In a\nsmart city, fog computing can complement\
    \ cloud comput-\ning to support smart city applications [37]. While cloud\ncomputing\
    \ can provide powerful and scalable services for\nsmart city applications, fog\
    \ computing can provide more\nlocalized, fast-response, mobility, and data streaming\
    \ ser-\nvices for smart city applications. Furthermore, integrating\nIoT, fog\
    \ computing, and cloud computing as shown in\nFig. 1 can provide a powerful platform\
    \ to support different\nsmart city applications. Figure 2 shows a hierarchical\
    \ rep-\nresentation where the IoT devices use a multihop topology\nto reach the\
    \ gateway connecting to the fog server. This\nintegrated platform needs good networking\
    \ and commu-\nnication support to efficiently handle the communication\nbetween\
    \ all these components. This also includes a good\nnetwork security support to\
    \ avoid any threat vulnerabil-\nity issues in the integration and in supporting\
    \ smart city\napplications.\n4.3\nLinks between nodes in smart city systems\n\
    Table 2 describes the various networking protocols that\ncan be used in smart\
    \ city systems [38–40]. The table shows\ntheir main characteristics, the physical\
    \ and data link layer\nspecifications, their data rates, and transmission range.\n\
    We can see that the applications requiring short range\nsuch as smart buildings,\
    \ smart grid and smart water, gen-\nerally can use the IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee)\
    \ protocol, which\nis a very short range protocol that is mainly designed\nJawhar\
    \ et al. Journal of Internet Services and Applications            (2018) 9:26\
    \ \nPage 8 of 16\nFig. 1 An Illustration of the integration of IoT, fog computing,\
    \ and cloud computing to support smart city applications\nfor very small devices\
    \ that have very limited energy. It is\nintended to allow these devices to last\
    \ up to several years\nusing the same battery. In addition, the IEEE 802.15.1\n\
    (Bluetooth) protocol can be used by such applications.\nIt is a WPAN protocol,\
    \ which uses the 2.4 GHz band.\nIt employs a master/slave time division duplex\
    \ (TDD)\nstrategy, with a 1 Mbps data rate, and a range of 10\nto 100 m.\nThe\
    \ IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n protocol can be used with\nalmost all smart city systems.\
    \ The IEEE 802.11n proto-\ncol, which is the later version, works in the 2.4 GHz\
    \ and\n5.1 GHz ranges, uses direct sequence spread spectrum\n(DSSS) and orthogonal\
    \ frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM). It employs a carrier sense multiple\
    \ access with\ncollision avoidance (CDMA/CA) MAC strategy. It allows\nbest effort\
    \ operation using the distributed coordination\nfunction (DCF) as well as reservation-based\
    \ operation\nusing the point coordination function (PCF). The latter\nservice\
    \ is useful for multimedia audio, video, and real-\ntime data traffic, which require\
    \ QoS guarantees of certain\nparameters such as bandwidth, delay and delay jitter.\
    \ It\nsupports data rates from 15 to 150 Mbps, and has a\ncommunication range\
    \ up to 25 m.\nThe cellular 3G and 4G protocols can be used with\napplications\
    \ such as smart grid, smart water, UAVs and\npipeline monitoring. They use packet\
    \ switching for data\ncommunication and optional packet or circuit switching\n\
    for voice communication. They use frequencies in the 800\nMHz to 1900 MHz, 700\
    \ MHz, and 2500 MHz ranges.\nThey also use code division multiple access (CDMA)\
    \ and\nFig. 2 An hierarchical representation showing the integration of IoT, fog\

    cations such as UAVs, pipeline monitoring, and intel-\nligent transportation.\
    \ They typically use frequencies\nin the range of 1.53 GHz to 31 GHz. They also\n\
    employ frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and\ntime division multiple access\
    \ (TDMA) at the data\nlink layer. The data rate is between 10 Mbps (down-\nload)\
    \ and 1 Gbps (upload). Geographically, satellite\ncommunication covers the entire\
    \ earth since handoff\nbetween satellites can be used to achieve such continuous\n\
    coverage.\n5\nIllustration of selected smart city systems\nIn this section, five\
    \ selected smart city systems are briefly\npresented in order to illustrate some\
    \ possible networking\nand communication models that are used.\n5.1\nSmart grid\
    \ system\nFigure 3 shows the general architecture of a smart grid sys-\ntem, which\
    \ is one of the essential applications in a smart\ncity. As shown in the figure,\
    \ smart grid systems are divided\ninto three categories: (1) generation, (2) transportation,\n\
    and (3) consumer. In turn, the consumer systems are\nseparated into three sub-categories:\
    \ (1) commercial, (2)\nresidential, and (3) industrial. Each of these sites usu-\n\
    ally contains sensing and acting devices that are deployed\nto monitor and control\
    \ the different mechanisms and\nmachines that are located on the premises. These\
    \ devices\nform nodes in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) or a\nwireless sensor\
    \ and actor network (WSAN). The nodes\ncan communicate using multihop networking\
    \ protocols\nspecifically designed for MANETs and WSANs [41, 42].\nUsually, one\
    \ (or more) of the nodes plays the role of a gate-\nway and it provides connectivity\
    \ to the network at that\nsite with the infrastructure LAN or the Internet. Cloud\n\
    computing platforms can also be used to provide storage,\nanalysis, processing\
    \ and decision making services to the\nsmart grid network system [43]. In addition,\
    \ the control\ncenter and various users can collect information and issue\nJawhar\
    \ et al. Journal of Internet Services and Applications            (2018) 9:26\
    \ \nPage 10 of 16\nFig. 3 The general architecture for a smart grid system used\
    \ in a smart city\nrequests and commands to provide real-time control of\nthe\
    \ corresponding systems.\n5.2\nSmart home energy management\nIn a typical smart\
    \ city, the electric company will have\ndifferent rates for different time periods.\
    \ Typically these\nperiods would be three: Peak, Mid-Peak, and OFF-Peak.\nAlso,\
    \ most homes would be equipped with environment-\nfriendly local energy generation\
    \ sources such as wind-\nmills, solar panels, or photovoltaic cells (PVC). In\
    \ Fig. 4, a\ngeneral architecture of a smart home energy management\nsystem is\
    \ shown. In this model, when a specific service is\nrequested from a particular\
    \ appliance (e.g. wash the laun-\ndry, run the dishwasher, use a robot to clean\
    \ the pool, etc.),\nthe energy management unit (EMU) is used to decide\nwhich\
    \ energy source is used to supply the requested power\nand the time to turn ON\
    \ the corresponding electric appli-\nance. The user enters the requested task\
    \ (or service) to be\ncarried out by a particular appliance along with a dead-\n\
    line (or an amount of acceptable delay) by which the task\nneeds to be accomplished.\
    \ This allows the EMU to calcu-\nlate the amount of maximum delay that can be\
    \ tolerated\nfor the performance of the task. Then it performs an algo-\nrithm,\
    \ which determines the source of the energy and the\ntime for executing the desired\
    \ task by the indicated appli-\nance. The algorithm consists of the following\
    \ logic. If the\namount of energy that is needed by the task is available\nin\
    \ the locally generated/stored energy, then it runs the\nappliance immediately\
    \ using the local energy storage as a\nsource. Otherwise, it tries to shift the\
    \ time of running the\nappliance to the OFF-Peak period, with the electric com-\n\
    pany as a source, using the maximum tolerable delay that\nis calculated based\
    \ on the user input. If the delay does not\nallow such shifting, it tries to shift\
    \ the task executing to\nthe Mid-peak period. Otherwise, if the shifting is not\
    \ pos-\nsible, it executes the task during the current time period.\nThis type\
    \ of energy management system provides consid-\nerable environmental benefits.\
    \ It also lowers the cost of\nenergy for both the user as well as the electric\
    \ company.\n5.3\nSmart water systems\nFigure 5 shows the general architecture\
    \ of a smart water\nsystem, which is another important smart city application.\n\
    The system is used to monitor and control the irrigation\nof the soil with various\
    \ types of crops using an optimized\nprocess. In general, sensing devices are\
    \ placed in selected\nareas in the farm in order to monitor different parame-\n\
    ters such as temperature, and moisture of the soil. Actor\ndevices are used to\
    \ control different activities such as the\ntime and amount of water that is provided\
    \ by the sys-\ntem. Both sensor and actor devices constitute nodes in\na WSAN.\
    \ The nodes can have various topologies includ-\ning mesh and star configurations.\
    \ In either case, one of\nthe nodes acts as a gateway to provide connectivity\
    \ to the\nsink, which in turn connects the WSANs to the backbone\nLAN or the Internet.\
    \ Cloud computing platforms can\nalso be used to provide storage, analysis, processing,\
    \ and\ndecision making services. The figure also shows that dif-\nferent databases\
    \ can be used to provide plant and weather\nrelated information to the system.\
    \ Such information is\nJawhar et al. Journal of Internet Services and Applications\

    \ of issuing alert notifications to the\nusers whenever it is appropriate. In\
    \ addition, the net-\nwork is connected to the control center, which oversees\n\
    the operations. It also issues different configuration and\ncommand requests to\
    \ supervise and manage the network.\n5.4\nUAV and Commercial Aircraft Safety Communication\n\
    Due to the several challenges of the new aeronautical\napplications including\
    \ emerging UAV applications for\nFig. 5 The general architecture for a smart water\
    \ system used in a smart city\nJawhar et al. Journal of Internet Services and\
    \ Applications            (2018) 9:26 \nPage 12 of 16\nsmart cities, there are\
    \ high needs to define new com-\nmunication solutions, which can effectively support\
    \ these\nnew applications. The National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration\
    \ (NASA) in the United States and the\nEuropean Organization for the Safety of\
    \ Air Navigation\n(EUROCONTROL) are leading the development of new\ncommunication\
    \ systems. A standard for UAS Control\nand Non-Payload Communication (CNPC) links\
    \ is being\ndeveloped in the United States to enable safe integration\nof UAS\
    \ operations within the National Airspace System\n(NAS) [44]. NAS is the main\
    \ aviation system in the United\nStates that involves, the US airspace, airports,\
    \ and moni-\ntoring and control equipment and services that implement\nthe enforced\
    \ rules, regulations, policies, and procedures.\nThis system covers the airspace\
    \ of the United States and\nlarge portions of the oceans. Some of its components\
    \ are\nalso shared with the military air force. For safe integration\nof UAS operations\
    \ in NAS, sense and avoid techniques,\naircraft-human interface, air traffic management\
    \ policies\nand procedures, certification requirements, and CNPC\nare being studied\
    \ [45]. This integration allows UAVs to\nfunction within the airspace used for\
    \ manned aircrafts\nused for carrying passengers and cargo.\nCNPC links are defined\
    \ to provide communication\nconnections to be used for aircraft safety applications\n\
    and to enable remote pilots and other ground stations\nto control and monitor\
    \ the UAVs. Figure 6 show an\nillustration of required communication links between\n\
    the UAVs, commercial airlines, and the control center.\nThis involves several\
    \ issues including communication\narchitecture types as well as rate, bandwidth,\
    \ frequency\nspectrum allocation, security, and reliability require-\nments. Two\
    \ communication architecture types were\nproposed including line-of-sight (LOS)\
    \ communication,\nwhich provides communication with unmanned air-\ncrafts through\
    \ ground-based communication stations and\nbeyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communication,\
    \ which pro-\nvides communication with unmanned aircrafts through\nsatellites.\
    \ The communication rates requirements for\nboth uplink (ground-to-air) and downlink\
    \ (air-to-ground)\nwere defined based on the size of unmanned aircrafts\nas shown\
    \ in Table 3. The uplink rates are much lower\nthan downlink rates as the uplink\
    \ communication will\nbe mainly used to send small messages to control the\nunmanned\
    \ aircrafts while the downlink communication\nis used for different types of communication\
    \ includ-\ning video transmission. The uplink rate was determined\nto support\
    \ transmission of 20 individual control mes-\nsages per second. This rate is required\
    \ to provide a\ncomplete real-time ground control for a UAV using a\njoystick\
    \ [44].\nThe supported density requirements of unmanned air-\ncrafts that use\
    \ CNPC to the year 2030 are also specified\n[45] and shown in Table 4. The third\
    \ column shows the\nnumbers of unmanned aircrafts (of different sizes) that\n\
    can be supported if a terrestrial-based communication\nlink of radius 100 Km is\
    \ used.\nBased on the defined UAV density, the required band-\nwidth for CNPC\
    \ links is 90 MHz divided into 34 MHz\nfor the terrestrial-based LOS CNPC links\
    \ and 56 MHz\nfor the BLOS CNPC links [44]. Two frequency spectrum\nranges were\
    \ assigned by the 2012 International Telecom-\nmunications Union World Radio Communications\
    \ Con-\nference (WRC-12) to be used by CNPC to provide reliable\nand real-time\
    \ data transmissions. These frequency spec-\ntrums are from 960 MHz to 1164 MHz\
    \ (L-Band) and\nfrom 5030 MHz to 5091 MHz. However, a portion of the\nfirst range\
    \ will be shared with other legacy applications\nFig. 6 UAV and commercial aircraft\

    \ Another issue\nof CNPC links is the high security requirements. Good\nsecurity\
    \ mechanisms should be used on CNPC links to\navoid any possibility of spoofed\
    \ control or navigation sig-\nnals that may allow unauthorized persons to control\
    \ the\nUAVs [46]. For meeting future communication capac-\nity requirements in\
    \ aeronautical communications, a new\nair-ground communication system, called\
    \ L-Band Dig-\nital Aeronautical Communication System (L-DACS), is\nbeing developed\
    \ in Europe with funding from EURO-\nCONTROL. L-DACS is the system in the Future\
    \ Com-\nmunication System (FCS) for L-band, 960-1164 MHz.\nL-DACS comprises of\
    \ L-DACS1 [47] and L-DACS2\n[48]. L-DACS1 is multi-carrier broadband Orthogo-\n\
    nal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based sys-\ntem while L-DACS2 is narrow\
    \ band single-carrier with\nGaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation\n\
    system. More information about L-DACS1 and L-DACS2\nincluding their benefits with\
    \ the current aeronautical sys-\ntem and their physical and medium access layers\
    \ can be\nfound in [49].\n5.5\nPipeline monitoring and control\nIn this section,\
    \ we provide further discussion and illustra-\ntion of the smart city application\
    \ of monitoring pipelines\nsystems as an example of infrastructure monitoring.\n\
    Figure 7 shows a CPS system for pipeline monitoring and\ncontrol. In our previous\
    \ work in [50, 51], we present a\nframework for monitoring oil, gas, and water\
    \ pipelines\nusing linear sensor networks (LSNs). We defined an LSN\nto be a WSN\
    \ where the sensors are aligned in linear form\ndue to the linearity of the structure\
    \ or geographic area\nTable 4 CNPC supported aircraft density\nAircraft size\n\

    \ monitored, such as pipelines, borders, rivers,\nsea coasts, railroads, and more.\
    \ In the system illustrated\nin the figure, the sensor nodes (SNs) are placed\
    \ on the\npipeline in order to monitor various important parame-\nters such as\
    \ temperature, pressure, fluid velocity, chemical\nsubstances, leaks, etc. The\
    \ collected data could either be\nrouted to the sink, which is placed at the end\
    \ of the\npipeline or pipeline segment using a multihop strategy\n[51], or it\
    \ could be collected using a mobile node such as\na low flying UAV [52]. In the\
    \ latter case, the SN trans-\nmits its stored data to the UAV when it comes within\
    \ its\nrange. The UAV, which flies along the pipeline, delivers\nthe collected\
    \ data to the sink at the other end. Once the\ndata arrives at the sink using\
    \ either one of these strategies,\nit transmits the data to the infrastructure\
    \ network using\nany one of the communication networks that are available\nin\
    \ the area such as IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), cellular, and\nsatellite.\nThe storage\
    \ and processing servers that are used by the\nCPS system can be a part of the\
    \ cloud computing environ-\nment. The results are then sent in appropriate format\
    \ to\nthe network control center (NCC), where they can be pre-\nsented to the\
    \ NCC personnel using applications that allow\nvisualization of the pipeline structure.\
    \ The graphic repre-\nsentation that is displayed can show the pipeline’s current\n\
    status as well as any anomalies that need more attention\nand further inspection.\
    \ The NCC officers can then issue\ncertain commands back to the SNs in a particular\
    \ hot spot.\nAlternatively, such commands might be automatically\nissued by the\
    \ CPS system in accordance with algorithms\nand configurations that are programmed\
    \ by the sys-\ntem administrators. The command messages intended to\nreach the\
    \ target SNs are communicated via the network,\nthe sink, and other SNs (if the\
    \ multihop routing strategy is\nused) or the UAV (if UAV-based communication is\
    \ used).\nAn example of such commands could be: (1) increase the\nquantity and/or\
    \ quality of the collected data, (2) turn ON\nmore SNs in the hot spot, and (3)\
    \ turn ON additional\nsensing or monitoring devices (that might be in sleep-\n\
    mode to save energy) such as higher resolution cameras,\nas well as audio or video\
    \ monitoring equipment. Also,\nthe NCC might dispatch specialized UAVs and/or\
    \ quick\nresponse teams for further inspection, or to take remedial\nemergency\
    \ actions (put out fire, etc.) In other cases, the\ncollected data can be used\
    \ to generate appropriate main-\ntenance schedules, which could result in the\
    \ service of\nvarious parts of the pipeline according to a pre-set priority\n\
    strategy.\n6\nOpen issues\nIn this section, we identify some of the most important\n\
    open issues that need further research and investigation in\nthe area of networking\
    \ and communication in smart city\nsystems.\nJawhar et al. Journal of Internet\
    \ Services and Applications            (2018) 9:26 \nPage 14 of 16\nFig. 7 CPS\
    \ for pipeline monitoring and control\n6.1\nCommunication middleware for smart\
    \ city\napplications\nAs a smart city network can consist of different devices,\n\
    communication technologies, and protocols, managing\nsuch a network can be very\
    \ complex. One of the pos-\nsible approaches to relax this complexity is to use\n\
    a specialized communication middleware capable of\nabstracting these communication\
    \ details. In addition, this\nmiddleware can offer value-added features that are\
    \ com-\nmonly needed for different smart city applications and\nare not fully\
    \ supported by existing network technolo-\ngies. These features can include provisions\
    \ and services\nfor security, reliability, scalability, and quality of service\n\
    provisioning.\n6.2\nSoftware defined network support for smart city\napplications\n\
    Software defined networking (SDN) is an approach to\nenable flexible and efficient\
    \ network configuration to\nenhance a network. SDN can provide many advantages\n\
    for configuring city networks to support different appli-\ncations. While there\
    \ are some efforts in investigating this\napproach for supporting smart city applications\
    \ [37], there\nis room for developing more advanced management and\nnetworking\
    \ mechanisms in SDN for efficient, reliable, and\nsecure network configurations\
    \ in smart cities.\n6.3\nNew networks and network protocols\nMost of the current\
    \ communication infrastructure uses\nthe Internet infrastructure or the cellular\
    \ networks.\nAlthough these have proven to be efficient and usable,\nthey often\
    \ lack some necessary requirements for smart\ncity applications. Issues in real-time\
    \ responses, mobility\nsupport and the ability to handle huge volume of network\n\
    traffic. When a smart city application is deployed city-\nwide and collects find\
    \ grain data, it will generate massive\ntraffic, which could cause serious performance\
    \ problems\nfor the underlying network infrastructure. Some work is\nunderway\
    \ to add more capabilities such as the progres-\nsion from 3G, to 4G and now 5G\
    \ cellular networks [53],\nadvances in MESH networks and investigation of more\n\
    efficient protocols on the existing networks. However,\nthere is a lot to be done\
    \ in this regard.\n6.4\nModeling and simulation\nThere are limited efforts in\
    \ studying modeling and sim-\nulation of the communication performance of different\n\
    smart city applications on different network architectures.\nIt is important to\
    \ develop different models and simula-\ntion tools to be able to design, evaluate,\
    \ and plan for\nsuch networks. In addition, more detailed traffic pat-\nterns\
    \ of different smart applications need to be compre-\nhensively studied. Modeling\
    \ and simulation of both the\nJawhar et al. Journal of Internet Services and Applications\
    \            (2018) 9:26 \nPage 15 of 16\ntraffic of smart city applications and\
    \ the used networks’\ncapabilities may lead to better end results for the smart\n\
    city applications.\n7\nConclusions and future research\nSignificant advancements\
    \ in various technologies such as\nCPS, IoT, WSNs, cloud computing, and UAVs have\
    \ taken\nplace lately. The smart city paradigm combines these\nimportant new technologies\
    \ in order to enhance the qual-\nity of life of city inhabitants, provide efficient\
    \ utilization\nof resources, and reduce operational costs. In order for\nthis\
    \ model to reach its goals, it is essential to provide\nefficient networking and\
    \ communication between the dif-\nferent components that are involved to support\
    \ various\nsmart city applications. In this paper, we investigated the\nnetworking\
    \ requirements for the different applications\nand identified the appropriate\
    \ protocols that can be used\nat the various system levels. In addition, we illustrated\n\
    networking architectures for five different smart city sys-\ntems. This area of\
    \ research is still in its initial stages.\nFuture studies can focus on important\
    \ requirements\nincluding routing, energy efficiency, security, reliability,\n\
    mobility, and heterogeneous network support. Conse-\nquently, more investigations\
    \ and studies need to be done,\nwhich should lead to the design and development\
    \ of\nefficient networking and communication protocols and\narchitectures to meet\
    \ the growing needs of the various\nimportant and rapidly expanding smart city\
    \ applications\nand services.\nAbbreviations\nCPS: Cyber-physical systems; UAV:\

    \ date\nAbstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a thriving technol-\nogy in almost\
    \ all ﬁelds of human life to make their lives easy.\nSmart Agriculture is one\
    \ of the IoT applications on which\nfarmers are widely switching to improve productivity\
    \ and re-\nduce labor costs. As IoT involves the Internet, data transmis-\nsion\
    \ technology creates the possibility of privacy/security\nbreaches concerning\
    \ users’ data. The cybercrime rate may\nalso increase in IoT-based agriculture\
    \ (IoTA). Thus there\nmust be ready concerning digital forensics in IoTA. Various\n\
    review articles are available regarding the emerging cyber\nattack, cybercrime,\
    \ and forensics challenges in IoT appli-\ncations like smart home, smart city,\
    \ smart healthcare, smart\ngrid, smart retail, smart supply chain management,\
    \ and smart\nagriculture, while a few review articles on IoTA security and\nforensic\
    \ challenges. This review paper is focused on IoTA\nsolutions and their security\
    \ and forensics challenges. The\nsystematic literature review method has been\
    \ used for this\nstudy which includes articles published from 2011 - 2021.\nThis\
    \ article has brought the limelight on IoT architecture\nand its application in\
    \ agricluture (IoTA) to emphasize on\nits introduction, architecture, challenges\
    \ and issues related\nemerging cybercrimes and digital forensics. At the end,\
    \ this\nreview paper discusses various challenges in securing IoTA\nsystems and\
    \ presents future directions for research.\n1 Introduction\nInternet of things\
    \ (IoT) refers to interconnected things. Karl\nSteinbuch, a German computer science\
    \ pioneer, said, \"In a\nfew decades, computers will be interwoven into almost\
    \ ev-\nery industrial product .\" IoT is frequently used in the do-\nmains like\
    \ healthcare, food and restaurant industry, travel\nand tourism industry and library\
    \ services, smart home, smart\nae-mail: santoshi.phdcs21@nfsu.ac.in\nbe-mail:\
    \ parag.rughani@nfsu.ac.in\ngrid, smart retail and smart agriculture [1] [2].\
    \ The IoT mar-\nket value projected to reach from 157 billion USD in 2016\nto\
    \ 771 billion USD by 2026. Cisco predicted that by 2030,\n500 billion objects\
    \ would be connected and linked up to the\nInternet [3].\nFood Requirement will\
    \ increase by 70% more to supply\nfor an estimated population of 10.1 billion\
    \ by 2050, says the\nUN Food & Agriculture Report [4]. The volatility of food\n\
    prices, climate change and timely harvest forecasts are cru-\ncial to counteract,\
    \ which has a major impact on the economy\nand is closely linked to issues such\
    \ as malnutrition, and un-\ndernourishment, [5] [6] [7]. By 2050 the global population\n\
    of 9 billion people will face the challenge of feeding [8].\nTo deal with these\
    \ challenges and meet the need of future\nfood requirements. Agriculture 5.0 implies\
    \ that farms are\nfollowing Precision Agriculture principles and using equip-\n\
    ment that involves crewless operations and autonomous de-\ncision support systems\
    \ using the IoTA, robotics and AI [9].\nMany developed and developing counties\
    \ are widely using\nIoT based Agriculture (IoTA). It is observed that the 26.7%\n\
    global population and approximately 58% of the Indian pop-\nulation rely on agriculture\
    \ and farming to meet their liveli-\nhood. The Economic Survey of India 2020-21\
    \ report stated\nthat in FY20, the total food grain production was recorded at\n\
    296.65 million tonnes by India [10]. This high dependency\nmakes agriculture a\
    \ signiﬁcant factor in improving higher-\nyielding and better quality agriculture\
    \ and farming produc-\ntion. These higher-yielding and better quality requirements\n\
    are being taken with the help of technology. Many of the\ndeveloped and developing\
    \ countries are transforming into\nIoTA.\nIoTA is a smart technique where the\
    \ researchers have\nbeen working on inventing tools and techniques for improv-\n\
    ing the production and quality in agriculture and farming.\nIn general, technologies\
    \ like GPS (Global Positioning Sys-\ntem), sensor networks and remote sensing\
    \ are used in IoTA\n2\n[11][12]. IoTA is helpful for various farm activities like\
    \ crop\nmonitoring, automated irrigation system, insect/pest moni-\ntoring, warehousing\
    \ of food, supply chain and smart farming\nsuch as livestock management, livestock\
    \ disease monitoring,\ndairy management [13]. Many IT organizations like Google,\n\
    Microsoft, Watson, IBM, Intel, Jasper, CISCO, Dell, HPE,\nHello Tractors, Farm\
    \ 2050 and Qualcomm are continuously\ndeveloping IoTA solutions that would have\
    \ a huge economic\nimpact [14]. The authors also estimate 2.7−6.2 trillion each\n\
    year, which will bring evolution in agriculture [15]. At present,\nmore than 26\
    \ billion smart devices are in circulation, while\na forecast says that this number\
    \ will triple within the coming\n5-6 years [16].\nThis paper presents a review\
    \ of different papers on IoT\ndevices supporting agricultural use, focusing on\
    \ the applica-\ntions, the emerging cyber attack and cyber crime (CACC)\nand Digital\
    \ Forensics (DF) challenges. With many farms\n(plant and livestock, small and\
    \ large) using automation and\nremote, networked sensors to monitor and manage\
    \ the op-\nerations, from watering and feeding, to growth and health\nmonitoring,\
    \ this is a sector that has not traditionally been as-\nsociated with high risks\
    \ of computer and network security\nproblems impacting their operation. And when\
    \ security is,\nat best, an afterthought, the enterprise can be at risk. Since\n\
    the number of IoTA solutions will rise, the number of crimes\non smart agriculture\
    \ may also increase soon. Sensitive data\nprocessed through IoTA could be a luring\
    \ means for hacking\ntargets by cyber criminals targeting the agricultural sector\n\
    for ﬁnancial gain, cyber warfare, activist/political purposes,\nor to obtain intellectual\
    \ property and technological advance-\nments. This study aims to review the work\
    \ done in the ﬁelds\nof IoTA based CACC and DF challenges as listed below.\n–\
    \ Introduction to IoTA\n– IoTA architecture\n– IoTA applications and IoTA solutions\n\
    – Existing vulnerabilities in IoTA\n– Existing and novel cyber crimes on IoTA\n\
    – DF challenges in IoTA.\nThe review article is organized in following way: Sec-\n\

    \ future research and\nchallenges in IoTA tools and techniques. This article is\
    \ con-\ncluded in Section 5.\n2 Review Selection Method\nIn this article, we have\
    \ followed the article selection method-\nology using the method Systematic Literature\
    \ Review (SLR)\nshows a representation in Fig 1. The ﬁrst step was to choose\n\
    reputed journals for selecting articles from there. The second\nphase of SLR was\
    \ the article published between 2011-2022.\nThe third step was to include articles\
    \ related to IoT/IOTA\nonly. The fourth phase was to check articles related to\
    \ IoTA\nor IoT architecture, security, CACC and DF challenges. All\nthe articles\
    \ fall in these categories that have been included\nin the systematic review.\
    \ The search focused on the scientiﬁc\nresearch publishers like Elsevier, IEEE\
    \ Xplore, Springer, Wi-\nley, MDPI, Inderscience, Taylor, Francis and UGC care-listed\n\
    journals. We considered the articles which were published\nbetween 2011 and 2021.\
    \ We have also considered a few\nwhitepapers, statistical survey papers and websites\
    \ to refer\nIoTA based tools. We have considered various IoTA relevant\nkeyword\
    \ search to ﬁnd relevant articles. The keywords were\n(\"Internet of Things\"\
    \ OR \"IoTA\" OR \"AIoT\" OR \"IoT based\nAgriculture Tools OR Appliance\" OR\

    \ OR \"Smart Irrigation\" OR \"Automatic\nIrrigation\" OR \"Disease Monitoring-Detection\"\
    ) AND (\"Dig-\nital Forensic in IoT\" OR \"Challenges OR Issue in IoT\").\nIn\
    \ this SLR method, we could identiﬁed 111 articles\nfor the study. In these articles\
    \ 91 were journal papers, 12\nconference papers and 8 book chapters. We have referred\
    \ 3\nwhite papers and 10 websites additionally. The selected pa-\npers were analyzed,\
    \ considered and classiﬁed for IoTA and\nfarming applications of the method used\
    \ in this review for\narticle selection.\n3 IoT Based Agriculture (IoTA)\nIoTA\
    \ is an automated functioning system in which devices\ncommunicate over the Internet\
    \ and function according to the\nrequirements of the resources. The IoTA refers\
    \ to the usage\nof the Internet to connect sensors, Single Board Computer\n(SBC)\
    \ and servers. The Sensors sense the agriculture envi-\nronment status (plants,\
    \ crops, animals and their relative pa-\nrameters such as soil moisture, soil\
    \ nutrient ingredients, pest\nimages, water quality, climate, humidity, temperature,\
    \ crop\nstatus, animal health and reproductive system). The sensed\ndata is to\
    \ be sent to the SBC. SBCs such as Node MCU, Ar-\nduino, Raspberry pi and others\
    \ decide according to set con-\nditioned values and update the agriculture status\
    \ using the\n3\nFig. 1: Review Article Selection Method\nInternet. IoTA is used\
    \ for increasing the quality and quan-\ntity of agriculture production so that\
    \ the agriculture can be\nmonitored or operated from remote places and the action\
    \ be\ntaken by IoTA as per the requirement of the plants and an-\nimals. It reduces\
    \ the monitoring and labor costs [17]. IoTA\nallows devices to operate automatically\
    \ so that the chores in\nagriculture can be monitored and controlled remotely.\
    \ IoTA\nis being adopted widely to reduce labor costs and improve\nproductivity.\
    \ IoTA applications can manage land, animals,\ncrops and farms without human intervention.\
    \ IoTA is also re-\nferred to as smart agriculture[18], precision agriculture\
    \ [19]\n[20], digital farming [21], smart farming[22] [23], digital\nagriculture\
    \ [24].\n4 IoTA Architecture\nIn general, there are ﬁve layers in IoTA architecture\
    \ i.e. ap-\nplication layer, middleware layer, network layer, edge layer,\nphysical\
    \ layer. The illustrated with the diagram as shown\nin Fig 2 IoTA architecture\
    \ with its basic components such\nas sensors, SBC, gateway, cloud and the Internet\
    \ [25] [26]\n[27].\nIn [28] by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union\n\
    Telecommunication Standard Sector) had been supposed four\nlayered architecture\
    \ for holistic IoT. The ﬁrst is device layer\nwhich interacts with hardwares like\
    \ sensors, actuators, RFID\ntags and GPS in IoT. The second is network layer which\n\
    performs functions such as networking, communication and\ntransport. The third\
    \ layer is service and application support\nlayer and the topmost layer IoT application\
    \ layer, which\nmanages IoT applications.\nIn IoT World Forum 2014, [29] has presented\
    \ 7 layer\nbased IoT achitecture reference model by the combination\nof three\
    \ layered and ﬁve layered IoT architectures. The lay-\ners included are physical,\
    \ connectivity, edge computing, data\naccumulation, data absraction, application\
    \ and collaboration\nand processes. The physical layer manages things in IoT,\n\
    connectivity layer is resposible for communication and pro-\ncessing units. The\
    \ edge computing layer analyze data ele-\nment and transforms it. The data accumulation\
    \ layer works\nas a storage of data to be recived or sent. The abstraction\nlayer\
    \ performs aggregation and access of the data. The ap-\nplication layer controls,\
    \ performs analytics and presents re-\nport of the functionality of IoT regarding\
    \ present environ-\nment. The collaboration and process layer includes people\n\
    and business processes.\n[30] proposed a three layerd based IoTA architecture.\n\
    The authors adopted the concept of fog coputing and cloud\ncomputing in this architecture.\
    \ In which, the ﬁrst layer named\nas IoT layer includes IoTA devices such as sensors,\
    \ drones,\nSBC and actuators. The sensor measures the environmental\nvariables\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\nactivates the actuator to\
    \ perform respective function in the\nagriculture. Second is the fog layer where\
    \ IoTA devices are\nconnected with gateways by LoRaWAN or other network.\nThe\
    \ third layer is cloud layer which deals with API’s to man-\nage the data received\
    \ from the agricultral environment.\n[31] proposed four layer based IoTA architecture.\
    \ In this\nIoTA architecture, the perception layer is consists of phys-\nical\
    \ devices like sensor, actuators and microcontroller. The\nsensors fetch the data\
    \ of sensed agriculture environment and\nstored into the local server; Subsequently\
    \ after error anal-\nysis precised data is uploaded to the cloud. The network\n\
    layer performs abstraction of raw data recieved from the per-\nception layer and\
    \ trasnsmit on to the upper layers. The sen-\nsors are connected distinct communication\
    \ newtwork com-\nmunication technologies such as wireless networks like 4G,\n\
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee. The middleware layer provides\ninter-communication between\
    \ network layer and application\n4\nlayer. It also manages resourses and services\
    \ and performs\noperation the remote database. The application layer is re-\n\
    ceives data from middleware layer. It consists of interface\nmethods and communication\
    \ protocols such as MQTT, AMQL\nand CoAP. It receives encrypted data, decrypts\
    \ it using soft-\nware internally and stores data on the local machine for fu-\n\
    ture use.\n[26], presented IoTA architecture where the 3 main layer\nare discussed.\
    \ Those layer are platform layer, edge layer and\ncommunication layer. The plateform\
    \ layer perform raw data\ncollection IoTA hardwares sensing by the agricultural\
    \ envi-\nronment. The edge layer performs decision making based on\ndata merging\
    \ and processing the sensors data. The commu-\nnication layer comunicates between\
    \ gateway and cloud.\n[32], discussed three layer based IoTA architecture. The\n\
    authors considered device layer, network layer and applica-\ntion layer. They\
    \ did not include middleware layer in their\narticle.\n[33] discussed two categories\
    \ of architecture based on\nholistic IoT applications. That IoT architectures\
    \ were three\nlayered and ﬁve layer according to different vendors of IoT.\nAuthor\
    \ raised the challenge of standarization issue of the\nIoTA architectures.\n[34]\
    \ discussed a common IoTA architecture. The archi-\ntecture consists of three\
    \ layers namely IoTA hardwares, com-\nmunication technologies and data processing\
    \ and storage.\nIoTA hardwares included sensors, actuators, embedded sys-\ntem\
    \ with processor, communication modules, memory, I/O\ninterfaces and battery power.\
    \ The authours have discussed\nvarious communication technoloies such as ZigBee,\
    \ Z-Wave,\n6LoWPAN and NFC, based on various parameters as li-\ncensed, transmission\
    \ distance, frequncy and data rate.\n[35] discussed drawbacks of tradional cloud\
    \ based archi-\ntecture and to overcome the drawbacks they proposed edge\nand\
    \ fog computing architecture for IoTA. The shortcom-\nings of existing system\
    \ were as high energy consumption\nduring agricultural data transfer from and\
    \ to the cloud and\nhigh network traﬁc. The proposed architecture reduces the\n\
    load over cloud layer which minimize the energy consump-\ntion, network traﬁc\
    \ and latency for IoTA applications and\nservices. The proposed architecture consists\
    \ of four layer\nsuch as IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer and cloud\nlayer.\
    \ The IoT sensor layer responsible for all IoTA har-\nwares deployment.The edge\
    \ layer performs computation of\nsensors/actuators data at the edge of the network.\
    \ The fog\nlayer is responsible for process and analyze complex data\nreceived\
    \ from IoTA sensors through edge layer. The cloud\nlayer provides higher scalibility\
    \ and on demand computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing.\n\
    [36] proposed user centrinc IoTA architecture which con-\nsists of three main\
    \ layers perception layer, communication\nlayer and control layer. The perception\
    \ layer is responsi-\nble for data aquisition via sensors. The communication layer\n\
    \ \nPhysical Layer\nSensor                      Actuator                     \

    \ of\nthe acquired data.\n[37] proposed IoTA architecture based on the holistic\n\
    IoTA architecture. This proposed architecture contains six\nlayers namely device\
    \ layer, network layer, session layer, ap-\nplication layer, cloud layer, business\
    \ layer. The business layer\nconsists of several business modules where the information\n\
    can be accessed as per the business nature.\nThe comparision in various IoTA architectures\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Table 1. This table includes total number of layers\nused\
    \ in IoTA, layers name and function of each layer.\nAfter the reviewing the previous\
    \ work there is given lay-\nered architecture based on 5 layers as physical layer,\
    \ edge\nlayer, fog layer, application layer and cloud layer. Each lay-\ners described\
    \ in the cronological way are as follows:\nPhysical Layer: The Physical Layer\
    \ consists of physi-\ncal devices like sensors, actuators, SBC (Single Board Com-\n\
    puter) and a gateway in the farm [38]. This layer senses and\ncollects agricultural\
    \ environment based speciﬁc data through\nsensor devices. Based on the speciﬁc\
    \ type of sensor, the col-\nlected data is about location, temperature, orientation,\
    \ mo-\ntion, vibration, acceleration, humidity and chemical changes\nin the air.\
    \ The information is then passed to the Network\nlayer for its secure transmission\
    \ to the information [39]. The\n5\nTable 1: Comparision of Different IoTA Architectures\n\

    \ Layer [40].\nEdge Layer: The edge layer collects raw data from the\nphysical\
    \ layer and proceeds to the network layer based. It\nmerges sensor data and processes\
    \ it [26]. It enables the ac-\ntuators to what the conditioned value has been\
    \ set in the\nﬁrmware of IoTA. For instance, in a smart irrigation sys-\ntem,\
    \ the conditioned unit value for the soil moisture sensor\nis 1000; thus, if the\
    \ sensor provides less than 1000 soil mois-\nture values, the actuation will start.\
    \ Some of the commu-\nnication technologies namely 802.11*, Sigfox, LoRaWAN,\n\
    NBIoT, LTE-3GPP, EC-GPRS, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\nZ-Wave, 6LoWPAN and NFC used\
    \ in IoTA are categorised\nbased on distinct parameters like licenced spectrum,\
    \ trans-\nmission distance, type of network used, frequency, and data\nrate [41]\
    \ [38] [32] [42] [34]. The communication technol-\nogy allows the hardware (in\
    \ the physical layer such as sen-\nsors, actuators and the controller) to communicate\
    \ by wired\nor wireless medium [43]. According to[44], Low-Frequency\nCommunication\
    \ (LFC) is popular in smart villages due to a\nlack of infrastructure. However,\
    \ some prominent high com-\nmunication technology used in IoTA is IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ Zensy\nWave, Long Term Evolution (LTE), LongRange (LoRa), Near\nField Communication\
    \ (NFC), Ultra-wideband (UWB) and\nothers. These communication technologies help\
    \ to commu-\nnicate hardwares like sensors, actuators in IoTA devices present\n\
    in the farm for are also commonly used in smart villages\nfor different applications\
    \ like postharvest management, cat-\ntle health monitoring and others.\nFog Layer:\
    \ Fog layer is a virtual cloud which recieves\ndata from edge layer and transmits\
    \ it to the upper layers. It\nprocess and analyze complex data received from IoTA\
    \ sen-\nsors through edge layer. It includes fog nodes like gateways,\nrouters,\
    \ entry points, distinct fog servers. The fog nodes sit-\nuates between end devices\
    \ and cloud data centers. This layer\nworks as a local cloud server.It provides\
    \ intra-networked\ncommunication for the IoTA system. By this means the IoTA\n\
    devices communcates through low frequencies and activates\nthe actuators. The\
    \ raw data collected from the sensors do not\nneed to travel frquently over the\
    \ Internet. Hence, the concept\nof fog layer overcomes the drawback like high\
    \ latency be-\ncause of real time control and mitigates security risk about\n\
    data transmission as the Internet were acted as a backbone.\nThus, the compromisation\
    \ of the Internet will lead to com-\nplete obstruction IoTA system [30].\nApplication\
    \ Layer: Application layer consists of vari-\nous communication protocols such\
    \ as HTTP, MQTT, CoAP,\nAMQP and XMPP [45] [46]. This layer provides a graphical\n\
    user interface of the agricultural environment information\nprocessed by the Middleware\
    \ layer in encrypted form and in-\nternally decrypts this information using software,\
    \ thus stores\ndata for further use. The application layer monitors the agri-\n\
    cultural environment and suggests actions to be performed\nto get better throughput\
    \ using IoTA. The applications im-\nplemented by IoTA like smart crop monitoring,\
    \ smart irriga-\ntion, smart fertilizer/pesticides sprinkling, smart greenhouse\n\
    and livestock monitoring. The data is uploaded to the Cloud\nfor data warehousing\
    \ through these applications. Some of\nthe Cloud-based IoTA platforms are AgroCloud,\
    \ AT&T M2X\ncloud, AWS, Azure IoT hub, Blynk, Cropinfra, Dropbox,\nERMES, FIWARE,\
    \ freeboard, Google, GroveStream MACQU,\nMobius, NETPIE, Rural IoT, self-developed,\
    \ SmartFarm-\nNET, ThingSpeak, Ubidots, Nimbits, ThingWorx, Phytech\n[45][46].\n\
    Cloud Layer: The cloud layer works as a centerlised data\nstorage for the IoTA\
    \ system. It receives data through appli-\ncation layer from the fog layer and\
    \ stores it for long time us-\nage. It provides greater scalibility and on demand\
    \ computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing [35].\n5 IoTA\
    \ Applications\nThe IoTA applications have become very popular among\nfarmers\
    \ due to their efﬁciency and productivity. The IoTA\nsolutions are designed to\
    \ help farmers with time efﬁciency,\nimproved productivity and better monitoring\
    \ of daily agri-\ncultural tasks. Some of the sensors are soil moisture sen-\n\
    sor, temperature sensor, distance sensor, direction sensor,\nlivestock’s temperature\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, ultrasonic\nsensor, acoustic sensors, leaf sensors,\
    \ stem sensors and fruit\nsize sensor. These sensors have speciﬁc functionality\
    \ in IoT\napplications like identifying environment temperature, crop\nstatus,\
    \ soil preparation, irrigation, pest monitoring and de-\ntection [14]. The IoTA\
    \ applications are classiﬁed into two\ncategories crop and livestock based applications.\
    \ Crop based\nIoTA applications are smart irrigation, frost protection, com-\n\
    post management, pest monitoring, pest controlling, weed\ndetection, chemical\
    \ control, seedbed preparation to reseed-\ning, yield analysis and mapping, arable\
    \ farming, spraying,\nvehicle and machinery control, crop assistant, weather con-\n\
    dition, soil quality, agricultural drones UAV, smart green-\nhouse. The applications\
    \ based on livestock management based\nare livestock monitoring, livestock identiﬁcation,\
    \ milking au-\ntomation technology, early disease detection, offspring man-\n\
    agement and care, smart poultry farming.\n[47] discussed the Niger research project\
    \ to highlight\nthe development of IoT-based smart city and smart village\nfor\
    \ the fulﬁllment of sustainable development goals (SDG-\n2030) 11 and 9 for revolution\
    \ through smart cities and smart\nvillages in Niger.\n[23] mainly focused on holistic\
    \ deﬁnitions of IoTA and\nits applications such as crop health, weeding and spraying,\n\
    planting sowing, seedbed preparation to reseeding, planting\nfrom the air, harvesting\
    \ from the ﬁeld, drones for a ﬁeld,\nyielding analysis and mapping.\n7\n[48] described\
    \ the types of agricultural UAV (Harvesting\nUAV, Spraying UAV, Mapping UAV, Sensing\
    \ UAV), includ-\ning their area of application in terms of seeding, planting\n\
    seed, monitoring, detecting weed, mapping, infestation and\nspraying pesticides/fertilizers,\
    \ forecasting and controlling.\n[49] have discussed IoTA applications that have\
    \ utilized\nmodern technologies like WSN, RFID, Cloud Computing\nand end-user\
    \ applications. These IoTA devices are found\nto be automotive, cost and time-efﬁcient\
    \ for the farmers.\nThe authors have also presented IoTA technologies and the\n\
    classiﬁcation of IoTA applications of monitoring activities.\nThe applications\
    \ are irrigation and water quality monitor-\ning, soil monitoring, weather monitoring,\
    \ farm monitoring),\ndisease and pest control, greenhouse production, automa-\n\
    tion and precision, agricultural machinery and crop manage-\nment with other applications\
    \ in smart farming as smart cat-\ntle farming, smart poultry, smart hatchery,\
    \ smart aquaponics\nand smart beehive monitoring.\n[50] did a comprehensive study\
    \ about crop data man-\nagement in agriculture 5.0. The authors displayed a tabular\n\
    analysis of various crop data management applications and\ntheir main features\
    \ based on parameters, namely software,\ncompany, headquarters and relevant features\
    \ .\n[13] discussed various solutions used in IoTA. Few of\nIoTA solutions are\
    \ water quality monitoring, farm land mon-\nitoring system, greenhouse envioronment\
    \ monitoring sys-\ntem, automated hydroponic system, smart mashrrom farm,\nsmart\
    \ vegitable storage, smart vineyard monitoring system\nand others. They compared\
    \ IoTA monitoring and control\nsystems based on parameters like a gateway, sensor\
    \ and ac-\ntuator, communication system, storage, user interface, ex-\nperiment\
    \ nature (outdoor/indoor), plant name/type, advan-\ntages of the existing system\
    \ and weaknesses in the current\nsystem.\n[46] did a thorough review of IoTA applications.\
    \ Based\non the usage, they classiﬁed IoTA applications into two types,\nIndoor\
    \ (i.e., crop beds, greenhouse, hydroponic) and out-\ndoor (arable land, orchard).\
    \ Some other works include IoT\nbased smart greenhouse and precision farming applications\n\
    [51]. In Europe, there is ongoing work on IoTA based re-\nsearch projects [52].\
    \ The classiﬁcation of holistic IoTA ap-\nplications and various IoTA solutions\
    \ are tabulated Table 2\nrespectively.\nIn the few states of India like Orisa,\
    \ Madhya Pradesh\nfaced the problem of crop vandalization. To deal with this\n\
    situation, IoTA based alarming system has been designed.\nWhenever trespassing\
    \ of the elephants is observed, the smart\ncamera detects the suspected activity\
    \ and an alarming sys-\ntem is activated [53].\nIn the next section, we have specialized\
    \ in CACC and\nDF challenges and issues in the IoTA realms.\n6 Existing Emerging\
    \ Cyber Attacks and Cyber Crime\n(CACC) in IoTA\nCyber attack (CA) is a attack\
    \ based on pertaining to digi-\ntal devices and its nework to disturb distrupt\
    \ or destroy the\nservices of the system. The other aim be perform data theft\n\
    or malicious intension of the attackers. As the CA gets re-\nported into the police\
    \ is called as Cyber Crime (CC). CC is\nan unlawfull activity againsts making\
    \ subotage, disruption\nor harm pertaining to any digital device, network, data,\
    \ or\nany living being.\nA senior vice president, Corey Reed with Deere, admit-\n\
    ted that cybercriminals have been looking for farming infor-\nmation.\nDue to\
    \ the interconnectivity of IoTA devices with the\ninternet, there are the possibility\
    \ of various CACC. The at-\ntackers could drive Sprout into a ditch or a hedge\
    \ or prevent\nit from working. In [2] [74], cyber-attack taxonomy included\nvectors,\
    \ viruses, malware, worms, trojans, ransomware, ad-\nware, zero-day vulnerability,\
    \ Stuxnet, exploit toolkit, Bot-\nnet, Man In The Middle (MITM), phishing and\
    \ spooﬁng,\nside channel, DoS, DDoS, RFID based attacks. These cyber-\nattacks\
    \ have included case studies for IoT smart devices.\n[45] the authors covered\
    \ the simulation tools for the vulnera-\nbility assessment of holistic IoT devices,\
    \ i.e., Bevywise IoT\nSimulator, IoTIFY, CupCarbon U-One, Simple IoT Simula-\n\
    tor, Mimic IoT Simulator, Cooja. The authors suggested se-\ncurity measures and\
    \ precautions for the user only. They had\nemphasized cyber-attacks and security\
    \ measures as well.\nIoT has been emphasized greatly since the 90s, when it\n\
    was proposed as an idea of interconnecting different elec-\ntronic devices through\
    \ various technologies. However, dur-\ning the past decade, IoT has rapidly developed\
    \ without con-\nsidering the profound security goals and challenges involved.\n\
    Consequently, the IoTA will face various emerging CACC.\nAccording to Statista,\
    \ by 2025 there will be 75 billion IoT-\nconnected devices [75]. Due to the rapid\
    \ development, it im-\nplies that checking for the security and vulnerability\
    \ assess-\nment is impossible. The absence of a complete trust zone can\nbe detected\
    \ in the microcontrollers used for IoTA devices.\n[76], ForeScout IoT Enterprise\
    \ Risk Report clearly sug-\ngests that by 2018, two-thirds of enterprises will\
    \ experience\nIoT security breaches. It has captured a broader spectrum of\nthe\
    \ security vulnerabilities and attacks in IoT systems. Their\nclassiﬁcation is\
    \ unique compared to the other classiﬁcations\nas it divides the different attacks\
    \ into four distinct classes;\nPhysical, Network, Software, and Encryption attacks.\
    \ The\nsame statement is true for an IoTA system, where the IoTA\ndevices can\
    \ be attacked physically or at its network or to the\napplications. Similarly,\
    \ the attacks can be tried on encryp-\ntion schemes, as IoTA is implemented using\
    \ various existing\nnetwork technologies.\n8\nTable 2: IoTA Solutions and Techniques\n\

    \ emerging Cyber Attacks (CA) in\nIoTA based on each IoTA layer. The CA on the\
    \ physical\nlayer was autonomous system hijacking/disruption, irregular\nmeasurement,\
    \ node capturing and sleep deprivation. Edge\nlayer based attacks were forged\
    \ for control actuator, boot-\ning, ﬂooding and signature wrapping attack. The\
    \ network\nlayer attacks were DoS, DDoS, data transit attacks, routing\nattacks,\
    \ signal disruption, Radiofrequency (RF) Jamming at-\ntacks, side-channel attacks,\
    \ malware injection, and Botnet\nattacks. An application layer based CA were phishing,\
    \ ma-\nlicious scripts, DoS, or DDoS. Cloud computing attacks and\ncyber terrorism\
    \ are other types of attacks have been dis-\ncussed.\n[78], covered network layer\
    \ based CA in IoTA. These\nattacks are replay attacks on Zigbee protocol that\
    \ can create\ndiﬁculties to implemnting other protocols. The smart farm,\nwhich\
    \ uses IEEE 802.11 protocol, can face attacks like pass-\nword cracking and evil\
    \ twin access point, which allows at-\ntackers to get credentials by creating\
    \ a rogue access point.\nKey reinstallation attack, which exploits 4-way handshake\n\
    in WPA2, which was responsible for securing modern wiﬁ.\nARP spooﬁng attack where\
    \ an attacker fakes the MAC ad-\ndress of the gateway and convinces the victims\
    \ to send frames\nto the fake address except the destination address. DNS spoof-\n\
    ing attacks where the trafﬁc is directed to the fake website\ncause altered DNS\
    \ records.\n[79],discussed UAV oriented CA and its consequences.\nUAV is an automated\
    \ aerial vehicle IoTA system used for\ncrop monitoring, pesticides or chemical\
    \ sprinkling, etc. The\nCA is integrity exploitation of UAV or IoTA devices. The\n\
    consequences of this attack can vandalize the whole stand-\ning crop in the ﬁeld,\
    \ ﬂood the crop, and sprinkle the pesti-\ncides in excess quantity. If such attacks\
    \ are widely coordi-\nnated, they can take the place of agro-terrorism. The authors\n\
    discussed other UAV based CA, such as radio frequency\njamming, malicious code\
    \ injection, MITM, DoS/DDOS, ran-\nsomware attacks, etc. These attacks can tamper/modify\
    \ the\ncommunication devices.\n[80], [81], [82] [49] discussed emerging CA aspects\
    \ in\nIoTA system on the different levels such as physical secu-\nrity of devices\
    \ due to the harsh nature of climate and nat-\nural disaster in IoTA, emerging\
    \ cyber threats like endpoint\nattacks, phishing, third party attack, supply chain\
    \ attacks,\nransomware, state-sponsored IoT attacks, threats in smart\ndevices.\
    \ They speciﬁed risks or dangers in terms of data\nbreaches, data integrity, privacy\
    \ breaches in business secrets,\nrisk of crypto-jacking, cyber-physical attacks,\
    \ state-sponsored\nattacks, highjacking, or threats to autonomous drones or trac-\n\
    tors.\n[83] described the several issues in IoTA caused by the\nInternet connectivity\
    \ for data processing and covered param-\neters based on CA in IoTA. In the IoTA\
    \ system, at the phys-\nical layer, the emerging CA such as unintentional physical\n\
    modiﬁcation in hardwired, temporary or permanent damage,\nautonomous system hijacking,\
    \ autonomous system disrup-\ntion, optical deformation, rough treatment, power\
    \ depletion\nof battery, sensor weakening as per the sensor aging, node\ncapturing,\
    \ adding a malicious node and sleep deprivation.\nIn sleep deprivation attack\
    \ there is draining the battery of\nthe smart devices. Network layer-based emerging\
    \ CA dis-\ncussed as DoS/DDoS, data transit attack, and routing attack.\nThe emerging\
    \ CA at the edge layer can be forged controls\nfor actuators, gateway-cloud request\
    \ forgery, forged mea-\nsure injection, booting, unauthorized access, MITM, signa-\n\
    ture wrapping, and ﬂooding. In the sequence, the concern-\ning CA in the application\
    \ layer is phishing, malicious script,\nDoS, and DDoS attacks. The author emphasized\
    \ the current\nstate of security in smart agriculture as the researcher and\n\
    developer leave default security features for the MQTT and\nCoAP since the researchers’\
    \ probability keeps it disabled.\nMoreover, IoT device manufacturers use IoTs\
    \ to keep them\ninvisible to the security feature, validation processes, col-\n\
    lecting, transferring, or storing phases or failure checks. This\npaper further\
    \ illustrates these invisible parameters for the in-\nvisible security features.\
    \ The authors also suggested a future\nenhancement in the perspective of better\
    \ security in smart\nagriculture and farming applications.\n[84] presented a literature\
    \ survey on CA pertaining to\ndistinct components of IoTA. They have discussed\
    \ attacks\nbased on hardwares like sensors, controllers, RFID tags. Few\nattacks\
    \ based on protocol such as RFID, NFC,bluetooth, wiﬁ,\nZigbee, 6loWPAN, and protocols\
    \ on application layer.\n[85], authors classiﬁed CA in IoTA based on the phys-\n\
    ical layer, network layer, middleware layer, and application\nlayer. The CA on\
    \ the physical layer is such a RF jamming,\nside-channel attack, which aims to\
    \ gather unauthorized in-\nformation regarding the implementation description\
    \ of the\nIoTA system using monitoring parameters of hardware like\nan electric\
    \ current or voltage [86]. Attacks on the network\nlayer are DoS, MITM, and cloud\
    \ computing attacks. At-\ntacks regarding data are data leakage, ransomware, cloud\n\
    data leakage, and misconﬁguration. Application layer based\nattacks are software\
    \ update based attacks such as malware\ninjection, buffer overﬂow and SQL injection.\
    \ Other attacks\nthey have covered are cyber terrorism and invalidation, which\n\
    refers to false data fabrication.\n[87], authors are concerned that exposure of\
    \ personnel’s\nprivate information, social engineering, cyber espionage, and\n\
    agroterrorism to any CA is a potentially severe threat that\nshould be seriously\
    \ and carefully considered.The possibil-\nity of cyber terrorism in the agriculture\
    \ sector is known as\nagroterrorism.\n[88], authors warn the cyber threat risk\
    \ in IoTA, for internet-\nbased automatic functional devices, like smart crop\
    \ sprayers,\ndrones, UAV in agriculture can be hacked.\n10\nCybercriminals are\
    \ looking to ruin the particular revenue\nbusiness, where agriculture plays a\
    \ very important role in\nrevenue generation for the individual and the country.\n\
    [89] homeland security of U.S. department mention the\nconcern potential cyber\
    \ threats and vulnerabilities in IoTA.\nTheir released report disscussed different\
    \ technologies in\nIoTA sucha as on farm device, location or remote sensing\n\
    technologies and machine learning. This report highlights\nhypothetical scenarios\
    \ pertaining to CACC. Likewise IoTA\nbased sensors could be the signaﬁcant cause\
    \ for CACC is-\nsues. A warning from the UK government and FBI states\nthat Cyber\
    \ criminals could exploit ﬂaws present in the IoTA\nhardware which were used to\
    \ plant and harvest crops, such\nas automatic crop sprayers, drones and robotic\
    \ harvesters\nto disrupt the GDP growth, food production of the country\n[90].\
    \ According to an FBI report, CA in IoTA has slowed\ndown the agriculture processing\
    \ system and also interrupted\nthe email communication and website-based administration.\n\
    A cyber crime by disrupting process dairy facilities can quickly\nspoil the result.\
    \ FBI has released a list of cybercrime in agri-\nculture. Where the means of\
    \ cybercrime was a ransomware\nattack, where data was stolen and encrypted, and\
    \ criminals\ndemanded ransom, cyber actors may perceive cooperatives\nas lucrative\
    \ targets with a willingness to pay due to the time-\nsensitive role in agricultural\
    \ production. The goal could be\nto disrupt the seed and fertilizer supplies.\n\
    Various IoT based CACC has been already observed and\nsevere consequences had\
    \ faced by users. [91], the Mirai bot-\nnet in 2016 is an example of DDoS attack\
    \ which was launched\non IoT devices in smart home on a large scale. Similar CA\n\
    are possible in the context of IOTA. The consequences of\nsuch attack can disrupt\
    \ normal functionality of distinct mod-\nules of an individual IoTA farm and leverage\
    \ for interrupt-\ning legitimate cyber services in other areas. [92], the IoTA\n\
    system can be compromised and controlled by utilising cen-\ntral malicious system\
    \ know as Botnet of Things. [93], a CA\nnamed as Night Dragon could steal big\
    \ amount of informa-\ntion from various petrochemical companies. [94], an another\n\
    incidence of devastation using phishing attack attemped on\nGerman steel mill\
    \ for gaining access on network plant pro-\nduction system of the mill ofﬁce.\n\
    The increase in CACC in IoT based devices has become\nthe concern in smart agriculture\
    \ where these CACC can bring\ndevastation to IoTA, crop demage, animal production\
    \ loss\nand vast ecconomical loss.\nIn 2020, JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat\
    \ processing\ncompanies, paid $11 million as a ransome to resolve a CA;\nmalware\
    \ attack that shut down Australian and New Zealand\nwool sales [95]. The US agriculture\
    \ ﬁrm AGCO was af-\nfected production by a ransomware attack. President Greg\n\
    Gatzke of ZAG Technical Services Inc observed losses be-\ntween $40,000 to $200,000\
    \ caused by cyber-criminals [96].\nIn the US, Jan 2021, faced the business lost\
    \ $9 million as cy-\nber criminals inﬁltrated a farm’s internal network via com-\n\
    promised administrative credentials. The total loss derives\nfrom the temporary\
    \ shutdown of operations.\nCo-founder of agricultural ﬁrm Muddy Machines, Chris\n\
    Chavasse, states that the IoTA based devices can be attacked\nand hacked. Their\
    \ study says that IoTA sector is at risk.\nIn industrial espionage, revenge-minded\
    \ employees can\ndamage farmers having a treaty in contract farming with that\n\
    particular company. In the case of IoTA, the farmer/contractor\nmay face severe\
    \ loss due to linked cyber security breaches or\nattacks on the contract provider\
    \ company. Subsequently, se-\nvere data loss/breaches or sabotage might be found\
    \ in IoTA.\nVarious emerging CACC, its consequences on IoTA and un-\nfavourable\
    \ affects on the farming are summarised in Table\n3.\nAgribusiness is suspected\
    \ of attacking and disturbing,\ndisrupting, or destroying its existing functional\
    \ system due\nto its fragility in nature, as IoTA is a hackable and crack-\nable\
    \ system. Consequently, various unsolved cases could be\nfound in the court of\
    \ law. Thus various challenges are being\nfaced in evidence collection and DF\
    \ investigation regarding\nIoTA. The various challenges are discussed in the next\
    \ sec-\ntion.\n7 Digital Forensics Challenges in IoTA\nDF is a superset of cyber\
    \ forensics, which includes forensics\nof all digital devices like computers,\
    \ mobile phones, PDAs,\npalmtops, storage devices, obscure devices like gaming\
    \ de-\nvices, recording devices, digital cameras, IoTs and many\nmore. DF consists\
    \ of the systematic propelled and scientif-\nically proven approach for preservation,\
    \ collection, valida-\ntion, identiﬁcation, analysis, interpretation, documentation\n\
    and presentation of digital evidence [100]. DF is a conven-\ntional technique\
    \ as the law enforcement acknowledges that\nmodern day life includes a distinct\
    \ of devices where IoT is at\nthe top of the list of digital devices. The IoT\
    \ can be exploited\nby criminal activity [101].\nThe IoTA is a subset of IoT.\
    \ It includes a sensor, gate-\nway, network, Internet and the cloud. Thus IoTA\
    \ also in-\nherits properties of DF challenges belong IoT. We have in-\ncluded\
    \ a few articles to discuss various DF challenges and\nissues in IoTA. According\
    \ to the principle of exchange given\nin 1934 by Dr. Edmond Locard (1877-1966),\
    \ \"Every action\nleaves a trace.\" Any action of a crime commiter cannot occur\n\
    without leaving a trace. The Locard’s principle was also de-\nﬁned in the perspective\
    \ of conventional crime that is proved\nin the digital world. The same rule is\
    \ equally applicable in\nthe IoTA.\n11\nTable 3: Emerging CACC and Its Consequences\

    \ into six categories: identiﬁcation, collection, preserva-\ntion, analysis, correlation,\
    \ attack attribution and presenta-\ntion. These challenges are further divided\
    \ into its subclasses.\nThe authors discussed DF challenges for various IoT appli-\n\
    cations except for IoTA.\nThe following section discusses the work done in the\n\
    area of IoT/IoTA forensics. In this article We have classi-\nﬁed related articles\
    \ into different categories, some of which\nare discussed below.\n7.1 Jurisdictions\n\
    [103] identiﬁed the challenge presented as the devices cross\nthe borderline of\
    \ jurisdictions. Likely, data in transit between\nIoTA devices and globally distributed\
    \ cloud computing plat-\nforms cross these borderlines more frequently. It is\
    \ unclear\nunder which law the case should be prosecuted i.e., the de-\nvice jurisdiction,\
    \ the attacker jurisdiction, or the data storage\njurisdiction. For this reason,\
    \ it is necessary to create an in-\nternational commission that updates the current\
    \ legislation\nand can deﬁne uniform procedures in IoT DF [102] [104].\nThe same\
    \ jurisdiction challenge stands for IoTA too.\nAccording to [105], DF is an interdisciplinary\
    \ process of\ninvestigation where cooperation and coordination between\nnations\
    \ is indeed required for transnational law enforcement.\nThe Council of Europe’s\
    \ Convention on Cybercrime formed\na committee, \"Council of Europe, 2001,\" for\
    \ harmonizing\nprocedural and substantive laws related to digital crime and\n\
    evidence among its signatories. The treaty commissions states\nto create standard\
    \ systems of substantive and procedural laws\nprohibiting cyber-criminal conduct\
    \ and investigating crimi-\nnal conduct with computer devices with respective\
    \ to each\ncountry. This treaty includes the number of signatories coun-\ntries\
    \ was 63; the few of 63 counties are USA, Canada, Ger-\nmany, France, Great Britain,\
    \ Italy, Hungary, Israel, Japan.\nThe other high technology nations have not signed\
    \ the treaty\nat the convention. That countries are like the Russian Feder-\n\
    ation, Peoples Republic of China, India, the Islamic Repub-\nlic of Iran, Mexico,\
    \ Pakistan and South Africa) [103].\n7.2 Search and Seizure\nSearch and seizure\
    \ is an essential step in any DF examina-\ntion. However, detecting the presence\
    \ of IoT evidences is\nquite challenging as the IoT devices are designed to work\n\
    passively and autonomously. In most cases, when an IoT de-\nvice is identiﬁed,\
    \ there is no documented method or reliable\ntool to collect residual pieces of\
    \ evidence from the device in\na forensically sound manner [106].\n[107] concerned\
    \ that the standards by which the evi-\ndence is in DF investigations could have\
    \ been altered to ac-\ncommodate the changing nature of the cloud computing en-\n\
    vironment. We believe that the alalogical statement holds for\nIoTA DF investigations\
    \ too. Beyond technical challenges,\nprivacy is a signiﬁcant issue to consider\
    \ when analyzing and\ncorrelating collected data, primarily as most IoT sensors\
    \ col-\nlect innate personal information [106].\n[108] authors reviewed various\
    \ DF limitations and chal-\nlenges in IoT. Those limitations include impracticability\
    \ of\ncloning of all data by a service provider, requirement of ex-\ncess time\
    \ in data acquisition and other challenges.\n7.3 Identiﬁcation\nIn the term of\
    \ IoT based DF investigation, the question arises\nof whether to investigate devices\
    \ or data in the case of cloud\nor else the devices may be viewed as a metadata\
    \ aspect of\nthe data or if the reverse is true, the cloud computing ar-\nchitectures\
    \ (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) allow data fragmentation and\ndistribution among different\
    \ countries and continents [109].\nAs IoTA is one of the applications, IoT may\
    \ face the same\nchallenge in the identiﬁcation phase of the investigation.\n\
    7.4 Preservation\nIn evidence, the acquisition is to maintain the integrity of\n\
    the evidence collected. The most frequently used technique\nfor computers and\
    \ phones is calculating a hash to assure\nintegrity. The question arises about\
    \ calculating hash at the\ntime of creating an image. The problem here is the\
    \ lack of\navailable tools that can prevent accidental changes in the IoT\nbased\
    \ evidence [103].\n7.5 Challenge in imaging\nThe challenge of the acquisition\
    \ is to decide whether to cre-\nate an image of an endpoint or to acquire it physically.\
    \ In the\ncase of computer crimes, the standard practice is to create a\nworking\
    \ copy/image of the storage media and seal the actual\nmedia to avoid accidental\
    \ alteration in the actual evidence.\nSince the endpoints in IoT crime scenes,\
    \ excluding comput-\ners and smartphones, may store minimal or sometimes no\n\
    information, creating an image of those IoT nodes is com-\nplicated. If a component\
    \ stores some information, then it\nshould be technically possible to create an\
    \ image of that de-\nvice. The suggested way is to create images from available\n\
    sources [106].\n7.6 Analysis and correlation\nThe huge amount of data collected\
    \ in diverse type of IoT\ndevices makes it nearly impossible to provide an end\
    \ to end\n15\nanalysis of residual evidence. IoTA is a frequently evolv-\ning\
    \ technologies. Hence different Operating Systems (OS),\nvarious ﬁle formats and\
    \ distinct cryptographic methods. The\nExisting digital forensics tools or methodologies\
    \ do not sup-\nport for data extraction from emerging IoTA devices [102].\n7.7\
    \ Absence of Standard IoTA Architecture\nThe different standards for IoTA architecture\
    \ are followed\nby manufacturers, the lack of cooperation, and the many pe-\n\
    culiarities are the terrible thing about the IoT working within\nthe same area\
    \ of application. Due to the lack of standardiza-\ntion of IoTA architecture,\
    \ the smart irrigation system facil-\nitated by one manufacturer and the smart\
    \ crop monitoring\nsystem by another manufacturer can have problems in coor-\n\
    dination. The absence of a standard IoTA architecture chal-\nlenges the design\
    \ of the standard DF framework.\n7.8 Malware\nIn [97], the authors discussed various\
    \ research challenges in\nIoT forensics. The challenges are the complexity and\
    \ versa-\ntility of IoT devices, lack of standard IoT architecture, ev-\nidence\
    \ contamination due to overwriting data, and use of\nconventional tools forensics\
    \ tools.\n8 Discussion\nIoTA is the highest trending technology in human life\
    \ to\nmake life much easier, faster and more comfortable. Accord-\ning to Cisco\
    \ Internet Business Solution Group (IBSG), IoT\nwas born between 2008 - 2009,\
    \ with an average of 1.84 IoTs\nper person; the propositional logic can be derived\
    \ from this\nIBSG statistics that people will possess 10 IoTs per person\non an\
    \ average, in the coming age. Thus this ﬁeld requires\nthe most potential to research\
    \ in the IoTA domain to better\nits characteristics and work on its challenges.\n\
    This literature review is focused on IoTA. The rationale\nof this study is helpful\
    \ to understand IoTA architecture and\nits working environment from the physical\
    \ layer to the ap-\nplication layer from different authors’ perspectives. We have\n\
    included IoTA architecture, emerging CA, cyber crimes and\nDF investigation challenges\
    \ about IoT based Agriculture (IoTA).\nWe have done a comprehensive study about\
    \ the DF chal-\nlenges and issues that can have obstacles in this growing era\n\
    of IoTA and possible crime and related that scenario pre-\ncisely with IoTA. Many\
    \ challenges are discussed in previous\npapers. Those challenges include Jurisdiction\
    \ at IoT crime\nscenes, lack of available tools and documentation methods,\npreservation,\
    \ imaging, evidence analysis and correlation. There\ncan be future work on these\
    \ challenges, so the data must\nbe presentable in a court of law. In this review\
    \ work, we\nleft out elaborative discussion about all the IoTA based ap-\nplications,\
    \ deﬁnitions for IoT sensors, protocols, communi-\ncation technology, vulnerabilities,\
    \ cyber-attack, cybercrime,\ncybersecurity and DF, which can be added in the subsequent\n\
    study.\nThe concerning point of a literature review is that the\nauthors’ statement\
    \ was based on assumptions. The articles\nwere not found assured about CACC issues\
    \ in IoTA solu-\ntions. These weaknesses of the IoT system could be tested\nfor\
    \ being assured CACC. Consequently, the manufacturer\nand security experts would\
    \ have saved their time in ﬁnding\ncyber threats for each IoTA device with all\
    \ aspects through\nproactive measures.\nAs a part of the study, there has been\
    \ found a scarcity of\narticles on IoTA based cyber crime and DF discussion. Thus\n\
    the researchers can further explore emerging CACC and DF\ninvestigation based\
    \ on IoTA in this article to have survey\nbased insights. There must be readiness\
    \ for IoTA based CC\nand DF investigation process for running an agriculture busi-\n\
    ness (agribusiness) and to justice for the victim. The fail-\nure to prove the\
    \ suspect will cause the encourage CACC\nin IoTA. Those CACC will be responsible\
    \ for disturbing,\ndisrupting, or even destroying the IoTA system in agribusi-\n\
    ness. It will directly demotivate agribusiness persons to con-\ntribute to crop\
    \ and food production. Subsequently, individ-\nual agribusiness people, consumers,\
    \ laymen, countries and\nthe nation’s GDP could be affected. Thus there is an\
    \ urgent\nneed to have readiness towards CACC and DF in IoTA. It is\nalso observed\
    \ that most experiments were not conducted in\na practice environment and seemed\
    \ just an assumption. To\nsolve more real-time problems, researchers should also\
    \ ex-\nperiment with these techniques on real-world solutions for\nIoTA.\n9 Conclusion\n\
    It is a concerning point in SDG 2030; goal 2 is to promote\nsustainable agriculture\
    \ to achieve zero hunger. To smart agri-\nculture and farming the practice effectively,\
    \ IoTA is applied\nin almost all ﬁelds of agriculture, such as farm monitor-\n\
    ing, irrigation, pest monitoring, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, smart\
    \ poultry farm and so on. Existing smart\nfarming techniques are classiﬁed and\
    \ reviewed; from this\nstudy, it is understood that researchers should concentrate\n\
    more on readiness for emerging CACC for IoTA applica-\ntions or tools. The readiness\
    \ will provide non-interruptable\nservices. There is a need to be readiness for\
    \ DF investiga-\ntion for IoTA speciﬁcally which will make a robust judicial\n\
    system and strengthen the judicial system by catching the\nnatural suspected person.\n\

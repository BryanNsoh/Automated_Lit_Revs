    managementDigital twinTransparencyData modality and standardization Introduction
    Recently, there have been notable advancements in the Industrial Internet of Things
    (IIoT) paradigm, which focuses on implementing Internet of Things (IoT) applications
    for water management [1]. IIoT incorporates automated sensors, sensing devices,
    and data analytics to improve sustainability, efficiency, data security, and transparency
    in industrial operations involving multiple stakeholders. IIoT fetches about a
    revolutionary transformation in water management by facilitating precise calculations,
    real-time monitoring, and comprehensive profiling of resources within distributed
    infrastructures [2]. This paradigm opens up many possibilities for diverse water
    applications, incorporating various data modalities and features. Some notable
    examples of these applications include using sensors to monitor and assess water
    quality, track water consumption, analyze water composition, measure water levels,
    detect leaks, evaluate wastage, and understand consumption patterns. Data standardization
    plays a vital role in harnessing the potential of IIoT-enabled applications. Establishing
    uniformity and consistency in data representation and formats across different
    platforms and systems is imperative [3], [4], [5]. IIoT recognizes the potential
    of blockchain technology in creating new data standards that can seamlessly integrate
    and operate across various platforms. This standardized data format would benefit
    multiple stakeholders involved in water management, including end customers, government
    regulatory bodies, and water distributors. By adopting standardized data formats,
    valuable insights can be gained from water quality data. For instance, information
    regarding the precise amount of chlorine dosage and hormonal levels can be efficiently
    communicated to both government entities responsible for the regulation and end
    customers who are concerned about water quality and safety. This data standardization
    ensures transparency, reliability, and interoperability in the exchange of water-related
    information, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of water management
    processes. Effective data modalities and standardized data management are key
    factors in enhancing IIoT performance. Implementing technologies like blockchain
    and digital twins allows for this improvement. The convergence of the Industrial
    Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm with blockchain technology and Digital Twin
    (DT) concepts brings numerous advantages to the water industry [6], [7]. Blockchain
    technology (BCT) plays a pivotal role in processing and managing the data generated
    by interconnected water industries. It operates with transparency, security, and
    immutability, ensuring the data remains tamper-proof and protected against unauthorized
    modifications. By leveraging blockchain technology, applications in the water
    industry can establish a reliable and auditable data trail throughout the supply
    chain, ensuring data integrity and enabling authenticated data processes. BCT
    provides a robust framework for data asset management in the water industry. Through
    the utilization of Digital Twin (DT) technology, physical data from various locations
    and industries can be replicated and managed virtually. DT offers scalability,
    cost-efficiency, and interoperability, making it an invaluable tool for water
    industry applications. With DT, stakeholders in the water industry can create
    virtual replicas of their physical assets, enabling real-time monitoring, analysis,
    and simulations. This facilitates improved decision-making, predictive maintenance,
    and optimization of water management processes. In summary, integrating IIoT,
    blockchain technology, and Digital Twin concepts within the water industry offers
    benefits such as transparent and secure data management, traceability throughout
    the supply chain, authenticated data processes, and efficient data asset management
    through virtual replication. These technologies empower water industry applications
    to enhance operations, refine decision-making processes, and achieve cost-effective
    and scalable solutions [8], [9], [10], [11]. Deep learning (DL) has garnered considerable
    attention in research and academia due to its potential for automating processes
    within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) framework, particularly in water
    applications. DL, an integral part of artificial intelligence (AI), encompasses
    a range of mechanisms and algorithms. Notably, CNN and RNN strategies were utilized
    in DL. The primary objective is to effectively process and analyze the vast volume
    of data generated by water sensors in real-time. DL techniques excel in handling
    diverse data modalities associated with water sensors, including image data captured
    by sensors, time series data, and numeric and textual data obtained from distributed
    infrastructures. However, data standardization in water data management within
    the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) presents numerous challenges that must
    be addressed. This paper considers these research questions to solve the data
    standardization problem in IIoWT architecture. (i) The first challenge arises
    from the diverse data modalities encountered in water management. (ii) The data
    originates from various sources and is represented in different formats, necessitating
    suitable processing across multiple nodes. Secondly, the attainment of data interoperability
    and integration poses a significant obstacle. The IIoT involves collecting data
    from disparate sources, making it arduous to convert and consolidate it into a
    standardized format that can be seamlessly processed and yield meaningful outcomes
    on the nodes. (iii) Data security is another pivotal challenge, particularly when
    distributing data among IIoT water nodes involving end users, industries, and
    government entities. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper presents
    the Industrial Internet of Water Things (IIoWT) architecture, which includes components
    such as a water quality monitoring application, computing and wireless communication
    infrastructure, and data-generating sensors. The application aims to monitor water
    quality by implementing secure data standardization protocols that enable smooth
    data exchange among end users, service providers, and government entities. The
    integration of CNN and blockchain reveals many potential advantages and applications,
    particularly within the IIoWT (Industrial Internet of Things) industry. CNNs can
    be employed to analyze various types of data, such as images, text, and content,
    while blockchain technology ensures robust security and confidentiality, especially
    for sensitive data like patients’ medical records. By storing the training data
    and predictions of the CNN model on the blockchain, it becomes possible to authenticate
    and validate the accuracy and reliability of the model’s results, thereby fostering
    increased confidence in the system. To answer the research questions raised earlier,
    this paper offers the following research findings and contributions to the existing
    body of knowledge. • We present a hybrid model called CNN-LSTM. The CNN-LSTM model
    is designed to efficiently extract and process data from diverse sources, thereby
    addressing the issue of data modality. • We devise the cross-platform runtime
    environment based on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol.
    This environment allows for the seamless processing of diverse data sources and
    types through heterogeneous computing nodes in IIoWT. By leveraging MQTT, the
    devised runtime environment ensures interoperability and facilitates the execution
    of data across heterogeneous computing nodes. • We devise a blockchain scheme
    that utilizes SHA-256 for data hashing. This scheme incorporates a proof-of-work
    mechanism and ensures data validity across heterogeneous nodes in IIoWT. The existing
    blockchain schemes, such as proof of credibility, byzantine fault-tolerant, and
    hash validation schemes, consume more resources and support only homogeneous nodes
    in distributed networks. The paper is organized into several sections. Section
    1 focuses on the related work, providing an overview of previous studies in the
    field. Section 1 explains the IIoWT architecture, outlining its components and
    functionality. Section 1 presents the proposed methodology, detailing how it operates
    and addresses the research objectives. The implementation of the system and performance
    evaluation are discussed in Section 28. Finally, Section 28 concludes the paper
    and outlines potential avenues for future research. Related work The IIoT paradigm
    has been widely applied in water management across various smart cities. Its primary
    goal is to enable water quality monitoring across different gradients and stakeholders.
    In these studies [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], an industrial IoT architecture was presented
    to collect gradient data from raw water at different plants. These studies showcased
    various applications for monitoring raw water quality using plant ultrasonic sensors.
    The surveys and case studies discussed both application and infrastructure-related
    challenges. However, data standardization and security about data modality still
    need to be addressed in these works. To ensure data security standardization across
    heterogeneous computing nodes in water management, previous studies [6], [7] have
    proposed decentralized architectures based on blockchain technology. The primary
    objective was to facilitate the secure transfer of valid data among interconnected
    nodes using blockchain. The key contribution of this architecture lies in its
    ability to process data modalities in a transparent, immutable, and authenticated
    format across nodes. The studies presented blockchain-based systems for IoT water
    management in smart cities. The objective of these systems was to enable the transformation
    of water quality, sensor, and application data through a distributed ledger among
    involved stakeholders. Different processing levels implemented proof-of-work-validity,
    proof-of-credibility, and fault-tolerant schemes within the blockchain. These
    blockchain schemes aimed to ensure consistency in water data for quality enhancement
    and compliance with standards across various locations. However, developing and
    implementing blockchain blocks for data standardization with the aforementioned
    studies incurred significant resource and cost requirements at different nodes.
    Previous studies [8], [9], [10], [11] explored the integration of Digital Twin
    (DT) technology to mitigate the implementation cost associated with blockchain
    technology in water management systems and applications. They presented a DT-enabled
    blockchain solution wherein the implementation relied on virtualizing the consensus
    rules of physical blockchain blocks. The aim was to decrease the implementation
    cost of water management across various nodes by leveraging the combination of
    blockchain technology and DT. However, resource. A case study by Xu et al. [12]
    presented a water quality monitoring system utilizing underwater sensors in fish
    ponds. The study’s objective was to analyze the water quality and levels in various
    tanks using IoT technology and examine the flow after storage from different water
    sources in distributed fog cloud networks. Another study by Smith et al. [13]
    focused on a drinking water quality system that performs real-time checks on raw
    materials and their quality. The researchers aimed to develop a lightweight and
    cost-efficient IoT water management system. Furthermore, several studies [14],
    [15], [16], [17], [18] presented distributed architectures for water management,
    where raw data collected from diverse sensors is processed at different nodes
    and aggregated centrally for further analysis. However, it should be noted that
    these water management systems can only process one data modality at a time. By
    leveraging DL, improvements can be made in various aspects of water management.
    For example, DL algorithms can enhance water quality assessments, enable the detection
    of vulnerabilities and faults, provide fault tolerance mechanisms, and extract
    relevant contextual features during the data processing phase. Overall, DL’s capabilities
    make it a valuable tool for addressing the challenges present in water management.
    DL empowers water industry stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize processes,
    and improve water-related operations’ overall efficiency and effectiveness through
    its ability to process and analyze complex and diverse data. In previous studies
    [18], [19], [20], various DL and machine learning schemes were proposed to address
    data modality processing and feature extraction in distributed water management
    environments. Specifically, using CNN and LSTM models was widely explored for
    handling data modality and data fusion challenges, particularly in scenarios where
    sensor data processing is distributed across multiple nodes. These studies successfully
    processed diverse data formats, including images, text, numeric, and other data
    types. The paper [21] proposed a framework based on blockchain technology for
    environment and distributed data management. The objective was to establish a
    trusted water management process among interconnected nodes belonging to different
    stakeholders. To enhance the dynamic adoption of IoT-based water management in
    distributed blockchain-enabled networks, several studies [22], [23], [24], [25]
    presented their findings. In these studies, IoT sensors were deployed across various
    water management components to monitor water conditions at different locations.
    Implementing Chinese smart water systems based on blockchain technology enabled
    transparent, secure, and valid record-keeping across diverse locations within
    smart cities. The studies [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33] presented
    architectures for water management in agriculture applications based on blockchain
    technology. These studies proposed various components to facilitate water management
    in different architectural contexts. The presented architectures comprised several
    elements: source linking, processing nodes, pump speed control, water flow management,
    and scheduling mechanisms across distributed nodes. Based on our current understanding,
    unresolved challenges are still related to the standardization of data modalities,
    security aspects, real-time water quality monitoring across various nodes, and
    interoperability issues. In light of these challenges, this paper aims to address
    the issues of data modality security, interoperability, water management, and
    data validation among nodes. IIoWT architecture The architecture IIoWT, depicted
    in Fig. 1, comprises various components, including the water source, harvest system,
    storage facility, distribution pump, and end-user institutions such as houses,
    hospitals, schools, and more. Fig. 1 shows the flow of water management from raw
    material to the distribution of clean water in the different institutions for
    drinking. The water source and water treatment plant are responsible for the purification
    of water obtained from diverse sources. The water source gathers water from various
    points and employs sensors to generate data. These sensors include Residual Chlorine
    [34], Organic Carbon [35], Turbidity [36], Conductivity [37], pH [38], and others,
    which are utilized to monitor the quality of water at the collection sources for
    the water treatment plant. The architecture consists of physical and virtual servers
    and application interfaces. The physical servers are integrated into the power
    plant and government monitoring offices, while digital twin-enabled virtual servers
    are deployed in various water management offices to handle water flow and distribution.
    The physical servers exhibit heterogeneity, whereas the virtual servers possess
    homogeneous characteristics. Additionally, the computing node is integrated with
    various components to monitor the water quality within the architecture. The architecture
    collects data from diverse sources, each with its unique format. This heterogeneity
    poses a significant challenge in terms of interoperability and processing. To
    address this issue, our architecture incorporates a runtime design enabled by
    Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [39], ensuring seamless interoperability
    among data formats and runtimes. Furthermore, we have integrated deep learning
    convolutional neural network (CNN) [40] and least memory (LSTM) [41] schemes into
    our architecture to effectively process data with varying features and formats.
    This enables efficient analysis and utilization of the collected data. Our study
    integrates lightweight blockchain schemes within different nodes to ensure security
    and maintain data standards. This ensures the immutability and transparency of
    data sharing among the nodes, enhancing overall security and data integrity. The
    architecture incorporates various algorithm schemes, including CNN-LSTM and blockchain
    transactions data schemes (BCTD). The primary objective is to manage standardized
    data and process it efficiently across different nodes while ensuring transparency,
    immutability, and validity. Download : Download high-res image (768KB) Download

    Schemes The study integrates techniques, including CNN, LSTM, and blockchain,
    to handle water management’s diverse data modalities (e.g., image, text, numeric
    data) in IIoWT architecture [45], [46], [47]. We combine both CNN-LSTM to process
    the diversity of data generated from different sensors on the different computing
    nodes. The main reason is that CNN extracts the features of data, and LSTM sequences
    the data properly. In IIoWT architecture, the computing nodes, such as physical
    servers, virtual servers, and end-user nodes, the BCTD scheme, share the validated
    data among nodes during processing in IIoWT. To address this, we employ a combination
    of methods in our approach, enabling data feature extraction of sensor data using
    CNN. The sensors’ data requires capturing data dependencies. Therefore, we exploit
    LSTM for time series analysis and ensuring data validation across nodes (leveraging
    blockchain). The CNN scheme is utilized for extracting data features, while another
    scheme, like LSTM, captures data dependencies among various data points. Additionally,
    considering the heterogeneity of the computing nodes involved in processing, analyzing,
    and monitoring water from different perspectives, we propose data validation based
    on blockchain technology. This work showcases the methodology, highlighting the
    distinctions. The study illustrates two methodologies: the Flow Management of
    CNN-LSTM and BCTD Schemes. These schemes are integrated and operate collaboratively
    in distinct steps. The process begins with the data modality, which encompasses
    various data sensors. The data is then processed using CNN to extract the relevant
    features. In addition, for capturing data dependencies, the output layer of CNN
    serves as the input for LSTM. The LSTM module accumulates the results and shares
    them across different nodes based on the blockchain scheme implemented in our
    work. Data sensors modality process based on CNN and LSTM Schemes The combination
    of CNN and LSTM serves different purposes. We utilize the CNN scheme to extract
    and identify water level, leakage, and flow in various nodes. On the other hand,
    LSTM is employed to monitor water quantity and analyze its gradients within the
    architecture. We provide a detailed description of this scenario of the proposed
    methodology. Initially, we monitor water activity and data from different sensor
    modalities, denoted as T. The CNN scheme extracts features from diverse datasets,
    such as T. The output of the CNN model serves as the input for LSTM. This allows
    LSTM to analyze the data sequence based on time series analysis within the architecture.
    Please note that the mentioned description is a general example, and the details
    may vary depending on the context and data being analyzed. We are currently monitoring
    the water pump components and collecting data from various sensors, represented
    as Z. Due to heterogeneous components in the IIoWT architecture, we use the common
    runtime platform protocol such as X86 for communication. CNN is responsible for
    extracting features from different types of inputs, including images, numeric
    data, and text data from diverse sensors. LSTM is used to generate sequences based
    on the output of CNN. For example, a water pump is depicted with a blue color
    and consists of multiple components. The water tank is also connected to various
    sensors and provides output accordingly. The storage tank contains 30,000 liters
    of water and includes parameters such as pH level, chloride concentration, and
    others. The water is distributed to different residential houses, institutions,
    and hospitals. The CNN schemes analyze the features of various data inputs, denoted
    as T and Z. Each CNN scheme incorporates distinct hyper-parameters, including
    filters, padding, and size. CNN and LSTM are supervised learning algorithms that
    process different data sources across layers. In our methodology, we employ pre-trained
    data models [43] for CNN and avoid any data pre-processing. This approach allows
    us to handle non-linear data with diverse formats. The CNN architecture consists
    of multiple layers, with the convolutional layer of size 28 28 responsible for
    extracting features based on the trained and tested models. These features are
    then passed to the pooling layer. The fully connected layers and softmax activation
    function [44] generate the final feature results. Algorithm 1 CNN-LSTM data feature
    extractions The combination of CNN and LSTM Algorithm 1 incorporates various steps
    to achieve optimal results. The CNN’s convolutional layer, pooling layer, and
    output layer are combined with the different states of LSTM. This integration
    enables the determination of water flow, analysis of water quality and its constituents,
    identification of water flow patterns, and detection of component leakage in real-time
    within distributed computing components. In this paper, we present a combined
    CNN and LSTM Algorithm 1 that involves the following steps: • The combined algorithm
    schemes take several parameters as inputs, such as . • The initial results, denoted
    as R, are generated by CNN. These results involve the extraction of features from
    datasets based on pre-trained models. • Steps 1 to 3 focus on extracting features
    and labeling them on 3D images. For numeric and text data, matrixes are generated
    using the Word2Vec algorithm. • Steps 4 to 8 involve appending all the generated
    features and storing them into the initial results generated by CNN-LSTM, represented
    as . The results are appended using the operation ”Append R[t, f, z, m]” and then
    undergo training and testing. • For handling the sequence of water quantity, LSTM
    is applied as described in step 9. • From steps 9 to 14, the existing trained
    and tested model is utilized. • We consider this problem a vanishing gradient
    problem, where backpropagation aims to achieve minimum errors in different time
    series analyses. • Different states occur during the LSTM process, including the
    input, hidden, and output. • The previous time stamp and current timestamp are
    utilized to obtain accurate results from the inputs provided by CNN. • The algorithm
    produces results with cumulative accuracy, denoted as , as shown in steps 15 to
    17. Blockchain transactional data validation (BCTD) This paper’s computing nodes
    encompass various data processing and analysis entities, including physical servers,
    digital twin servers, and end users’ computing interfaces. Physical and virtual
    servers are responsible for processing data modalities, leveraging their respective
    resource capabilities and computing power. On the other hand, user end nodes solely
    receive data based on the validation scheme. To ensure interoperability across
    different nodes, we have designed a runtime environment based on MQTT for all
    cross-platform computing nodes. As mentioned earlier, our approach involves processing
    data modalities and fusion, employing a combination of CNN and LSTM for monitoring
    water level feature extraction and sequencing data dependencies in the algorithm.
    Physical servers are established exclusively at the power plant, while identical
    virtual servers are deployed at various monitoring institutions, such as government
    water municipal institutes. To ensure the scalability and effective deployment
    of the IIoWT architecture as the complexity and scale of the water management
    network grow over time. We set the deadlines for each transaction in the blockchain
    network as shown in Algorithm 2. The main concern is ensuring the resource’s scalability
    and overall execution time (e.g., computation time and communication time) must
    be less than the given deadlines on all transactions. All nodes have sufficient
    resources for scaling up and down in the blockchain networks. Consequently, physical
    servers share all processing data with virtual servers in different locations.
    Additionally, the water distributor digitally shares water quality data with end
    users based on their applications and interfaces throughout the processing phase
    within the architecture. However, ensuring security is crucial when dealing with
    heterogeneous nodes. Therefore, we propose utilizing blockchain technology to
    generate hash data before offloading it to another node, employing asymmetric
    SHA-256 hashing schemes. Algorithm 2 BCTD scheduling scheme To ensure secure communication,
    we implemented a combination of public and private keys for encryption and decryption,
    allowing for the transformation of data into readable forms at different computing
    nodes. In addition, we developed the Blockchain Transaction Data (BCTD) scheme,
    where encryption and decryption processes on current nodes are treated as blocks.
    Each block contains essential information such as a unique identifier (bid), current
    hashing (ch), previous hashing (phs), data transactions, offloading details, validation
    rules, and acknowledgments during the validation process between data transfers
    among nodes. This scheme transforms data transactions into a transparent and immutable
    format, enhancing the security and efficiency of our study. The study introduces
    the BCTD Algorithm 2 for data validation among nodes in the blockchain, which
    encompasses the following steps. • The blockchain scheme utilizes the input from
    the combined results obtained from the CNN and LSTM schemes on the given data
    modalities within the architecture. For example, the blockchain input is across
    all blockchain blocks. • Steps 1 to 8 illustrate the blockchain’s encryption,
    decryption, and data validation phases, implemented across different nodes. •
    Steps 9 to 13 involve data validation in its immutable form, based on predetermined
    rules. • These rules consist of generated hashing patterns, where the miner node
    establishes the blockchain rules for the other nodes. • Steps 10 to 21 demonstrate
    the processing of blockchain data at various nodes, following the predefined rules
    and utilizing the current and previous hash values. • The miner node, which in
    our case is the government institution, holds the authority to add or remove blocks
    within the blockchain architecture. • Steps 22 to 24 outline the matching of each
    transaction across nodes, using a designed proof-of-work pattern and rules during
    offloading and generating acknowledgments if the transaction validations are successful.
    • In cases where transactions are deemed invalid, the blockchain identifies them
    as suspicious within the architecture. Time complexity and space complexity of
    CNN-LSTM for considered problem In this study, we exploited different schemes
    such as CNN, LSTM, and blockchain validation for the data standardization process.
    We determined the time complexity of CNN based on . The N shows the number of
    convolutional layers, pooling layer, fitness, and sigmoid function of the processing.
    The LSTM has three distinct gates: input, output, and forget gates. Therefore,
    time complexity becomes . The blockchain has many blocks for validation. Therefore,
    the time complexity is determined in number of blocks for data standardization
    on heterogeneous nodes. The space complexity is determined in heterogeneous nodes
    based on available resources in IIoWT architecture. These classes include raw
    water ingredient monitoring, supply tank management, storage tank management,
    water flow control, water motor pump distribution, and water volume calculation
    based on data collected from different sensors. The digital twin system involves
    physical and virtual components, utilizing Amazon Lambda services. It incorporates
    blockchain technology to enhance the security and transparency of the virtual
    water management process. The physical and virtual server resources are determined
    in ∊ and ∊ . Performance evaluation and implementation In this part, we designed
    the simulation environment based on various components. We mainly focused on the
    IIoWT (Industrial Internet of Water Things) architecture components we prepared
    for the simulation. We compared these components with existing architectures,
    algorithms, data validations, and performance for distributed water management
    in smart cities. The IIoWT architecture comprises various components, including
    sensors, computing nodes, wireless communication, and different programming application
    interfaces (API). We defined and listed the simulation parameters in Table 2.

    Table 2 displays the configuration of nodes in the IIoWT architecture. It encompasses
    various computing nodes, including physical servers, digital twin virtual servers,
    and end-user interfaces. All the nodes in the architecture utilize Amazon’s virtualization
    technology. The physical and digital twin servers have adaptive and scalable storage,
    allowing for flexible expansion or reduction based on specific resource requirements.
    On the other hand, the end-user devices or interfaces are fixed and possess resource-constrained
    characteristics. IIoWT architecture implementation based on Amazon baseline architecture
    The open-source code for industrial IoT digital twin in water management, designed
    for simulation and design purposes, is available on GitHub by Amazon. This code
    provides a baseline application programming interface (API) that comprises various
    classes essential for water management, as shown in Fig. 2. These classes include
    raw water ingredient monitoring, supply tank management, storage tank management,
    water flow control, water motor pump distribution, and water volume calculation
    based on data collected from different sensors. The digital twin system involves
    physical and virtual components, utilizing Amazon Lambda services. It incorporates
    blockchain technology to enhance the security and transparency of the virtual
    water management process. Additionally, different sensors within the system generate
    images to detect and monitor water leakage. Overall, the digital twin code developed
    by Amazon for water management demonstrates the integration of virtual and physical
    components, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure efficient and secure operations
    in water management processes. The code is publicly available on Github for further
    exploration and utilization. The Amazon Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a simulator
    that enables the creation of virtual physical servers and digital twin servers.
    This functionality is made possible through the Amazon Virtual Lab, which provides
    the necessary hardware and software resources. It offers an open environment where
    mobile applications for industrial water management can be seamlessly connected
    to mobile devices. The environment is based on Docker containers, allowing the
    encryption of complete image data within blockchain blocks within the IIoWT architecture.
    In our research, we utilized two datasets that had been trained and tested: one
    focused on water quality and the other on water leakage detection. In our study,
    we utilized trained and tested datasets for our analysis. The CNN-LSTM algorithm
    collected data from sensors and made decisions based on the models that had been
    trained and tested. Blockchain technology was implemented on both physical and
    virtual digital twin servers. However, in the case of end-user applications or
    interfaces, blockchain was solely utilized to ensure the validity of drinking
    water data within the home environment. All nodes within the system were interconnected
    through distributed networks, ensuring interoperability and seamless communication
    between them. Download : Download high-res image (467KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. IIoWT implementation with different components. Water sensors datasets
    benchmark To evaluate existing studies’ performance, we exploited the same datasets
    with different features to compare the proposed work with the existing studies.
    The datasets consisted of different sensor data as the benchmark with the data
    modality as shown in Table 3. We applied blockchain technology to sensor data
    based on the SHA-256 scheme to collect valid sensor data among fog and cloud-enabled
    water components. Drinking water plays a vital role in human life, and therefore,
    government healthcare agencies always prioritize ensuring clean drinking water
    in smart cities. At national and international levels, water is generated from
    raw materials such as seawater and other resources, collected at power plants,
    and treated following predefined government regulations. Consequently, it is imperative
    to adhere to these regulations to purify drinking water at the power plants. To
    monitor compliance with these regulations, we continuously monitor the readings
    of various sensors in real-time using other computing nodes. We collected the
    real-time water quality and monitoring data in different time zones with different
    parameters. We generated sensor values using various hyperparameters, such as
    Sensor, Count, Mean, STD (standard deviation), Min (minimum), 12 am-8 am, 9 am-5
    pm, 6 pm-1.55 pm, and Max (maximum). Among these sensors, the pH sensor is of
    utmost importance as it measures the acidity level in water. As per the guidelines
    set by the government and the World Health Organization, the pH values must fall
    within the range of 6 to 9. Hardness in water consisted of different gradients
    such as magnesium and calcium salts. These salts are observed in water randomly
    during flows in various sources. Solid in water consisted of other ingredients.
    For instance, bicarbonates, chlorides, sulfates, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and
    potassium. Therefore, it has a standardized threshold to make the water into drink
    form. For instance, 499 mg/l to 999 mg/l were incorporated in water during processing
    at the power plants. The study adjusted the chlorine ratio to clean water at a
    concentration of 4 to 6 milligrams per liter. A certain percentage of ammonia
    was added to the water to render it suitable for drinking. Additionally, the water
    was supplemented with a sulfate level ranging from 2500 to 3000 milligrams per
    liter. The water leakage datasets included images such as Raw Water Plant, Motor
    Pump Filter, Water Flow Pump, Purify Pump, Drinking Clean Water, and Storage.
    The water leakage and flow and storage level of water tanks are determined and
    monitored in the IIoWT based on trained and tested models of dataset Z. Table

    analysis and discussion The study assessed the performance of existing industrial
    IoT water management architectures and compared them with the proposed IIoWT architecture,
    which utilized different components. Baseline approaches, namely IoT-Water [13],
    [14], [15] and random IoT-Water (RIoT-Water) [16], [17], [18], [19], were considered
    in this evaluation. These baseline architectures were employed to manage water
    quality in smart cities’ drinking water distribution. The architectures comprised
    computing nodes, sensors, wireless networks, and raw material sources for water,
    all simulated in the study. The architecture played a crucial role in determining
    the flow of raw water, the ingredients present in it, and the additional ingredients
    added to the water plant. In the experiments, we implemented component calibration
    using multi-ANOVA testing techniques. The random data and solution were assumed
    to follow normal distributions. We compared IoT water architectures using different
    sensor datasets, namely T and Z. These sensors’ values were collected and presented
    in Table 3. In Fig. 3, the x-axis represents the sensor data values ranging from
    100 to 1200, while the y-axis displays the total processing time involved in receiving
    raw data at the power plant and processing it using the given dataset in the architectures.
    This figure illustrates the performance evaluation of the architectures when water,
    obtained from various sources, undergoes processing based on different inputs
    outlined in Table 3. Remarkably, the IIoWT architecture outperformed all existing
    water architectures regarding raw data processing. This superiority can be attributed
    to monitoring water flow at different intervals, considering the availability
    of water flow in various time zones. We can effectively minimize delays by adjusting
    the water flow and raw material mechanism during nighttime compared to daytime.
    Consequently, IIoWT demonstrated superior performance in reducing total delays,
    measured in seconds, compared to other existing architectures. Download : Download

    trained and tested datasets processing total time (seconds). The powerful physical
    servers at the power plant retrieve data from various sources to transform raw
    water into drinkable form. These physical servers are solely responsible for executing
    all dataset tasks related to data modality, as depicted in Fig. 3. With minimal
    processing time, measured in seconds, these physical servers efficiently handle
    the data modality data, even when presented in different formats. In Fig. 3, the
    proposed IIoWT architecture surpasses all other existing water architectures in
    data modality processing while adhering to the established standards in distributed
    water management. In IIoWT, the training and testing time is adaptive and provides
    enhanced accuracy for various modalities. By employing a CNN, the architecture
    effectively extracts water ingredient features from sensors and utilizes the trained
    and tested data for decision-making regarding water level and quality management.
    As illustrated in Fig. 3, IIoWT demonstrates significantly improved training and
    testing validation times compared to existing IoT water and RIoT water architectures
    in physical and virtual server environments during the processing phase. We have
    leveraged digital twin technology to create virtual servers for managing distributed
    water processing. This innovation has fostered seamless collaboration among government
    entities, companies, and users, enabling the sharing of data and components. Instead
    of relying on physical servers in different places, we have opted for virtual
    servers in the distributed water system. These integrated virtual servers, which
    are real and constantly updated, ensure the sharing of up-to-date data. In summary,
    digital twin technology facilitates the smooth sharing of components and data,
    leading to improved collaboration, real-time monitoring, enhanced efficiency,
    and better decision-making through simulations and predictive analysis. The virtual
    servers in digital twins replicate the physical servers and can be easily scaled
    up or down during dataset processing. In Fig. 3, it is evident that the processing
    and data sharing time of the digital twin virtual servers is significantly reduced
    compared to physical servers. Consequently, the IIoWT architecture yields optimal
    results, and the successfully shared trained and tested models outperform existing
    IoT and RIoT water architectures. In addition to physical and virtual servers,
    the system incorporates other nodes, such as end-processing nodes. The end-user
    interface retrieves information about drinking water from various datasets, which
    include gradient details. End users can access a limited set of dataset sensors,
    specifically catering to incoming water data. These sensors provide parameters
    such as water cleanliness, pH, salt content, chlorine level, and other relevant
    factors. Such data points assist end users in evaluating the effectiveness of
    water in maintaining good health, aligning with predefined guidelines. Fig. 4
    showcases the IIoWT architecture, specifically designed with distinct data modalities
    for end users. This design reduces processing time and real-time data updates
    compared to IoT architectures. Consequently, end users receive timely and accurate
    information about drinking water quality. Download : Download high-res image (190KB)

    at end users interfaces with optimal processing. Standardizing data is crucial
    for effective distributed water management in smart cities. We have implemented
    data standardization across various nodes, including physical servers, virtual
    servers, and end users. Maintaining data processing and sharing accuracy is fundamental
    to the IIoWT architecture. Data standardization ensures that data conforms to
    a predefined set of standards across different nodes while maintaining data privacy
    and security (as depicted in Fig. 4). To assess the accuracy of data standardization,
    we conducted evaluations using different IoT architectures and varied datasets,
    such as T and Z. Fig. 4 demonstrates that IIoWT achieves a high level of accuracy
    in data standardization and sharing, nearing 99.9%, surpassing existing architectures.
    This achievement can be attributed to the robust data validation processes and
    the interoperability of the architecture, which are optimized components of the
    IIoWT framework. Standardizing data has different data formats and distributed
    water management in smart cities. We have implemented data standardization with
    the given datasets on different nodes, including physical servers, virtual servers,
    and end users. Maintaining data processing and sharing accuracy is fundamental
    to the IIoWT architecture. Data standardization ensures that data conforms to
    a predefined set of standards across different nodes while maintaining data privacy
    and security (as depicted in Fig. 4). To assess the accuracy of data standardization,
    we conducted evaluations using different IoT architectures and varied datasets,
    such as T and Z. Fig. 4 demonstrates that IIoWT achieves a high level of accuracy
    in data standardization and sharing, nearing 95% to 99%, surpassing existing architectures.
    These optimal results and robustness in data validation processes are obtained
    due to the interoperability of the architecture, which are optimized components
    of the IIoWT framework. Interoperability is the seamless cross-platform in heterogeneous
    nodes, where technologies and protocols are suggested in existing IoT water architectures.
    The existing interoperate technologies, such as socket programming interface [48]
    and remote procedure call [49] were widely exploited in cross-platform water with
    heterogeneous nodes. These are client and server message and data broker call
    protocols, where different data formats and data standardization are followed
    by nodes. However, socket and RPC are slow when they travel and offload the different
    formats in IoT water architectures. Fig. 5 (a) shows the accuracy of data sharing
    with the different formats among physical servers and virtual servers during water
    monitoring and processing in the architectures. Fig. 5 (b) shows the data format
    standardization among physical and virtual and end users interface with the higher
    accuracy with the MQTT broker application programming interface. Fig. 5 shows
    the proposed MQTT interoperability with IIoWT architecture has more optimal results
    than socket and RPC protocols. The main reason is that the existing protocols
    only share and convert the data into one form, such as extensible markup language
    and java object notation protocols. Therefore, they lose their accuracy when different
    data formats are shared among nodes. Therefore, MQTT obtained the optimal accuracy
    as compared to existing protocols. The research incorporated blockchain validation
    at the end of the CNN-LSTM process. Data encryption and decryption were performed
    using SHA-256, and transaction validation relied on proof of work validation across
    different nodes. Fig. 6(a) illustrates the three security schemes employed in
    IoT water architectures. Specifically, the integration of CNN-LSTM security and
    machine learning (ML) blockchain was explored in IoT water management to analyze
    data security through blockchain technology. Download : Download high-res image

    Fig. 6. Data validation and data standardization water quality and level monitoring
    in physical, virtual and end users nodes based on blockchain. By integrating machine
    learning techniques, blockchain technology becomes more adaptable and efficient
    in validating data formats and hashes among nodes. Throughout the experiment,
    the transparency and immutability of shared data demonstrated higher accuracy
    when utilizing the CNN-LSTM-BCTD scheme. Fig. 6(a) showcases the blockchain validation
    process between virtual servers and physical servers after implementing the CNN-LSTM
    schemes on the data before offloading them to each other. The study involved executing
    1200 transactions per block, and the results displayed in Fig. 6(a) indicated
    that the CNN-LSTM-BCTD approach achieved an optimal accuracy of approximately
    99% compared to existing security and blockchain technologies. Moreover, the CNN-LSTM-BCTD
    method attained higher accuracy in data validation among servers and end-user
    interfaces, as depicted in Fig. 6(b). CNN-LSTM-BCTD achieves higher data validation
    among different nodes compared to existing studies due to several key factors.
    One crucial aspect is the validation process through multiple interrogations within
    the CNN-LSTM-BCTD framework. By leveraging this approach, the miner node has the
    capability to add and delete blockchain blocks, ensuring the integrity of the
    transactional data. An important feature integrated into the CNN-LSTM-BCTD approach
    is validating the ”vanish ingredient” transaction. This validation process involves
    verifying each node’s original and transactional data before transferring them
    to other nodes. By implementing this step, the proposed method significantly enhances
    data validation across different nodes. As a result, CNN-LSTM-BCTD offers superior
    data validation among various nodes compared to existing studies. Its rigorous
    validation process and inclusion of the ”vanish ingredient” transaction verification
    contribute to the higher data integrity and accuracy achieved in the proposed
    method. Finding and Limitation We presented the IIoWT architecture incorporating
    blockchain and digital twin technologies and processed the data modality using
    the CNN-LSTM approach. The main finding of IIoWT architecture is to examine the
    existing IoT water systems and discuss their limitations. We presented the simulation
    parameters and described the implementation of IIoWT. We discussed each deployment
    step in detail. Furthermore, we analyzed the obtained results, demonstrating the
    efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed IIoWT and CNN-LSTM-BCTD schemes for
    water management across various computing nodes. There are many limitations of
    the proposed IIoWT architecture. In our proposed IIoWT architecture, we did not
    consider the failure ratio of different components in the large and distributed
    setup. The work did not consider the motor’s energy and power consumption of computing
    nodes. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we have presented the IIoWT architecture
    incorporating blockchain and digital twin technologies and processed the data
    modality using the CNN-LSTM approach. We aimed to address the research challenges
    by formulating relevant research questions and highlighting the contributions
    of this study. We thoroughly examined the existing IoT water systems and discussed
    their limitations. We also provided a comprehensive overview of the problem formulation
    and proposed algorithm, detailing the steps and scenarios involved. In the evaluation
    section, we presented the simulation parameters and described the implementation
    of IIoWT. We discussed each deployment step in detail. Furthermore, we analyzed
    the obtained results, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed
    IIoWT and CNN-LSTM-BCTD schemes for water management across various computing
    nodes. However, there is still considerable room for improvement in the existing
    IIoWT architecture. The current system faces challenges such as an increasing
    failure ratio of different components in the large and distributed setup. The
    processing cost has also become prohibitively high due to the numerous components
    involved. We will address these issues by considering new constraints such as
    fault tolerance, processing cost optimization, and data safety within the proposed
    IIoWT architecture. These improvements will enhance the reliability and efficiency
    of the system, ensuring its smooth operation in the future. We will also improve
    the motor’s energy and power consumption of computing nodes in the proposed architecture
    IIoWT. Code and data availability The study exploited the existing Amazon industrial
    IoT water management simulator and integrated the digital twin and blockchain

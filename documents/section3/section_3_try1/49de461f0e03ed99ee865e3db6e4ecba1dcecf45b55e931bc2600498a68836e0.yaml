    Neale Keywords:   Agricultural water management, Irrigation prescription mapping,
    Irrigation scheduling, Precision irrigation, Remote sensing, Sensors, Spatial
    crop evaOotranspiration, Unmanned aerial systems. Highlights Unmanned aerial systems
    (UAS) are able to provide data for precision irrigation management. Improvements
    are needed regarding UAS platforms, sensors, processing software, and regulations.
    Integration of multi-scale imagery into scientific irrigation scheduling tools
    are needed for technology adoption. Abstract. Several research institutes, laboratories,
    academic programs, and service companies around the United States have been developing
    programs to utilize small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) as an instrument to improve
    the efficiency of in-field water and agronomical management. This article describes
    a decade of efforts on research and development efforts focused on UAS technologies
    and methodologies developed for irrigation management, including the evolution
    of aircraft and sensors in contrast to data from satellites. Federal Aviation
    Administration (FAA) regulations for UAS operation in agriculture have been synthesized
    along with proposed modifications to enhance UAS contributions to irrigated agriculture.
    Although it is feasible to use sUAS technology to produce maps of actual crop
    coefficients, actual crop evapotranspiration, and soil water deficits, for irrigation
    management, the technology and regulations need to evolve further to facilitate
    a successful wide adoption and application. Improvements and standards are needed
    in terms of cameras‘ spectral (bands) ranges, radiometric resolutions and associated
    calibrations, fuel/power technology for longer missions, better imagery processing
    software, and easier FAA approval of higher altitudes flight missions among other
    issues. Furthermore, the sUAS technology would play a larger role in irrigated
    agriculture when integrating multi-scale data (sUAS, ground-based or proximal,
    satellite) and soil water sensors is addressed, including the need for advances
    on processing large amounts of data from multiple and different sources, and integration
    into scientific irrigation scheduling (SIS) systems for convenience of decision
    making. Desirable technological innovations, and features of the next generation
    of UAS platforms, sensors, software, and methods for irrigated agriculture, are
    discussed. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 13 Share Facebook X Email LinkedIn

    application methods is a present-day concern across the world that can be resolved
    by enhancing application efficiency through the adoption of advanced irrigation
    techniques. Sprinkler irrigation is a method that has high application efficiency,
    which can be further increased when coupled with automation toward precision irrigation.
    The objectives of this review are to summarize the main aspects of sprinkler and

    irrigation with precision applications using automation with a sensor-based mechanism
    for field data collection, data transformation, data analysis, and operation of
    IoT-based automatic solenoid valves can save 20–30% more irrigation water and
    increase crop yield by 20–27%. An analytical understanding and knowledge of the

    use of water at the farm level in traditional irrigation application methods is
    a present-day concern across the world that can be resolved by enhancing application
    efficiency through the adoption of advanced irrigation techniques. Sprinkler irrigation
    is a method that has high application efficiency, which can be further increased
    when coupled with automation toward precision irrigation. The objectives of this
    review are to summarize the main aspects of sprinkler and precision irrigation
    and their development, scope, and future prospects specifically in Asian countries.
    In this paper, a modified methodology, inspired by PRISMA guidelines, was used
    to explore the available literature to summarize the existing knowledge in the
    field. Regarding the technological aspects of the analyzed works, it became evident
    that sprinkler systems are an efficient method to not only irrigate crops (with
    39% water saving) but also for the application of fertilizers with higher efficiency
    (>35%) and water productivity (>14.1%) compared with gravity irrigation systems.
    Moreover, this paper highlights the prominent features of precision irrigation
    for maximizing agricultural productivity. The use of sprinkler irrigation with
    precision applications using automation with a sensor-based mechanism for field
    data collection, data transformation, data analysis, and operation of IoT-based
    automatic solenoid valves can save 20–30% more irrigation water and increase crop
    yield by 20–27%. An analytical understanding and knowledge of the field were used
    to draw conclusions that are thought-provoking for scientists, researchers, and
    other stakeholders. Keywords: application efficiency; sprinkler types; sprinkler

    Revolution has pushed many countries with agriculture-based economies to introduce
    reforms, resulting in rapid agricultural growth. The world’s agricultural growth
    can be assessed from the fact that only in China has total grain production reached
    117% with a 2% annual increase [1]. The agriculture-based gross domestic product
    (GDP) is growing at a rate of 9.4% [2] worldwide. There are still opportunities
    to double agricultural productivity by adopting mechanized practices that enhance
    crop yields as well as crop intensity [3]. The prime input for agricultural production
    is water, which is even more important in irrigated agriculture and plays a vital
    role in food security. Irrigated agriculture represents one-fifth of agricultural
    land and about half of the production is being cultivated directly from irrigated
    agriculture, screening its potential for crop production with more diversification
    and intensification [4]. According to a study [5], 80% of cereal crops and 90%
    of vegetable crops are being grown under irrigated agriculture; therefore, this
    sector is being expanded in many countries through the introduction of essential
    and mechanized irrigation practices. This development of irrigated areas can be
    assessed from the growth of irrigated land in China (Figure 1) due to it being
    one of the world’s leading agricultural economies [1]. Figure 1. Development of
    irrigated areas in China (1950–2020) [6,7]. Growth in irrigated land demands more
    irrigation water and triggers the issue of water security. Being a major consumer,
    the world’s agriculture sector uses more than 70% of available freshwater [8].
    The per capita water availability is decreasing all over the world and it has
    been projected that by 2050, 45 countries will be water scared (<500 m3/capita/annum)
    and 87 will be at the margin (<1700 m3/capita/annum) out of 180 countries [9],
    indicating increasing pressure on available water resources for the production
    of food to feed growing populations [10]. The provision of surface water resources
    to highly irrigated areas and the effective management of available resources
    are the only methods to sustain development in the agriculture sector to ensure
    the world’s food security with environmental sustainability [5]. This problem
    can be mitigated from two sides. One side is the enhancement of water availability
    by building storage infrastructures and the other side is the efficient use of
    water at the farm level [11,12,13]. In this respect, several projects in the 1990s
    were launched throughout the world to introduce water-efficient techniques for
    improving application efficiencies of traditional irrigation practices [14]. Under
    traditional irrigation systems, water is applied at constant intervals without
    considering the crop water requirements and the application efficiencies of these
    methods are also low as varying amounts of water are applied throughout the field.
    This uneven irrigation could over-irrigate a portion of the land while the other
    portion may experience water stress due to less irrigation [15,16,17]. Sprinkler
    irrigation is a type of high-efficiency irrigation system that has been used at
    the farm level since the late 1970s. This technology has proven its capability
    to save significant amounts of irrigation water with greater uniformity compared
    with other surface irrigation methods (basin, border, beds, furrow, etc.) [18,19]
    in addition to improvement in yield and fertilizer management with less leaching
    effects [20]. The proven facts regarding the benefits of sprinkler irrigation
    have encouraged farmer communities to use this method as an alternate system to
    overcome the problem of low application efficiency at the farm level. This technology
    has become very popular in Western countries, mainly in the USA and Europe with
    areas of 3 Mha and 2.5 Mha, respectively, under sprinkler irrigation until the
    1970s [21]. Many countries like Australia, Israel, China, etc., have developed
    and adopted different types of sprinkler irrigation systems and these are very
    popular in these countries. The adoption rate of sprinkler irrigation has been
    reported as 4.78% [22]. In China, the government is promoting the sprinkler irrigation
    system by launching demonstration projects at farmer fields, providing funds to
    research institutions to carry out research work, and launching subsidies for
    industries to manufacture sprinkler components at the indigenous level. The effectiveness
    of these exertions is demonstrated by the fact (Figure 1) that sprinkler irrigation
    is being adopted by farmers at a high rate and is replacing other irrigation practices
    at their farms. The water and fertilizer efficiency of sprinkler irrigation could
    be further enhanced by introducing advanced interventions like precision irrigation
    practices within the regular operation of manually operated sprinkler irrigation
    systems. The precision irrigation system is a combination of an irrigation system
    coupled with a control system, communication system, and information system for
    water applications in a precise and automatic way to achieve the highest possible
    crop water productivity [23,24]. It has been reported that by adopting sprinkler
    irrigation with precision application tools, maximum economic benefits can be
    driven [25,26]. To understand the effectiveness and applicability of precision
    irrigation for absolute water management at the farm level, previous research
    needs to be reviewed in a meaningful way to identify the research trends and hot
    spot directions for future research work within the subject field. The present
    review paper is an effort to examine the available literature related to sprinkler
    irrigation and precision irrigation using quantitative analysis in a systematic
    way. A careful identification of key influential factors affecting the development
    of sprinkler irrigation toward precision application methods was carried out to
    draw conclusions and thereby provide a state-of-the-art understanding of the topic
    to readers. The purpose of this work is to describe the insights of the research
    topic, understand the ambiguities and research gaps within the scope, and draw
    consistencies between prior research work and future research directions for researchers.
    2. Review Strategy and Exploration of Literature The spatial and temporal growth
    of research databases on a massive scale created a momentum toward summarizing
    research findings in an organized manner, leading to the development of new, systematic
    approaches to literature review since the start of the 21st century [27,28,29].
    A huge number of scholarly literatures on the use of sprinklers and precision
    irrigation in the disciplines of agriculture and engineering is available; therefore,
    systematically productive approaches were taken into account to assess the advanced
    knowledge on said subjects. To start the review process, the domain of this paper
    was divided into two major portions called sub-domains. These included (1) “sprinkler
    irrigation” and (2) “precision irrigation”. Other topics related to “irrigation
    water management” were taken in the study as a miscellaneous domain. The development
    in the research volume regarding these domains and published review papers can
    be seen in Figure 2, presents the volume of literature available only in one database
    (PubMed). This gradual growth in particular research work demands the summarization
    of research outcomes of different researchers to set future research directions
    in the subject field. Figure 2. The production of research publications related
    to specific topics from January 2005 to May 2023. The methodology adopted in the
    present study is inspired by the PRISMA 2020 guidelines [30]. A new strategy was
    designed by intergrading the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and the review approaches
    used by other researchers [31,32,33]. The literature related to each sub-domain
    was searched according to four approaches, illustrated in Figure 3. These approaches
    involved searching research papers based on manuscript titles, the keywords, the
    institution affiliation, and the citations of published articles. To achieve a
    speedy review, all searches were conducted using online scholar databases including
    Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Wiley, Science Direct, Springer, MDPI, Taylor & Francis,
    and journal websites. In these huge scholarly libraries, numerous research articles
    are available related to sprinkler irrigation and precision irrigation; therefore,
    a sturdy criterion was developed and adopted for the selection of the most influential
    research findings to eliminate unsuitable search results. Figure 3. Illustration
    of the mechanism through which information on the sub-domains of this paper was
    summarized and extracted. 2.1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria A comprehensive criteria
    to include or exclude literature for review proceedings was adopted. The inclusion
    criteria included (1) research published in prestigious journals, (2) research
    published in English and Chinese language, (3) research findings based on actual
    field studies, (4) publications having proper citations and available on the internet,
    (5) publications having relevant data for onward calculations of different quantitative
    parameters, (6) priority was given to journal publications, and (7) the date of
    publication was after 2005. Similarly, the exclusion criteria included (1) review
    articles, (2) research publications with duplicate or similar results, (3) publications
    containing possible errors in the data, and (4) a publication date older than
    2005. The process of obtaining the final search results is illustrated in Figure
    4. Figure 4. Illustration of the process regarding the improvement in the review
    summary using inclusion/exclusion criteria. 2.2. Summary of the Review Process
    The information was reviewed from renowned research databases and journal websites.
    The reviewed publications were dated from 2005 to the present but, of course,
    preference was given to recent publications. Figure 5 presents a summary of the
    review process. In Figure 5a, the year-wise number of reviewed papers is presented.
    It can clearly be seen that the majority of papers were selected between 2012
    and the present with a peak in 2022. In Figure 5b, the illustration of major review
    domains is shown. Most of the papers were reviewed related to sprinkler irrigation
    followed by precision irrigation. The papers related to all other topics are shown
    as other papers in Figure 5. In Figure 5c, the application of inclusion/exclusion
    criteria is given by illustrating the percentage of included papers, which was
    85% of the total reviewed papers. The remaining 15% of papers were not included
    in this study because their results were found to be repeated with similar input
    conditions. Figure 5. Summary of (a) no. of review papers, (b) subject-wise reviews,
    and (c) included and excluded papers. 3. Sprinkler Irrigation Sprinkler irrigation
    is a type of pressurized irrigation that irrigates crops by spraying water in
    the form of small droplets like natural rainfall. It has numerous advantages over
    surface irrigation or even over other pressurized irrigation technologies like
    drip irrigation as it can not only apply water to a crop but also flush its leaves
    and regulate canopy temperature to improve the efficiency of the photosynthesis
    process. Many research studies have been conducted on sprinkler irrigation that
    proved its viability and adoptability for economically higher crop production
    [34,35,36,37]. These systems have some limitations and disadvantages over other
    pressurized irrigation systems. These disadvantages include higher capital and
    operational costs, damage to soft fruit plants, low application efficiency in
    windy areas, and unsuitability for fields with fine textured soil [38]. Under
    humid conditions, moisture-related diseases may emerge within the crop canopy
    due to the presence of excessive moisture after the application of overhead sprinklers
    [39]. Romero et al. [40] reported the outbreak of fungal-related diseases within
    crop plants grown under humid and warm conditions. Belo et al. [41] reported management
    techniques including irrigation time and frequencies to reduce the risks of spreading
    bacterial-related diseases due to heavy moisture and dirt being splashed into
    the plant canopy of onion plants. But on the other hand, foliar water application
    by using an overhead sprinkler is beneficial for plants and good for protecting
    plants against frost when the temperature is at or below zero °C [42]. Despite
    these minimal limitations, sprinkler irrigation has marvelous advantages with
    high water application efficiency in the field [43]. The field application efficiency
    of different irrigation systems in comparison with different sprinkler types is
    illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6. Application efficiencies of different types
    of sprinkler systems. 3.1. Types of Sprinkler Systems In the early usage of sprinkler
    systems, single-point sprinklers were used with moveable positions, and the water
    was supplied to sprinklers through iron pipes [7]. The iron pipes were susceptible
    to erosion and heavy when moving sprinklers from one place to another. Iron pipes
    were replaced with aluminum pipes in the first phase and then with plastic/PVC
    pipes along with plentiful progress in the design of irrigation systems in the
    late 1990s [44]. By increasing the understanding of sprinkler systems, moveable
    machines were developed with sprinkler nozzles that can be transported throughout
    the field to irrigate entire areas with the same sprinkler setup. This kind of
    sprinkler system has high application efficiencies and more irrigation coverage
    with less labor requirements. This form of sprinkler system has many types and
    is adopted as per field conditions due to specific limitations associated with
    each type. The features and distribution uniformities (DUs) of different sprinkler
    systems were obtained from the literature [43,45] and are shown in Table 1. Generally,
    Equation (1) is used to calculate the DU of a sprinkler irrigation system. The
    DU range of each sprinkler type is provided in Table 1. The DU depends on the
    crop type, field condition, and environmental exposure of a sprinkler system.
    The maximum DU value belongs to lab experiments and the minimum value belongs
    to field conditions. 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝐷𝑈)= 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡ℎ

    types of sprinkler systems [43]. The center pivot system has many advantages over
    other types; therefore, this type of system has been installed in more than 13%
    of the area under sprinkler irrigation in China [46]. Researchers are working
    on a center pivot system to increase its efficiencies via a nozzle configuration
    corresponding to the particular movement speed [47,48]. Ma et al. studied the
    uniformity and the application efficacies of a two-span center pivot system and
    reported a 66.1–68.4% uniformity coefficient [49]. Several other researchers worked
    on other types of moveable sprinklers and conducted performance tests to determine
    their suitability and to improve the characteristics of existing systems [50,51,52,53].
    Hand-mover gravity sprinklers are mostly used in hilly areas where sufficient
    gravitational head is available to operate sprinklers without irrigation pumps
    [54]. 3.2. Sprinkler Nozzle Sprinkler nozzles are key components in the whole
    sprinkler system and their uniform operation determines the efficiency of the
    system. The study of sprinkler nozzles was limited before the 1970s; however,
    the topics gradually received attention due to the increasing demand for sprinkler
    systems. In the late 1970s, work on designing impact sprinklers was started by
    an industrial group, and a series of sprinkler nozzles were designed with varying
    diameters (20 mm to 80 mm inner diameter). The Chinese government put a special
    effort into the development of new sprinkler nozzles by reverse engineering imported
    sophisticated nozzles and promoting research and development in the same area
    [50,55]. Currently, researchers and enterprises have been working on the development
    of new products and refining the hydraulic performance of existing sprinklers
    with structural improvements. Low-pressure sprinklers are an example of the improvement
    in the design of existing sprinklers. The research and development (R&D) work
    by researchers on sprinkler characteristics is presented in Table 2. 3.3. Low-Pressure
    Sprinklers The increase in energy demand and its high cost are forcing researchers
    to introduce new developments in the existing irrigation technologies so that
    these systems could still be used as a viable source in the new era. Normal sprinkler
    irrigation is operated at a high pressure of around (≥300 KPa), causing more energy
    consumption [56]. The low-pressure sprinkler is a new addition to the existing
    technology, enabling users to operate sprinklers at <200 KPa and subsequently
    lowering operating costs with different management strategies [56,57,58]. The
    key principle of designing a low-pressure sprinkler is to change the internal
    nozzle structure to reduce the operating pressure without compromising the dispersion
    uniformity of water droplets. Table 2. Research work on sprinkler nozzles by researchers.
    Li et al. designed a low-pressure rotary sprinkler with different dimensions of
    scatters and evaluated its performance; the authors reported satisfactory results
    regarding all selected performance parameters [47]. Other researchers improved
    the jet dispersion in low-pressure sprinklers by introducing a pair of aerated
    pipes inside the sprinkler nozzle [70]. The optimal groove numbers were identified
    during a series of experiments using D3000 range sprinklers after changing their
    plate structure [71]. Wang et al. [72] derived empirical equations for low-pressure
    sprinklers for operation under varying operating conditions and design parameters
    [73]. Ouazaa et al. derived a calculation model for cunnings of water distribution
    using low-pressure sprinklers [74]. Besides the changes in sprinkler design, researchers
    improved the field performance of sprinkler irrigation systems by optimizing the
    pipeline structure to reduce energy loss in order to promote the use of low-pressure
    sprinklers [75]. Tsaboula et al. studied the effects of different wind speeds
    on water spray through low-pressure sprinklers [76]. 3.4. Sprinkler Irrigation
    Use for Crop Production The use of sprinkler irrigation is not only for water
    saving but also to improve crop yield and reduce crop production costs by limiting
    crop inputs. Sprinkler irrigation has many advantages over other pressurized irrigation
    methods (drip irrigation) including rain characteristics and delivery of higher
    amounts of water during irrigation in time units. Sprinkler irrigation systems
    can be effective in large areas with less costly installation costs. The regular
    operation, maintenance, and operational troubleshooting of sprinkler irrigation
    systems are easier than drip irrigation. The benefits of sprinkler systems over
    other irrigation systems have been reported by many researchers [77,78,79,80,81,82].
    Sprinkler irrigation can be applied to a variety of crops, soils, and field conditions
    compared with other systems. These are efficient for keeping crops well flourished
    and maximizing yield; therefore, about 6% of irrigated area in China has been
    covered with sprinkler irrigation [7]. Some prolific findings regarding better
    crop production under sprinkler irrigation are given in Table 3. Table 3. The
    benefits of the use of sprinkler irrigation for crop production. To obtain better
    crop response under a sprinkler system, the fertilizer must be applied with water
    for the highest crop productivity. The overall fertilizer use efficiency has been
    reported at only 30% [89], which can be improved by its application using sprinkler
    irrigation systems. The injection of fertilizer via sprinkler irrigation is only
    possible with the use of injection devices. Different injection devices and application
    methods have been reported according to specific operating or field conditions
    [41,90,91,92]. Irrigation water and fertilizer could be further saved using variable
    rate technology (VRT), which means specific water application on a particular
    portion of the field [93]. The first VRT system was introduced in Asia in 2014
    [94] followed by continuous research work on modifications of VRT systems. One
    researcher attuned the variable spray of the sprinkler nozzle by changing the
    operating pressure, flow rate, and internal structure [95], while another researcher
    invented the variable spray mechanism of CPS using infrared thermography [96].
    A GPS-based operating system was developed by a group of scientists, which can
    apply fertilizer at variable rates by changing the duty cycle and pivoting the
    operating speed [54]. In present times, VRT machines are capable of applying water
    and fertilizers as per the soil conditions and plant needs [97]. 3.5. Sprinkler
    Design for Better Microclimate and Associated Field Losses Sprinkler systems revolutionized
    farm irrigation methods with marvelous advantages. The efficiency of these systems
    is associated with the design of pumping systems, delivery pipes, and sprinkler
    devices according to the crops, weather, and field conditions [98]. The optimum
    design and selection of sprinkler components can be helpful in installing a system
    with economical cost and better performance for crop growing. Several techniques
    for designing sprinkler systems are available including graphical, analytical,
    and simulation techniques [99]. Bing et al. introduced the genetic algorithm (GA)
    technique for the design of an efficient irrigation system based on simulation
    research work [100]. Other researchers reported the use of binary coding genetic
    algorithms (BCGAs) for optimum water applications to different crops [101]; general
    genetic algorithms (GGAs) for irrigation scheduling, rotation, and its distribution
    [102]; and the use of single parent genetic algorithms (SPGAs) for space–time
    canal discharge distribution for irrigation rotation [103]. Liu et al. incorporated
    the weighting method (digital) using the MATLAB (R2013b) toolbox to analyze the
    distribution pattern of droplet size and identified the variation trends in distribution
    frequency under changing pressure at varying radial distances from sprinkler nozzles
    [104]. Based on the single-sprinkler installation approach, a line source sprinkler
    system with optimized design parameters was established using the analytical approach
    at Ferdowsi University [105]. These developed techniques are for the design of
    sprinkler systems for successful field operation with the ability to save significant
    amounts of irrigation water and create favorable conditions for crops by modifying
    field microclimate. Controlling field microclimate is an advantage that is associated
    with sprinkler irrigation for controlling the factors of high temperature and
    low humidity [106]. Hot wind drifts can cause an average of 5–10% yield loss that
    could be up to 20–30% under severe climate conditions. Similar results have also
    been reported by other researchers regarding abnormal crop growth and the reduction
    in final biomass [107,108]. Liu et al. conducted long-term scenario studies on
    sprinkler systems for winter wheat and reported a reduction in ambient crop temperature,
    low vapor pressure, and less transpiration [109]. The advantage of sprinkler applications
    also included improvement in photosynthesis and low respiration rates [110,111].
    Moreover, the positive impact of water spray on the temperature of the soil’s
    upper layer and the canopy temperature has been proven in other research works
    [112]. Cai et al. conducted a study on optimizing CPS to regulate field microclimate
    and reported improvement in the peak splits of temperature difference and photosynthesis
    rate [113]. Besides these optimistic impacts, there are some undesirable losses
    associated with sprinkler irrigation in terms of wind drift and evaporation. A
    small portion of the discharging water from sprinkler nozzles in the form of thin
    drops does not reach the crop canopy and evaporates in the air during its transfer,
    which is called wind drift or evaporation losses in sprinklers [114,115,116].
    The researchers’ findings provide evidence that the scale of wind drift depends
    on wind speed and weather conditions [117,118] and it varies from 3.6 to 7.2%
    [119]. Colombo et al. reported 3.38% losses of wind drift under the regular operation
    of CPS [120]. The variation in wind drift was examined by Playan et al. in a number
    of experiments (52 in 2004 and 39 in 2005) and reported the range of the magnitude
    of losses as 4.3–14.7 in 2004 and 0.3–8.3% in 2005 [121]. The wind drift losses
    in cold cum semi-arid climates were reported as 3.3–13.7% [122] and the same for
    Mediterranean regions as 5.8–36.4% [123]. Yazar revealed the average wind drift
    losses for various operating conditions and types of systems as 1.7–30.7% [124].
    These losses should be controlled otherwise these can cause water and energy loss
    as well as a reduction in crop yield and poor quality [125], which eventually
    increases production costs and decreases net income. Mole reported that 30–50%
    of total wind drift losses are due to direct evaporation from the air and the
    remaining part is due to the wind drifting [126]. The wind drift losses could
    be minimized by optimizing the operating pressure, speed of the vehicle, and sprinkler
    type. It was reported that the 1-Wob sprinkler has better efficiency and causes
    less drift losses [127]. Sandeghai et al. developed a multiple linear regression
    model to predict wind drift losses for various weather conditions under varying
    operating conditions [116]. Using the model, the worker can set the operating
    conditions as per the weather situation so that the wind drift losses can be minimized.
    By using the guidelines developed by different researchers [128,129,130], drift
    losses can be controlled to improve the application efficiency of sprinkler systems.
    4. Precision Irrigation Using Sprinklers Sprinkler irrigation systems can apply
    water and fertilizer precisely but manually operated sprinkler systems involve
    labor for their operation; moreover, it is difficult to apply irrigation as per
    the real-time crop water requirement, whereas precision irrigation is the latest
    water-saving technique for maximizing yield and providing water at a desired location
    based on actual crop water demand [15,131,132,133,134,135,136,137]. The potential
    of water saving with precision irrigation through sprinkler systems has been reported
    as 30% compared with conventional sprinkler systems [138]. The concept of precision
    irrigation is based on the temporal and spatial variation in the application rate
    of irrigation systems based on real-time crop water requirements [25,26]. The
    entire field or application area is tackled as small parts or zones having the
    same water requirement at a particular time. Then, irrigation is applied in every
    zone in the desired quantity using a smart application mechanism attached to an
    irrigation system. Precision irrigation keeps every part of the field at optimum
    moisture level for proper plant growth in a uniform way [139], which improves
    its productivity, yield quality, and water use efficiency [140]. Researchers studied
    water application via sprinklers using the principles of precision irrigation
    and reported marvelous results regarding efficient water applications [2,132,141,142,143,144,145,146].
    Precision irrigation involves (1) variable applications of irrigation water in
    space and time, regulated by the real-time monitoring of irrigation-related parameters
    in the field using sensors or other tools, (2) analyzing the data to develop irrigation
    schedules, and (3) feedback and operating mechanisms to control the irrigation
    machine using GPS to fulfill actual crop water requirements in every section of
    the field separately. To implement a precision irrigation system, advanced sensing,
    analyzing (simulating), and control technologies are adopted to achieve its best
    performance. This understanding of precision irrigation is also expressed as variable
    rate irrigation. Typical precision irrigation has been drawn by getting inspiration
    from the literature [147] and is shown in Figure 7. A precision system includes
    a mechanism for field data collection, data transformation to the control center/device,
    data analysis, and calibrated operation of IoT-based automatic solenoid valves
    to operate the irrigation system. Under precision applications, irrigation is
    applied frequently for short durations just to maintain the field water balance
    of a cropping system at every part of the field. Prior to the application of precision
    irrigation, the actual water requirement is calculated, and the operating time
    or intensities are designed for the onward operation of sprinkler vehicles. These
    calculations are referred to as irrigation scheduling. Figure 7. Overview of typical
    precision irrigation mechanism: (a) sensors for data collection from the field;
    (b) data transformation mechanism and transmitters; (c) data receiver and data
    analyzer for data calibration and to generate a command for the irrigation system;
    (d) remotely operated solenoid valves to operate the irrigation system as per
    commands generated by the data analyzer; and (e) the sprinkler irrigation system.
    4.1. Field Parameters Used for Irrigation Scheduling for Precision Irrigation
    The monitoring of field conditions is crucial for implementing precision irrigation
    for food production with minimum water usage. Monitoring of field conditions refers
    to the data collection regarding irrigation-related parameters that are capable
    of stating the real-time water balance of the crop system so that the desired
    water can be applied. Some basic parameters that are related to irrigation scheduling
    are categorized [17,148] into three classes or groups. Any of these parameters
    or the sum of some parameters could be adopted to determine irrigation scheduling
    under precision irrigation. The first group is associated with soil parameters
    including soil moisture, soil salinity, soil water absorption capacity, soil pH,
    etc. The second group is associated with plant parameters including leaf area
    index (LAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), stomatal conductance,
    evapotranspiration, leaf turgor pressure, crop water stress index, etc. Plant-related
    parameters for irrigation scheduling are relatively difficult to monitor but these
    parameters exhibit the most realistic picture of plant water balance and present
    the plant growth expected to be affected by droughts and nutrient deficiencies
    [149]. The third group contained climatic parameters including ambient temperature,
    humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, etc.
    These climatic parameters are put in the world-renowned “Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration
    model” for calculating actual evapotranspiration using crop coefficients for the
    development of irrigation schedules [150]. A summary of the literature review
    regarding the use of different parameters for precision irrigation has been taken
    from the literature [32] and illustrated in Figure 8 after modifications and improvements.
    The parameters are shown as per previously defined groups (crop parameters, soil
    parameters, and climatic parameters). Figure 8. Illustration of the literature
    showing the domains of monitoring parameters for precision irrigation. A: [151];

    Z: [173]; Aa: [174]; and Bb: [141]. 4.2. Data Collection Regarding Irrigation
    Scheduling for Precision Irrigation Precision irrigation requires the accurate
    measurement of field data related to the above-described parameters to implement
    its full scope in order to obtain maximum advantages. There are several ways to
    collect field data including the following: Manual monitoring using smart tools;
    Use of sensors (sensors for soil, plant, and climate parameters); Use of satellite
    data; Use of UAV for data collection. 4.2.1. Manual Monitoring Using Smart Tools
    The accuracy of monitoring field parameters is crucial to implementing precision
    irrigation in a true sense. The continuous and uninterrupted monitoring of irrigation-related
    parameters at different points at desired intervals can be conducted manually
    using smart sensing tools or devices. The biases in data collection by humans
    have been reported but the data regarding some specific plant or soil-related
    parameters could still be collected manually by following standard protocols [175].
    This method of data collection is convenient and easy to follow but it is very
    low in efficiency. 4.2.2. Use of Sensors Plant growth is highly dependent on the
    moisture level in the rhizosphere and frequent monitoring of moisture levels needs
    to be carried out for accurate irrigation scheduling. Accurate data collection
    regarding soil moisture on high temporal grounds is the only option for irrigation
    scheduling in a precise way [169,172,176]. Different kinds of sensors are available
    in the market and are being used for such purposes. One type is capacitance-based
    sensors, which are relatively low cost and can measure the moisture level with
    adequate reliability after efficacious calibration of the sensor with measured
    field data [177]. A more sophisticated device to monitor soil moisture is TDR
    (time domain reflectometry), which contains two electrodes. These electrodes are
    inserted in the soil column up to the desired depth and, afterward, an electric
    signal is generated from one electrode to another to assess the soil moisture
    by estimating travel time and soil conductance characteristics. The accuracy of
    TDR is high, but it is expensive to install in large numbers in open fields for
    monitoring soil moisture at different field spots. Bitella introduced the methodology
    to measure soil moisture at different depths at the same time using low-cost dielectric
    probes [131] while other researchers used IoT-based field monitoring devices for
    moisture measurements [162]. Huuskonen and Oksanen used drone cameras for remote
    measurement of soil moisture in upper soil layers [160]. Besides soil parameters,
    the use of climate parameters for irrigation scheduling has the highest ranking
    due to their extensive use among all contenders [143,149,162,166,178,179,180].
    Permanent weather stations or weather monitoring devices can be installed in the
    field to collect real-time climate data. The sensors to monitor plant or soil-related
    parameters can be installed on the moveable platform of an irrigation system like
    CPS for real-time monitoring during the irrigation cycle [181]. In addition to
    the moisture, soil and plant nutrients could also be monitored using soil nutrient
    detectors connected parallel to moisture sensors [182]. Joly developed a silicon
    chip for site-specific monitoring of soil nutrients [183]. 4.2.3. Application
    of Remote Sensing for Data Collection Satellite remote sensing is an excellent
    and reliable option to collect data on soil and plant-related parameters for irrigation
    under various environmental conditions throughout the world. The satellites can
    read ground data using different spectral bands and are capable of differentiating
    water-stressed crop areas and analyzing crop water needs at high spatial and temporal
    frequencies [184]. Many commercial satellites like MODIS, Landsat, SPOT, etc.,
    offer crop and soil moisture status at high temporal frequency [185]. Several
    researchers used open-source satellite data related to crop evapotranspiration,
    soil moisture, plant water stress, NDVI, etc., for the implementation of precision
    irrigation using sprinkler irrigation systems [186,187]. Reyes [188] used a satellite-based
    vegetation index to estimate actual crop water requirements for the design of
    irrigation scheduling for precise water applications in the field. Ramirez [189]
    used a GIS-based toolbox to explore satellite data for the assessment of soil
    moisture to determine crop water requirements. The 10–20% more water saving achieved
    by using integrated precision cum pressurized irrigation systems has been reported
    by many researchers who used satellite data for irrigation scheduling of various
    crops grown under varying field conditions [190,191]. 4.2.4. Use of UAV for Data
    Collection UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or “drones” are aircraft with no human
    pilots. The size of a UAV varies from small to large, depending upon the function
    that it can perform. UAVs are quick, affordable, and reliable alternatives to
    satellite data if the application area is small (local scale). Depending on the
    sensors carried by a UAV, various crop- and soil-based parameters for irrigation
    scheduling could be collected and monitored in real time at high spatial frequency.
    Various researchers used UAVs for the determination of crop water requirements
    [192], soil moisture [193], and plant water stress [194] for the implementation
    of precision irrigation, and satisfactory results were reported. 4.3. Techniques
    for Data Analysis and Management of Sprinkler Systems for Precision Irrigation
    The collected data were analyzed using several sophisticated techniques including
    modeling tools and multidimensional simulating software (DSSAT(v4.6), MATLAB(R2011b),
    APSIM (7.1), R(2.4.1.2) etc.) to predict spatially and temporally varied crop
    water requirements for developing irrigation maps for onward applications of precision
    irrigation. Mechanized techniques are essential in precision irrigation to manage
    sprinkler systems for efficient water applications using developed irrigation
    maps with less energy input and higher crop yield. The mechanized techniques belong
    to two big categories called open loop technique (OLT) and closed loop technique
    (CLT). In OLT, irrigation is controlled by a pre-set program designed for a particular
    field using input data regarding irrigation parameters [195]. The OLT is easier
    to follow and cheaper in cost; therefore, farmers prefer to adopt these techniques
    for implementing precision irrigation [196]. Farmers can set operating conditions
    (pre-timers, speed, and application rate) for any sprinkler system, which can
    be monitored during the entire operation of the irrigation machine. Many researchers
    reported the use of OLT by farmers for precision irrigation in their fields [197,198,199].
    The CLT is relatively difficult to implement but is more accurately related to
    the true spirit of precision irrigation using sprinkler irrigation systems with
    20–30% more efficiency [200,201,202]. Progressive farmers use such techniques
    at their farms. Many studies have been conducted on the applications, adoptability,
    and benefits of CLT techniques, and significantly positive responses to these
    techniques for crop production were reported [203,204]. The controlling mechanism
    of CLT includes a feedback input mechanism that continuously feeds the field conditions—retrieved
    from the sensors—to the input controller; then, the operation of irrigation machines
    is conducted in accordance with this information. The information may relate to
    climate, soil, or crop parameters [205,206]. Initially, a bigger irrigation program
    of variable nature is formulated that is implemented accordingly after retrieving
    information from the sensors at small time intervals [207,208]. However, continuous
    dynamics in field conditions make the control of irrigation extremely cumbersome
    under CLT. Also, due to the installation of sensors on irrigation machines and
    in soil profiles, the capital cost exceeds even unaffordable limits. Also, the
    use of sensors could mislead operators if they are not calibrated properly, which
    results in immense implementation struggles for farmers. The simplest illustration
    of precision irrigation using a center pivot sprinkler system under both controlling
    mechanisms (OLT and CLT) is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Block diagram of (a)
    open loop technique (OLT) and (b) closed loop technique (CLT) under precision
    irrigation. 4.4. Use of Controlling Devices for Precision Applications of Sprinkler
    Irrigation To perform water application using a sprinkler system according to
    real-time irrigation scheduling, mechanized systems are used to continuously control
    the operation of the irrigation system to adopt the true spirit of precision irrigation.
    The operation of the irrigation system is controlled to maintain the desired irrigation
    level by controlling the application rate or irrigation time [175]. To achieve
    this, electronic devices called “controllers” have been developed and are available
    in markets. The selection of controllers is made keeping in view their function,
    reliability, availability, price, etc. One type of controller is the PID (proportional-integrated
    derivative) controller. These controllers are widely used due to their simple
    structure, ease of troubleshooting, and minimum errors but these cannot handle
    external disturbance and can thus create errors [209]. The second type of controller
    is an AI (intelligent control for precision irrigation) controller. These controllers
    use the application of artificial intelligence, which makes these devices capable
    of providing solutions in a smarter way [210]. These devices with briskly developed
    algorithms can emulate the process of human decision making; therefore, these
    devices have been implemented specifically in sprinkler irrigation machines for
    precise water applications [211,212] in different forms like fuzzy logic, etc.
    [213]. On the other hand, these kinds of controllers have complex structures,
    are higher in price, and are difficult to troubleshoot. The third type of controller
    is the MPC (model predictive-based irrigation) controller, which is widely used
    in agriculture and other industries [214,215,216,217,218]. By installing MPC controllers
    instead of classical controllers on sprinkler irrigation machines, many benefits
    including good efficiency, excellent performance, and optimality can be achieved
    toward the true spirit of precision [219]. Future research on the development
    of smart MPC controllers can improve the efficiency of precision irrigation using
    sprinkler systems in a convenient way with 20–30% more efficiency. 4.5. Use of
    Precision Irrigation for Crop Production Precision irrigation has proved its impact
    in the field of irrigated agronomy. Many researchers worked on the qualitative
    and quantitative behavior of crops against precision irrigation. Abioye [159]
    used an MPC controller in sprinkler irrigation for precision applications and
    reported 30% water saving. The IoT-based precision irrigation system was used
    for water saving in tomato production and reported 10% water saving with 71% better
    uniformity and 27.5% higher yield [220]. Chen [221] recommended the fuzzy neural
    network with a genetic algorithm (GA) to accomplish precision irrigation for 15–25
    better yield and 25% water saving. The same technique was used by Guha [222] to
    calculate precise amounts of water with reference to greenhouse effects for a
    significant impact on crop productivity. Perea [223] used a combination of ANN
    and genetic algorithm (GA) for the prediction of evapotranspiration and crop response
    under water applications and reported 3–11% better results in terms of system
    efficiency for crop productivity. Ahmad [224] compared several studies on precision
    irrigation coupled with sprinkler irrigation and concluded that these technologies
    have a very positive influence on crop production and in the field of irrigated
    agronomy. 5. Conclusions and Future Perspectives This study consulted the major
    advances in sprinkler systems toward precision applications to save irrigation
    water and provide an increase in net crop production, maximum irrigation uniformity,
    and better fertilizer management with minimum leaching losses. A number of research
    articles from the literature were reviewed as per the designed methodology followed
    by the application of comprehensive inclusion/exclusion criteria to exclude unnecessary
    literature from the search results. Regarding the technological aspects of the
    analyzed works, it became evident that sprinkler systems are an efficient source
    to not only irrigate crops but also for fertilizer applications in the field with
    >35% efficiency and >14.1 productivity. This study also revealed the fact that
    the design of sprinkler irrigation needs to be optimized to avoid associated wind
    drift losses that are up to 14% of the total application efficiency. Moreover,
    this study covered prominent features of precision irrigation coupled with sprinkler
    irrigation technology. The data regarding precision irrigation revealed a dramatic
    improvement in productivity when automation and sensor-based monitoring were coupled
    with a control communication and information system to operate the sprinkler system
    to enhance the yield by 27.5% and save 30% more irrigation water. It is obvious
    that the cumulative literature and consolidation of results in one place will
    provide opportunities for students and researchers to develop new ideas for further
    interventions in the field of precision irrigation and improvements in the design
    of existing sprinkler systems. Future research should be continued on the smart
    design and evaluation of sprinkler nozzles with environmental impact assessments
    and simplified application mechanisms for precision irrigation systems. Research
    work on these lines will further support the adoption of modern irrigation techniques
    in large cultivable areas. Author Contributions Investigation, original drafting,

    Abstract Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based smart irrigation solutions rely on
    sensors for data reporting, a central infrastructure for generating irrigation
    parameters and a mobile machinery called Linear for irrigating. In this scenario,
    change in soil and environmental properties is referred as an event. Spatial distribution
    of such properties leads to multiple event regions in farmland. Identifying Boundary
    Nodes (BNs) of an event region is a well investigated problem in WSN, however,
    data reporting from BNs that caters to application specific requirements have
    rarely studied. To this end, an energy efficient data harvesting protocol for
    smart irrigation is designed that integrates three modules. First, to reduce number
    of source nodes and hence, energy consumption, a distributed Representative Node
    (RN) selection mechanism is proposed to identify a subset of BNs as the source
    nodes. Information from these RNs ensures correct actions even when nodes of more
    than two event regions lie nearby that is not achieved by existing RN selection
    mechanisms. Second, stop time of Linear must be adequate to collect data from
    RNs for ensuring proper actions. However, existing mechanisms limit to optimizing
    network lifetime. Calculation of data collection dependent stop time of Linear
    without having any information of RNs is proposed. Third, Reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme is proposed that uses single message transmission by a node for Linear
    location information dissemination. Results indicate that at least 58% of BNs
    are required for accurate region construction and overall, 12% to 56% less energy
    is consumed in the data harvesting process. Similar content being viewed by others

    Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction Smart irrigation or Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)
    is an emerging technique for precision agriculture where an area is irrigated
    according to its requirement. A field is divided into smaller sub-regions (event
    regions) of varying water requirement subject to soil texture, topography, crop,
    and environmental parameters. These event regions are called Management Zones
    (MZs). In traditional VRI setup, an irrigation machinery called Linear is guided
    by Base Station (BS) to move on a predefined linear path and irrigate the field.
    To generate control actions for irrigation, BS collects data from sensors in two
    ways. First, sensors send data to BS (placed outside the farmland) via multi-hop
    in flat [1, 2] or clustered architecture [3]. Second, data is collected from the
    nodes deployed in MZs of farmland having similar soil properties and irrigation
    requirement [4, 5]. These arrangements suffer from high energy consumption in
    data transmission from sensor nodes to BS for community agriculture where a large
    farmland is to be irrigated. Moreover, studies from agronomy [6] report the need
    of dynamic identification of MZs for monitoring purpose. MZs are spatio-temporally
    varying. To make the information regarding this change available near real-time
    at the Linear, is a key challenge. To accomplish this, Boundary Nodes (BNs) and
    non-BNs of MZ are marked in distributed fashion in our previous work [7]. The
    next step is to send information of BNs to Linear for generation of actions. Hence,
    the proposed work investigates the challenges of data harvesting from BNs of MZs.
    We assume that BS is mounted on Linear that stops at on-the-go identified locations,
    collects data from BNs, generates control actions and irrigates field while moving.
    In this work we intend to explore following research questions: Can a subset of
    BNs be identified as source nodes without loss of information of the event region
    boundary? How can stop time of Linear at a location be calculated at BS without
    any information of BNs? How does a Linear disseminate its location information
    with reduced network traffic and how a path is constructed from BNs to Linear?
    Will partial event region information be able to facilitate required action? What
    are the other applications where similar problem of data harvesting from BNs exists?
    Fig. 1 Data collection from a small region (Source: http://www.valleyirrigation.com)
    Full size image Figure 1 presents a scenario of data collection from BNs. A large
    irrigating machinery called Linear is guided by BS to move on a predefined linear
    path and irrigate the field. Linear moves at a low speed (\\(\\approx 2 m/s\\))
    or stops at some locations depending on the control action generated by BS. Data
    from the sensor nodes in a small region in front of Linear is collected at the
    BS, which then controls the sprinklers (actuators) mounted on Linear accordingly.
    For example, in Fig. 1, Linear is at position A and irrigating the region around
    it. The next region to be irrigated is B (enclosed by red line). Therefore, the
    information from sensors deployed in the shaded region must be delivered before
    Linear moves from position A and enters region B. Region B may consist of more
    than one event regions (sub regions of different irrigation requirements). Partial
    boundary information of all the sub regions facilitate irrigation schedule for
    region B. If all BNs send data to BS, the boundary information received at BS
    will be correct and proper actuation is ensured. However, if the number of BNs
    is large in a sub-region, network traffic increases. So, to reduce network traffic,
    the proposed work identifies a minimal set of BNs as sources laying in an event
    region. The minimal set must be selected such that the information from identified
    nodes suffice for the decision at BS. The nodes belonging to such minimal set
    are called Representative Nodes (RNs). Information from these nodes are sufficient
    to construct event boundary at BS. To demonstrate the impact of reducing BNs and
    hence, loss of information at BS, concept of event region map construction is
    introduced. Event region map is the virtual boundary of event regions created
    at BS from the position and data information of RNs. An example scenario (see
    Fig. 2a) consists of three event regions (MZs) A, B, and C where BNs 1–10 form
    boundary of A, 11–15 and 16–22 are the BNs of B and C, respectively. Suppose the
    RNs for construction of the event regions A, B, and C are \\(\\{2, 4, 6, 7, 10\\}\\),
    \\(\\{12, 13, 15\\}\\), and \\(\\{16, 17, 19, 21\\}\\), respectively. The coarsely
    constructed local map at BS from the information of these RNs, is shown in Fig.
    2b. Exclusion of any of these nodes will result in incorrect event region map
    and addition of other BNs to the set of RNs will fine grain the coarsely constructed
    boundary, however, increase the energy consumption. Thus, a trade-off between
    network traffic and information loss is to be maintained. Fig. 2 Minimal set of
    BNs Full size image Construction of event region map is limited to our work and
    actual decision making process depends on the algorithm running on BS. This work
    identifies a minimal set BNs as sources and explores the challenges of mobility
    assisted data collection (as explained with the help of Fig. 1). These challenges
    are application specific and vary from application to application. For example,
    in enemy troop detection [8], where soldiers move in their own area of surveillance,
    if there are some intruders, it becomes important to be aware of the area ahead
    of the troop. The problem is same to that of VRI, however, precise boundary information
    is required for this application. In automated brooding systems (chick, quail,
    goose, ducks) [9], temperature and humidity sensors are deployed to report different
    temperature zones. The problem of local map construction is similar to VRI, however,
    network of sensors is three dimensional. Thus, for enemy detection and livestock
    monitoring, the proposed scheme must be modified according to the challenges posed
    by specific scenario. This work takes VRI as use case and investigates the challenges
    of energy efficient data collection for reconstruction of event region map at
    Linear. Having discussed the application specific scenario and the other application
    where the problem may find its place, the essential features of the problem considered
    in the work are presented as follows: To minimize the traffic and energy consumption,
    a minimal set BNs known as RN is identified in such a way that correct actions
    are ensured at BS using the information of these nodes. Fig. 3 Taxonomy of data
    harvesting schemes in WSAN/WSN. Deploying Linear as a data harvesting and processing
    infrastructure for smart irrigation is proposed for the first time in this work
    to the best of our knowledge. This taxonomy presents existing mobility assisted
    data harvesting techniques Full size image Considering the RNs are identified
    through a distributed scheme, another challenge is posed by data acquisition from
    these RNs. Linear stops at some locations and collects data from the BNs laying
    in sub-region ahead, constructs a local view of the sub-region and generates control
    actions. In this context, the stop time of Linear must be adequate to collect
    data from all RNs. Inadequate stop time can result into insufficient information
    from RNs leading to inaccurate event decision at Linear. Hence, a data collection
    dependent stop time of Linear at a location is proposed. Moreover, to reduce energy
    consumption in location information dissemination, a reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme is proposed where a node transmits only one location information message.
    Temporal and spatial suppression of information is prevalent to reduce energy
    consumption of nodes. For example, authors in [10] have reduced the volume of
    data by modified version of KNN algorithm on sensor node and further aggregation
    of data at Cluster Head (CH). Authors in [11] proposed Data Transmission (DaT)
    Protocol for suppressing redundant data to save the energy while maintaining a
    suitable level of accuracy. Other temporal data compression techniques to reduce
    the energy consumption is proposed in [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Spatial information
    suppression focuses on reducing number of source node in the network. The existing
    algorithms for identifying RNs as source nodes are designed for boundary monitoring
    [18,19,20,21]. These schemes are energy efficient and select lesser number of
    BNs, however, construct incorrect event region in the case of more than two subregions
    (A, B, and C in Fig. 2). The mechanisms give inaccurate result when neighbors
    of a sensor node lay in two different event regions. For example, BN 4 and its
    neighbors 15 and 16 in Fig. 2a. Node 4 suppresses the data of its neighbors and
    sends information to BS that 15 and 16 are BNs of another region. However, while
    constructing the event region map, BS can not visualize that nodes 15 and 16 are
    the BNs of two different subregions. Detailed discussion is presented in Section
    4.2.2 with the help of Figs. 17, 18, and 19. Moreover, these schemes do not investigate
    data acquisition from RNs. There is a plethora of mobile infrastructure based
    data collection schemes (a taxonomy is presented in Fig. 3). In most of these
    works, the stop time is either independent of data collection [22, 23] or negligible
    [24, 25] for a mobile BS. A few research works have modelled the stop time of
    mobile BS. Table 1 discusses these works and the limitations regarding applicability
    to the scenario under consideration. The paper aims to design a distributed Lightweight
    Event Region map Construction based data harvesting protocol LERC, for delay tolerant
    applications with following contributions: To reduce network traffic, RNs are
    identified as data transmitters. The scheme identifies RNs that in turn construct
    correct event region map even when BNs of more than two event region lay in the
    neighborhood (explained in Section 4.2.2). BN calculates the gradient (defined
    in the first paragraph of Section 3.3) of line joining it to previous RN. If the
    gradient is greater than an application dependent threshold, BN marks itself as
    RN. The decision of BNs is evaluated by plotting the boundary of event region
    at Linear in which less number (at least 58%) of BNs are required for correct
    event region construction. A reduced overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for
    path construction that ensures only one message transmission by each node. It
    restricts transmission of multiple copies of location information message of Linear
    in the network. The efficiency of this scheme is measured in terms of energy consumption.
    Reduced overhead broadcast decreases the energy consumption of network by 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    with respect to the limited broadcast scheme proposed in [26]. Sojourn locations
    of Linear are identified on-the-go and data collection dependent stop time at
    a location is modelled. The modelled stop time is adequate to collect data from
    all RNs laying in the event region ahead that in turn ensures correct event region
    map construction at BS. Modelled stop time is the sum of maximum time required
    for dissemination of location information to the farthest BN of the region and
    data transmission from it to Linear. 2 Related work This section discusses the
    research related to RN selection, limited broadcasting, stop time, and stop location
    modelling. A summarized discussion of the research gaps with respect to the applicative
    scenario’s requirements, follows. 2.1 Selection of RNs (data reporting nodes to
    sink) In [19] energy efficient Continuous Boundary Monitoring (COBOM), only one
    BN is selected randomly as RN among its neighbor BNs. Selected RNs maintain and
    transmit a BN-array to sink that includes the boundary information around the
    RN. First all nodes send their position to sink to maintain a neighborhood map
    at sink. In each iteration, only one BN sends the data to sink along with the
    status of its neighbors as BN or non-BN. COBOM suppresses the BNs and achieves
    desired accuracy when nodes are belonging to only one event region that is either
    a node is inside the event region or outside of it. However, for smart irrigation
    there may be more than one event regions present. A node’s neighbors may belong
    to different event regions and in such condition boundary construction at sink
    will fail. It is proved by simulation in Section 4.2.2 with the help of Fig. 17.
    Authors in [20] have proposed a BN selection algorithm that identifies a small
    set of BNs independent of node density and provides well-balanced RN selection
    from the small set. It chooses only the closest sensor nodes to the boundary of
    an object as BN. A Neighbor Descriptor Table (NDT) that includes neighbor location
    information and event detection status is maintained as each node. From the selected
    BNs, the algorithm tries to choose only one RN per each radio range regardless
    of node density. The algorithm selects a BN as RN if no RN selection message arrives
    from its neighbor BNs and the two most distant neighbor BNs are selected as left
    and right RNs. Since the RN selection algorithm identifies only one RN per each
    radio range, it is not suitable for the applications where one-hop neighbors belong
    to different event regions. For the applicative scenario considered in our work
    one-hop neighbors may lay in different event regions and selection of only one
    BN among neighbors as RN lead to information suppression and incorrect decision.
    Hence, the above mentioned scheme is not applicable to the applications mentioned
    earlier in Section 1. Energy-efficient DEtection and MOnitoring for COntinuous
    objects in wireless sensor networks (DEMOCO) [21] focuses on reducing the number
    of BNs that eventually results in lowering the number of RNs to reduce traffic
    as well as communication between sensor nodes. It selects the nodes inward to
    the boundary of continuous event as RNs and ignores the outward BNs. It reduces
    number of RNs to half in comparison to COBOM. In this work, minimizing number
    of RNs and hence, overall energy consumption in data reporting are the main objectives.
    However, event region construction at BS is ignored. Hence, DEMOCO is not suitable
    for the applications where information from RNs facilitate construction of event
    region at BS. In [18], authors have proposed BN detection and boundary refinement
    scheme for continuous boundary monitoring in heterogeneous Internet of Things
    (IoT). Boundary of event region consists of resource rich backbone nodes that
    are assisted by resource constrained edge nodes. Planarization algorithms are
    applied to generate a coarse boundary region. Sensory data of edge nodes is estimated
    by backbone nodes by applying interpolation techniques. For boundary refinement,
    mobile BS visits each BN to collect data. The path of mobile BS is optimally planned
    by applying models including the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) with
    time constraints and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), to enable the near real-time
    requirement of domain applications. The scheme identifies less number of BNs,
    however, the accuracy of boundary region decreases. Moreover, the scheme is centralized
    and hence, not suitable for automated smart irrigation scenario where BNs are
    identified by a distributed algorithm. 2.2 Limited broadcast Authors in [27] have
    proposed a limited broadcast scheme, where an actor transmits the location information
    in its Voronoi cell. Authors have assumed that sensors belonging to the Voronoi
    cell of an actor, are one-hop distant to it. Hence, number of messages transmitted
    for location update reduces. However, in applications such as VRI a few RNs may
    or may not be one-hop neighbors of Linear at its current stop location. In such
    scenario, the above mentioned scheme tends to perform as flooding. A Mobile Actor
    Routing Protocol (MARP) for data transmission in mobile Wireless Sensor and Actuator
    Networks (WSAN) is proposed in [28]. Actors stop at some locations for random
    time and broadcast two control signals to construct cluster around it. Cluster
    members send data to the actor within its pause time at that location. Stop locations
    and stop time are independent of data collection. The location information dissemination
    is restricted to the nodes belonging to the cluster around stop location of actor.
    However, the approach is still flooding that causes high energy consumption and
    moreover, if cluster size or node density increases energy consumption increases
    exponentially. Authors have proposed sensor-actor coordination mechanism in [29]
    where network is divided into grids and a CH is chosen for each grid. Actor broadcasts
    its location information while moving and CHs further floods it to other CHs and
    sensor nodes. The location information dissemination is restricted to the grid
    however, flooding of location messages consumes much energy. Moreover, if size
    of grid or density of nodes increases energy consumption increases exponentially.
    A limited flooding mechanism for cluster formation is proposed in [26], in which
    mobile BS broadcasts beacon periodically. Beacon contains hop count, energy, source
    address, and time to live (ttl). A node discards a packet if hop count of received
    packet is greater than the hop count stored at the node. If hop count is less
    than current value, it is updated and broadcasted again. Cluster formation stops
    if ttl has expired. Though limited flooding consumes less energy than flooding,
    the repetitive transmission by a node till ttl is reached, causes significant
    energy consumption in larger networks and hence is not scalable. 2.3 Stop time
    modelling A taxonomy of research works utilizing mobile BS is shown in Fig. 3.
    In WSAN (where mobile BS works as actuators), mechanisms of periodic visit are
    not appropriate to the problem under consideration, as the stop locations depend
    either on the nearness of previous stop point [30] or on the probability of event
    occurrence [31] and thus, are independent of data collection. However, for Linear
    move irrigation, next stop locations and stop time should take decision making
    and actuation into account. In existing works of on-demand visit [32], the key
    concern is to select an optimal actuator to take action in the event region. Table
    1 Evaluation of stop time based models Full size table In Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN) (where mobile BS acts as a data collector), for Linear visiting each node
    [38], the stop time is modelled for one hop transmission taking buffer constraint
    and speed of mobile BS into account. Another way of data collection is to visit
    a subset of nodes such as Rendezvous Points (RPs) [24, 25, 39,40,41] or Rendezvous
    Area (RA) [42, 43]. The stop locations are RPs that are decided by BS and known
    a priori to mobile data collector. Stop time at RPs are negligible most of the
    time. These algorithms do not fit for the applicative scenarios’ requirement as
    BS mounted on Linear has no prior knowledge of the BNs. Moreover, BNs are subject
    to change, so every time transmitting location of all BNs for calculation of stop
    locations will be wastage of constrained resources. In RA based mechanisms, stop
    time and stop location are random. When RPs are selected along the path of mobile
    BS, stop time is either negligible or modelled for one hop transmission. To the
    best of authors’ knowledge, none of the works design stop time and stop location
    taking the crucial aspects (collision, number of hops) of multi hop data collection
    into account. Apart from stop time and stop location, neither RP nor RA can furnish
    Linear with the event region boundary information. The mechanisms that model stop
    time are discussed in Table 1. 2.4 Discussion Limited flooding mechanisms broadcast
    location updates in a smaller region rather than entire network and hence, perform
    better than flooding. However, nodes are involved in repetitive transmission that
    consumes a considerable amount of energy. Stop time modelling in literature is
    either negligible or dependent on the energy consumption of the nodes for lifetime
    maximization. However, in application under consideration, stop time of the Linear
    should be adequate to collect data from enough BNs to construct a map of the event
    region. For reducing network traffic, data aggregation on CHs is a much prevalent
    method. However, CH election and cluster formation itself consume a considerable
    amount of energy [19, 20]. Moreover, CHs are not able to demarcate the boundary
    of a subregion (detailed discussion is presented in [7]). On the other hand, the
    RN selection schemes are energy efficient, however, fail to construct accurate
    map at sink when neighbors of a node lies in two different subregions. In VRI,
    incorrect boundary identification at sink hampers the decision making and actions
    to event region. 3 Lightweight Event Region Construction (LERC) protocol This
    section discusses the proposed methodology for data collection from BNs of a MZ.
    First, system framework and problem formulation are presented. Next, the three
    modules of the proposed methodology namely, reduced overhead broadcasting method
    (Section 3.2), RN selection scheme (Section 3.3), and calculations of stop time
    and next stop location (Section 3.4) are discussed. 3.1 System framework In this
    subsection, first we present the network model, energy model and problem formulation
    follows. 3.1.1 Network model Figure 4 depicts a scenario of farmland where a set
    of sensor nodes S = {\\(s_1, s_2...., s_n\\)} are deployed in an irregular polygon
    shaped field. The uniformly distributed sensors form a network represented as
    a graph \\(G=(S,E)\\) where sensor nodes form the vertices and connection among
    them is represented by a set of edges E = {\\(e_1, e_2...., e_m\\)}. \\(\\forall\\)
    s\\(_i\\), \\(\\exists\\) NB\\(^{d}_i\\) where NB\\(^{d}_i\\) is the one hop Neighborhood
    set of \\(s_i\\) with d members and \\(d <n\\). A node \\(s_j \\in\\) NB\\(^{d}_i
    \\iff \\left| s_i-s_j \\right| \\le\\) 2r, where \\(\\left| s_i-s_j \\right|\\)
    is the Euclidean distance between \\(s_i\\) and \\(s_j\\) and r is the communication
    range of \\(s_i\\). A multi attribute sensing sensor node \\(s_i\\) is capable
    of measuring different soil properties (for example soil moisture, temperature,
    AWC). In Fig. 4 there are two categories of nodes, namely, Boundary Nodes (BNs)
    and Interior Nodes (INs) where boundary of a MZ is demarcated by the BNs (solid
    circles). A node \\(s_i\\) marks itself as BN or IN depending on the measurements
    and position information received from the nodes in NB\\(^{d}_i\\). Each node
    upon receiving data from its neighbors runs MZ delineation algorithm (for details,
    please refer [7]). A list of symbols is presented in Table 2. Table 2 List of
    symbols Full size table BNs represent the MZ, on boundary of which, these are
    laying. To collect data from the BNs, Linear are deployed in the field. BS is
    responsible for data collection and generation of control actions and is mounted
    on a self propelled Linear move irrigation machinery (shown in Fig. 1). The actuators
    (mounted on Linear) control the rate, amount, timing of irrigation as well as
    the on/off mode of sprinklers according to the location of BNs. Fig. 4 An example
    scenario with multi Linears Full size image Linear (\\(Linear_1\\) or \\(Linear_2\\))
    starts from the periphery of the farm that is the first stop location of it. It
    gathers data from RNs (a subset of BNs), construct MZ map, generates control actions
    and irrigates the field while moving. Thus, there are two states of Linear namely,
    Stop and Collect (S&C) and Move and Irrigate (M&I). The assumptions made are based
    on the various real life VRI systems. VARIwise [44] is an autonomous control platform
    developed to generate Prescription Map for automated VRI. In an another project,
    VRI system developed by University of Georgia [45], for generating dynamic Prescription
    Map takes feedback from the sensor network. The University of Georgia Smart Sensor
    Array (UGA SSA) consists of smart sensor nodes and a base station that form a
    mesh network. 3.1.2 Energy model In this setup, sensor nodes are deployed in the
    field having transmission range equal to r. Nodes remain in sleep state till a
    control signal from Linear arrives to wake these nodes. Energy consumption of
    a node is the sum of the energy consumed in various states of a node namely, idle
    (\\(E_{idle}\\)), transmit (\\(E_t\\)), and receive (\\(E_r\\)) as proposed in
    [46, 47]. Where, \\(E_{idle}\\) is the energy consumed in Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access (CSMA) backoffs and idle state (waiting for data or control packet). Since,
    we are not optimizing any parameter of idle state, energy consumed is depicted
    as \\(E_{idle}\\) to keep it simple. Energy consumed in transmit state (\\(E_t\\))
    and receive state (\\(E_r\\)) are as follows [46]: $$\\begin{aligned} E_t= (e_t+e_{d}r^{p})B.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (1) $$\\begin{aligned} E_r=e_{r}B. \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where,
    \\(e_t\\) is the energy/bit consumed by the transmitter electronics, and \\(e_d\\)
    accounts for energy dissipated in the transmit op-amp. r is the transmission range
    and p is the channel path loss index. B is the bit rate of radio. The first phase
    of LERC protocol is Reduced Overhead Broadcast, where, each node receives a control
    message from all its predecessors and broadcast one message to its successors.
    Thus, in this phase, a maximum of k messages are received and one message is transmitted
    for a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{ROB}_i
    = (k_i*E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where, \\(k_i\\) is the number of neighbors
    of node \\(s_i\\). A node enters in RN selection phase after it receives a control
    message \\(RN_c\\) from its predecessor (explained in the first paragraph of Section
    3.3). It broadcasts this control message after deciding about its role as RN or
    non-RN. Thus, in this phase at most one message is transmitted and received by
    a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{RN}_i
    = n_{BN}(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where, \\(n_{BN}\\) is the number of BNs.
    Though size of packets in downstream, upstream and RN selection phase differs,
    it is ignored to make calculations simple. After deciding its role as RN or non-RN,
    a node transmits its data towards Linear (via the path constructed in reduced
    overhead broadcasting phase) if it is a RN or waits for the data from RNs to forward,
    otherwise. In worse case, a node may forward data packets of all RNs. So, for
    upstream data transmission, a node receives and transmits messages equal to number
    of RNs. So, the maximum energy consumption is written as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    max E^{DT}_i = n_{RN}*(E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (5) Thus, the maximum energy
    consumption of a node \\(s_i\\) is written as: $$\\begin{aligned} max E_i = E_{idle}+
    (k_i*E_r+E_t)+(n_{RN}+n_{BN})*(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where, \\(E_{idle}\\)
    is the energy consumed in idle state for during all phases mentioned above. LERC
    aims to reduce number of transmissions of a node for location information dissemination.
    Moreover, it selects a subset of nodes as the source nodes that further decreases
    in-network traffic. Thus, LERC regulates \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\), and \\(n_{BN}\\).
    The objective function of the proposed work can be formulated as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\forall {s_i\\in S} \\hspace{.1in}Minimize \\sum _{i=1}^{|S|} E_i \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) Subject to constraints: $$\\begin{aligned} Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge R_0.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (8) $$\\begin{aligned} D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN) \\le
    T. \\end{aligned}$$ (9) where, the constraints in Eqs. (8) and (9) are explained
    as follows: 1. Minimum reliability constraint \\(Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge
    R_0\\) The constraint depicts that number of RNs must not be reduced beyond \\(R_0\\),
    where, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs to achieve correct event region
    map at BS. In this work, we define reliability (Re) with respect to MZ map construction.
    It is the number of BNs sending data to Linear for MZ map construction. If all
    BNs transmit data to Linear, Re is 100% and the map constructed is correct and
    can be treated as the reference. However, in-network traffic and energy consumption
    in this case is high. Let us define a set of BNs as \\(BN=\\{BN_1, BN_2...., BN_{n_{BN}}\\}\\).
    To reduce in-network traffic, a subset of BN defined as \\(RN= \\{RN_1, RN_2....,
    RN_{n_{RN}}\\}\\) is chosen as source nodes such that \\(RN \\subseteq BN\\) and
    \\(n_{RN}\\le n_{BN}\\). As the number of selected RNs decreases, the constructed
    map can deviate from the correct (reference). After one point, the deviation in
    map hampers the decision making and implementation of actions (explained by Figs.
    14 and 15 in Section 4.2). The number of RNs at this point is defined as the minimum
    reliability \\(R_0\\). Thus, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs required to
    demarcate the boundary of MZs at Linear such that the decision and implementation
    remains same to the reference. A generalized approach to calculate \\(R_0\\) is
    not mentioned in the proposed work since it is topology and event region dependent.
    Minimum number of BNs to construct an event region (MZ) at BS is \\(R_0\\) and
    its value ranges from 1 to \\(n_{BN}\\). So, an event region may be represented
    by 1 BN or may be represented by all BNs laying in that event region. As the soil
    parameters change, shape of event region (MZ) changes and so the BNs representing
    the MZ. Thus, proposing a method to calculate the exact number of \\(R_0\\) is
    out of scope of this study. However, an empirical study is shown with the help
    of Figs. 14 and 15. 2. Delay constraint \\(D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN)
    \\le T\\) T is the stop time of Linear at a location for data acquisition. If
    delay of a packet is greater than T, it will be discarded by Linear. Thus, D is
    the maximum end to end delay of data transmission of a RN that is selected as
    data transmitter to construct MZ map at Linear. Fig. 5 Flow chart of the proposed
    method Full size image Thus, the work intends to minimize energy consumption of
    sensor nodes. The energy consumption of a node depends on \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\),
    and \\(n_{BN}\\) (as represented by Eq. (6)). These variables are in turn depend
    on the number of transmissions of control packets in disseminating the location
    information of Linear and data packets in sending information from source nodes.
    To minimize the number of messages during location information dissemination of
    Linear a Reduced Overhead Broadcast mechanism (explained in Section 3.2) is proposed
    where nodes receive control packets from all predecessors and transmit only one
    message. To reduce number of data packets, number of source nodes are minimized
    by selecting a sub-set of BNs namely, RNs, where the number of RNs must be sufficient
    to construct boundary of event region at Linear. RN selection mechanism minimizes
    \\(n_{BN}\\). It is an angle-based greedy approach where each BN marks itself
    as RN or non-RN depending on the angle formed with previous RN (explained in Section
    3.3). Since, RNs are identified in a distributed fashion, stop time (T) of Linear
    must be adequate to collect data from all RNs to ensure the correct construction
    of event region boundary at Linear. A data collection dependent stop time is modelled
    and explained in Section 3.4. Section 3.5 discusses the RN selection when one-hop
    neighbors belong to multiple MZs and data collection by multiple Linears. A flow
    chart of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 5. 3.2 Reduced overhead broadcasting In
    S &C state, at a stop location, Linear sends two control signals. First control
    signal is broadcasted with a transmission range R that is greater than the transmission
    range of sensor nodes (r). This control signal is sent to wake up the nodes from
    sleep state. R depends on the Region of Action (ROA) of Linear that in turn depends
    on the length of field (L) and number of sinks deployed. For example, in Fig.
    4, \\(R=L/4\\), to cover the ROA of Linears. However, for single sink in the same
    region R will be L/2. Fig. 6 Structure of start message Full size image Next,
    a control message start is transmitted with a transmission range of r. start is
    sent for path construction from BNs to Linear. It contains the coordinates of
    Linear (coordinate), hop, residual energy (energy), and sleep time = present time
    + stop time (time) of nodes as shown in Fig 6. Nodes receiving start from neighbors,
    will increment value of hop by one and store its remaining energy in residual
    energy field. Every node will broadcast only one start message to its neighbors
    to reduce network traffic. To ensure reduced overhead broadcast, once a node receives
    first start message (at time \\(t_{start}\\)), it will wait for time \\(t_w\\)
    (Please refer Eq. (15) in Section 3.4), to collect start messages from other neighbors.
    Among all of its neighbors, a node will select one having smallest hop as next
    hop node, for upstream data transmission. If two nodes with same hop are there,
    then a node with largest energy is selected. If multiple nodes with same energy
    and hop are there, randomly a node will be selected as next hop. After next hop
    selection, each node will broadcast its start message to neighbors. Any start
    message received after this broadcast will be discarded. For example, please refer
    Fig. 7 that represents a small portion of a larger network. It consists of a Linear
    (diamond shaped) near node 41 and 42 and BNs (laying on the boundary of network
    and MZ). Let us suppose all nodes shown in the figure are in receive state and
    waiting for start message. Linear broadcasts start message that is received by
    the one-hop neighbors of Linear, nodes 41, 42, 40, 39, 38, 37, 33, and 32. Since
    these nodes are one-hop neighbors of Linear (hop = 0), they update hop and energy
    of the start message and broadcasts it. After this broadcast, these nodes start
    contending for data transmission (explained in the second last paragraph of right
    column on page 12) and discard the start message received from their one-hop neighbors.
    Fig. 7 An example scenario for start message dissemination and RN selection Full
    size image Next, we take example of node 27 to elaborate the reduced overhead
    broadcast scheme. It will wait for \\(t_w\\) time (depends on the maximum transmission
    time of all neighbors), after it receives first start message. After \\(t_w\\)
    time expires, it has start messages from nodes 33(hop = 2), 34(hop = 3), and 26(hop
    = 2). It does not receive start from nodes 35 and 30, since these nodes will broadcast
    start after \\(t_w\\) for node 27 is expired. It selects node 33 or node 26 depending
    on the energy as its next hop since hop is least for them. Node 27 then broadcasts
    start message. Figure 8 depicts various states of Linear and activities associated
    with it. S &C state comprises of three states namely, transmit, wait, and receive.
    In transmit state, Linear sends two signals, wake and start. It then switches
    to wait state, where it waits for a time T (calculation is shown Section 3.4).
    If data packets are received from sensor nodes, it switches to receive state and
    start preparing the Prescription Map (PM) that is set of control actions such
    as rate, location, on/off state for sprinklers, etc. When timer T expires Linear
    switches to M &I state and irrigate the field according to the PM generated. When
    the next stop location is reached, calculation of which was done in S &C state,
    Linear switches to next S &C state and repeats the above mentioned activities.
    Fig. 8 State space representation of Linear Full size image 3.3 Representative
    Node (RN) selection Key idea of RN selection scheme is to select a BN as RN if
    it lies on a large gradient (\\(\\theta\\)) with respect to previous RN. Large
    \\(\\theta\\) depicts a significant change in the shape of event region. Each
    BN marks itself as RN or non-RN. One hop neighbors of Linear (nodes 41, 42, etc.)
    and corner nodes, for example nodes 36 and 37 in Fig. 7 (for corner node identification
    please refer Outward Nodes in the algorithm proposed in [7]), are RNs by default.
    One hop neighbors of Linear are RNs as only one hop transmission is required for
    these nodes. Corner nodes are RNs as these nodes are key enablers to achieve minimum
    reliability (shown by Fig. 15 and discussed in the last paragraph of left column
    on page 18). These nodes broadcast a control message \\(RN_c\\) to inform others
    that they are default RNs. Other nodes, when receive this message, first calculate
    Euclidean distance from Linear. If the calculated distance is in between \\(R-r\\)
    and \\(R+r\\), the BN marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message. If the
    calculated distance is less than \\(R-r\\), BNs calculate angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with its neighbor RN. \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1})\\)
    if \\(y_2-y_1 < x_2-x_1\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{x_2-x_1}{y_2-y_1})\\),
    otherwise. (\\(x_2, y_2\\)) is the coordinate of neighbor RN and (\\(x_1,y_1\\))
    is the coordinate of the node calculating \\(\\theta\\). If \\(\\theta\\) is less
    than \\(\\theta _0\\) (an application dependent threshold discussed in the next
    paragraph), it marks itself as non-RN and as RN otherwise. A non-RN node sends
    \\(RN_c\\) message containing coordinate of RN with which it has calculated the
    angle \\(\\theta\\). The BN receiving this message calculates the angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with the coordinate received in the message. A BN receiving multiple \\(RN_c\\)
    messages will decide according to the lowest \\(\\theta\\). Exact \\(\\theta _0\\)
    can be calculated in a distributed fashion by local talk of sensor nodes where
    nodes between two corner nodes can decide among themselves the value of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) for that setting. However, when boundary pattern changes significantly re-tuning
    \\(\\theta _0\\) is required. Exact mechanism for fixing \\(\\theta _0\\) is a
    work in progress. For the sake of simplicity, in this work, we assume that the
    boundary does not change significantly to change \\(\\theta _0\\). However, a
    safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) is provided by recording the effect of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) on energy consumption and reconstruction of coarse boundary by simulating
    various networks (explained in Section 4.2.1). We elaborate RN selection by an
    example scenario, shown in Fig. 7. The one hop neighbors of Linear (node 41, 42,
    37, 38, 39) excluding the non-BNs (32 and 40) mark themselves as RN and send \\(RN_c\\)
    message to their neighbor node. Moreover, the corner nodes (36 and 37) also mark
    themselves as RN by default. Among neighbors of node 42, only node 33 calculates
    the angle \\(\\theta\\) since others are either non-BNs or RNs. Suppose \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\) for this case. \\(\\theta\\) for node 33 is \\(32^\\circ\\)
    and hence, node 33 marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message to its neighbors.
    Angle \\(\\theta\\) for nodes 34, 26, 27, 29 are \\(4^\\circ\\), \\(12^\\circ\\),
    \\(17^\\circ\\), and \\(38^\\circ\\) respectively. Node 29 marks itself as RN.
    However, when node 29 receives message of node 27 and calculates angle with node
    27 (it is an RN because distance from Linear is \\(R-r\\)) that is \\(6.7^\\circ\\),
    it marks itself as non-RN. Nodes 34 and 35 will mark themselves as non-RN with
    respect to node 33. Node 30 will mark itself as RN with respect to node 36. All
    default RNs (one hop neighbors of Linear and corner nodes) start contending for
    channel access through Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
    (CSMA/CA) [48] scheme as soon as they receive start message. Other nodes contend
    after marking themselves as RNs or non-RNs. If a RN has residual energy less than
    a threshold, it informs its neighbors about the situation and go to sleep. Its
    neighbors transmit data and its position information to next hop neighbors. Figure
    9 shows various states of sensor nodes and actions associated with it. Each sensor
    node can be in one of the four states namely, sleep, receive, wait, and transmit.
    Sensor nodes switch from sleep state to receive state when they receive wake signal
    from Linear and go to sleep state when timer T expires. When start message is
    received, a node (BN or non-BN) broadcasts it by changing hop and residual energy.
    A BN first decides whether it is a RN or not. If it is RN, it follows CSMA/CA
    mechanism. Various activities associated with it is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 State
    space representation of a sensor node Full size image 3.4 Stop time modelling
    and next stop location calculation for the Linear Stop time of Linear at a location
    depends on the data collection delay from all RNs. This delay in turn is the sum
    of propagation time of start message to the farthest RN (within range R) and data
    transmission time from this RN to Linear. The stop time (T) can be calculated
    as: $$\\begin{aligned} T = h_{max}*(delay_{d,max} + delay_{u,max}). \\end{aligned}$$
    (10) where, \\(h_{max}\\) is the maximum number of hops between Linear and the
    farthest RN, \\(delay_{d,max}\\) and \\(delay_{u,max}\\) is the one hop delay
    of downstream and upstream traffic respectively. \\(h_{max}\\) is calculated from
    the probability density function (pdf) of distance covered in one hop proposed
    in [49]. The pdf depends on the number of neighbors of a node that can forward
    data towards Linear, transmission range of nodes (r), and the maximum transmission
    range of Linear (R). The maximum one hop delay in transmitting start message to
    the farthest RN is the sum of the waiting time (\\(t_w\\)) a node waits for its
    neighbors to send start message and the time required for that node to successfully
    broadcast it. $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{d,max} = t_w + t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) where, \\(n_R\\) is the average number of retransmissions and \\(t_{tx}\\)
    is the total time required for transmission of a packet that depends on the back
    off time (\\(t_{BO}\\)), Clear Channel Access (CCA) time (\\(t_{CCA}\\)), transmission
    time of a packet (\\(t_{txn}\\)), and transmission of an acknowledgement (\\(t_{Ack}\\)).
    $$\\begin{aligned} t_{tx}=t_{BO} + t_{CCA} + t_{txn} +t_{Ack}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (12) The upper bound of \\(t_{BO} + t_{CCA}\\) is reached when a node extracts
    highest back off timer at each back off stage, and at each back off stage it finds
    the channel busy. The value is 120*\\(t_b\\), where \\(t_b\\) is the duration
    of one time slot [48]. The average number of retransmissions \\(n_R\\) is modelled
    using Geometric distribution, that is the probability of number of failures before
    first successful transmission [50]. $$\\begin{aligned} n_R= (1-p)/p. \\end{aligned}$$
    (13) where, p is the probability of successful transmission given by: $$\\begin{aligned}
    p=\\frac{1}{n_c}. \\end{aligned}$$ (14) where, \\(n_c\\) is the number of nodes
    contending for channel access. For the worse case analysis, number of nodes contending
    is taken as number of nodes of the network (n) as stated in [48]. Based on the
    above discussion, \\(t_w\\) of a node can be calculated as the time required for
    receiving start message from all neighbors. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} t_w = k*(t_{tx}+
    n_R*t_{tx}). \\end{aligned}$$ (15) where, k is the average degree of the network.
    Similarly, \\(delay_{u,max}\\) can be written as: $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{u,max}=
    t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$ (16) Next stop location of Linear The data
    packets received in S &C state contain the coordinates of source RNs. The farthest
    RN in the direction of move of Linear will be its next stop location. However,
    there may be a situation where no data packet is received from the farthest RN.
    Such situation may arise due to two reasons: first, there are no BNs (in receive
    state) in the direction of move of Linear and second, data packet from BN may
    be lost due to various reasons (congestion, link quality, etc.). In this case,
    Linear stops at a location that is R meters away from present stop location. Although
    the probability of packet loss is low due to re-transmission, however, loss of
    packet of corner nodes for \\(Re \\ge R_0\\) and of RNs for \\(Re=R_0\\), can
    effect the decision of Linear. 3.5 Critical cases In this subsection, we discuss
    some critical situations that may occur during data acquisition. These situations
    are discussed separately for ease of understanding. 3.5.1 How will a BN mark itself
    as RN if BNs of two MZs are in receive state Fig. 10 BNs laying in different MZs
    Full size image The example discussed for RN selection in previous subsection
    assumed that BNs of one MZ are in receive state. However, in some cases BNs of
    two adjacent MZs may be in receive state as shown in Fig. 10. Nodes 6, 17, 20,
    29, 26, 27, and 30 are the BNs of one subregion. Nodes 7, 19, and 18 are the BNs
    of second subregion and nodes 8, 9, and 21 are the BNs of third subregion. We
    propose a rule based scheme for marking a BN as RN, when BNs of two MZs are in
    receive state. When all neighbors of a BN are BNs of another MZ: The BN will mark
    itself as RN, since it is the only BN of its MZ, among its neighbors. For example,
    refer Fig. 10, where BNs of three subregions are shown, as mentioned above. Node
    8 is a BN of third subregion, and all other neighbors are the BNs of second subregion,
    Hence, node 8 marks itself as RN. When only one neighbor of a BN is in its MZ
    and others are in different MZs: The BN will mark itself as RN, since it is the
    node laying on the corner of its MZ. For example please refer nodes 7, 19, 9,
    and 21 in Fig. 10. For nodes 7 and 19, node 18 is the only neighbor BN in their
    subregion. Similarly, node 9 and node 21 are the only BN neighbors of each other
    laying in same subregion. Thus, these nodes mark themselves as RNs. When more
    than one neighbors of a BN are its MZ and others are in different MZs: The BN
    will measure angle \\(\\theta\\) with RN of its MZ, and declare itself as RN if
    \\(\\theta > \\theta _0\\) (as explained in Section 3.3). For example, refer nodes
    27, 26, 29, 20, and 17 of the first subregion and node 18 of second subregion
    in Fig. 10. These nodes will calculate \\(\\theta\\) from neighboring RN and will
    decide accordingly. 3.5.2 How will data collection be accomplished by multiple
    Linears We have discussed data harvesting by single Linear, so far. However, for
    a large area multiple Linears can be utilized for data collection. Figure 4 shows
    data acquisition by two Linears, where each Linear has a fixed area in which it
    can collect data, named as its ROA. It is equal to \\(\\frac{L}{S}\\), where,
    L is length of the field perpendicular to the direction of move of Linear and
    S is number of sinks. The area is divided into three subregions namely, A, B,
    and C. RN selection, next stop location, and stop time calculation remain same
    for multiple Linears to that of single Linear. However, the maximum range (R)
    with which Linear transmits control signal to wake the nodes, changes for multiple
    Linears. R should be selected in such a way, so that it covers the nodes laying
    in the ROA of the Linear horizontally. Thus, \\(R=\\frac{L}{2S}\\) for proper
    functioning of the proposed protocol. However, the BNs laying near to the dividing
    boundary of ROAs of both sinks (nodes 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 4) may receive signals
    from both Linears. These nodes can send data to any of the Linear, and Linears
    can exchange data before the generation of control actions. The range R decreases
    with increase in number of sinks and so does the area from which data is to be
    collected for current S &C state. However, number of sinks must be bounded by
    a value where R becomes 2r. Since increasing number of sinks beyond this point
    will result in a collecting region as small as the sensing range of a sensor node
    that in turn leads to one hop data collection by Linear. Number of collecting
    regions are \\(\\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil\\) for one sink where W is the length
    of the area along the direction of move of Linear. Lemma 1 Total energy consumption
    of the network decreases by \\(\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}\\) for S Linears.
    Proof Let us assume that energy consumption of the network with \\(N_b\\) sources
    (BNs) and one sink is \\(E_T\\), where, $$\\begin{aligned} E_T= N_{b}h_{avg}E_b.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (17) where, \\(E_b\\) is the average energy consumed in one hop
    transmission and is calculated taking the various factors (backoff and retransmissions)
    into account, as discussed in Section 3.4 and \\(h_{avg}\\) is average number
    of hops between source and destination. As number of sinks increases by 1, ROA
    and R of a sink shrink by a fraction of 2. Number of collecting regions are \\(\\lceil
    \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S\\), from which data is to be collected for S sinks. Energy
    consumption for S sinks is: $$\\begin{aligned} E_{T}^{''}= \\lceil \\frac{W}{R}
    \\rceil SE_S. \\end{aligned}$$ (18) where, \\(E_S\\) is energy consumption for
    one collecting region and is given by: $$\\begin{aligned} E_S= N_b^{''}h_{avg}^{''}E_b=\\frac{N_b}{
    \\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S}h_{avg}^{''}E_b. \\end{aligned}$$ (19) where, \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is the average number of hops when distance between source and destination in
    one collecting region with reduced range R. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{E_{T}}{E_{T}^{''}}=\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (20) Validation of the proposed lemma is done through numerical
    analysis and network simulation. For numerical analysis, \\(h_{avg}\\) and \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is calculated by the pdf given in [49] and \\(E_b\\) is calculated as the sum
    of energy dissipated in different states namely, idle, transmit, and receive.
    In idle state, average number of backoffs is calculated by the equation proposed
    in [48]. Energy in transmit and receive states are calculated taking average number
    of retransmissions (discussed in Section 3.4) and packet size into account. Values
    are calculated and simulated for two networks of 42 nodes (low average degree
    \\(\\approx\\) 6) and 150 nodes (high average degree \\(\\approx\\) 20) deployed
    in an area of \\(900\\times 500\\) \\(m^2\\). For network simulation, average
    of 100 runs is considered as the values saturate after this point. The result
    shown in Fig. 11 depicts that numerical analysis matches with the simulation.
    Number of sinks is varied from 1–2 for this network since, range of sink R reduces
    to 125m that is less than 2r (160m). 4 Results and discussion Fig. 11 Validation
    of Lemma 1 through numerical analysis and simulation Full size image Table 3 Simulation
    setup Full size table The section discusses the performance of the three modules
    of LERC. Simulation is performed on the discrete event simulator NS3.30.1 and
    various simulation parameters are mentioned in Table 3. Experiments are performed
    on a data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes deployed in a \\(900\\times 500 m^2\\)
    area. The range of sensor nodes is set as 80m as this is the minimum range for
    connected graph. The data set [51] consists of soil moisture values and position
    information at 42 locations in a farm. The proposed work identifies source nodes
    (RNs) among BNs that in turn depend on position information of sensor nodes. Moreover,
    the proposed work intends to reduce energy consumption in data collection from
    RNs. Thus, the data set is apt to add a realistic flavor for simulating the impact
    of the proposed work. First, energy consumption in reduced overhead broadcast
    is discussed in comparison to cluster trail [26] and MARP [28]. Since, reduced
    overhead broadcast does not depend on the data values of sensor nodes, different
    networks are created keeping transmission range constant. Number of nodes are
    increased randomly to vary average degree of the network by 2. Average degree
    is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. In Section 4.2, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear and event region map construction at Linear
    for different value of \\(\\theta _0\\) is discussed. RN selection depends on
    BN identification (proposed in [7]) that in turn is data dependent. Scarcity of
    available agriculture data set restricts the evaluation of RN selection, stop
    time modelling and total energy consumption to one data set [51]. However, robustness
    of RN selection is shown in different topology by varying \\(\\theta _0\\). RN
    selection is scheme is compared with the recent state-of-the-art methods in terms
    of event region map construction in Section 4.2.2 for \\(\\theta _0=0^\\circ\\).
    Stop time modelling is evaluated by comparing the end to end delay in transmitting
    data from RNs to Linear with the modelled stop time of Linear. End to end delay
    is recorded for different values of \\(\\theta _0\\). Total energy consumption
    of the proposed scheme compared with CH based data transmission, cluster trail,
    and MARP is presented in Section 4.4. Total energy consumption of data collection
    is the sum of energy consumed in BN detection, RN selection and transmission from
    identified RNs to Linear. BN detection mechanism [7] is our previous work and
    is evaluated in same simulation environment and data set. Thus, reduced overhead
    broadcast, RN selection, and stop time modeling are evaluated by simulation in
    this work and total energy consumption includes simulation results from our previous
    work in same simulation environment. 4.1 Analysis of reduced overhead broadcast
    Energy consumption in dissemination of start message for the proposed reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme, cluster trail scheme, and flooding is shown in Fig.
    12. The proposed mechanism is tested for different networks, keeping transmission
    range constant. Number of nodes are increased to vary average degree of the network
    by 2. Average degree is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. The proposed
    reduced overhead broadcast scheme consumes 33.3%\\(-\\)61.1% and 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    less energy than the flooding scheme [28] and cluster trail [26] respectively.
    A node receives k number of messages and transmits only one message as opposed
    to multiple message transmissions in others. Fig. 12 Energy consumption in start
    message dissemination Full size image 4.2 Analysis of data transmission from BNs
    to Linear and construction of MZ map at Linear In this subsection, variation in
    number of RNs and corresponding energy consumption of the network, with respect
    to the tuning of angle \\(\\theta _0\\) is presented. As \\(\\theta _0\\) increases,
    number of RNs (source) decreases and so is the energy consumption (as shown in
    Fig. 13). The values written in brackets are the number of RNs for corresponding
    \\(\\theta _0\\). \\(\\theta _0\\) is varied from 0\\(^\\circ\\) to 45\\(^\\circ\\)
    (maximum \\(\\theta\\) is 45\\(^\\circ\\) from the formula given in Section 3.3),
    with an interval of 1. However, only those values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in the figure for which there is a change from previous value. When \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\), all BNs act as data transmitters to Linear. A BN does
    not mark itself as a RN if its \\(\\theta\\) (angle of the gradient of line joining
    it to its previous RN) is less than \\(\\theta _0\\). Thus, number of RNs keeps
    on decreasing with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\),
    number of RNs and energy consumption are minimum. For this value, only the BNs
    that are one hop neighbors of Linear and the corner nodes act as RNs. However,
    this value is not the optimum one to achieve reliability (Re), since it depends
    on the MZ construction at Linear. Fig. 13 Variation of energy consumption in data
    transmission from RNs to Linear with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Fig. 14 MZ map at Linear for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 0 Full size image Fig. 15 Variation
    in the construction of MZ at Linear with varying \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Linear constructs MZs, depending on the data and position information received
    from RNs. Constructed MZs at Linear for some values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in Figs. 14 and 15. When \\(\\theta _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\) (refer Fig. 14), all
    BNs send data to Linear and MZ is constructed with 100% reliability. As \\(\\theta
    _0\\) increases, number of RNs decreases gradually and MZ at Linear changes. For
    example, when \\(\\theta _0\\) is 5\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 34
    do not mark themselves as RNs. However, exclusion of these nodes have insignificant
    impact on construction of MZ at Linear (it can be clearly seen in Fig. 15a). Similarly,
    for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 15\\(^\\circ\\) nodes 15, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31 are excluded
    (Fig. 15b) and for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 20\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 17 and 20 are removed
    from RN set having a negligible variation in MZ map at Linear (Fig. 15c). When
    node 30 marks itself as non-RN node for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) (Fig.
    15d), distortion in MZ map is seen with respect to the original MZ for \\(\\theta
    _0\\) = 0\\(^\\circ\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\) only corner nodes
    and one hop neighbors are marked as RNs. (refer Fig. 15e). Thus, it can be inferred
    from the above discussion that as value of \\(\\theta _0\\) increases, number
    of data transmitter BNs and overall energy consumption decreases. However, after
    a certain value of \\(\\theta _0\\), data collected from RNs become insufficient
    to construct a correct MZ map at Linear. For the topology under consideration
    \\(\\theta _0\\) should be less than or equal to 20\\(^\\circ\\) for a reliable
    construction of MZ map at Linear. Moreover, Fig. 15f shows the constructed MZ
    map for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) without corner nodes 4 and 12. The
    map shows that corner nodes are key enablers for MZ map construction and hence,
    must be selected as RNs. 4.2.1 Safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) To test the variation
    of MZ map with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) further, networks are deployed by varying
    number of nodes from 50–150 with an increase of 1 in average degree in the area
    900\\(\\times\\)500 \\(m^2\\). Change in boundary and BNs was insignificant for
    the networks of more than 150 nodes. RNs are identified by varying \\(\\theta
    _0\\) from \\(0^\\circ -45^\\circ\\) and effect on the boundary is observed. As
    \\(\\theta _0\\) increases number of RNs decreases and so is the energy consumption
    of the network. However, the reconstructed boundary of MZs deforLinear with decrease
    in number of RNs. \\(\\theta _0\\) after which no significant change in energy
    consumption is recorded for various networks is shown in Fig. 16. The results
    show that the minimum value among all recorded values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(20^\\circ\\).
    Maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) to retain the shape of coarse boundary is shown in Fig.
    16. For correct reconstruction of boundary, maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\).
    Thus, \\(\\theta _0\\) must be tuned between \\(20^\\circ\\) and \\(30^\\circ\\).
    \\(\\theta _0\\) selected in this range reduces energy consumption while maintaining
    the correctness of coarse boundary of reconstructed MZ map. Limitation Exact tuning
    of \\(\\theta _0\\) is a limitation of the proposed work as mentioned in Section
    3.3. Fig. 16 Optimal values of \\(\\theta _0\\) for energy consumption and correct
    MZ map reconstruction Full size image 4.2.2 Comparison with RN selection schemes
    The RN selection algorithm of the proposed LERC protocol is compared with COBOM
    [19], DEMOCO [21], and the algorithm proposed in [20]. Figures 17, 18 and 19 show
    the selected RNs among BNs and the demarcated boundary map by the algorithms.
    Both the algorithms identify lesser number of RNs than the proposed scheme, however,
    give ambiguous and incorrect results. Fig. 17 RNs and event region construction
    by COBOM [19] Full size image As shown in Fig. 17, COBOM identifies 9 RNs among
    20 BNs. If a node has different reading (depending on threshold) than its neighbors,
    it is marked as BNs. RNs are selected among BNs by suppressing the neighbors.
    A node in COBOM declares itself as RN if none of its neighbors broadcast their
    status as RN within a predefined time. RN transmits its data and its neighbors’
    IDs. Thus, every two-hop neighbors are marked as RNs. Node 27 informs the sink
    that its neighbors, nodes 18, 19, and 22 are in different subregion. On the other
    hand, node 21 informs that nodes 9, 13, and 22 are in same subregion. Nodes 17
    and 8 informs that nodes 7 and 18 are in different subregion. According to these
    reports, sink draws a boundary as shown in Fig. 17 where nodes of two different
    subregions are merged (please refer Fig. 14 for correct map). COBOM is designed
    for continuous object boundary monitoring, where only two subregions exist: one
    in which object is present and second in which object is not present. Fig. 18
    RNs and event region construction by DEMOCO [21] Full size image Fig. 19 RNs and
    event region construction by the scheme proposed in [20] Full size image DEMOCO
    reduces number of BNs and hence, number of RNs to minimize number of source nodes.
    It enhances COBOM by selecting only \"IN\" nodes as BNs leaving \"OUT\" nodes.
    Thus, it selects BNs that lay on one side of the boundary. BNs, RNs, and the event
    region boundary constructed at BS by DEMOCO is shown in Fig. 18. It reduces number
    of RNs to 5, however the event region boundary formed at BS is Incorrect. The
    BNs belonging to four event regions are entirely suppressed since, DEMOCO selects
    nodes laying one side of the boundary as BNs. Thus, neighbors of BNs laying in
    different event regions are not selected as BNs and RNs. DEMOCO reduces number
    of RNs to a great extent, however, this in turn leads to suppression of information
    from different event regions. The algorithm proposed in [20], identifies a node
    as BN if its data value is different from at least one neighbor and distance from
    this neighbor is least among the distances from all of its neighbors. Every two
    hop neighbor among BNs is selected as RN. In this course, the algorithm reduces
    RNs by 72% as compared to LERC. However, such suppression leads to information
    loss and the constructed event region map is faulty as shown in Fig. 19. 4.3 Stop
    time for the Linear In this subsection, the modelled stop time is evaluated by
    varying the application dependent threshold \\(\\theta _0\\) as shown in Fig.
    20. Calculated stop time is 30seconds for network of 42 nodes and simulated End
    to End (E2E) delay for \\(\\theta _0\\) = \\(0^\\circ\\) is 23.5seconds. The E2E
    delay decreases slightly with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\), as number of RNs decreases
    with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\) (explained in previous subsection). Decrease
    in number of source nodes in turn decreases in-network traffic and retransmissions.
    Hence, E2E delay decreases. However, for \\(\\theta _0>40^\\circ\\) E2E delay
    saturates at 23.05seconds as decrease in number of RNs seizes beyond this point
    (shown in previous subsection). The modelled stop time for two sinks is lesser
    than that of one sink because of the number of hops between Linear and farthest
    RN. E2E delay for two sinks is less than the modelled stop time and decreases
    slightly with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). Hence, it can be concluded that modelled
    stop time of Linear is adequate to collect data from all RNs. Fig. 20 Variation
    in end to end delay with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image 4.4 Overall
    analysis of the system The proposed scheme is compared with a clustering based
    data collection by mobile BS moving on fixed trajectory [41], to prove the efficacy
    (in terms of energy consumption) of data transmission from BNs to Linear over
    the data transmission from CHs to mobile BS. Next, the proposed scheme is compared
    with MARP that is a recent sensor actuator coordination protocol. Further, the
    proposed scheme is compared with two recent agent based routing protocols. Energy
    efficient Geographic Routing Protocol based on mobile sink (EGRPM) [23] is mobile
    BS based data collection protocol, whereas, Energy Efficient Layered Routing Protocol
    (EELRP) [52] is a static BS based layered routing protocol. In addition, the proposed
    scheme is compared with cluster trail [26] that is a communication protocol implementing
    limited broadcast for mobile BS location information dissemination. Experiments
    are performed on the data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes. Total energy consumption
    is the energy consumed in transmitting start message from Linear to nodes and
    data transmission from RNs to Linear. To test reduced overhead broadcast scheme
    we varied number of nodes since BNs are not required for it. However, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear for varying number of nodes requires selection
    of BNs in each setting. Scarcity of available agriculture data set restricts the
    performance evaluation to this data set [51]. However, variation in number of
    nodes can be done by extrapolation technique. Fig. 21 Comparison of total energy
    consumption with recent protocols Full size image The proposed scheme performs
    better in terms of energy consumption as shown in Fig. 21. For network of 42 sensors,
    there is 12 %, 19%, 24%, 34%, 56% decrease in energy consumption with respect
    to EGRPM, CH based scheme, cluster trail, MARP, and EELRP, respectively. Total
    energy consumption of the proposed scheme is the sum of energy dissipation in
    BN selection (algorithm proposed in [9]), start message dissemination, and data
    transmission from selected RNs to Linear. For CH based data transmission, there
    are two phases namely, initial and collection. Initial phase involves control
    message flooding from mobile BS to the sensor nodes, hop count transmission from
    each node to BS, and maximum and minimum hop count flooding from BS to sensor
    nodes. Flooding of several control messages incur high energy consumption, however,
    it is a one time process. In collection phase, CHs are elected by several control
    message transmission, sensor nodes are attached to CHs as Cluster Members (CMs),
    and CHs choose another CH as next hop for forwarding of data transmission. At
    the end, data is transmitted from CMs to respective CHs and is forwarded to BS
    via another CHs. In the proposed scheme, BN selection algorithm consumes approximately
    529 mJ in which identification of BNs laying on network boundary (one time process)
    consumes 400 mJ (for details please refer [7]). The initial phase of [41] consumes
    less energy (=350 mJ) than the proposed scheme despite of more number of message
    exchanges. The reason behind this decrease is the size of packets. In BN identification,
    data packets are transmitted in addition to the control packet transmission whereas,
    in [41], only control packets are flooded. However, in collection phase the CH
    election, cluster formation, and data transmission consumes more energy than reduced
    overhead broadcast and data transmission from selected RNs. EELRP [52] divides
    the network into sectors centered at the BS that sits in the middle of it. Each
    node transmits three control packets to select agent of their sector and sends
    data to the agent via multi-hop. Agents of the sectors aggregates and forwards
    the data to BS via multi-hop. The proposed scheme performs better than EELRP since
    selecting agent involves multiple messages and moreover, multi-hop data transmission
    between sensor nodes to agent and agent to BS causes high energy consumption.
    Table 4 Key findings of the research Full size table EGRPM [23] divides the network
    into similar grids where the size of grid is decided based on the length and width
    of the network. Each cell nodes flood control messages to identify agent of the
    cell. Mobile BS traverses through the network and stops at four locations on the
    periphery of the network. Each cell node sends data to the agent of cell via one-hop
    or multi-hop. The agent then transmits data to mobile BS via one-hop or multi-hop.
    LERC performs better than EGRPM in terms of energy consumption as in EGRPM selection
    of agent is an energy consuming process due to flooding of control messages. Moreover,
    all nodes are source nodes and forwards data towards agent via multi-hop. Moreover,
    agent forwards data to mobile BS via multi-hop. Average path length is 5 for EGRPM.
    LERC achieves less energy consumption by reducing number of source nodes and minimizing
    location information messages of mobile BS. Energy consumption of cluster trail
    is more than the proposed scheme as mobile BS location information broadcast consumes
    much energy as shown in previous subsection. Data transmissions from sensor nodes
    consume slightly more energy due to the movement of sink. In some cases, BS moves
    before data is received by it. In such cases, nodes follow the trail generated
    and ends up into many multihop transmissions. The proposed scheme consumes less
    energy than MARP [28], because of two reasons. First, the reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme and second is the selective sources. In MARP, actuator floods its control
    message to establish a path from each source to it. Flooding causes high energy
    consumption as already shown in previous subsection. Moreover, all nodes transmit
    sensed data to the actuator during its pause time that consumes more energy than
    the data transmission from a few RNs in the proposed scheme. A summary of the
    key findings in this research is presented in Table 4. 4.5 Interpretability and
    explainability of performance gain over existing methods The performance gain
    of the proposed mechanism is twofold: Correct map construction and Low energy
    consumption. Correct map construction is achieved by transmitting data from RNs.
    The existing mechanisms for RN selection mechanism are developed for selecting
    appropriate nodes among BNs. However, these methods do not include the communication
    cost from RNs to BS. Therefore, to evaluate the communication cost of the proposed
    mechanism, it is compared with existing communication protocols. Thus, the proposed
    scheme is compared with two class of state-of-art mechanisms: RN selection mechanisms
    and communication protocols. Correct map construction is achieved by the proposed
    mechanism even if nodes of more than two event regions lie nearby. The existing
    methods fail to reconstruct the boundaries at BS in such a scenario (As described
    in Introduction section and shown in the results (Figs. 17 and 19). However, in
    case of two event regions sharing a single boundary, existing methods perform
    better than the proposed mechanism as less number of RNs are selected by existing
    mechanisms. As RNs are the sources for data transmission, less number of RNs result
    into reduced energy consumption. There are two components contributing for low
    energy consumption in data transmission for local map construction than the existing
    methods. First component is the reduced overhead in Linear location information
    dissemination. Each node waits for its neighbour to transmit the control packet
    having Linear location information and sends only one message. Second component
    is the reduced number of sources. However, for a particular boundary, decrease
    in number of RNs beyond a point reduces the energy consumption but hampers the
    correctness of map constructed at Linear. Selection of this point is the limitation
    of our work as mentioned in above subsection. The cost of correct local map construction
    with low energy consumption at Linear is increased delay. Linear waits for a certain
    period of time modelled as the Stop Time before decision making and actuation.
    This time includes the waiting time of nodes for location information dissemination
    of Linear and the data transmission time from the farthest RNs to Linear. The
    waiting time for Linear location information dissemination ensures reduced energy
    consumption and data transmission time guarantees the correctness of constructed
    map. However, the application under consideration can tolerate the increased delay.
    5 Conclusion The paper develops a distributed lightweight scheme for event region
    map construction at Linear. It identifies minimal set BNs as source nodes and
    models stop time of Linear to collect information from these nodes. A reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for location information dissemination where
    each node transmits only one message. This scheme addresses the challenge of reducing
    message overhead in location information dissemination. Stop time is modelled
    as the sum of control message transmission to the farthest BN, and data packet
    transmission from it to Linear. The challenge of modelling adequate stop time
    for data collection is addressed in this module. Next, to reduce network traffic,
    a minimal set BNs are selected as data transmitters (RN) to Linear. The RNs are
    selected such as the data transmitted by them must construct a correct map at
    Linear. Moreover, data collection in multiple Linear scenario is investigated.
    Simulation results demonstrated a significant decrease in energy consumption with
    respect to the state-of-art mechanisms. Data availability Not applicable. References

  description: Understanding spatial and temporal dynamics of soil water within fields
    is critical for effective variable rate irrigation (VRI) management. The objectives
    of this study were to develop VRI zones, manage irrigation rates within VRI zones,
    and examine temporal differences in soil volumetric water content (VWC) from irrigation
    events via soil sensors across zones. Five irrigation zones were delineated after
    two years (2016 and 2017) of yield and evapotranspiration (ET) data collection.
    Soil sensors were placed within each zone to give real time data of VWC values
    and assist in irrigation decisions within a 23 ha field of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum
    ‘UI Magic’) near Grace, Idaho, USA (2019). Cumulative irrigation rates among zones
    ranged from 236 to 298 mm. Although a statistical comparison could not be made,
    the irrigation rates were 0.6 to 21% less than an estimated uniform grower standard
    practice (GSP) irrigation approach. Based on soil sensor data, crop water stress
    was avoided with VRI management in all but Zone 3. Thus, this simple approach
    to VRI zone delineation and VWC monitoring has the potential to reduce irrigation,
    such as this study, on average by 12% and should be evaluated in other site-years
    to assess its viability.

    1.1. Yield and Crop Water Needs Are Spatially and Temporally Variable Variation
    of crop yields are often related to factors, such as topographical changes, soil
    texture and property differences, compaction, nutrient variability, and pest distribution
    differences [1]. Significant within-field variation in yield has been observed
    even in fields that appear somewhat uniform. Some areas of a field may consistently
    produce lower or higher yields, while other areas are variable from year-to-year
    due to many interacting factors [2]. For example, Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin
    et al. (2019) [4] found that wheat (Triticum aestivum spp.) yields ranged from
    2.3 to 10.6 Mg ha−1 in a field with minimal topographic variation. One underlying
    cause of within-field yield variation of irrigated crops is spatiotemporal variation
    of soil water content, which varies significantly in seemingly uniform fields
    [5]. Understanding within-field and temporal variation of soil water can improve
    understanding of yield variation and inform precision management practices to
    improve resource use efficiency. Agricultural irrigators using pressurized water
    delivery systems typically apply uniform irrigation as they seek to ensure that
    no area of the field is visibly water stressed [6]. However, uniform irrigation
    ignores variations in soil properties, nutrient availability, topographic features,
    microclimates, pest and pathogen pressure, and other factors that affect crop
    water use [3,4,7]. As a result, a field that is irrigated uniformly with an application
    of the average amount of water use would create water deficits in some areas within
    a field and surpluses in others [8]. Spatial variation of yield and crop water
    use have been linked to the variability of a wide variety of soil physical and
    chemical properties, such as texture, depth, water holding capacity, and apparent
    soil electrical conductivity (ECa) [5,9,10], as well as organic matter, topography,
    compaction, hydrophobicity, subsurface layers, nutrient deficiencies, pH, salinity/sodicity,
    and soil borne pathogens, nematodes, and insects [11]. The most visually obvious
    spatial differences are often related to topography. However, high within-field
    variability in soil water properties has been observed in mechanically leveled
    fields with minimal topographical undulations [5,12]. Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin
    et al. (2019) [4] found surprisingly large differences in soil water holding capacity
    (SWHC) in a field with minimal apparent variation in many soil properties and
    topographical features. 1.2. Delineating and Managing Zones for VRI Relatively
    new technology allows for a variable rate irrigation (VRI) in an effort to more
    precisely apply the water that is needed by a crop to potentially improve yields
    and reduce waste. The effectiveness of VRI is determined by accurately predicting
    variable water needs in zones within a field. Developing these zones can be performed
    by determining various static properties but are complicated by dynamic events
    that change year to year. Soil properties are among the static conditions that
    are generally used to delineate VRI zones [6,13,14,15]. Many of these static soil
    properties impact the spatial variability of SWHC, which has been shown to influence
    yield and crop water use [10,16], including within-field variations of these properties
    [5,9]. As such, variation in SWHC is utilized to delineate zones [6,8,14,17,18]
    and inform VRI to help maximize crop production per unit of land and water [11].
    While within-field variability of soil properties is important for characterizing
    VRI zones, topographical features also play a role in zone delineation. General
    topographic features used to describe within-field variability are elevation,
    slope, aspect, and curvature [2,19,20]. Water tends to move within fields from
    areas of higher elevation to lower areas of the field and often results in yield
    variation related to deficient, optimum, or excessive levels of water availability
    [2,3,4,21,22]. Combining topographical features with historical yield patterns,
    explained below, has been useful in delineating irrigation management zones for
    VRI [3,4,19]. While VRI zone delineation based on static soil properties or topographical
    features is common, some research has indicated that considering dynamic soil
    or crop factors could improve VRI management [5,7,23]. Examples of dynamic factors
    impacting crop water stress include variable precipitation and other weather conditions,
    snow accumulation impacting depth of soil water in spring, disease or pest pressure,
    and nutrient deficiencies [3,4,5,7,23]. These dynamic factors combine with the
    static variation of soil properties to make complex and variable spatial patterns
    of crop yields and evapotranspiration (ET). Modeling daily ET for estimating crop
    water demand utilizing soil water sensors and remote sensing of the crop canopy
    are approaches that have been used to describe these spatially variable patterns
    [14,24,25,26]. Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin et al. (2019) [4] found variable soil
    water dynamics throughout a field of winter wheat, such as spring soil volumetric
    water content (VWC). These have been effective variables in predicting late season
    crop water stress in arid regions [27]. Although irrigation zones have been characterized
    with soil and topographical properties, other dynamic field data, especially historical
    yield and ET, may improve the delineation of zones. Utilizing these other dynamic
    factors are not common within zone delineation for VRI management [17,28]. However,
    Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin et al. (2019) [4] collected multiple years of yield
    data in a field with a wheat–wheat–potato cropping system and found consistency
    in yield patterns were apparent. These yield patterns likely have an impact on
    irrigation needs. Svedin (2018) [3] and Svedin et al. (2019) [4] combined yield
    data with ET to delineate zones based on productivity. This method could inform
    growers on how to delineate zones to irrigate their fields most efficiently. In-season
    VRI management can be achieved with buried soil water matric potential (MP) or
    VWC sensors measuring temporal variation. [29,30]. Sensor costs and installation
    time generally prevent their use for high density spatial coverage within production
    fields, and selecting locations for sensors within a field presents an important
    challenge [29,31,32]. Delineating VRI zones has been performed using variables,
    such as topography and static soil properties, but experiments using dynamic variables,
    such as historical yield and ET patterns to create zones, and then irrigated with
    soil sensors require more examination. The objectives of this study were to: (i)
    develop VRI zones using observations of within-field variation in crop yield and
    ET; (ii) manage spatially and temporally unique irrigation rates within VRI zones
    for a winter wheat crop; and (iii) assess whether VRI was effective at maintaining
    VWC within zone-specific soil bands of readily available water. 2. Materials and
    Methods 2.1. Study Site This study was conducted on three years (2016, 2017, and
    2019) of spatial and temporal data collected from a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum
    ‘UI Magic’) field (23 ha) near Grace, ID, USA (elevation 1706 m above sea level;
    42.60904 latitude and −111.788 longitude; ArcGIS Pro 2.7.1, Redlands, CA, USA).
    The previous crop in 2015 and 2018 was potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) with the
    historic cropping system of wheat–wheat–potato. The field is in a semi-arid region
    with a climate typified with relatively hot days and cool nights during the summer
    growing season with an average air temperature of 15 °C and about 80 to 110 frost-free
    days. Average annual precipitation is 0.39 m [33] with most of the precipitation
    occurring during winter as snowfall. The growing season precipitation (May–August)
    was below average (0.15 m) [33] during the time of this trial, with precipitation
    between spring soil sampling and harvest totaling to 0.099, 0.090, and 0.092 m
    in 2016, 2017, and 2019, respectively. The soil is a silty clay loam Rexburg-Ririe
    complex, with 1 to 4 % slopes, described as coarse-silty, mixed, superactive,
    frigid Calcic Haploxerolls that derive from alluvial influenced loess [34]. The
    field has a 6 m difference between the lowest and highest elevation (Figure 1).
    Figure 1. Image of field research site near Grace, ID, USA, with elevation contour
    lines (m), 2019 VRI management zones, soil sample points, and soil volumetric
    water content (VWC) sensor locations. Soil texture was measured at four 0.3 m
    depth increments from the surface level down to 1.2 m at 46 spatially distributed
    sites (70 m grid) across the field. The silty clay loam texture was confirmed
    at 42 of the sample sites, and the remaining four sites were classified as silty
    clay. Irrigation was applied using a 380 m center pivot with a 5 m nozzle spacing
    equipped with a zone-control VRI system (GrowSmart Precision VRI, Lindsay Corporation,
    Omaha, NE, USA). Irrigation events occurred every 5–7 days in spring and every
    3–5 days during summer at peak ET. There are 0.3 ha of shallow and emerged bedrock
    that are not farmed or irrigated, and these water savings are not included in
    the results of this study but are certainly part of the overall savings experienced
    by the grower. The cooperating grower managed all aspects of wheat production.
    2.2. Soil Volumetric Water Content (VWC) The soil sampling grid (70 m) was determined
    from the range (140 m) of a fitted semi-variogram determined using the approach
    of Kerry and Oliver [35], which recommends using a grid interval of half the variogram
    range for a variogram of ancillary data that are related to the property of interest.
    The semi-variogram for this sampling grid was calculated from the 1 m resolution
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from a color-infrared National Agriculture
    Imagery Program (NAIP) of bare soil imagery from winter of 2015, https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-aerial-photography-national-agriculture-imagery-program-naip
    (accessed on 3 April 2023). In 2016 and 2017, 46 gridded samples were collected
    on the 70 m grid, with an additional 39 random sample points (85 total). These
    additional random samples at shorter intervals mean that when interpolating data
    for any measured variable, the nugget variance of the variogram is more accurately
    estimated, and this will give more accurate kriged estimates. Beginning in 2019,
    56 nested sample sites were collected as well as the 46 gridded sample points
    (102 total). This sampling scheme was used to calculate the spatial variation
    of soil VWC and soil water depletion over time. Soil samples were collected on
    18 April and 20 August 2016, 4 May and 1 September 2017, and 23 April, 30 May,
    25 June, and 5 September 2019. These samples were used within each year to calculate
    ET from a season-long water balance equation, calculate crop water productivity
    (CWP), initialize a daily soil water depletion model, and compute reliable variograms
    for kriging [36]. Mid-season soil samples were collected at all locations on 30
    May, and half of the sampling locations on 25 June in 2019 to provide further
    in-depth, in-season validation calculations for the soil water depletion model
    used. Soil samples were collected using a 0.051 m diameter soil probe in 2016
    and 2017. In 2019, soil probes with a diameter of 0.019 m were driven into the
    profile with a modified gas-powered post driver (AMS, Inc. American Falls, ID,
    USA). At each sampling point, a soil core was taken to approximate the final depth
    of rooting at increments of 0–0.3, 0.3–0.6, 0.6–0.9, and 0.9–1.2 m. Samples were
    sealed for transport to the laboratory where gravimetric soil water content was
    determined by drying in a forced-air oven at 105 °C until consistent weights were
    reached. Soil gravimetric water content was converted to VWC using soil bulk density
    values determined in 2016 from previous samples [3,4]. Prior to geostatistical
    analysis of soil VWC, yield, ET, and CWP, summary statistics were calculated and
    histograms plotted. If the skewness of the dataset was outside the bounds of ±1,
    then the data were transformed to logarithms for variogram computation and backtransformed
    to the original scale following kriging [37]. Following variogram computation,
    each variable was ordinary kriged to a 5 m grid. All variograms and kriging was
    completed using SpaceStat (BioMedware, SpaceStat 4, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and ArcGIS
    desktop: Release 10 (Redlands, CA, USA). JMP Pro 14 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
    USA) was used for distribution statistics. 2.3. Evapotranspiration The ET for
    the wheat growing season (18 April–20 August 2016, 4 May–1 September 2017, and
    23 April–5 September 2019) was calculated for each sampling location within the
    field using the following water balance equation: 𝐸𝑇=𝑃+𝐼+∆𝑆−𝑅𝑂−𝐷 (1) where “P”
    is total season-long precipitation (m), “I” is total season-long irrigation (m),
    “ΔS” is the change in the depth of soil water in a 1.2 m deep profile between
    sampling events at spring green-up and harvest, “RO” is surface water runoff (m),
    and “D” is soil water drainage (m) below the sampling depth. Drainage was calculated
    from a separate daily soil water balance as any amount of water (P + I) that exceeded
    site specific field capacity (FC) values for the 1.2 m deep profile. Reference
    ET and crop coefficients from the cooperative agricultural weather network AgriMet
    [33] were used to determine the daily soil water balance. Seasonal RO was assumed
    negligible because the greatest daily precipitation event was 0.0086 m, and soil
    infiltration rates exceeded this amount, and there were no visible indications
    of surface water movement. The season-long ET water balance calculation began
    at the date of spring soil sampling and ended at the date of the fall soil sampling.
    2.4. Yield and Crop Water Productivity Grain was harvested with a commercial combine
    equipped with a calibrated yield monitor (New Holland IntelliView 4, Turin, Italy)
    using a mass flow sensor collecting yield data every 10 m2. The yield data were
    processed as described by Kerry and Oliver [35]. Erroneous data points were defined
    as outside the limits of ±75% of the median. In addition, points where the wheat
    combine did not harvest the full header width were removed. Wheat yield data were
    calibrated using a weigh cart and validated with wheat bin storage showing an
    overall accuracy of ±1%. Season-long ET at each sample location was used to calculate
    CWP. Crop water productivity was calculated as follows: 𝐶𝑊𝑃=𝑌/𝐸𝑇 (2) where Y is
    yield (kg ha−1) and ET is season-long evapotranspiration (mm) assessed at each
    sample point from pre-planting to harvest. 2.5. Irrigation Management Zones Irrigation
    zones for 2019 were created from yield and ET data collected from 2016 and 2017
    [3,4,38]. In 2016, yield and ET were evaluated under the grower standard practice
    (GSP) of uniform irrigation. In 2017, yield and ET were evaluated under VRI with
    irrigation treatments created based on three years (2013, 2014, 2016) of yield
    data and CWP in 2016 [3,4]. The 2017 irrigation included low (0.7 × GSP) and high
    (1.3 × GSP) irrigation treatments and two control strips (GSP) for within-year
    comparisons. Irrigation differences among treatments were created to give plus-or-minus
    15% difference in season-long ET. The observed reactions of the field to 2017
    irrigation treatments were used to create and manage spatially variable irrigation
    zones for the 2019 growing season. This was accomplished by using a regression
    where yield was the response variable and ET was the explanatory variable. Then,
    a k-means clustering algorithm was conducted based on the slope of the regression
    and with constraints for spatial contiguity to map out the five irrigation zones
    (Figure 1) [17]. During the 2019 growing season, irrigation rates for each zone
    were derived by comparing VWC measured by sensors in each zone to the zone average
    FC values and applied to bring the upper 0.3 m soil depth to a soil water content
    approximately equal to FC [38]. Irrigations were timed to keep water depletion
    from decreasing below readily available water (RAW). Cumulative irrigation amounts
    in each zone were compared with a cumulative estimated GSP irrigation amount.
    The 2019 GSP rates were estimated from a combination of historical GSP rates from
    the same crop under uniform irrigation and considering rates from a neighboring
    field with a similar crop during that same year. The FC values were approximated
    within each zone by averaging the greatest of the three green-up (wheat at early
    spring) observed VWC values for each soil sample within their given zones between
    2016 and 2018. The FC was assumed based on the soil being recently saturated from
    melting snow and spring precipitation but having at least three days for drainage
    with minimal ET losses during this time. Wilting point (WP) was assumed from fall
    soil samples because the soils had been dried down for harvest with 15, 7.1, and
    1.3 mm of rainfall 18, 25, and 16 d after the last irrigation event for 2016,
    2017, and 2019, respectively. The WP values were chosen from the lowest VWC values
    between these three years of sampling at the post-harvest sampling dates. The
    WP assumption was validated on 39 samples using a Decagon WP4C (WP4C Dewpoint
    Potentiometer, METER Group, Inc.—formally Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) to
    estimate the relationship between VWC and water potential. For each validation
    sample, 4–5 known volumetric moisture values were analyzed on the WP4C to calculate
    water potential. Using a logarithmic fitted line, VWC was estimated at −1500 kPa
    for each sample and compared to the field estimated WP. All measured volumetric
    WP values were within ±10% of the fall VWC values for individual depths, and within
    a 5% error when averaged for the whole soil profile, verifying the assumption
    that fall soil samples were at or very near WP. The soil water retained between
    FC and WP was calculated as total available water (TAW, mm), which is the water
    available to the plant, using the following equation: TAW = 1000 (FC − WP) Zr
    (3) where “FC” is field capacity (m), “WP” is wilting point (m), and “Zr” is the
    rooting depth (m). Readily available water (RAW) is the portion of water within
    the TAW that can be taken up by plants before the plant develops crop stress.
    The equation to calculate RAW is as follows: 𝑅𝐴𝑊=𝑝𝑇𝐴𝑊 (4) where “ 𝑝 ” is the average
    fraction of TAW that can be depleted from the root zone before the crop experiences
    stress and yields are limited. The 𝑝 value of 0.55 was assigned to the winter
    wheat crop [39]. 2.6. VWC Data Collection through Soil Sensors in 2019 During
    the 2019 growing season, soil sensors were installed to measure VWC (TEROS 12,
    METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) and soil MP (TEROS 21, Meter, Pullman, WA,
    USA) with data loggers (ZL6, METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) in each of the
    five irrigation zones. The location of the sensors placed within each zone was
    chosen to reflect the average measured VWC for that zone. One of each sensor type
    was installed 0.03–0.05 m apart at 0.15 and 0.45 m below the soil surface with
    an additional VWC sensor at 0.75 m depth at each of the five locations (Figure
    1). The sensors logged data every 15 min. The loggers and sensors were installed
    on April 23 and removed just prior to harvest on August 20. 3. Results 3.1. Zone
    Delineation by Observed CWP Under uniform irrigation in 2016, the field average
    yield was 7.5 Mg ha−1 with a range of 2.3–10.6 Mg ha−1 and a field average ET
    of 520 mm with a range of 315–571 mm (Figure 2). Figure 2. Variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) zones (first row), spatially variable wheat yield (second row), evapotranspiration
    (ET) (third row), and crop water productivity (CWP) (fourth row) for 2016 and
    2017. These data were used to create the irrigation management zones for 2019.
    Under spatially variable irrigation in 2017, a similar yield range was observed
    (1.8–8.4 Mg ha−1), but the field average yield decreased to 5.8 Mg ha−1 (Figure
    2). This phenomenon is common in second-year wheat grown in wheat–wheat–potato
    crop rotations as disease and pest pressure increase within the second wheat year
    [40,41,42], and it is assumed that the observed differences are not because of
    the change in irrigation practice. The irrigation treatments did influence yield
    within 2017 with the low and high irrigation treatments averaging 4.9 and 6.4
    Mg ha−1, respectively. Average ET was 497 mm with a range of 255–620 mm (Figure
    2). The low and high zones had an average ET of 435 and 573 mm, respectively.
    Although the range of yield was less in 2017 than 2016, it is notable that the
    range of ET was 109 mm greater in 2017. The spatial pattern of ET was largely
    dictated by irrigation treatments while the spatial pattern in the yield was similar
    to that observed under uniform irrigation in 2016. These comparisons were made
    to evaluate crop water response under variable conditions, and no statistical
    comparisons of yield across years were performed. In these years, CWP patterns
    were more closely related to yield than ET. In 2016, average CWP was 14 kg ha−1
    mm−1 with a range of 4.7–21 kg ha−1 mm−1 (Figure 2). In 2017, average CWP was
    11 kg ha−1 mm−1 with a range of 4.1–19 kg ha−1 mm−1 (Figure 2). In 2016, CWP generally
    increased in areas where ET was lower. Similarly, in 2017, yields improved but
    CWP decreased in the high irrigation treatment areas where 30% more irrigation
    was applied. For the low treatment where irrigation was decreased by 30%, yields
    decreased and CWP increased. 3.2. 2019 Variable Rate Irrigation A five-zone VRI
    map for 2019 was generated based on the CWP from both uniform and variable irrigation
    seasons in 2016 and 2017 (Figure 1). Irrigation rates were unique for each zone
    and irrigation event. The total area in each zone was 2.5, 7.7, 3.6, 7.2, and
    1.8 ha for Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Variable irrigation rates in
    2019 were determined from observed VWC values from installed soil sensors and
    zone-specific average FC values. Temporal changes in soil-sensor VWC for each
    zone are depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3. Temporal change in volumetric water content
    (VWC) at a depth of 0.0–0.3 m for a wheat crop in 2019 under variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) with five irrigation zones. Precipitation and zone-specific VRI events are
    also shown. Zone average field capacity (FC) and readily available water (RAW)
    are identified with blue and red lines, respectively. The VRI irrigation scheduling
    approach was successful in maintaining VWC between FC and RAW during critical
    growth stages in each zone, except for a short time in Zone 3 (Figure 3). The
    distinctive VWC patterns between irrigation zones provide evidence for value from
    VRI. There was a total of 14 irrigation events, beginning at 131 d after planting
    (May 11) and ending at 199 d (July 18). Applied irrigation rates for individual
    events and zones ranged from 5 to 28 mm, with an average application of 15 mm
    per event (Table 1). Table 1. Date of application and irrigation amounts within
    each of the five delineated irrigation zones throughout the 2019 growing season.
    Estimated grower standard practice (GSP) rates are compared to the rates of the
    other irrigation zones throughout the season. Uniform rates were applied on 6/18
    and 7/2 for fertigation purposes. Total season-long irrigation averaged 262 mm
    for the entire field, with 285, 236, 298, 237, and 254 mm in Zones 1, 2, 3, 4,
    and 5, respectively (Figure 4 and Table 1). Figure 4. Cumulative irrigation for
    winter wheat in 2019 under variable rate irrigation (VRI) with five irrigation
    zones compared to the estimated cumulative grower standard practice (GSP) from
    11 May to 18 July with irrigation events represented by the unique shapes for
    each zone. Although the study was not designed to statistically compare VRI to
    a control, it is useful to compare to the 2019 estimated GSP. The GSP for this
    field would have had 17 irrigation events of 18 mm each for a total of 300 mm
    (Table 1). Compared to the estimated GSP, these season-long irrigation amounts
    represent 5, 21, 0.6, 21, and 14% (2–64 mm) less water for Zones 1 through 5,
    respectively, with an overall average of a 12% reduction. 4. Discussion 4.1. Zone
    Delineation Commonly employed methods of delineating VRI zones include TAW, electrical
    conductivity data, yield data, and others [14,17,28]. Utilizing a combination
    of yield and ET from historical data is a relatively simple approach that has
    not been widely considered. Widespread adoption of on-the-go yield sensors provides
    easily accessible yield information. Implementation of measuring the same number
    of spring and fall soil samples as collected in this study to estimate ET is not
    practical for growers and their agronomists, although a few samples are reasonable
    [15]. Other methods of obtaining ET at the requisite spatial density are possible
    through remote sensing estimates, modeling, or the use of ancillary variables
    to delineate zones that reflect CWP variability [25,28,43]. The method of using
    CWP (yield and ET) did not capture all the variation within the field but coupling
    the zones created from CWP while utilizing the variation of VWC and FC from soil
    sensors to make in-season irrigation management decisions did play an important
    role in the entirety of the VRI process of irrigation management. This approach
    can improve spatial precision and accuracy of irrigation—potentially improving
    the crop and conserving water. 4.2. Cumulative Irrigation Events While irrigation
    rates within the zones may have been similar to each other at the beginning of
    the season, rates changed as plants matured, weather changed, and water levels
    decreased in soil profiles (Figure 4). This showed that less water was needed
    at different times of the season, and it was assumed that potential drainage or
    runoff was avoided within the irrigation zones. In addition to the difference
    in FC values among zones, the difference in water needs across zones could be
    described by areas that are more productive than others, resulting in higher water
    needs because ET increased in productive areas. The differences could also be
    from topography changes, even if they are slight within this field, and zones
    with slopes may see a dry down sooner than those with no slopes. For example,
    Zone 3 is situated on a ridge with a slope that moves toward Zone 2 (Figure 1).
    The VWC in Zone 3 did not reach FC after the irrigation events (Figure 4), and
    although there was no visible runoff, subterranean lateral water movement within
    the soil profile toward Zone 2 could have occurred. Zone 3 also shows historically
    lower yields compared to other parts of the field, which could affect the water
    needs as the plants are not as productive in this zone as other zones. Considering
    these aspects throughout each zone could be beneficial in understanding the individual
    water needs. Utilizing a sensor-based VRI management scheme resulted in a reduction
    in the number of irrigation events and the total water applied in each zone with
    no measurable negative impacts on yield. When the field was irrigated to FC within
    each zone, total water applied was reduced. Although the zones were irrigated
    at rates greater than the estimated GSP at different times within the growing
    season, this was performed (Figure 4) to avoid bringing the plants into a state
    of crop stress where yield is negatively affected. All zones showed lower cumulative
    irrigation compared to total estimated GSP, which resulted in water savings that
    are similar to other studies [11,14]. Managing VRI with zones that address the
    natural spatial variation of soil properties, such as FC, can result in water
    savings and has been noted to be valuable [18,25]. The project results suggest
    that using sensors to carefully monitor VWC and ensuring each zone was maintained
    at FC was successful at avoiding crop stress (Figure 3). The onset of crop water
    stress did occur in 21% of field locations in 2019; however, 79% did not reach
    that level of stress until the end of the season [44]. Indeed, by using this approach,
    stress was delayed well beyond the GST, starting around Day 174 (24 July) [4].
    Although methodology for an exact sensor location is still in process [32,45],
    using irrigation zones can increase water use efficiency and delay the onset of
    crop water stress leading to higher yield and water savings [11]. 4.3. Temporal
    Differences of VWC The VWC is affected by permanent soil properties, such as soil
    texture, SWHC, FC, and WP [7,9,18]. However, Baroni et al. [46] showed that soil
    properties alone do not account for all the spatiotemporal VWC variation. Topography,
    dynamic climate factors, variation in crop growth and ET, and other factors affect
    the variation of VWC throughout a field. This suggests that irrigation decisions
    should include input beyond VWC, such as leaf area index. Research has found that
    irrigating based on sensors placed in each VRI zone has resulted in water savings
    [11]. This study showed that irrigating unique rates, which varied on average
    by 10.8 mm among watering events, according to differences in soil properties
    among zones coupled with VWC sensors were valuable resources to apply the right
    amount of water in each zone. The water savings generated by a reduced application
    by an average of 12% due to VWC values gave the cooperating grower more water
    to apply to historically underwatered areas. Further, in the past, the area just
    west of the ridgeline (mainly in Zone 2) would be overwatered under uniform irrigation.
    This was a problem, especially during a potato crop, because the excess moisture
    would cause disease in that part of the field and decrease yields. The VWC sensor
    curves did not reach FC at each irrigation event potentially due to the buffering
    effect of the lower soil profile. The deeper depths of the soil profiles still
    contained water at the beginning of the season, but as the season progressed,
    and plants continued to grow and mature, those deeper profiles depleted more water
    throughout the season. This buffering effect is evident in the different zones.
    For example, the VWC in Zone 1 increased each time irrigation was applied, but
    Zone 2 did not respond in the same manner as the VWC would continue to decrease
    with irrigation events. Only after large amounts of irrigation were applied in
    July did the VWC in Zone 2 finally increase. The reasoning for this could have
    been that the lower soil profiles were eventually filled enough for the 0.30 m
    depth to also retain water. As irrigation events were watered to only the first
    soil’s depth (0.30 m) of FC, water continued to move downward and could have been
    taken up by deeper roots. This could explain why FC was not always reached after
    irrigation events. Although it would seem beneficial to water to multiple depths
    of FC values, these rates became too high for the center pivot to water as the
    growers’ pivot had a maximum rate of 29 mm per pass. In situ sensors provide temporal
    water status at static locations but do not provide information at spatial scales
    required for developing VRI zones [11]. Installing multiple sensors per field
    is cost prohibitive and increases VRI implementation costs [11]. Utilizing sensors
    in combination with satellite imagery may be an effective strategy to reduce the
    need for multiple sensors per field. For example, Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery
    was used to estimate soil moisture throughout the growing season [44], and Landsat
    satellite imagery was used to detect spatial variability of crop water stress
    [31]. These strategies could be used to assist in making sensor placement decisions.
    Understanding the spatial variability within each zone can assist growers not
    only in making sensor placement decisions and irrigation rate decisions but also
    in delineating VRI zones as they are cost efficient and provide spatially dense
    data. 5. Conclusions Delineating five VRI zones from historic yield and ET observations
    effectively reduced irrigation requirements in the field utilized in this study.
    Irrigation was further refined by implementing in situ VWC soil moisture sensors
    to inform spatially precise irrigation rates to conserve irrigation water. Utilizing
    the natural variation in soil properties among zones incorporated with zone-specific
    VWC soil sensors is a useful irrigation management practice to maintain VWC below
    FC and above RAW values in each zone, thus saving water and protecting the crop
    from the early onset of crop water stress. Although a statistical comparison could
    not be made, these methods presented the ability to conserve water and improve
    water use efficiency. Further work is required to find more accurate ways of delineating
    zones, identifying optimal sensor placement, and measuring spatial FC values in
    a cost-effective manner. Refining VRI zone delineation and decision support systems
    will improve water usage and conserve increasingly scarce water resources. Author

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Tashkent, Uzbekistan SECTION I. Introduction
    Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) is capable of recording different parameters
    of the physical world, processing the collected data, making a decision based
    on the recorded values, and performing appropriate actions [1]. Actor is a resource
    rich entity that accounts mainly for decision making and performing appropriate
    actions in an event region. The automated architecture [1] of WSAN, where sensors
    transmit sensed value to actors instead of sink and actors take decision by inter
    actor coordination locally, resulting in energy and bandwidth savings. In addition,
    the mobility of actors facilitates the energy saving of relay nodes not laying
    in the event area and hence, enhances the network lifetime [1]. In the mobile
    automated WSAN, control actions of actors are generated for the entire event region
    and implemented simultaneously across the region. Data collection from all the
    sensors of an event region before decision making is the prerequisite for the
    accomplishment of such requirement in WSAN. For example, in military region if
    presence of enemy is the event of concern, actors should gather information about
    entire event region and perform action of destroying the enemy troop at once over
    entire region. However, mobile actors may move to a new location before completing
    collection of entire event information due to the predefined stopping time (independent
    of data collection) that in turn results in incorrect decision. Moreover, some
    part of event region may be left unattended while implementation of control actions.
    A typical example of automated WSAN is the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based
    Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) system that has attracted the researcher community
    as a solution to the efficient water management problem in recent times. In VRI,
    the irrigation demand of land is the event of concern and mobile irrigation machinery
    (sprinklers mounted on Central pivot or Linear) is the actor. Linears are responsible
    for data collection from sensors recording the soil and environmental parameters
    and generating the amount, time, and rate of irrigation called Prescription Map
    (PM). The irrigation requirement and PM may be different for different parts of
    farmland. The heterogeneity in irrigation requirements arise due to the variation
    of soil parameters in space and time. The subregion having similar irrigation
    requirement is called Management Zone (MZ) and is subject to change. Partial data
    collection by a linear may affect the PM, irrigation and finally crop growth.
    Thus, the PM generation for an MZ requires the data collection from all sensors
    laying in one MZ. According to [2] in various automated irrigation systems ([3],
    [4], [5]) WSNs are applied as coordinating technology. The decision making tools
    (computational intelligence based algorithms) are of utmost importance till date
    and the inherent issues of WSN or WSAN (energy efficient inter sensor and sensor-actor
    coordination) are not considered yet in integration of applicative scenario0s
    requirements [6]. In existing literature of WSAN, localization (range free and
    range based), topology control (sensor relocation), sink mobility (trajectory
    design, and location updates), communication (routing, QoS, and clustering), and
    actuation (actuator selection, actor-actor co-ordination, task creation, and prediction)
    are well investigated [7]. However, the challenges of event reporting, taking
    decision making into account are relatively less explored. Authors in [8] have
    proposed a Mobile Actor Routing Protocol (MARP) for data transmission in mobile
    WSAN. Actors stop at some locations for a predefined time and broadcast two control
    signals to construct cluster around it. Cluster members send data to the actor
    within its pause time at that location. Stopping point and pause time are predefined
    and independent of data collection. In Actuator Discovery Protocol (ADP) [9],
    sensors set a routing path to the closest actor in the learning phase. Sensors
    send a request message to one hop neighbor to find nearest actor and join the
    path after getting a reply from the neighbor. Thus, a path is established before
    the event. The cluster formed is independent of area of the event. A real-time
    coordination and routing protocol (RCR) [10] is proposed for sensor actor coordination
    in automated and semi automated architectures. For automated architecture, senors
    are organized into a fixed number of clusters to achieve energy efficiency. Sensors
    select actor for data transmission depending on the distance. A geographical routing
    protocol for sensor actor communication is proposed where cluster head aggregates
    event data and forwards to the nearest actor. The network is divided into virtual
    grids of equal size, and data is transferred from cluster head to actor grid by
    grid. Above mentioned mechanisms are proposed for data transmission from sensors
    to actors taking stoppage location and time as predefined or random. None of the
    works take the decision making aspect of event reporting into account, the problem
    mentioned in [1]. The paper considers event as the occurrence of an activity (enemy
    troops invasion, animal attack) or a phenomena (environmental factors crossing
    a predefined threshold), for monitoring of which WSAN is deployed. Fig. 1: Schematic
    representation of linears over farmland Show All In this paper, a sensor-actor
    coordination mechanism for data collection from an event region is proposed taking
    challenges of VRI into account. The proposed mechanism ensures event reporting
    to actor while focusing on the crucial aspects for correct decision making. Rest
    of the paper is organized as follows: Section-II describes the example scenario
    of VRI along with the research questions and assumptions. In Section-III, proposed
    methodology is explained. Section-IV discusses the simulation results obtained
    for the validation of proposed methodology and Section-V concludes the paper.
    SECTION II. Scenario description Sensors deployed in an agriculture farm for sensing
    various soil parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, etc. are shown in
    Fig. 1. Solid circles are termed as Boundary Nodes (BNs) and others are Interior
    Nodes (INs). BNs demarcate the boundary of an event region (MZ) and can be identified
    by the mechanism proposed in [11] or any of the data dependent BN detection mechanism
    mentioned in [12]. BNs are assumed to be the data aggregators of INs laying in
    respective MZs and serve as source nodes to reduce in-network traffic. Decision
    making (irrigation requirement) depends on the data collected by all BNs of an
    MZ. Depending on the position of Mobile Sink (MS) and range of control signal
    sent by it (details are in Section-III (A)) BNs can be classified into two categories.
    The BNs of an event region that are one hop away from MS current stopping location
    are termed as Near End BN (NEBN). The distant BNs that receive the control signal
    are called Far End BN (FEBN) (Fig. 1). It is assumed that BNs have boundary information
    (number of BNs and largest coordinates in each direction) of the event region
    in which they are laying. The area of a MS (linear) where it can act is termed
    as its Region of Action (ROA) (refer Fig. 3). Fig. 2: State transition diagram
    of linears Show All MS stops at the starting point of an MZ, collects data from
    BNs, generate the control actions, and move to irrigate the field. Thus, there
    are two operating states of MS namely, Stop and Collect (S&C) and Move and Irrigate
    (M&I)(refer Fig. 2). In S&C state a MS stops at locations identified in previous
    S&C round and send control signal to BNs for data collection. After collecting
    data from all BNs of an MZ, MS decides the amount of irrigation and other control
    actions and switch to M&I state. In M&I state MS moves through the MZ and irrigate.
    At the end of M&I state it stops at the BNs (that did not send data in previous
    S&C state) of a non irrigated MZ. In this scenario the following research questions
    arise: How does a BN decide whether to send data in current round or not after
    receiving control signal? When (time) would the MS change state from S&C to M&I?
    What (position) is the next stopping point for a MS? SECTION III. Methodology
    Proposed methodology finds solution for above mentioned research questions while
    determining next hop of every node for transmitting data to MS. These next hops
    will establish a path from BN to MS. A. Stop and Collect (S&C) At the start of
    S&C state MS sends two messages. First message is the control signal wake and
    is sent at maximum transmission range of MS. Second message is termed as depth
    and is sent at transmission range equal to sensor nodes. depth contains two fields
    namely, hop and energy and is used to determine the next stopping point of MS.
    If a node (BN or IN) receives depth , it increments the hop value by 1 and stores
    its remaining energy in energy. While propagation of depth, nodes may receive
    more than one message. A node stores the neighbor having remaining energy more
    than a predefined threshold as the next hop for data transmission to MS. If all
    depth contain energy greater than the threshold, the node having lower hop value
    is selected. If two or more nodes have same hop count, then node with higher energy
    value is preferred. 1) Data transmission to MS: A NEBN, (received depth having
    hop equals to 1), transmits its data and the boundary information (gathered by
    all BNs of its event region) to MS and forwards depth to its neighboring nodes.
    depth propagation is required for a situation in which a small event region lies
    inside a larger event region (as shown in Fig. 3). In this case, the NEBN of larger
    event region will provide the boundary information of its region to MS and it
    will stop at FEBN of the event region. However, MS will be unaware of the smaller
    region information and no decision will be taken for it. To avoid such situation
    depth is transmitted in a multi hop fashion. Propagation of depth is terminated
    by a FEBN and it will transmit a stop message containing its position information
    to MS via the identified next hop. The neighboring BNs belonging to another event
    region will not transmit data and wait for next S&C state of MS. For example,
    in Fig. 3 propagation of depth and stop is shown. There are three event regions
    (A, B, and C) in the area under consideration, virtual boundary (shown by dashed
    line) of which is demarcated by BNs (solid circle). MS mounted on linear transmits
    depth (solid arrow) to its one hop sensors (NEBNs) after transmitting wake. All
    NEBNs forwards depth to one hop neighbors after increasing the hop value by 1
    and storing their remaining energy in energy field. The FEBN (node 1) transmits
    stop to MS1 via the path established. In another region, FEBNs (node 2 and 3)
    transmits stop to MS2 containing their coordinates and informing the existence
    of event region C. Fig. 3: depth stop propagation from sensor Show All After receiving
    stop or expiration of Avg waiting time (calculation is described below) whichever
    is earlier, MS will transmit a control signal informing the nodes about its state
    change from S&C to M&I. 2) Avg waiting time calculation: MS waits for Avg waiting
    time (W) before changing its state from S&C to M&I if stop is not received from
    any BN. W is introduced to avoid a situation in which there is only one event
    region in the ROA of a MS. In this case, stop message may take much time in reaching
    MS from FEBN due to packet loss, link failure, etc. W is equal to the time of
    depth transmission to the farthest FEBN of event region and stop transmission
    from that BN to MS. It depends on the average one hop delay for a packet transmission
    and total number of hops travelled. W= D avg ×h (1) View Source One hop delay
    (Davg) [13] depends on waiting time in queue (Wq), average number of retransmissions
    ((1-p)/p), awake time (Taw), sleep time (Tsl), and backoff time (2(1− )/p 1/2),
    and is given by: D avg = W q + 1−p p ( T aw + T sl )+ 2 (1−p)/p −1 2 +R(0, T sl
    ) (2) View Source where, R(0, Tsl) is a random number distributed between 0 and
    Tsl for the case when the receiver is sleeping, and the sender has to wait until
    the receiver wakes up [13]. h is the average number of hops and depends on the
    route taken by the packet in travelling from MS to BN and back. A packet will
    travel minimum number of hops when it covers shortest distance between MS and
    FEBN and two hops are situated on the maximum distance (maximum distance between
    two nodes in each others range is 2r). Thus, the minimum number of hops (hmin)
    is given by: h min = dist 2r (3) View Source dist is the Euclidean distance between
    MS and the BN laying on far end of the event region (coordinates of BN are collected
    during boundary information sharing). r is the transmission range of sensor node.
    A packet will travel maximum number of hops when it will be routed through the
    boundary of the event region. Thus, hmax = Number of BN laying on the boundary
    of the event region inside the Region of Action of MS. This information is given
    by NEBN to MS, while transmitting the data and boundary information of event region.
    Hence, h is given by: h= h min + h max 2 (4) View Source If stop is not received
    till W time, MS sends a control signal to nodes to go to sleep state and switch
    its state from S&C to M&I. B. Move and Irrigate (M&I) MS changes its state from
    S&C to M&I after meeting one of the two conditions: i) It receives a stop message
    from FEBN. ii) Avg waiting time (W) is over. In M&I state MS moves and irrigates
    (acts) throughout the event region according to the control actions generated
    based upon the collected data from the region. 1) Stopping position: The stopping
    location of MS is deter-mined by the coordinates of FEBN received either by NEBN
    (via one hop transmission) or in stop message transmitted by FEBN (via multi hop
    transmission). MS stops at the FEBN of the event region in which it is acting
    upon in M&I state. These FEBNs can be the nodes as reported by the NEBNs or can
    lay before the FEBNs as reported by NEBNs (coordinates received in stop message
    in this case). For example, in Fig. 3 MS2 will stop at node 2 and 3 in next S&C
    state to collect data from the BNs of region c. Similarly, MS1 will stop near
    node 1 to collect data from BNs of region b laying in its region of action. SECTION
    IV. Simulation Results To validate the proposed methodology extensive simulation
    is performed on NS3.28. First, performance evaluation of algorithm in terms of
    energy consumption is presented. Comparative analysis with MARP [8] and ADP [9]
    in terms of energy consumption for data delivery is done afterwards. Results shown
    are the average of 100 simulation runs since variance in the result is negligible
    after these runs. A. Performance Evaluation Simulation setup for evaluation purpose
    is shown in Table I. The proposed algorithm is applied on agriculture data set
    [14] consisting of soil moisture values and coordinates of 42 sensors. Fig. 4
    shows the energy consumption of the nodes in data reporting to one mobile actor.
    BNs are identified on the basis of data dissimilarity (Euclidean distance between
    data) values of one hop neighbors as mentioned in [15]. TABLE I: Simulation setup
    depth and stop messages are of 32 and 64 bytes respectively. Packet lengths are
    set according to the frame structure specified for IEEE 802.15.4 standard as mentioned
    in [16], [17]. Since coordinates of FEBN are transmitted in stop, it is of 64
    bytes. NEBN transmits data and boundary information to MS in data packet main
    of 512 bytes. Energy consumption in transmission of depth, stop, and main packets
    are 97.6 µJ, 155.4 µJ, and 961.6 µJ respectively. Energy consumption of nodes
    in a network of 42 sensors is shown in Fig. 4 that depends on the type and number
    of packets a node is forwarding. For example, NEBNs (4, 15, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28,
    31, 35, 37, 38, 41, 42) are consuming more energy than INs or FEBNs. Since, NEBNs
    transmit main and depth packets and receive stop packet. Among these NEBNs some
    dissipates more energy than others (for example 31, 39, and 42). These NEBNs received
    the control signal and changed the state to wake. However, MS is not on one hop
    distance. These nodes changed state to sleep when depth of hop value greater than
    one is received. Energy used in channel listening and receiving depth from neighbors
    result into higher energy consumption. The INs (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 16) and the
    FEBNs (17, 20, 26, 27, 29, 30) that are not main packet transmitters consume lesser
    energy. However, the INs (7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13) that receive multiple depth packets
    (nodes having more one hop neighbors) are higher energy consumers than their counterpart
    INs. Fig. 4: Energy consumption of nodes in a network of 42 sensors Show All B.
    Comparative Analysis A comparative analysis of proposed mechanism with MARP [8]
    and ADP [9] is shown in Fig. 5, in terms of energy consumption of the network
    by varying number of nodes. Proposed mechanism performs better than both the schemes
    because of the data aggregation at BNs and transmission of data by selected nodes
    (NEBNs). MARP forms a cluster around random stopping location for a predefined
    time and collects data via multihop communication. All nodes laying in the cluster
    forward data to actor within the stopping time. Data transmission by all nodes
    and flooding of Rank Assignment message incur into high energy consumption. On
    the other hand, proposed mechanism restricts the flooding of depth message. A
    node may receive multiple depth message but forwards only one message to child
    nodes. Moreover, only NEBNs transmit data to MS via one hop. Other nodes are involved
    in control packet transmission that consumes less energy. As the number of nodes
    increases, data transmitting nodes in MARP also increase and thus the energy consumption.
    However, effect of network size is relatively less on proposed scheme since BNs
    do not increase in that proportion. ADP is a typical work according to [18], among
    the strategies where a path is built prior to event occurrence. The scheme establishes
    a path via three way handshaking of messages. This consumes considerable amount
    of energy. Nodes transmit recorded values in multihop fashion. As network size
    increases the number of hops for data transmission increases and so is the energy
    consumption of the network. Fig. 5: Comparison of energy consumption with MARP
    [8] and ADP [9] Show All Effect of entire event region data collection on decision
    making process is not taken into account by the existing works. Moreover, the
    stopping location and time are predefined and does not take into account the existence
    of event regions. In MARP, once stopping time is over actor moves to a new location
    irrespective of the amount of data collected. There may be some nodes left in
    the cluster that have not transmitted data due to packet loss or link failure.
    This can affect the decision making process for event region. For VRI, data collection
    from entire event region is the prerequisite for generating the prescription map
    and implementing the control actions (rate and amount of irrigation), as explained
    in Section-II. In such scenario, if a cluster (according to MARP) is formed and
    data is collected, it may happen that cluster does not cover entire region or
    covers more than two regions. Moreover, if a cluster of exactly one MZ (event
    region) is formed, it may happen that some nodes are not able to transmit their
    data in predefined interval. Insufficient information about event region will
    result into incorrect decisions and will finally hamper the crop growth. However,
    in the proposed mechanism stopping time of MS at a location is dependent on data
    collection. stop message and Avg waiting time ensure that MS moves after completion
    of data collection from entire event region. Coordinates of FEBN (transmitted
    in stop message) are the next stopping position for MS. NEBNs and FEBNs for current
    state are the data transmitters to MS. Thus, the paper addresses the list of issues
    identified in Section-II. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper proposes a sensor-actor
    coordination scheme incorporating the crucial issues of decision making process
    into account. Control action generation for an event region depends on the data
    reported by all sensors spotting the event. However, existing sensor-actor coordination
    schemes do not consider this aspect while data acquisition. Proposed scheme ensures
    data collection from all nodes of an event region. It takes VRI as application
    under consideration where demand of irrigation is the event. Moreover, the stopping
    location and time is a variable in proposed scheme that depends on the data acquisition.
    Proposed scheme performs better in terms of energy consumption with respect to
    recent state of the art mechanisms. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

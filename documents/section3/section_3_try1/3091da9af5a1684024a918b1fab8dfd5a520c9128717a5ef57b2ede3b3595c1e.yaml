  description: In order to realize high precision of environment parameters detection
    in irrigation applications, a sensor and sensor network (SSN) ontology based data
    fusion method is proposed. An SSN sub-ontology for soilstate monitoring is revised,
    which includes the sensing devices hierarchies and measurement properties selection
    according to the detection feature interests. As for sensor data processing, a
    tuning data method by data pool filtering and clustering is adopted, as well as
    a useful data fusion method for multi-sensor system. The testing results show
    that both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are higher after
    related filtering and clustering process, which enables a thorough monitoring
    for intelligent irrigation systems and can be extended into environment monitoring
    and control applications.

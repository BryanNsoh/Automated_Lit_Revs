    in India 1. Introduction Modern day farming demands increased production of food
    to accommodate the large global population. Towards this goal, new technologies
    and solutions (Chen et al., 2015, Misra et al., 2015, Goumopoulos et al., 2014,
    Amaral et al., 2014, Ngo et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2014,
    Qu et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2013, Riquelme et al., 2009, Garcia-Sanchez et
    al., 2011, Camilli et al., 2007) are being applied in this domain to provide an
    optimal alternative to gather and process information (Behzadan et al., 2014,
    Dhurandher et al., 2014) to enhance productivity. Moreover, the alarming climate
    change and scarcity of water (Postel, 1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000,
    Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts, 2010, Mueller et al., 2012) demand new and
    improved methods for modern agricultural fields. Consequently, the need for automation
    and intelligent decision making is becoming more important to accomplish this
    mission (ur Rehman et al., 2014, Suprem et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Hart
    and Martinez, 2006). In this regard, technologies such as ubiquitous computing
    (Burrell et al., 2004), wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks (Diallo et al., 2015,
    Srbinovska et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013, Karim et al., 2013, Zhang et al.,
    2013, Krishna et al., 2012, Zhang and Zhang, 2012, Misra et al., 2011, Mirabella
    and Brischetto, 2011, Lloret et al., 2011, Garcia et al., 2010, Bri et al., 2009,
    Lloret et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2006), Radio Frequency Identifier
    (RFID) (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011), cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Misra
    et al., 2014, Cho et al., 2012), Internet of Things (IoT) (Atzori et al., 2010,
    Gubbi et al., 2013), satellite monitoring (Moghaddam et al., 2010), remote sensing
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013), context-aware
    computing (Moghaddam et al., 2010) are becoming increasingly popular. 1.1. Motivation
    Among all these technologies, the agriculture domain is mostly explored concerning
    the application of WSNs in improving the traditional methods of farming (ur Rehman
    et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz
    et al., 2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004, Yick et al., 2008, Ruiz-Garcia et
    al., 2009). The Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has enabled
    the creation of small and cheap sensors. The ubiquitous nature of operation, together
    with self-organized small sized nodes, scalable and cost-effective technology,
    enables the WSNs as a potential tool towards the goal of automation in agriculture.
    In this regard, precision agriculture (Chen et al., 2015, Cambra et al., 2015,
    Barcelo-Ordinas et al., 2013, Baseca et al., 2013, Díaz et al., 2011, López et
    al., 2011, Park et al., 2011, Matese et al., 2009), automated irrigation scheduling
    (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Reche et al., 2015, Greenwood et al., 2010, Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010), optimization of plant growth (Hwang et
    al., 2010), farmland monitoring (Corke et al., 2010, Voulodimos et al., 2010),
    greenhouse gases monitoring (Malaver et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2013, Mao et al.,
    2012), agricultural production process management (Díaz et al., 2011, Dong et
    al., 2013), and security in crops (Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2011), are a few potential
    applications. However, WSNs have few limitations (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Yick
    et al., 2008) such as low battery power, limited computation capability and small
    memory of the sensor nodes. These limitations invite challenges in the design
    of WSN applications in agriculture. In agriculture, most of the WSN-based applications
    are targeted for various applications. For example, WSNs for environmental condition
    monitoring with information of soil nutrients is applied for predicting crop health
    and production quality over time. Irrigation scheduling is predicted with WSNs
    by monitoring the soil moisture and weather conditions. Being scalable, the performance
    of an existing WSN-based application can be improved to monitor more parameters
    by only including additional sensor nodes to the existing architecture. The issues
    present in such applications are the determination of optimal deployment strategy,
    measurement interval, energy-efficient medium access, and routing protocols. For
    example, a sparse deployment of nodes with a long data collection interval is
    helpful for enhancing the lifetime of a network. However, challenges may emerge
    from the choice of the deployment region. As an example, if the field area is
    separated by obstructions then it will lead to attenuation of signal, thereby
    affecting the inter-node communication. In the Indian scenario, the WSN-based
    farming solutions need to be of very low cost to be affordable by end users. However,
    with the increasing population, the demand of food-grain is also rising. Recent
    reports warns that the growth in food grain production is less than the growth
    in population (Shanwad et al., 2004). Also, India is one of the largest exporters
    of food grains, and thus, researchers (Shanwad et al., 2004, Mondal and Basu,
    2009) demand to boost production by incorporating advanced technologies. Consequently,
    new and modern technologies are being considered in many agricultural applications
    to achieve the target (Mondal et al., 2004). The current state of development
    in the Indian scenario comprises of technologies such as WSNs, General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS), Global Positioning System (GPS), remote sensing, and Geographical
    Information System (GIS). 1.2. Contributions In this paper, we surveyed the variants
    of WSNs and their potential for the advancement of various agricultural application
    development. We highlight the main agricultural and farming applications, and
    discuss the applicability of WSNs towards improved performance and productivity.
    We also classify the network architecture, node architecture, and communication
    technology standards used in agricultural applications. The real-world wireless
    sensor nodes and various sensors such as soil, environment, pH, and plant-health
    are also listed in this paper. In Section 5, we study and review the existing
    WSN deployments both in the global as well as the Indian scenarios. In summary,
    the contributions of this paper are listed as follows. • We study the current
    state-of-the-art in WSNs and their applicability in agricultural and farming applications.
    • The existing WSNs are analyzed with respect to communication and networking
    technologies, standards, and hardware. • We analyze the prospects and problems
    of the existing agricultural applications with detailed case studies for global
    as well as the Indian scenarios. • Finally, we present the futuristic applications
    highlighting the factors for improvements for the existing scenarios. 1.3. Paper
    organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    the basics of WSNs, its requirements, potentials and different possible application
    in the agriculture domain. Design of a wireless sensor network for agricultural
    application is discussed in Section 3. The technologies and standards used in
    agricultural applications are analyzed in Section 4. We further discuss about
    the currently existing state-of-the-art and real-world applications in Section
    5, and analyze the prospects and problems of the existing solutions. In Section
    6, we provide few future direction of work pointing out the factors for improvement.
    Finally, the paper concludes in Section 7. 2. Wireless sensor networks and its
    potential for agricultural applications In this section, we discuss two widely
    used variants of WSNs—Terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSN) and Wireless
    Underground Sensor Networks (WUSN), specifically used in agricultural applications.
    2.1. Terrestrial wireless sensor networks WSNs are a network of battery-powered
    sensors inter-connected through wireless medium and are typically deployed to
    serve a specific application purpose (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al.,
    2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the
    ground surface. The advancements in MEMS technology has enabled the creation of
    smart, small sized, although low cost sensors. These powerful sensors empower
    a sensor node or mote to accurately collect the surrounding data. Based on the
    sensed information, these nodes then network among themselves to perform the application
    requirements. For example, consider a precision agriculture environment where
    WSNs are deployed throughout the field to automate the irrigation system. All
    these sensors determine the moisture content of the soil, and further, collaboratively
    decide the time and duration of irrigation scheduling on that field. Then, using
    the same network, the decision is conveyed to the sensor node attached to a water
    pump. Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed one such automated irrigation system using
    a WSN and GPRS module. Fig. 1 depicts a typical wireless sensor network deployed
    on field for agricultural applications. The field consists of sensor nodes powered
    with application specific on-board sensors. The nodes in the on-field sensor network
    communicate among themselves using radio-frequency (RF) links of industrial, scientific
    and medical (ISM) radio bands (such as 902–928 MHz and 2.4–2.5 GHz). Typically,
    a gateway node is also deployed along with the sensor nodes to enable a connection
    between the sensor network and the outer world. Thus, the gateway node is powered
    with both RF and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or GPRS. A remote
    user can monitor the state of the field, and control the on-field sensors and
    actuator devices. For example, a user can switch on/off a pump/valve when the
    water level applied to the field reaches some predefined threshold value. Users
    carrying mobile phone can also remotely monitor and control the on-field sensors.
    The mobile user is connected via GPRS or even through Short Message Service (SMS).
    Periodic information update from the sensors, and on-demand system control for
    both type of users can also be designed. Download : Download high-res image (240KB)

    Another variant of the WSNs is its underground counterpart—Wireless Underground
    Sensor Networks (WUSNs) (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Vuran and Akyildiz, 2008).
    In this version, the wireless sensors are planted inside soil. In this setting,
    higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation, and comparatively lower frequencies
    are able to penetrate through the soil (Silva and Vuran, 2010, Yu et al., 2013).
    Thus, communication radius gets limited and the network requires higher number
    of nodes to cover a large area. The application of wired sensors increases the
    network coverage by requiring relatively smaller number of sensors. However, in
    this design, the sensors and the wires may be vulnerable to farming activities.
    A typical agricultural application based on underground sensor networks is shown
    in Fig. 2. Unlike the TWSN-based applications shown in Fig. 1, in this figure,
    the sensor nodes are buried inside soil. One gateway node is also deployed to
    transmit the information collected by the underground sensor nodes to the surface
    sink placed over the ground. Thereafter, the information can be transmitted over
    the Internet to store in remote databases, and can be used for notifying a cell
    phone carrying user. However, due to comparatively shorter communication distance,
    more number of nodes are required to be deployed for use in WUSNs. Download :

    2.3. Differences between TWSNs and WUSNs We highlight the specific differences
    between the TWSNs and WUSNs in Table 1. Table 1. Differences between terrestrial
    and underground WSNs. Feature TWSNs WUSNs Deployment Placed over ground Buried
    under-ground Depth Anywhere over ground Topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (>30 cm)a
    Communication range ≈100 m ≈0.1–10 m Communication frequency Higher (868/915 MHz,
    2.4 GHz) Lower (433 MHz, 8–300 kHz) Antenna size Smaller Larger Energy consumption
    Lower Higher Cost Lower Higher a References Martinez et al., 2004, Vuran and Silva,
    2009 reported a glacier monitoring network where underground communications over
    30 m distance were possible. Further, using higher transmission power, 80 m distance
    under ice were also covered. 2.4. Usefulness of WSNs In the following, we highlight
    the salient features of WSNs that have enabled themselves as a potential tool
    for automation in the agricultural domain. (i) Intelligent decision making capability:
    WSNs are multi-hop in nature (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al., 2002b,
    Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In a large area, this feature enhances the energy-efficiency
    of the overall network, and hence, the network lifetime increases. Using this
    feature, multiple sensor nodes collaborate among themselves, and collectively
    take the final decision (Kulkarni et al., 2011, Bhattacharjee et al., 2012, Wu
    et al., 2012, Yao et al., 2013). (ii) Dynamic topology configuration: To conserve
    the in-node battery power, a sensor node keeps itself in the ‘sleep mode’ most
    of the time. Using topology management techniques (Ren and Meng, 2009, Chu and
    Sethu, 2012, Li et al., 2013), the sensor nodes can collaboratively take these
    decisions. To maximize the network lifetime, the network topology is configured
    such that the minimum number of nodes remain in the active mode. (iii) Fault-tolerance:
    One common challenge in deploying the WSNs is that the sensor nodes are fault-prone
    (Younis et al., 2014). Under such circumstances, unplanned deployment of nodes
    may lead to network partitioning, and in turn, the overall performance of the
    network is affected. However, in countermeasure, the sensor nodes can ‘self-organize’
    by dynamically configuring the network topology (Misra et al., 2011). (iv) Context-awareness:
    Based on the sensed information about the physical and environmental parameters,
    the sensor nodes gain knowledge about the surrounding context. The decisions that
    the sensor nodes take thereafter are context-aware (Vijay et al., 2011). (v) Scalability:
    Generally, the WSN protocols are designed to be implemented in any network irrespective
    of its size and node count. This feature undoubtedly widens the potential of WSNs
    for numerous applications. (vi) Node heterogeneity: WSNs are often assumed to
    be comprised of homogeneous sensor attached devices (Misra et al., 2015, Li and
    Hou, 2005, Ren and Meng, 2009). However, in many realistic scenarios, the devices
    are heterogeneous in respect of processing and computation power, memory, sensing
    capability, transceiver unit, and movement capability. (vii) Tolerance against
    communication failures in harsh environmental conditions: Due to the wide range
    of applications in open agricultural environments, WSNs suffer the effects of
    harsh environmental conditions (Misra et al., 2014). The WSN protocol stack includes
    techniques to withstand the effect of communication failures in the network arising
    due to environmental effects. (viii) Autonomous operating mode: An important feature
    of WSNs is their autonomous operating mode (Misra and Jain, 2011) and adaptiveness
    (Nicopolitidis et al., 2011). In agricultural applications, this feature certainly
    plays an important role, and enables an easy as well as advanced mode of operation.
    (ix) Information security: The WSNs carry raw information about on-field parameters.
    To ensure the security of sensed information, WSNs provides access control mechanisms
    (Misra and Vaish, 2011) and anomaly detection (Karapistoli et al., 2013) to restrict
    unauthenticated users. 2.5. Potential applications We list the possible agricultural
    and farming applications which can be implemented using WSNs. • Irrigation management
    system: Modern day agriculture requires an improved irrigation management system
    to optimize the water usage in farming (Adamala et al., 2014, Greenwood et al.,
    2010). The alarming reduction of ground water level is another motivation for
    the requirement of an advanced system. In this context, micro-irrigation techniques
    are cost-effective and water-usage efficient (Raina et al., 1998, Westarp et al.,
    2004). However, micro-irrigation efficiency can be further improved based on the
    environmental and soil information. In this regard, WSNs are applied as the coordinating
    technology (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Lorite et al., 2013,
    Moghaddam et al., 2010). • Farming systems monitoring: Currently, various improved
    systems and devices are used in farming. In this regard, an improved system to
    manage these devices eases the overall operation, and enable automation in faming
    (Kim et al., 2014). Also, such remote monitoring systems help towards enabling
    improved management in large agricultural fields. Further, with the input of additional
    information such as satellite images and weather forecasts, the system performance
    can be improved. • Pest and disease control: Controlled usage of pesticides and
    fertilizers helps increasing the crop quality as well as minimizing the farming
    cost. However, for controlling the usage of pesticides, we need to monitor the
    probability and occurrence of pests in crops. To predict this, we also need the
    surrounding climate information (Matese et al., 2009, Bhave et al., 2013) such
    as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A WSN can autonomously monitor and predict
    these events over a field of interest (Bhargava et al., 2014). • Controlled use
    of fertilizers: Plant growth and crop quality directly depend on the use of fertilizers.
    However, optimal supply of fertilizers to proper places in fields is a challenging
    task. The use of fertilizers for farming may be controlled by monitoring the variation
    in soil nutritions such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), and pH.
    Consequently, soil nutrition balance may also be achieved, and hence, crop production
    quality is also maintained. Gonçalves et al. (2015) studied the effectiveness
    of mobile nodes to improve agricultural productivity in a smart system with Precision
    Sprays. • Cattle movement monitoring: A herd of cattle grazing a field can be
    monitored using WSN technology or Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) (Voulodimos
    et al., 2010, Kwong et al., 2012). Thus, real-time monitoring of any cattle is
    also achieved. This technology can be implemented further to monitor whether any
    cattle is moving near the vegetation fields or not. • Ground water quality monitoring:
    The increased use of fertilizers and pesticides lead to decrease in the quality
    of ground water. Placing sensor nodes empowered with wireless communication help
    in monitoring the water quality (Lin et al., 2008, Zia et al., 2013). • Greenhouse
    gases monitoring: Greenhouse gases and agriculture are closely related to each
    other. Greenhouse gases are responsible for increasing the climate temperature,
    and thus, has direct impact on agriculture. On the other hand, greenhouse gas
    emission comes from various agricultural sources. Malaver et al. (2015) presents
    the development of a system of solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and
    WSN to monitor greenhouse gases – CH4 and CO2. • Asset tracking: Wireless technology
    enabled farming equipments attract the possibility of remote tracking (Misra and
    Singh, 2012) of these assets. A farmer can track the position of the farming vehicles
    and irrigation systems from his home. • Remote control and diagnosis: With the
    advent of internet of things, remote control and diagnosis of farm equipments
    such as pumps, lights, heaters, valves in machinery are also possible (Fukatsu
    et al., 2011, Coates et al., 2013). 3. Design of a wireless sensor network for
    agricultural applications 3.1. Network architecture for agriculture applications
    In this section, we discuss the network architecture considered in various agricultural
    applications. We classify the architectures in various categories and highlight
    the potential agricultural applications suitable for each one. Fig. 3 provides
    a visual depiction of the architectures classified with respect to different parameters.

    Fig. 3. Classification of network architectures with respect to different parameters.
    Based on the movement of the networked devices and nodes, we classify the existing
    architectures in the following categories: • Stationary architecture: In the stationary
    architecture, the sensor nodes are deployed at a fixed position, and during the
    application duration, they do not change their position. Typically, applications
    such as irrigation management system, ground water quality monitoring, and controlling
    the use of fertilizers require stationary architectures. In such applications
    with TWSNs, the data logger (data collector) sensor nodes are typically placed
    over the field. However, in WUSNs, the data collector sensor nodes are placed
    under-ground. Also, as shown in Fig. 2, aggregator nodes may be placed under-ground
    to collect all the data of the underground sensors and communicate with the outside
    TWSNs. • Mobile architecture: Mobile architectures comprise of devices which change
    their position with time. An example of applications based on such architecture
    will be an autonomous network of tractors and cell phone carrying farmers serving
    the purpose of ubiquitous farming operations. • Hybrid architecture: In the hybrid
    architecture, both stationary and mobile nodes are present. For example, this
    type of architecture is applicable to farming applications consisting of stationary
    field sensors, mobile farming equipments, cell phones carrying users, and moving
    cattle. Based on the types of sensor nodes and associated devices, the existing
    architecture used in agriculture are classified as follows: • Homogeneous architecture:
    As the name suggests, homogeneous architecture comprises of sensor equipped devices
    of similar potential. This type of framework is typically used in applications
    based on the unplanned deployments. In such circumstances, the network is deployed
    mainly for in situ monitoring of the desired agricultural parameters. However,
    this type of architecture lacks variety in terms of communication hardware. Consequently,
    the schemes and communication protocols are designed keeping this limitation in
    mind. One example application of this type of architecture is agricultural data
    collection application on the use of pesticides and changing quantity of soil
    nutrients. • Heterogeneous architecture: In this type of architecture, various
    types of sensor nodes, and devices are present. These devices vary in terms of
    computation power, memory, sensing capability, and transceiver units. For example,
    in any irrigation management application, the on-field sensor nodes communicate
    their sensed information to a master or sink node, which again transfer the information
    to remote user. In this case, the sink node is capable of communicating in multiple
    modes—RF and GSM. Another possible application may be the farming systems monitoring
    and agricultural asset tracking. In this application, multiple heterogeneous devices
    are included with on-field sensors. The application model shown in Fig. 1 depicts
    a heterogeneous architecture. In Fig. 1, the field sensor and gateway nodes are
    of different configurations. The architectures are classified into various categories
    based on the hierarchy. • Single-tier architecture: This type of architecture
    is most common among the agricultural applications, specifically small-scale ones.
    In this type of architecture, the on-field devices and sensor nodes directly communicate
    their data to a sink node placed near the application area. This type of architecture
    is also referred to as the single clustered architecture. • Multi-tier architecture:
    In a multi-tier architecture, there are multiple levels in the overall application
    hierarchy. The on-field sensor nodes remain in the lower level of hierarchy, and
    form the basic clusters. Thereafter, the next levels of hierarchy include multiple
    clusters to reach the gateway nodes. Typically, multi-tier architectures consist
    of heterogeneous nodes. Fig. 4 shows a multi-tier architecture with three levels
    of gateways. The basic unit of the network is formed by a cluster comprised of
    sensor nodes and a cluster head, referred to as the 3rd tier gateway in the figure.
    These gateways again form a cluster with the 2nd tier gateways as the cluster
    head, and thus, the hierarchy is followed iteratively until the remote sink is
    reached. Download : Download high-res image (271KB) Download : Download full-size

    of sensor nodes 3.2.1. Embedded multi-chip sensor nodes The components of a typical
    multi-chip sensor node are shown in Fig. 5(a). Typically, a sensor node consists
    of an application-specific sensor array with a transceiver unit for communication.
    A processor or micro-controller unit is used as the “brain” of the node. Optionally,
    a sensor board includes memory units to store data. Depending on the application
    demand, the architecture of the sensor nodes varies to meet the demands. For example,
    the processing power and on-board memory size are increased to meet the requirements
    of more intense or intelligent processing. Download : Download high-res image

    technology is System-in-Package (SiP), which is defined as any combination of
    multiple chips including passive components (such as resistors and capacitors)
    mounted together keeping provision to attach external components later. SiP reduces
    the product cost with optimized size and performance. Thus, the SiP technology
    has potential for applications in agricultural scenarios. SiP based agricultural
    systems can be applied in different applications simply by attaching different
    sensors with the main package. In the following, we discuss the associated factors
    in the selection of the components of a sensor node as per the requirement of
    agricultural applications. • Processor: The computation power of the sensor node
    solely depends on the choice of the processing unit. A micro-controller provides
    few advantages such as low cost, flexibility to communicate with other nodes,
    ease of programming, and low power consumption over the traditional processors.
    Mostly, these micro-controllers work on 3.5–5 V. However, power consumption is
    one of the most important factors in sensor nodes. Considering this fact, micro-controllers
    are preferred over general purpose processors. • Transceiver: Transmission and
    reception are the two major reasons of energy consumption in sensor nodes. In
    agricultural applications, the network planner chooses the deployment to ensure
    optimal power consumption of the sensor nodes. • Memory: The sensor nodes have
    two types of on-board memory—memory associated with processor and external memory.
    Depending on the application requirement, sensor nodes need to store historical
    data for intelligent decision making. In this regard, flash memories are used
    for additional storage. • Power: It is also an important factor for selecting
    the sensor nodes, as the battery power of the sensor nodes is limited. In many
    agricultural applications, the nodes possess alternate energy sources such as
    solar power. However, solar power is available during the day time only, and at
    other times, the nodes rely on battery power. Also, frequent change of battery
    increases the cost of maintenance. Thus, we need energy-efficient algorithms such
    that the energy consumption of the sensor nodes are reduced. • Cost: One very
    important selection factor of the sensor nodes is the total hardware cost. A low
    cost application design is always preferred for any application level, and consequently,
    it is the most important issue in terms of applications targeting the low and
    middle income country (LMIC) markets. 3.2.2. System on Chip (SoC) sensor nodes
    The System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, on the other hand, follows more application
    specific design targeting minimization of the power requirements and design cost.
    SoC provides an integration of multiple programmable processor cores, co-processors,
    hardware accelerators, memory units, input/output units, and custom blocks. Fig.
    5(b) shows the components of a typical SoC based sensor node. The envisioned applications
    for SoC is mainly in designing Network on Chips (NoCs) (Koch et al., 2006), systems
    for multimedia and streaming applications (Karim et al., 2003) which are computationally
    intensive. Currently, in agricultural applications, the use of SoCs are very rare.
    However, the advent of SoC has a lot of potential for the agriculture and farming
    domain. Firstly, the use of SoCs based sensor nodes instead of current day embedded
    multi-chip sensor nodes will increase the computation power, and decrease the
    energy-consumption. Also, the size of the nodes will be less and thereby, portability
    of the overall system increases. Compared to multiple silicon dies in SiP, SoC
    is single die based, and thus, SoCs result in lesser size, but, higher cost. Table
    2 briefly lists the differences between the embedded multi-chip nodes and SoCs.

    we discuss the details of the wireless communication technologies, and the standards
    used in various agricultural applications. Also, we study the different wireless
    sensor nodes available in the market for use in these applications. 4.1. Wireless
    communication • ZigBee: (ZigBee Specifications,, Baronti et al., 2007, Guo et
    al., 2012); technology defines the network and application layer protocols based
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006)
    physical and MAC layer definitions required for designing a wireless personal
    area network (WPAN) using low power radio-enabled devices. Being energy-efficient,
    low cost, and reliable, the ZigBee technology is preferred for WSN-based applications
    in the agricultural and farming domains. ZigBee also supports short-distance (10–20
    m) data communication over multi-tier, decentralized, ad-hoc and mesh networks.
    The ZigBee-enabled devices have a low-duty cycle, and thus, are suitable for agricultural
    applications such as irrigation management, pesticide and fertilizer control,
    water quality management, where periodic information update is required. However,
    ZigBee applications yield low data rates of only 20–40 kbps and 250 kbps at 868/915
    MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies of ISM band, respectively. Typically, this standard
    requires low specification hardware (such as microprocessor with 50–60 kb memory)
    and includes security encryption techniques. • WiFi: WiFi is a wireless local
    area network (WLAN) standard for information exchange or connecting to the Internet
    wirelessly based on the IEEE 802.11 standards family (IEEE 802.11, 802.11a/b/g/n)
    (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2005, IEEE Standard for Information
    technology, 2012a). Currently, it is the most widely used wireless technology
    found in devices ranging from smart phones and tablets to desktops and laptops.
    WiFi provides a decent communication range in the order of 20 m (indoor) to 100
    m (outdoor) with data transmission rate in the order of 2–54 Mbps at 2.4 GHz frequency
    of ISM band. In agricultural applications, WiFi broadens the use of heterogeneous
    architectures connecting multiple type of devices over an ad-hoc network. • Bluetooth:
    Bluetooth (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2012b, Bluetooth Technology
    Special Interest Group,), which is based on the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, is a low
    power, low cost wireless technology used for communication between portable devices
    and desktops over a short range (8–10 m). The Bluetooth standard defines a personal
    area network (PAN) communication using the 2.4 GHz frequency of the ISM band.
    The data rate achieved in various versions of the Bluetooth ranges from 1 to 24
    Mbps. The advantages of this technology are its ubiquitous nature, and therefore,
    it is suitable for use in multi-tier agricultural applications. The ultra low
    power, low cost version of this standard is named as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    (Xhafa and Ho, 2013, Xhafa and Ho, 2015, Linde and Tucker, 2013), which was initially
    introduced by Nokia in 2006 as Wibree (Nokia, 2006). However, in 2010, BLE was
    merged with main Bluetooth standard version 4.0. BLE also uses the 2.4 GHz ISM
    frequency band with adaptive frequency hopping to reduce interference. Also, BLE
    includes 24 bit CRC and AES 128 bit encryption technique on all packets to guarantee
    robustness and authentication. BLE topology supports one-to-one as well as one-to-many
    connections between devices. • GPRS/3G/4G: GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
    is a packet data service for GSM based cellular phones. A data rate of 50–100
    kbps is achieved in the 2G systems. However, in GPRS, throughput and delay are
    variable, and they depend on the number of other users sharing the same resource.
    Although the biggest advantage that GPRS brings is in relieving the range limitation
    of wireless devices. Any two devices can communicate provided they both are in
    the GSM service area. However, it is better suited for the periodic monitoring
    applications than to the real-time tracking-type applications. The advanced version
    of GPRS is Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), which offers increased
    data rate with no hardware/software changes in the GSM core networks. 3G (Goodman
    and Myers, 2005) and 4G (Parkvall et al., 2008) are the third and fourth generations
    of mobile communication technology. The corresponding data transfer rate achieved
    in these technologies are 200 kbps and 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps in 3G and 4G, respectively.
    • WiMAX: WiMAX is the acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access,
    a wireless communication standard referring to the inter-operable implementations
    of the IEEE 802.16 standards (IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks,
    2011) family. WiMAX is targeted to achieve 0.4–1 Gbps data rate on fixed stations,
    and the maximum transmission range using this technology is 50 km. The Mobile
    WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e standard) provides data rates in the order of 50–100 Mbps.
    Also, WiMAX is stated to be energy-efficient over the pre-4G Long-Term Evaluation
    (LTE) and Evolved High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) (Deruyck et al., 2010, Louta
    et al., 2014). The long range support together with high speed communication features
    place WiMAX as the best suitable technology for agricultural applications involving
    asset monitoring such as farming system monitoring, crop-area border monitoring,
    and real-time diagnostics such as remote controlling of water pumps, lights, gates,
    remote diagnosis of farming systems. In Table 3, we compare the different communication
    technologies with respect to various parameters. We also mention the suitable
    agricultural applications of each technology. Table 3. Comparison of different
    communication technologies. Parameter ZigBee WiFi Bluetooth GPRS/3G/4G WiMAX Standard

    sensor platforms for use in the agricultural domain (ur Rehman et al., 2014).
    In Table 4, we analyze the existing wireless sensor nodes by classifying them
    according to different features and parameters. Table 4. Comparison of the existing

    the various application specific sensors which empower the wireless sensing platforms.
    For better classification, we divide these sensors in three main categories—soil,
    environment, and plant related. 4.3.1. Soil related In Table 5, we compare the
    sensors along with different soil-related measurement parameters—suitable for
    different potential agricultural applications. Table 5. Comparison of different

    soil and plant sensors in various agricultural applications. Such kind of heterogeneous
    placement ensures intelligent and improved decision making. Table 6 lists the
    sensors specific to the measurement of environmental parameters. Table 6. Comparison

    Plant related The sensors deployed or attached to a plant are also an integral
    part of modern farming applications. The potential applications include controlled
    use of fertilizer, crop quality monitoring, pest control, and cattle movement
    monitoring. The plant related agricultural sensors are listed in Table 7. Table

    real-world applications In Section 5.1, we discuss the different categories of
    agricultural applications in detail, and also, bring on the real-world counterpart
    of the same application deployment as a case study. These applications are designed
    with both the TWSNs and the WUSNs. Also, we mention the developments in the Indian
    scenarios in Section 5.2. Although, the number of such developments is very small
    compared to the global scenario. In Section 5.3, we analyze the challenges, problems,
    and prospects of the existing solutions both in the global as well as the Indian
    scenarios. 5.1. Global scenario 5.1.1. Irrigation management The recent years
    have witnessed an upsurge in the deployment of WSNs, specifically in the irrigation
    management applications (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2011, Kim et al.,
    2009, Kim et al., 2008, Moghaddam et al., 2010, Erdem et al., 2010, Kim and Evans,
    2009, Pierce and Elliott, 2008, Vellidis et al., 2008, Nemali and Iersel, 2006).
    This is mainly because of the importance of water in crop production (Postel,
    1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000, Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts,
    2010, Mueller et al., 2012). In the following, we survey two such deployments
    as case studies. Case Study—San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico:
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) described the development and deployment of an automated
    irrigation system comprising of a distributed WSN, a gateway, and remote server.
    The project was dedicated to implement a WSN system capable of reducing water
    use. The WSN consists of soil moisture and temperature sensors buried in ground
    for taking measurement in different depths. The gateway node has on-board facilities
    supporting both ZigBee (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006, Baronti
    et al., 2007, Guo et al., 2012) and GPRS communications. It is also empowered
    with intelligent decision making such as automated irrigation activation based
    on soil moisture and temperature values exceeding a certain predefined threshold
    value. The remote server is used for storing all the information, and displaying
    the information in a graphical user interface (GUI). The advantage of this application
    design is its real-time data analysis feature. The system components are explained
    in the following: • Wireless Sensor Units (WSUs): Each WSU, deployed on-field,
    has four different type of components—application specific sensors, processing
    unit, radio transceiver, and battery power. Table 8 lists the details of each
    of the components (sensors and actuator devices) used in reference (Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014). For energy saving, the micro-controller often remains in the sleep
    mode. A solar panel is attached with each of the WSUs to recharge their batteries.

    • Wireless Information Unit (WIU): The WIU acts as the master node, and collects
    information from the WSUs using the ZigBee technology. All the information received
    about soil moisture and temperature are compared with a predefined threshold values,
    and consequently, the pumps are activated for an estimated period. The received
    information and irrigation related data are saved in the attached solid state
    memory, and are transmitted to the remote server via GPRS using the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The pumps are driven by two electronic relays of 40-A,
    12 V DC. The WIU can be commanded to changed the irrigation scheduling from the
    remote server, and is also equipped with a button to perform manual irrigation.
    Four different irrigation actions (IAs) are considered—manual irrigation, predefined
    irrigation, and automated irrigation with soil moisture of at least one sensor
    dropping below threshold, and automated irrigation with soil temperature of at
    least one sensor exceeding past the threshold. • Remote web server: The server
    shows a specific GUI, which visualizes the data from each WSU, total water consumption,
    and IA type. The web application also enables the user with direct programming
    facility of the scheduled irrigation schemes, and changing the threshold values
    based on the crop type and season. Case Study—Smart Sensor Web: The Smart Sensor
    Web (SSW) system proposed by Moghaddam et al. (2010) introduces a new technology
    for smart sensor web system measuring the surface-to-depth soil moisture profile
    of on-field sensors. The University of Michigan Matthaei Botanical Gardens in
    Ann Arbor, Michigan was chosen as the deployment region of the on-field sensors.
    The in situ sensors were deployed to model the spatio-temporal variations in soil
    moisture serving the future goal of enabling satellite observation of soil moisture.
    To minimize the overall cost and energy conservation, the authors plan to sparsely
    sample the sensor data. The Sensor Web, is guided by the intelligence of a control
    system envisioned to determine an optimal sensor selection strategy to decide
    sensor configurations over time, and an estimation strategy based on the information
    of 3-dimensional soil moisture values. The problem of finding an optimal strategy
    and estimating a parameter are modelled using Partially Observed Markov Decision
    Process (POMDP) (Lovejoy, 1991). In a real deployment, multiple actuator nodes
    are placed with multiple sensors placed at different depths. One central coordinator
    node is deployed to schedule the data transmission events of the actuators. Upon
    receiving the readings from the in situ actuators, the central coordinator estimates
    the spatial variation of soil moisture. Then, the coordinator decides the time
    schedule of future measurements. In this manner, the coordinator node leverages
    the spatio-temporal correlation of soil moisture, and optimally estimates with
    reduced number of measurements. The system description is presented in the following.
    • Ripple 1 system: The on-field sensor nodes, deployed at fixed locations, are
    equipped with 3–5 soil moisture probes. Communication between the nodes is done
    using the ZigBee technology built on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The nodes are
    classified into three categories—coordinator, router, and end devices. The specific
    node level parameters and sensors are listed in Table 9. The sensor nodes are
    powered with on-board batteries, and solar panels are also installed to recharge
    them. The coordinate node is attached to the base station computer. Table 9. Deployment

    The 3G network card is installed on the base station. The server saves all the
    information, and any home/mobile user is able to visualize the information in
    real-time, thereby integrating the whole system from the in situ sensors to the
    remote user. Case Study—Alfalfa Crop Irrigation Cut-off System: Saha et al. (2011)
    presented a automatic irrigation cut-off system targeted for eliminating tail
    water drainage in alfalfa crop. The work is based on Yolo silt loam soil on the
    UC Davis campus, California, USA, where alfalfa is the largest water consuming
    crop. Earlier, the flood-irrigation method was used for this crop. However, the
    water runoff reduces the efficiency of this method. Motivated by this problem,
    Saha et al. designed a wireless sensor based system which provides the irrigation
    information from the tail-end of the field. The realization of the system is done
    by applying a water advance model to the field deployment of wetting-front sensors
    couple with cellular communication. The irrigator farmer receives a SMS notifying
    the time to shutdown the irrigation system. Fig. 6 depicts the application scenario
    showing the deployment. In the deployment area, 4 out of 48 alfalfa checks are
    selected for the experiment. Each check is of dimensions 220 m × 15 m with a slope
    of 0.01%. Wetting-front sensing system was placed at the tail-end of the field.

    in alfalfa crop (Saha et al., 2011). The system is very useful for a large-scale
    field with vast area for irrigation. Case Study—AMI Turf Irrigation System (Aqua
    Management): This turf irrigation controller system designed by Aqua Management,
    Inc. is targeted for the turf irrigation industry to solve the problem of providing
    efficient water management solutions at an affordable price. It is a cloud-based
    control system, which considers various on-field parameters such as Evapotranspiration
    (ET), weather condition, water flow and leak. The application control can be accessed
    from any computer, tablet, or smartphone. The features of this system are cataloged
    in Table 10. The automated decision making framework relies on the following components
    – local weather value, local ET values from public/private systems, and soil moisture
    sensors. Alternatively, the AMI data logger (AMI LoggerTM) can also be used to
    automate irrigation. The AMI Q collects all data from the on-field sensors and
    flow meters, and upload the information to the cloud. Table 10. Features: AMI

    Dynamic adjustments ET and real-time weather based Flow management Available Fault
    detection Can detect leak Alert notification Automatic Reaction to faults due
    to leak and weather related events Automatic shut down Overall, irrigation management
    is based on the actual volume of water, rather than time. Based on the weather
    condition, irrigation can be stopped or started. The water management facility
    includes reporting of various analytics such as water budgeting on a daily, weekly,
    monthly, or annual basis. 5.1.2. Vineyard monitoring Applying pervasive and mobile
    computing technologies in vineyard monitoring to increase the quality of production
    and reduce the production cost and the effect of crop related diseases. We review
    one of the existing works (Burrell et al., 2004) as a case study. Case Study—Vineyard
    Production Monitoring (Díaz et al., 2011): Díaz et al. (2011) presented a design
    of a precision agricultural system for vineyard production monitoring. The deployment
    of WSNs help in estimate the variability in agricultural parameters throughout
    the field. Initially, in the first phase, the authors divide the subject terrain
    into few different zones (zone A, B, C) based on geographic, weather, and soil
    maps. In the network planning phase, the most suitable architecture is chosen
    based on the application requirement. The subject area dimension was 600 m × 450
    m, and different sensors were placed in different zones. For example, the authors
    assumed that zone C has temperature, humidity, soil moisture, luminosity, and
    pH level sensors deployed. In zones A and B, the environmental temperature, humidity
    and temperature, and luminosity sensors were deployed, respectively. The sensor
    nodes are assumed to have an transmission range of 75–100 m. The nodes in different
    zones form a virtual tree structure among themselves, and the sensed information
    reaches the gateway following a multi-hop path. The detailed deployment parameters
    are presented in Table 11. Table 11. Deployment parameters: Díaz et al. (2011).

    in the design—sensor, actuator, redundant nodes, and a gateway. The sensors can
    only collect data samples, and information is routed to gateway. The actuator
    nodes have provision for driving irrigation systems. The actuators can also respond
    to the given commands about scheduling irrigation. The redundant nodes, as the
    name suggests, help in information routing, and imitate the functionalities of
    faulty nodes. The gateway acts as the bridge between the in situ network and the
    base station. Information routing is done to select the best neighbor node. The
    routing scheme can also be executed in an energy conserving manner, and in such
    a condition, the diagonally placed nodes are not selected for the next hop. 5.1.3.
    Precision farming Precision farming is targeted to generate greater productivity
    with reduced costs. Wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks are utilized in precision
    farming to gather field data which can then be analyzed to find the best farming
    conditions. Case Study—Video Sensing in Precision Agriculture (Cambra et al.,
    2015): Cambra et al. proposed video sensing for controlling fertilizer use in
    agricultural field. Their work is motivated by the objective of maintaining energy-efficiency
    with reduction of fertilizers in productions as defined Common Agricultural Policy
    (CAP) 2014/2020.1 In this work, the AR drones are utilized to capture the video
    of the field. Based on the video input, a system identifies and geopositions the
    weeds present in the field. Finally, the fertilizer sprayer system is actuated
    based on the processed localized information of weeds in fields. In Fig. 7, we
    depict the system overview showing the interaction between the AR drones, the
    central system, and the fertilizer sprays. The AR drones maps the field area in
    2D/3D drag and drop waypoint maps. Here, the monitored field area was 17 m by
    15 m. These drones form ad-hoc network among themselves and the central system.
    In this work, Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is applied to route
    the information from the field drones to the central system in real-time. Also,
    the drones and other devices are attached with on-board GPS, which enables updating
    the flight map and calculating the distance between the devices. Download : Download

    frames received from the flying drones are processed and geo-referenced in the
    central system. OpenCV2 based platform is used to recognize the weeds in the field.
    In the image processing framework, the authors consider Multilayer Perceptron
    learning algorithm (Bradski and Kaehler, 2008) with the green and brown color
    lines which are seen in maize crops. Finally, the locations of the weeds in the
    field are transmitted to the fertilizer sprayers, which precisely apply fertilizers
    to the weeds. Thus, using this framework, the overall production efficiency enhances
    while keeping the fertilizer use at lower levels. 5.2. Indian scenario 5.2.1.
    Water management Case Study—Project COMMON-Sense Net (Project Common Sense Net
    2.0,, Panchard et al., 2007): The COMMON-Sense Net project was a collaboration
    project with partners EPFL, Zurich (http://www.epfl.ch/) and the Centre for Electronic
    Design and Technology (CEDT) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) (http://www.cedt.iisc.ernet.in/).
    The goal of this project was to develop emerging technologies suitable for developing
    countries. The region of interest was chosen at Chennakeshavapura (CKPura) in
    the Tumkur district, Karnataka, India. To focus on the specific problems of the
    chosen region, the targeted goal was to predict and mitigate the effect of adverse
    environmental changes (Panchard, 2008). The actual deployment consists of 9 on-field
    and 3 backward nodes measuring soil moisture at two different depths of 150 cm
    and 30 cm. These nodes transmit their data to the base station every 15 min. The
    base station then transmits the data to the remote server over a GPRS link. In
    addition to soil moisture, environmental data such as ambient temperature and
    relative humidity, were also collected. The design of a water management system
    for deficit irrigation includes the following (Panchard et al., 2006, Prabhakar
    et al., 2007): • Calibration: First, the soil moisture probes are calibrated using
    the standard gravimetric method (Reynolds, 1970, Schmugge et al., 1980, Dobriyal
    et al., 2012, Lekshmi et al., 2014). In the next normal mode, calibration is continued
    using a feedback loop based on the difference in measured and predicted values.
    • Alert: Nodes are programmed to issue an alert whenever soil moisture reaches
    a certain value. The sensed data and historical climate data, together, help in
    predicting the change of rain in future. • Soil moisture prediction: Real-time
    prediction of soil moisture is done using a learning method over the predicted
    and measured data. • Water requirements assessment: The system is also able to
    estimate the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    The design parameters related to the COMMON-Sense Net project are listed in Table

    at IIT Kharagpur, India: Recently, IIT Kharapur started working on development
    of low-cost irrigation management system targeted for India. The lab-scale deployment
    of sensor network was carried out inside IIT Kharagpur campus, a place in the
    Kangsabati basin. In this project, four Ko Pro wireless sensor nodes were deployed
    over an area of 1440 m2. Fig. 8 shows the real deployment in the lab-scale facility.
    Each on-field node embeds four EC-5 soil moisture sensors. In addition to the
    on-field nodes, another gateway node was placed in the vicinity of the field to
    receive all the on-field soil moisture data at an interval of 15 min. The gateway
    node is programmed to run Crossbow’s XServe network management operations, and
    provides web services for remote viewing of data and network health. The gateway
    node also estimates the irrigation requirement of the field, and sends a SMS to
    the farmer informing this. The system has provision to control the number and
    recipient of SMS. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download : Download

    nodes in IIT Kharagpur lab facility. The different procedural components are described
    below. • Calibration: The soil moisture sensors are first calibrated using the
    standard gravimetric method. • Irrigation requirements assessment: The on-field
    system calculates the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    This estimation also depends on the duration between the last SMS update and current
    time. • Update to farmer: Nodes are programmed to send SMS to the farmers with
    preprogrammed time and recipient phone number. The design parameters are listed

    Case Study—Vineyards Precision Farming: One of the widely cultivated crops in
    India is the grapes. Precision farming is applied in this field to reduce the
    production cost and reach a high turnover. Also, the use of precision farming
    is justified by the economic value of grapes. Precision farming in vineyards has
    to deal with three main issues—optimal water use, disease prediction, and controlled
    use of pesticides. In this regard, the soil and environment related parameters
    such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, leaf wetness, relative humidity are
    most important parameters for measurement. Soil moisture is the controlling factor
    for the crop production, size and quality of grapes. The quality of grapes and
    the wine produced from them depend on their size. The area of deployment, i.e.,
    the Sula vineyards, Nashik, India, is limited in terms of water resources. Another
    problem in grapes is the use of pesticides to control diseases such as Downey
    mildew, Powdery mildew, Anthracnose (NRCG, 2007). Consequently, the overall cost
    increases, and the crop quality degrades due to the use of harmful chemicals.
    However, there is another way to reduce the use of pesticides—by predicting the
    disease. For this purpose, it is needed to integrate the measurement of leaf surface
    wetness and duration with the existing system of sensors. Motivated by the above
    issues, Shah et al. (2009) designed a precision agriculture framework in the Sula
    vineyards at Nashik, Maharashtra, India. Initially, the lab-based small-scale
    setup was tested in a greenhouse at IIT Bombay, India with dimensions of 6 m   9
    m. On the other hand, the large-scale deployment at the Sula vineyards consists
    of wireless sensor nodes equipped with soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and leaf wetness sensors. Table 14 lists the various system parameters
    considered in this project. Based on the on-field sensor data, the Evapotranspiration
    (ET) and Infection Index were computed. Table 14. Deployment parameters: Sula

    5.2.3. Crop disease risk evaluation Crop diseases are the root causes of production
    and revenue losses. The prediction of crop disease, and taking countermeasures
    to help farmers ensure sustained revenue generation. Case Study—Sula vineyards
    (Das et al., 2009): Das et al. (2009) studied the forecasting of grapevine Downy
    Mildew disease (Francesca et al., 2006, Caffarra et al., 2012), one of the most
    common and important fungal diseases in grapes (Madden and Hughes, 1995, Rossi
    et al., 2010), by deploying a WSN powered with various agro-meteorological sensors.
    The Downy Mildew disease in grapes is caused by the Plasmapora Viticola virus,
    which is a weather-related disease. The prediction of such a disease benefits
    the grapevine industry tremendously—increased revenue with quality enriched food
    and beverage products. The deployed motes are equipped with ambient temperature,
    relative humidity, and leaf wetness duration (LWD) sensors. Two different existing
    models, i.e., the Logistic and Beta models, are adopted in the work (Das et al.,
    2009). The study was performed for over five months at the Sula Vineyards, Nashik,
    Maharashtra, India. Following the collected data, the “Infection Index” was computed
    in real-time using both the Logistic and Beta models. Case Study—AgriSense (Tripathy
    et al., 2013a, Tripathy et al., 2013b): The AgriSense distributed system comprises
    of wireless sensor nodes with environmental and soil-specific sensors – ambient
    temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness, and soil moisture. The actual test-bed
    was chosen as one semi-arid tropic region located at the Agriculture Research
    Institute (ARI) of the ANGR Agricultural University, Hyderabad. The target mission
    was to predict the Bud Necrosis Virus (BNV) disease of groundnut crop. Experiments
    were executed using different settings of protected and weather-based protection
    plots with different dates of sowing treatments on three different replicas. The
    on-field deployment comprises of five MICAz motes with 25 m communication range,
    transmitting at an interval of 15 min. These nodes communicate among themselves
    using the ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) protocol at the 2.4 GHz RF ISM band. One gateway
    node sends the collected data to a remote server using GPRS communication. The
    remote server converts the raw sensor data to a usable format and saves it in
    its database for displaying through the graphical user interface (GUI). Based
    on the data of soil and environmental parameters, various data mining models such
    as Expectation Maximization (EM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) classifier were
    used to predict the pest/disease dynamics. The schematic view of the real-time
    decision support system (DSS) is illustrated in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res

    real-time decision support system (DSS) used in AgriSense (Tripathy et al., 2013a,

    The existing solutions invent smarter applications for solving multiple challenges
    existing in the agricultural domain. We discuss the prospects of these application
    in the following. However, there remains scope to further improve the solutions.
    We list few points to improve the existing innovations. • Cost-effective solutions
    for LMICs are required: The existing research and development efforts are targeted
    at the reduction of hardware and software costs, while maximizing the system output.
    The overall system cost increases due to the use of foreign imported devices to
    build the systems. However, for applications in LMICs, we need to reduce the system
    cost further. Thus, the challenge exist in bringing down the cost further. • Scalability
    of the deployments need to be tested: For LMICs, we need planned and scaled-up
    deployment of such agricultural systems. In this way, the average system cost
    can be reduced down keeping the performance intact. Also, with increased scalability,
    we need to have design. For a large scale deployment, hierarchical architecture
    would perform better than the flat single-tier network architecture, as discussed
    in Section 3.1. For example, in Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010,
    the on-field WSN deployment in a specific area mostly follows the two-tier hierarchical
    network architecture with WSUs as end devices and WIUs as the gateway. This type
    of network architecture can be scaled up by replicating to multiple fields. In
    this setting, to increase the number of WSUs over a large deployment area, we
    have to place multiple WIU to provide connectivity to all the WSUs. • Fault tolerance:
    Fault tolerance is a necessary feature of wireless sensor networks for achieving
    precision agriculture. Different types of faults (Baljak et al., 2012) that may
    occur in a WSN based precision agriculture system are – node failure due to depleted
    battery or any other reason, sensor hardware faults generating erroneous value,
    faulty sensor calibration, communication failure. In the existing literature,
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) presented an irrigation management system which is fault
    tolerant to nodes (WSUs) and communication failure. In case of any fault, the
    system follows the default irrigation schedule. To reduce the chances of node
    failure due to energy depletion, (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah
    et al., 2009) have used solar powered nodes. Also, the topology management and
    data aggregation schemes should be fault tolerant in a large scale deployment.
    • Energy management and energy harvesting: Energy management is an important issue
    in any WSN-based system. System components and algorithms should be designed keeping
    this issue in mind. Alternatively, the potential energy harvesting solutions such
    as solar power (Everlast Simjee and Chou, 2008), wind power (AmbiMax Park and
    Chou, 2006), biomass, and vibration should also be considered while designing
    WSN based precision agriculture systems. Among the existing works, solar powered
    WSNs (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah et al., 2009) are already
    in use. Therefore, the future works have scope of working on these non-conventional
    resource based WSNs. • Simplification of the existing solutions are needed: The
    end-user of most of the targeted agricultural applications are the farmers. Thus,
    the designed platforms and solutions are envisioned to be simplified in terms
    of usability. In this regard, the human–computer interaction issues such as accessibility
    and usability are required to be taken care of. • The present works may further
    be improved for different climatic conditions, crop and soil types: Most of the
    existing developments does not takes care of the real-time climate parameters.
    However, to enable precision, integration of the environmental parameters are
    necessary. 6. Future work direction There are many potential applications of WSNs
    in the agriculture and farming area. The current state-of-the-art includes most
    works on irrigation management, vineyard production monitoring, and crop disease
    prediction. 6.1. Factors for improvement The factors associated with WSNs that
    need further attention in the future are listed as follows. • Cost: A low cost
    solution is always desirable for increasing the scope and outreach of the applications.
    • Autonomous operation: The future solutions should include the provision for
    autonomous operations surviving for long time. • Intelligence: An inherent intelligence,
    which will enable the futuristic solutions to react dynamically to multiple challenges
    – from conserving energy to real-time response. • Portability: For easy of application,
    portability of the system is essential. Recent advances in embedded systems, such
    as System in package (SiP) and System on Chip (SoC) technologies will help in
    this regard. • Low maintenance: It is essential to design a system which require
    minimum maintenance effort. This will certainly minimize the average cost in the
    long run. • Energy-efficiency: To ensure extended lifetime with autonomous operation,
    the solutions need to be more energy-efficient by incorporating intelligent algorithms.
    • Robust architecture: A robust and fault-tolerant architecture for the emerging
    applications is required to ensure sustained operation. • Ease of operation: Typically,
    the end users of these applications are non-technical persons. Therefore, these
    applications need to be simple and easy to use. • Interoperability: Interoperability
    between different components and different communication technologies will enhance
    the overall functionality of the system. In addition to the global challenges,
    there are specific problems in Indian scenarios with respect to the agricultural
    WSN systems. We list few India specific challenges in the following. • Cost: The
    high cost of the sensors and associated systems is the major deterrent for these
    applications in the LMICs. • Variable climate & soil: The most challenging part
    in designing a WSN-based system for agriculture for India is the different temperature
    and soil types throughout the country. The application parameters are required
    to be tuned such as to function properly at different locations. • Segmented land
    structure: Unlike the USA, India has partitioned farming land, a specific challenge
    which demands suitable deployment architecture for WSN-based agricultural applications
    like irrigation management. • Average farmer requirement: In India, the average
    land holding per farmer is also lower than global scenario. Due to this, smaller
    and personalized systems are in demand. • Overall plan: An overall planning, considering
    the segmented land structure and farmer requirement, is required for attaining
    success in bringing automation in agriculture and farming domain. 6.2. Futuristic
    applications In recent times, with the advent of the new technical concepts such
    as sensor-cloud technology, big-data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), new
    applications are envisioned. We briefly describe such concepts, and enlist a few
    potential futuristic applications in the following. • Sensor-cloud computing:
    sensor-cloud computing refers to the on-field WSN applications empowered with
    cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Alamri et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2014). This
    integrated framework benefits the WSNs with improved processing power and storage
    capacity. Furthermore, sensor-cloud improves the data management and access control
    while increasing the resource utilization. Few potential application for the agricultural
    domain are, – A cloud-enabled storage of spatial variation of soil and environmental
    profile with respect to different seasons is need to be developed. – Crop health
    monitoring and yield prediction using mobile sensor-cloud services. – Designing
    a sensor-cloud controlled smart irrigation system for large fields. – To design
    a sensor-cloud operated environment control system for off-season production of
    vegetables and flowers in greenhouse farming. • Big-data analytics: Big-data analytics
    techniques are applied to find meaningful insight from large volume of data with
    various data types (Kim et al., 2014, Nabrzyski et al., 2014). Big-data analytics
    based techniques are helpful for finding hidden correlations, unknown patterns,
    business trends, customer preferences, detecting crimes and disasters, etc. We
    list few big-data application for the agricultural domain as, – Building crop
    growth and disease management models based on farm data. – Designing a web-enabled
    analytics service for the farmers to provide improved information on agriculture.
    – Easy farming equipment control system for large-scale agriculture field. – Decision
    support service to improve crop productivity with optimal cost considering a large-scale
    contextual agricultural and climatic information. – Optimal policy determination
    based on data analytics for government and industries. • Internet of things: IoT
    extends the ubiquitous computing concepts with heterogeneous smart devices or
    ‘things’ integrated with interoperable communication technologies (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Gubbi et al., 2013, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013, Al-Fuqaha et al.,
    2015). The IoT paradigm defines ‘things’ which are capable of identifying, communicating
    and interacting with their surrounding. Empowered by these pillars, IoT provides
    flexible control mechanism for on-field parameters in real-time. Due to this,
    IoT is a potential solution for various agricultural applications. Few potential
    IoT-based agricultural applications are, – Cost-effective agricultural supply
    chain management using RFID tags. – Remote monitoring of animal movement in open
    pastures. – Automated pest counting and remote reporting in farms. – Remote control
    and scheduling of pesticide sprays at an user-defined rate and time. – Leak detection
    and remote water flow control in large-scale agricultural field water supply.
    7. Conclusion The inclusion of WSNs is envisioned to be useful for advancing the
    agricultural and farming industries by introducing new dimensions. In this survey,
    we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in WSN deployment for
    advanced agricultural applications. First, we introduced the variants of WSNs—the
    terrestrial WSNs and underground WSNs. Then, we highlighted various applications
    of WSNs, and their potential to solve various farming problems. The consecutive
    sections of this paper presented the network and node architectures of WSNs, the
    associated factors, and classification according to different applications. We
    review the various available wireless sensor nodes, and the different communication
    techniques followed by these nodes. Then, using case studies, we discussed the
    existing WSN deployments for different farming applications, globally and in India.
    Finally, we presented the prospects and problems associated with the existing
    applications. Finally, we listed several directions for future research with associated
    factors for improvement. The survey of the existing works directs us in concluding
    few remarks. The current state-of-the-art offers WSN-based solutions for irrigation
    management, crop disease prediction, vineyard precision farming mostly. Simplified,
    low cost, and scalable systems are in demand, specifically for the LMICs. At the
    same time, with the advent of modern technologies, there exist a lot of scope
    for innovating new and efficient systems. Specifically, low cost solution with
    features like autonomous operation, low maintenance is in demand. Overall, futuristic
    pre-planning is required for the success of these applications specifically to
    overcome the problems in global as well as LMICs. Acknowledgement This work is

    Metrics Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) gives a new dimension in the area of
    smart farming and agriculture domain. With the use of fog computing and WiFi-based
    long distance network in IoT, it is possible to connect the agriculture and farming
    bases situated in rural areas efficiently. To focus on the specific requirements,
    we propose a scalable network architecture for monitoring and controlling agriculture
    and farms in rural areas. Compared to the existing IoT-based agriculture and farming
    solutions, the proposed solution reduces network latency up to a certain extent.
    In this, a cross-layer-based channel access and routing solution for sensing and
    actuating is proposed. We analyze the network structure based on coverage range,
    throughput, and latency. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume:

    Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Farming and agriculture is the basis of human
    life which gives food, grains, and other raw materials. Technology holds a tremendous
    role in increasing production and decreasing extra manpower. Internet of Things
    (IoT) has opened up a suitable solution for smart farming and agriculture, however,
    it remains a dream till the connectivity is not reached to rural areas. The WiFi-based
    long distance (WiLD) network is successfully been used to connect the rural regions
    with low cost [1]–[3]. With the extended range, for better and efficient IoT in
    such region, fog computing, and cloud computing solutions can be incorporated
    in WiFi devices [4], [5]. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is proven to be an economically
    viable solution for the farming domain [6], [7]. Features like the integration
    of sensors/actuators, digital transmission, low power consumption, scalability,
    and security of WSN enable us to use in different IoT applications. Irrigation,
    farm monitoring, control use of fertilizer, soil monitoring, intruder detection,
    water quality monitoring, etc., operations can be supported using WSN [8]. To
    support efficient routing and auto-configuration in such network, 6LoWPAN is widely
    used [9]. The 6LoWPAN can be integrated into WSN-based IoT to uniquely identify
    a large number of devices [10]. It allows us to achieve interoperable communication
    among different technologies. 6LoWPAN border router (6LBR) is responsible for
    collecting the sensor information and forwarding to an IoT cloud server. At the
    same time, 6LBR also carry the available commands from a remote user or from an
    automation server. The agriculture and farm-related solutions and decisions are
    handled by a cloud-server. The WiLD network has revealed to be an affordable alternative
    to the other low cost and long distance solutions [1], [11]. The WiFi (IEEE 802.11)
    commodity hardware is available at low cost and it supports license-exempt operation
    in the ISM radio bands [12]. Replacing existing cloud, a local solution station
    in these devices is required for such long-range wireless network which saves
    bandwidth and reduces the delay. Fog computing has emerged as a solution to this
    problem. It can reduce the delay to milliseconds to subseconds of time by creating
    a local and collaborative solution system. In this paper, we propose a network
    solution in the domain of IoT connecting the rural region with various agricultural
    and farming applications. In summary, the primary contributions of this paper
    are as follows. We introduce WiLD network and fog computing in the existing WSN-based
    solutions for covering longer range with lesser delay. A cross-layer-based MAC
    and routing solution that adapts traffic nature and sets the duty cycle accordingly
    to improve delay and throughput performances over multihop IoT is proposed. We
    discuss the testbed evaluation processes and analyze the performance of the proposed
    architecture. Remaining of this paper is organized into four sections. The IoT
    and its potential for smart farming and agriculture are discussed in Section II.
    Section III presents the proposed IoT network solution for farms and agriculture
    in rural areas. Section IV gives the performance evaluation process of the proposed
    network. Finally, Section V concludes this paper. SECTION II. IoT and Its Potential
    for Smart Farming and Agriculture IoT monitoring and automation from anywhere
    in the world is replacing human being and hence yielding more benefits in agriculture.
    It is predicted that by the year 2050, the agriculture using IoT will increase
    the food production by 70% and provide foods up to 9.6 billion people, and 2 billion
    sensors will be used in 525 million farms. Due to this prediction, IoT-based agriculture
    and farming is becoming popular with the promise to deliver all-time visibility
    of soil and crop health, used machinery, storage conditions, fertilizer used,
    energy consumption, and animal behavior. IoT can help farmers in numerous ways.
    With the deployed sensors/actuators across farms and machinery, farmers can gain
    as an abundance of insightful data such as temperature, fertilizer used, water
    used, etc. Once an IoT-enabled smart system is in place, farmers can easily monitor
    a variety of environmental parameters and do analytics. Table I shows a list of
    IoT-based agricultural applications. From the table, it is clear that longer latency
    is intolerable for most of the applications. TABLE I Network Requirements of Different
    IoT Applications in Farm and Agriculture Gutiérrez et al. [14] proposed an IoT-based
    irrigation system comprising of a WSN connected by a gateway and a remote server.
    Other than the efficient use of water, this project also deployed soil moisture
    and temperature sensors. Smart sensor Web [16] was proposed to measure soil moisture
    with the deployed sensors and controlled them from a Web-based system. To monitor
    pH, temperature, humidity, etc., Cambra et al. [15] proposed a video sensing-based
    fertilizer controlling in agriculture production. An IoT-based smart security
    and monitoring system is developed in [17]. Security devices are kept in agricultural
    fields like rainstorms and cold stores to control and monitor from a remote location.
    A soil moisture monitoring system is developed in [13], which worked on an energy
    efficient algorithm. Dan et al. [18] monitored climate conditions using a greenhouse
    monitoring system with short-range ZigBee technology. Ojha et al. [8] discussed
    the deployment processes of WSN for agriculture and farming and analyzed the network
    with respect to technologies, standards, and hardware. However, these solutions
    mainly consider short-range technologies deployed in an area where Internet connectivity
    is available nearby. As farms and agriculture primarily available in rural areas,
    connecting the short-range WSN from long distance and solving the farm-related
    issues still challenging. Further, provisioning QoS for such application to fulfill
    different network requirements is very important. SECTION III. Proposed Network
    Architecture for Smart Farming and Agriculture The proposed architecture is a
    practical and promising solution for connecting rural farms using IoT with low
    cost and better QoS. The proposed network ( N ) is a combination of one WiLD network
    ( W ) and a set of 6LoWPAN enabled WSN networks ( w ). Network N , can be represented
    as a graph N ( A/ R i / g i / s i , E ), where A is the gateway, R i is any WiFi
    relay node, g i is any sensor gateway, s i is any sensor node, and E is the set
    of links between two nodes in the network. Fig. 1 shows the proposed IoT architecture.
    The architecture combines multiple networks for scalability and larger coverage
    range. Components of the proposed architecture are described below. Fig. 1. Proposed
    IoT network architecture connecting rural areas. Show All A. 6LoWPAN-Based Wireless
    Sensor/Actuator Network The 6LoWPAN-based wireless sensor and actuator network
    is used in the farm domain for sensing and actuating many operations. 6LoWPAN
    is a low power wireless personal area network with devices of IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    using IPv6. Definition 1 (6LoWPAN-Based Sensor Node):A sensor node is a tiny device
    accessible using IPv6 address having low storage capacity, capable of low computation
    and processing capability, and low power consuming. According to their functionalities,
    a sensor node s i can perform sensing, actuating, or both operations. Multiple
    on-field sensor nodes deployed across the farm areas which are accessible through
    a set of gateway nodes g i s available to their respective coverage range. 6LoWPAN-based
    network is widely used in IoT implementations. The considered network in this
    phase can be defined as follows. Definition 2 (6LoWPAN-Based WSN):A 6LoWPAN enabled
    WSN is a collection of sensor nodes ( s= s 1 , s 2 , s 3 ,…, s n ) which are identifiable
    by a compressed version IPv6 addresses and accessible through a gateway node g
    . A large number of IoT devices need larger address space and auto-configuration
    which is provided by IPv6. Characteristics of a 6LoWPAN network are small packet
    size, low bandwidth, lossy link, and mesh management. It uses the 6LoWPAN protocol
    stack (IPv6 and adaptation layer). The challenge of such combination is to adapt
    the packet sizes between the two layers, i.e., 1280 bytes in IPv6 and 127 bytes
    in LoWPANs. 6LBR fragments the packet in IPv6 layer and reassemble them in 802.15.4
    layer. As shown in Fig. 1, the nodes are enabled with IPv6 addresses for better
    scalability. The deployed sensor nodes communicate using 6LoWPAN-based network,
    monitors the environment to provide precision farming and agriculture management.
    To provide security, identifying, managing, and to collect and deliver data to
    the devices, a gateway is used. The gateway devices run 6LBR for interfacing between
    two different networks. It is coped with two different interfaces supporting IEEE
    802.15.4 network (6LoWPAN) and 802.11 networks (WiLD networks). The gateway device
    has more processing capability than deployed sensor devices. 1) MAC and Routing
    Solution for Internet of Things: Monitoring and taking actions over a large scale
    farm or agricultural area, a huge number of sensor and actuator nodes may need
    to be deployed. The traffic generated by the nodes are mostly periodic in nature
    which is transmitted over multiple hops till the gateway. On the other hand, bursty
    traffic may be generated toward downlink direction for controlling actuators.
    WSN-based MAC protocols [also called low power listening (LPL) protocol] such
    as X-MAC [19], B-MAC [20], ContikiMAC [21], and SpeckMAC [22] do not meet our
    goal to achieve lesser delay and energy consumption, and also the nodes of the
    network need to operate homogeneously. To adapt with heterogeneous traffic scenarios,
    MaxMAC [23] adjusted their duty cycle dynamically. However, switching its mode
    of operation causes more energy consumption. With the use of routing, AADCC [24]
    gathers neighborhood information and modifies the MAC duty cycle. However, there
    may high latency due to the wake-up interval, which can be extended to save energy.
    A traffic adaptive MAC protocol, T-AAD [25] uses senders queue length which reduces
    transmission delay but cannot eliminate/reduce channel contention and does not
    support burst transmission. Enabling burst transmission, a queue length-based
    dynamic duty cycle MAC protocol Q-BT [26] is proposed. Due to the fixed length
    of it, queue length-based approaches are not efficient. Further, these protocols
    cannot adjust duty cycle accurately among nodes that have periodic traffic and
    different child-parent links and nodes in a multihop IoT. Table II compares the
    proposed MAC solution with the related works. TABLE II Comparison of Different
    WSN MAC Protocols Enhancing ContikiMAC, a cross-layer and adaptive duty cycle
    (CLAD) protocol based on routing over low power and lossy networks (RPLs) is proposed
    to solve the above problem. The protocol uses a cross-layer approach and utilizes
    the destination oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) topology to know the number
    of children nodes. As shown in Fig. 2, sink and routing nodes keep the counts
    of their children nodes. For uplink traffic, a node keeps track of its number
    of child nodes and adjusts its duty cycle dynamically. If ( Q ) be the number
    of children nodes of any sensor node s i , then the duty cycle ( D dc ) varies
    as D dc ∝ 1 Q . (1) View Source Fig. 2. DODAG topology constructed by RPL routing
    protocol. Show All Although the uplink traffic is mostly periodic in nature, downlink
    traffics are bursty (as an action happens is informal). In the next step, to handle
    bursty traffic, the proposed protocol calculates the traffic load index as L i
    = r r + f r + c r C (2) View Source where L i is the load index at a particular
    routing node i and C is the link capacity. Also, r r represents the successful
    packet arrival rate, f r shows the successful packet forwarding rate, and c r
    represents the packet collision rate at the particular relay node. The higher
    value of L i means the higher is the congestion in the node. All nodes periodically
    send their load index to the sink node along with the number of child nodes (
    Q ). As the downlink traffics are mostly burst in nature, based on the received
    L i values, sink node uses less congested path for routing decision. The traditional
    RPL routing can create one or more DODAG, the sink node in the proposed protocol
    keeps records of them. The L i received from different intermediate nodes are
    compared with a threshold value L Th =([C/2]+ o r + a r )/C , where a r is the
    required data rate for alert/command and o r is the extra data rate due to packet
    and control overhead. The best downlink path is created comparing L Th and L i
    for all nodes. 2) Performance Analysis of the CLAD Protocol: In the proposed protocol,
    the sensor nodes periodically check in the adjusted D dc for any incoming packet.
    It uses two consecutive CCAs of duration, D cca with a short sleep gap, D s .
    Once the CCA can detects a packet from sender, the expected delay for one-hop
    can be calculated as D td = j. D dc +(2+i) D cca + D s + D data + D ack +2 D pt
    + D b (3) View Source where D data , D ack , D b , and D pt are data transmission
    (Tx) time, ACK Tx time, backoff time, and propagation time, respectively, and
    i∈{0,1,2,…,n} and j∈{0,1} . Delay may change with the changing value of i , j
    , D dc , and D b . The proposed protocol sets dynamic duty cycle according to
    the number of children nodes ( D dc ∝ Q −1 ). D b can be calculated from the probability
    of successful Tx ( p ). According to Bernoullis theorem [27], probability of random
    variable ( X ) can be given by P(X=y)=(1−p ) y−1 p∀y∈R. (4) View Source Average
    backoff window ( W b ) can be calculated from expected value of y as W b =[(2−p)/p]
    , which gives an average backoff time as D b = W b . t s , where t s is the slot
    time. Considering default value of Contiki-3, sending a packet of 100 bytes, D
    td is found to be ( ≈ ) 8.56 ms, assuming i=j=0 , W b =64 , and t s =50μs . Therefore,
    expected delay for h hops will be h× D td . Wasteful and unnecessary activities
    in the considered network may cost a huge energy consumption. A proper and application
    load aware duty cycling scheme can solve the issue. The proposed scheme uses traffic
    load and number of nodes to optimally utilizes the D dc for better delay performance.
    Energy consumption in the proposed protocol is primarily because of Tx, reception
    (Rx), backoff, and idle listening. Assuming packet interarrival time λ , energy
    consumption due to idle time ( E id ), transmission ( E tx ), reception ( E rx
    ), backoff time ( E b ), and ( E sl ) are calculated as E id = E tx = E rx = E
    bo = E sl = P id (λ−k.( D dc +2 D cca )+2 D cca + D data + D ack + D b + D tr
    ) P tx ( D data + D ack ) P rx (2 D pt + D tr ) P rx . D b P sl .( D dc + D s
    ) View Source where P id , P tx , P rx , P sl , and P bo are power required per
    unit time in idle, Tx, Rx, sleep, and backoff modes, respectively. D pt is the
    propagation delay, D tr is the transition delay for switching over from sleep
    to receive mode, and k=⌊(λ/ D dc )⌋ . For any collision, a subsequent re-transmission
    will consume extra E tx and E id energy. The operating voltage of CC2420 is 2.1–3.6
    V and it requires 17.4 mA, 18.8 mA, and 1 μA (max) in transmit, listen, and sleep
    mode, respectively. The value of D dc is not fixed in our case, so considering
    an average value of 200 ms ∈{150,250} , for 2.3 V, λ=500 ms, idle time ( D id
    ) is found to be 91.168 ms and hence E id =3.94 mW. Similarly, E rx ≈0.02 mW,
    E bo =0.138 mW, and E sl =0.00046 mW. Total energy consumption in one-hop transmission
    will be E total =4.1 mW. Further, other parameters like distance, weather and
    cross-layer complexity may consume additional energy. The simulation and testbed
    performance of the proposed protocol are extensively discussed in Section IV.
    3) Architectural Complexity and Communication Overhead in CLAD Protocol: The proposed
    cross-layer MAC protocol shares Q and L i value of routing which helps to decide
    appropriate sleep duration. The cross-layer decision enables the network for a
    distributed construction and reduces control overhead at the MAC layer. In network
    protocol stack of 6LoWPAN-based architecture like Contiki, there is an adaptation
    layer in between MAC and routing layer. The message propagation latency for multilayer
    (layer 1 to n ) can be calculated as D t 1→n = ∑ i=1 n ( D Ti + D Pi ) (5) View
    Source where D Ti is the message travel time between layer i interface and layer
    i+1 interface and D Pi is the processing time. However, direct signaling is used
    to exchange information between MAC and routing layer. For two nonadjacent layers
    l x and l y , direct propagation latency is calculated as [28] D d l x → l y =
    D t 1→n n−1 . (6) View Source This scheme of cross-layer signaling gives n−1 speedup
    factor. 4) Effects of Weather in the Proposed 6LoWPAN-Based Network: Weather-related
    parameters such as humidity, temperature, fog, cloud, and rain affect the signal
    strength in proposed IEEE 802.15.4-based 6LoWPAN. The received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI) is most widely used to estimate signal quality [29]. For a link
    of distance d , received signal power, P(d) is computed according to the following
    equation: P rssi (d)= P 0 −10ηlog( d d 0 )+ G σ (7) View Source where P 0 is the
    RSSI value at a mention distance d 0 , η is the attenuation factor, value of which
    depends upon the environmental factors around the receiver node, and G σ refers
    to Gaussian random variable at zero means and σ 2 variance. The ITU recommended
    a model for fog or cloud attenuation which is valid up to 200 GHz [29]. According
    to which specific attenuation due to fog/cloud is η c =φM (8) View Source where
    φ and M are specific attenuation coefficient and liquid water density, respectively.
    Value of M varies with changing air temperature as [30] M= ρ γ a T (1+ H c ) 1+
    H c γ w γ a (9) View Source where T is the absolute temperature of air, ρ is the
    pressure in humid air, γ a and γ w are the individual gas constants of air and
    water vapor, respectively, and H c is the specific humidity. Luomala and Hakala
    et al. [31] discussed the effect of temperature on different states of humidity.
    Other than attenuation due to rain, the increased size of water droplets may cause
    reflection, refraction, or scattering. A performance comparison of RSSI for cloudy
    and normal weather in hilly terrain areas is discussed in Section IV-B. B. WiLD
    Network Different LPWAN technologies such as LoRaWAN, SigFox, and NB-IoT are designed
    for long-range connection, but due to very low data-rates and processing capabilities,
    these are not suitable for carrying a huge amount of data and running fog computation.
    However, both of them can be supported by the use of the WiLD network with ease.
    The WiLD network is used to connect the rural regions from a remote location situated
    far away from the point of Internet connectivity. A WiLD network in our proposed
    system can be defined as follows. Definition 3 (WiLD Network):A WiLD network can
    be presented as a graph G(R,E) , where R is a set of WiLD nodes including a gateway,
    set of the relay nodes and a set of leaf nodes, and E is the set of long-distance
    point-to-point links. A WiLD network can be modeled as a tree with levels L c
    . For any level l i , position of i th node is R i,l . Similarly, any link between
    three levels l−1 , l , and l+1 for nodes i th, j th, and k th communicating in
    a multihop manner can be written as ( R i,l → R k,l+1 )∈E . The gateway node,
    A is responsible for handling the initialization, synchronization, and scheduling
    of channel access. As shown in Fig. 1, WiLD network consists of multiple P2P links
    forming a mesh scenario. The network connectivity from a gateway node situated
    at district headquarter extended till rural areas for last mile coverage. The
    TDMA-based MAC protocol is proven to be suitable. The proposed architecture uses
    a two-color scheduling 2C-MAC protocol [3], which reduces the overall data frame
    into two slots by slot reuse concept. C. Fog Computing A prediction by International
    Data Corporation found that the amount of data analyzed on devices that are physically
    close to the IoT is approaching 40% [32]. That is, analyzing the data close to
    the sensor areas minimizes latency up to a large value. Definition 4 (Fog):A virtualized
    platform which enables storage, computation, and networking services in between
    the sensor nodes and the existing cloud computing centers. It analyzes agricultural
    data close to the deployed field to reduce latency. It also increases greater
    business agility as developers can quickly develop fog application with less cost
    and deploy wherever needed [12]. All these computations can be carried out locally
    due to the support of a specific node or set of nodes called as fog node. Definition
    5 (Fog Node):A fog node is a part of connected network situated closer to “things”
    of IoT and extends services toward the cloud. The hierarchical fog nodes structure
    helps to provide distributed computing in the network and ensures QoS for the
    delay sensitive applications. In the proposed model, reception of sensory information
    is done using application layer protocol like MQTT or COAP. Further, real-time
    control, analytic with milliseconds response time, and sending only aggregated
    data calculated from periodic traffic generated by sensors are done by a fog node.
    D. Cloud Computing Definition 6 (Cloud):A cloud in IoT provides autonomous and
    on-demand access to a shared list of computing resources kept in the storage server.
    The services that an IoT application demands from a cloud are as follows: Supporting
    a huge number of devices to communicate. Available anytime for computation. Provisioning
    security and privacy to data. Available storage. Helps in analytic report generation.
    Low cost. E. Performance Model of the Proposed Framework The proposed framework
    is a union of multiple networks having multihop communication in each of the modules.
    Hence, a key concern of the proposed dense network topology is the end-to-end
    delay. The primary alternatives of delays are as follows: Transmission and processing
    delay, Δ , and if there are multiple hops, this delay will be multiplied, Propagation
    delay, which is dependent on the Euclidian distance [33] between two ends and
    speed of wireless signals. Let us consider the sensor network component for delay
    calculation. If d be the distance covered by a wireless signal travel per unit
    time and E i,j be the Euclidian distance between any pair of nodes i and j , then
    the discrete propagation delay in a one-hop link ( i , j ) will be [ E i,j /d]
    . So, delay over multihop is the sum of one-hop delay. If first hop delay is D
    1 and total delay is D total then for WSN D 1 = D w = [ E i,j d +Δ] ∑ hop=i j−1
    [ E i,j d +Δ]. (10) (11) View Source Similarly, for the WiLD network, from node
    j to gateway k , multihop delay ( D W ) can be given by D W = ∑ hop=j k−1 [ E
    j,k d +Δ]. (12) View Source Then the total delay would be D total = D w + D W
    . (13) View Source As the WSN gateway and WiFi nodes are fog nodes, the decision
    can be processed and action can be taken from these nodes. Any decision taken
    in j node (i.e., first fog node), total delay ( T 1 ) for complete sensing and
    actuation operation would be T 1 =2 D w + D p (14) View Source where D p is the
    decision processing delay in a fog node, which depends on the availability of
    sensor data and processing capabilities of the system. Again, for the first WiLD
    node, i.e., second fog node, j+1 T 2 =2( D w + D 2 )+ D p . (15) View Source Similarly,
    for remaining fog nodes j+2,j+3,… , and k , the total action time can be calculated
    and finally the time required, if the gateway node is used as fog is calculated
    as T k−1 =2( D w + D k−1 + D k−2 +⋯+ D j )+ D p (16) View Source where D k−1 +
    D k−2 +⋯+ D j = D W . From (15) and (16), it is clear that T 1 < T 2 <⋯< T k−1
    . Based on the critical nature of different agricultural applications and to share
    the processing of data, priority of choosing a fog node ranges from j to k . Similarly,
    fog computing in the system can save bandwidth of the network up to a huge amount.
    For sending a packet P in the WiLD network having capacity C , required bandwidth
    is B req =(P/δ) , where δ is the transmission time and B req ≤C . However, a fog
    node holding the responsibility to process the packet does not further forward
    the data to next hop saving bandwidth B req for the remaining of the network.
    SECTION IV. Performance Analysis We have analyzed the performance of the proposed
    system in simulation as well as testbed environment. A. Simulation Analysis The
    performance of proposed framework is analyzed in two phases. Individual performance
    of the proposed WSN and WiLD network. Performance of the overall framework using
    results achieved in the first phase. In Cooja simulator of Contiki, we used CC2420-based
    Skymote device for the simulation of 6LoWPAN. A network topology with 50 nodes
    are created, where the position of nodes from the sink is kept static to ensure
    multiple hops. A detailed tabular description of the test setup is given in Table
    III. TABLE III Different Parameters for WSN Simulation As shown in Fig. 3(a),
    with increasing number of nodes throughput, reduces. This is due to the high contention
    in the channel coped with the high frequency of channel check which results in
    a significant number of packet drops. While X-MAC relies on ACK for strobes before
    actual transmission of data packets, ContikiMAC directly sends the data packets.
    The strobes further generate unnecessary traffic in the network and thus the overall
    throughput of X-MAC goes down well below Contiki-MAC. The proposed MAC protocol
    achieved higher packet received ratio (PRR) than ContikiMAC and XMAC with increasing
    number of nodes. In CLAD, a node increases its duty cycle based on the child nodes,
    hence in multihop scenarios, chances of successful Tx/Rx in higher than the other
    relevant protocols. Our scheme maintains a traffic load-based solution which provides
    priority to the downlink traffic and hence PRR is higher. The proposed scheme
    chooses a less congested path for the downlink flows. To validate the congestion
    control mechanism in the proposed scheme, we have measured downlink PRR and end-to-end
    delay for the proposed and traditional routing decision. As shown in Fig. 4(a),
    PRR after saturation point shows worst as traditional RPL routing does not consider
    current load for event-driven downlink traffic. Fig. 3. Average (a) PRR over increasing
    number of hops, (b) end-to-end delay over increasing number of hops, and (c) energy
    consumption of multihop network. Show All Fig. 4. Average (a) PRR (%) with varying
    loads and (b) end-to-end delay with varying loads. Show All Similarly, we have
    calculated multihop end-to-end delay applying different RDC protocols. The average
    delay is calculated for traffic sending from end nodes to the sink node for XMAC,
    ContikiMAC, and CLAD. From Fig. 3(b), it is clear that the proposed protocol achieves
    superior performance than the others. As the intermediate nodes try to become
    available according to the hierarchy, waiting delay in the queue is reduced. Furthermore,
    downlink traffics are prioritized in the proposed protocol to reduce delay and
    hence shows the best performance among the compared schemes. Contiki’s energy
    module [34] is used to calculate the energy consumption of a node per second.
    We can observe from Fig. 3(c) that the LPL duration strongly affects power consumption
    in comparison with the fixed duty cycle-based MAC protocol. Changing the LPL value
    from 150 to 250 ms, energy consumption reduces by 40% in XMAC and ContikiMAC protocol.
    However, allowing dynamic LPL configurations based on traffic load and the number
    of nodes, the proposed scheme achieves better performance over the relevant protocols.
    In CLAD, with increasing hops, energy consumption increases due to the decreasing
    D dc . For one-hop with 200 ms, the simulation result shows 4.11 mW of energy
    consumption, which is almost the same with the theoretical result. Once the packet
    from WSN is received by the local gateway, the gateway forwards it to the WiLD
    network. To ensure QoS requirements over such long distance networks, fog computing
    is used. To simulate the proposed computation mechanism, we have used iFogSim
    simulator [35]. Detail simulation parameters are mentioned in Table IV. The simulation
    is carried out over tree-based WiLD network topology as shown in Fig. 5. To cover
    a larger area and to test the fog performance over a various size of the network,
    WiLD nodes (fog nodes) are increased from 1 to 19 in between the cloud and the
    sensor device. WiLD nodes are positioned in a hierarchical manner and the end
    nodes are responsible for connecting the sensor/actuator nodes. Based on the number
    of fog nodes across physical topology configurations scenarios 1–5 of nodes 1,
    5, 10, 15, and 19, respectively, are considered. Two placement strategies, viz.,
    cloud and fog are created. In the cloud-centric scenario, all the operators (for
    example, diseases detection, solutions, environment issues detection, etc.) are
    placed in the cloud. Whereas in fog scenario, these operations are pushed toward
    the fog devices. In this application scenario, the delay is calculated over the
    control loop Sensing→reading→problem detection→taking action , i.e., the cloud
    or fog module will first read the sensed data, then find current problems and
    action will be taken to the appropriate actuator. TABLE IV Simulation Parameters
    of the Fog Framework Fig. 5. Simulation topology for fog performance, where A
    and S are sensor and actuator, respectively. Long distance gateway fog (LDGF),
    long distance relay fog (LDRF), and local sensor gateway fog (LSGF) are the fog
    nodes. Show All As shown in Fig. 6, when there is no computation in the WiFi nodes,
    cloud placement do the operation creating a huge delay in the control loop. With
    the increasing number of WiFi nodes, latency also increases. The primary reasons
    for the delay are the multihop transmission, last-mile solution, periodicity of
    sensor data, computation complexity, etc. However, with fog placement, the delay
    has been reduced up to a huge margin. Rather than shifting all the operations
    to the cloud, fog nodes take the responsibility locally. For analytic purposes,
    fog nodes only send the aggregated data using some existing data aggregation algorithms
    on duplication. In cloud placement strategy, due to a large number of connected
    devices, load also increases significantly in contrast with fog placement. We
    can attribute to a fact in the fog-based computation that most of the critical
    and sensitive communication taken using low latency links. Therefore, modules
    like problem detection and decision are carried on the fog nodes which further
    reduces the data volume earlier sent to a cloud. Fig. 6. Average control loop
    latency for different physical topologies. Show All B. Testbed Evaluation Different
    components of the testbed setup are discussed as follows. 1) 6LoWPAN-Based WSN
    Setup: The 6LoWPAN-based WSN is interfaced with the WiLD network for long distance
    connectivity. A RaspberryPi device configured with 1-GB RAM, 1.2-GHz ARM processor,
    and CC2531 for 802.15.4 interface is used for the local gateway nodes. Similarly,
    software like Contiki-OS, Paho for MQTT broker, COAP client, Mysql, etc., are
    used. Detailed specification of CC2650 is shown in Table V. CC2650 provides longer
    battery life using a coin cell with ultralow power microcontroller. It further
    saves energy with built-in low powered microelectromechanical sensors. Along with
    the six built-in weather-related sensors, additionally, two GPIOs are programmed
    out from JTAG interfaces for adding a soil moisture sensor and a relay switch
    to add an actuator. Fig. 9 shows the programmed low powered smart mote named as
    SmartAgriMote for the proposed agriculture and farming application. TABLE V 6LoWPAN
    Node (CC2650) Specifications Fig. 7. Leaf/end node (right), where (1) is an omnidirectional
    antenna, which is closer (< 100 m) to 6LoWPAN gateway nodes, and (2) is a directional
    antenna connected to WiLD relay node for bridging connectivity, a relay node (middle),
    where (1) and (2) are two directional antennas for Tx/Rx operation and establishing
    multihop communication, a root node (left), where (1) is an omnidirectional antenna
    for local area connectivity, (2) and (3) are two directional antenna to enable
    communication between two sub-WiLD networks for extending connectivity, and (4)
    is the RouterBoard. Show All Fig. 8. Google map view of deployed testbed setup.
    Show All Fig. 9. Programmed smart mote for the proposed agriculture and farming
    application. Show All The proposed WSN-based MAC protocol is implemented over
    cc26xx-Web-demo module to see the PRR and Round-trip delay using upper layer protocols
    MQTT and COAP. To generate uplink traffic, sensor nodes are set to send a packet
    at every 5 s. Similarly, with the same duration, a command button from a Web interface
    was used to measure downlink traffic. We have used five motes along with the gateway
    for the performance test. As shown in Table VI, with increasing number of hops,
    delay increases, and PRR decreases. From RTT, end-to-end delay for one-hop would
    be (34/2 =)17 ms, which almost vary close to the simulation result. The same case
    can be applied for multihop scenarios too. In hilly terrain areas, cloud and fog
    are common for most of the time. We have analyzed the weather effect on RSSI for
    different distances. Unavailability of an external antenna in CC2650, it can cover
    maximum up to 40 m in a single hop scenario. However, as shown in Table VII, RSSI
    measured in cloudy weather condition is lesser than normal condition. Also, we
    have measured the downlink PRR for the proposed congestion aware solution and
    shows improvement over traditional routing. TABLE VI Performance Results of the
    Proposed 6LoWPAN-Based Sensor Network TABLE VII RSSI in Cloudy and Normal Weather
    Conditions 2) WiLD Network Setup: A shown in Fig. 7, three types of nodes are
    used for complete WiLD network setup. We have used two types of router boards:
    a) Mikrotik RB433AH and b) Mikrotik RB411 for the WiFi nodes. These boards are
    configured with 128-MB RAM and 680 MHz of nominal clock speed. The configuration
    of a P2P connection using these two boards is shown in Fig. 10. Google map view
    of the testbed is shown in Fig. 8. The main purposes of two relay nodes in the
    setup are: a) creating a multihop scenario covering longer distance and b) achieving
    a proper line of sight in hilly terrain. We have implemented the 2C-MAC protocol
    over Atheros-based Ath9k driver package of OpenWrt. Iperf and Ping are used to
    check the throughput and delay performance of the network. In 2C-MAC protocol,
    same slots are used by every two hops nodes, and hence throughput performance
    does not get reduced significantly over multiple hops (which can be seen in Table
    VIII). TABLE VIII Performance of the Proposed WiLD Network Fig. 10. Setting up
    WiLD links using high gain directional antennas. Show All After individual performance
    evaluations of both network components, we have analyzed the control system in
    two scenarios: Doing cloud computation at the Internet. Doing fog and cloud computation
    at WSN gateway and Internet. In the first approach, computations and report generation
    are done at the cloud. Whereas, in the second approach, except the report generation,
    other computations are carried out at the local gateway. The sensor network gateway
    only sends deflected data to the cloud to reduce bandwidth in the network. Calculating
    RTT at edge node (i.e., local gateway) we found the average value as 357 ms, whereas,
    at hosted cloud, it is 5032 ms. Fig. 11 shows a deployed on-field sensor node.
    A Web-based interface for visualizing the system is shown in Fig. 12. Based on
    the current requirements of agriculture fields, automation is also carried out.
    For example, based on the soil moisture values received, automatically water supply
    switches its mode to on. Fig. 11. Deployed on-field sensor node (SmartAgriMote).

    Show All SECTION V. Conclusion This paper has presented an IoT-based control system
    for advancement in agriculture and farming of rural areas. Different components
    and enhancements of the control system are discussed and analyzed in all aspects
    including testbed evaluation. The MAC and routing solution for IoT have achieved
    better energy, delay, and throughput performance. Combining the proposed solution
    with the WiLD network, it is possible to reduce delay and improve throughput for
    end mile connectivity. The proposed fog computing solution takes action with lesser
    delay and saves bandwidth in the network. The economy of a developing country
    mainly depends on agriculture and farms in rural areas and applying traditional
    approaches is not sufficient. Use of modern technologies like IoT with low cost
    and scalable solutions are very important. The proposed solution is also suitable
    for other applications like smart healthcare and smart grid in rural regions.
    To reduce congestion in the proposed large-scale network, along with the routing
    and fog computing solution, technologies like IEEE 802.11n/ac/ah having more physical
    data-rate capacity can be used. Moreover, dynamic bandwidth allocation-based configuration
    at existing relay WiLD node can further be installed. The chance of attacks like
    tampering and manipulation of data is high if we do not secure the long distance
    covering wireless network. Similarly, the privacy of individual devices is very
    important to autonomously communicate over different entities such as fog, cloud,
    and Internet. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    \ municipalities employ the smart city model in large cities to improve the quality\n\
    of life of their residents, utilize local resources efﬁciently, and save operating\
    \ expenses. This model\nincorporates many heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Wireless\nSensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (ClCom).\
    \ However, effective networking and\ncommunication protocols are required to provide\
    \ the essential harmonization and control of the many\nsystem mechanisms to achieve\
    \ these crucial goals. The networking requirements and characteristics\nof smart\
    \ city applications (SCAs) are identiﬁed in this study, as well as the networking\
    \ protocols\nthat can be utilized to serve the diverse data trafﬁc ﬂows that are\
    \ required between the dissimilar\nmechanisms. Additionally, we show examples\
    \ of the networking designs of a few smart city systems,\nsuch as smart transport,\
    \ smart building, smart home, smart grid, smart water, pipeline monitoring,\n\
    and control systems.\nKeywords: smart city; IoT applications; networking architectures;\
    \ Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\n1. Introduction\n\
    Nowadays, several municipalities implement the smart city model [1] to improve\n\
    the quality of life for their citizens and the efﬁcient use of city resources.\
    \ Intelligent\nservices can decrease operational costs and resource expenditure\
    \ in smart cities. They can\nenhance performance and operations in a wide variety\
    \ of smart city applications (SCAs)\nincluding transportation, healthcare, energy,\
    \ education, and many more. Smart services are\nprovided by various cutting-edge\
    \ technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples\nof these technologies\
    \ include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data\nanalytics,\
    \ and robots.\nIoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful\
    \ human life beneﬁts [2].\nIoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart\
    \ things into urban environments\nwhere innovative services are offered to support\
    \ every activity at any time and from any\nlocation [2]. Things are monitored\
    \ by IoT applications that make direct decisions for their\nefﬁcient management.\
    \ Moreover, things state their conditions, such as battery status and\nfault reporting\
    \ for prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state\nof\
    \ the infrastructure and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices\
    \ can also\nobtain physical environment information such as temperature. In a\
    \ CPS, the computation,\nnetworking, and physical processes are put together to\
    \ control and monitor the physical\nenvironment of a smart city [4]. In smart\
    \ cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical\nconnections between the virtual\
    \ and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can\nbe sustained by the\
    \ ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform\nElectronics\

    \ FogC offers reduced latency, greater mobility,\nlocation awareness, streaming,\
    \ and real-time response for SCAs [6]. Smart cities have\ndispersed vast numbers\
    \ of sensors, and thus large-scale data processing requires a complex\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Robotics in the cloud can be an effective computing tool for IoT applications\n\
    that require a lot of data processing [7]. To improve the services offered by\
    \ smart cities,\nbig data analytics is employed to generate intelligent and optimal\
    \ temporary and lasting\ndecisions [8].\nThe abovementioned technologies are used\
    \ to implement numerous smart city ser-\nvices [9,10]. For instance, intelligent\
    \ transportation services are applied to improve route\nplanning and avoid jamming\
    \ in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety\nand make possible\
    \ self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart trafﬁc light\ncontrols\
    \ are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy management\n\
    and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids and smart buildings.\n\
    These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable energy. Additional\
    \ smart\nservices are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, water\
    \ networks, train and\nsubway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural health\
    \ monitoring is also feasible using\nsmart services [11]. Last but not least,\
    \ there are smart services that focus on monitoring the\nenvironment, public safety,\
    \ and security of citizens [12].\nAll these smart city services necessitate a\
    \ reliable networking infrastructure to efﬁ-\nciently exchange messages between\
    \ the modules of a smart city system implementing a\nparticular smart service.\
    \ In particular, smart city services need a variety of networking and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies for their completion because they are proposed for dissim-\nilar\
    \ scales. For example, smart services for smart buildings must be implemented\
    \ based\non Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols.\
    \ On the other\nhand, smart services for the smart grid must be mainly implemented\
    \ using the WiMAX\n(IEEE 802.16) network protocol. From another viewpoint, smart\
    \ city services can exploit\ndissimilar network and communication models and solutions.\n\
    Until now, the networking and communication components of smart city systems have\n\
    received little research attention. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive\
    \ survey\nof network architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart\
    \ cities does not exist\nand is the goal of this study. The communication and\
    \ networking issues involved in smart\ncity systems are examined in this study.\
    \ This paper considers networking technologies,\ntopologies, and communication\
    \ requirements for such systems. It also examines if current\nnetwork protocols\
    \ are appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent\n\
    developments in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active\
    \ area, this\npaper is important to support new research in this ﬁeld. The paper\
    \ contributes as follows:\n1.\nIt presents network requirements of the major SCAs\
    \ including intelligent transporta-\ntion, smart buildings, pipeline monitoring\
    \ and control, smart water networks, smart\ngrids, and manufacturing control and\
    \ monitoring.\n2.\nIt reviews networking architectures used for the above applications\
    \ focusing mainly\non the protocols’ suitability.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;\nSection 3 presents network\
    \ requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;\nSections 4 and 5 analyze\
    \ protocols and network architectures for smart grids, smart build-\nings, smart\
    \ water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart transportation; Section 6\n\
    summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open research directions; lastly,\
    \ Section 8\nconcludes the paper. Figure 1 provides the layout of the survey.\n\

    \ inappropriate articles, only\n226 studies were identiﬁed.\n2. Smart City Applications\n\
    This section discusses the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what\n\
    type of assistance is needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs,\
    \ their\nadvantages and design problems were addressed.\nIn the energy sector,\
    \ SCAs are being used to increase the reliability, efﬁciency, and\nsustainability\
    \ of electric energy generation and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart\
    \ grid\nis a new power grid system that automatically collects and reacts to available\
    \ information\nabout supplier and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply\
    \ self-monitoring and\nsuperior control mechanisms for power generation and consumer\
    \ demand, improving grid\nreliability and efﬁciency. CPS systems are also used\
    \ to manage the process of producing\nrenewable energy from wind turbines [15].\n\
    Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings to monitor and manage energy\n\
    consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the buildings, including the Heating,\n\
    Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems; appliances; and lighting systems.\n\
    Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep track of the current state of the\
    \ environment\nand energy consumption, are typically included in smart building\
    \ systems. A centralized\nmonitoring and control system receives observations\
    \ and measurements from these sensors.\nBased on reported observations, current\
    \ operational circumstances, and environmental\nfactors, the control system employs\
    \ intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems\nemployed in the buildings\
    \ to optimize energy consumption.\nIntelligent transportation is another SCA that\
    \ has attracted a lot of interest in the\ntransportation sector. Applications\
    \ related to vehicle safety are among the most crucial\ntypes of such applications.\
    \ Vehicles can be equipped with a variety of safety features,\nsuch as blind spot\
    \ monitoring, emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane\nchange\
    \ warning signs. To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-\n\
    automatic operations. Real-time and reliability support in detection and response\
    \ are these\napplications’ most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing\
    \ vehicle safety must\nbe dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects\
    \ such as threat observations,\ndecision making, communication, and actions. However,\
    \ the software cannot handle\nhigh levels of incorporation across all the relevant\
    \ devices and guarantee real-time and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n5 of 63\ntrustworthy\
    \ replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial SCAs [17].\n\
    They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring equipment\n\
    to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed data and\
    \ intelligent\nsoftware that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.\
    \ Intelligent trafﬁc light controls,\nwhich incorporate device monitoring across\
    \ numerous locations to precisely forecast trafﬁc\npatterns, are another application\
    \ of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present\nan example of intelligent\
    \ trafﬁc lights.\nWater networks are maintained using smart city technology to\
    \ increase their intelli-\ngence, efﬁciency, dependability, and sustainability.\
    \ CPS systems are integrated into water\nnetworks to add smart characteristics\
    \ to the processes of water distribution [19]. Offering\nearly warning systems\
    \ to identify problems in water networks is one of these duties. For\ninstance,\
    \ it is simple to identify leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary ﬁxes can be\n\
    implemented to prevent water wastage and future network threats or damage [20].\n\
    WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides\n\
    well-organized control for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level\
    \ in green-\nhouses [21]. Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry\
    \ to automate, control,\nmonitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23].\
    \ Finally, smart-healthcare systems\nbased on edge computing [24] are proposed\
    \ to monitor and examine the physical health of\nusers [25].\nFigure 2 shows some\
    \ important applications including smart trafﬁc surveillance\nand management,\
    \ smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste\nmanagement,\
    \ smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart home.\n \n\
    observations, decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software\
    \ \ncannot handle high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices\
    \ and guarantee \nreal-time and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving\
    \ vehicles are regarded as \ncrucial SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned\
    \ capabilities with vision and \nmonitoring equipment to provide the vehicle the\
    \ ability to traverse the roads using \nsensed data and intelligent software that\
    \ evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time. \nIntelligent traffic light\
    \ controls, which incorporate device monitoring across numerous \nlocations to\
    \ precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application of intelligent\
    \ \ntransportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent traffic\
    \ lights. \nWater networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase\
    \ their intel-\nligence, efficiency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems\
    \ are integrated into \nwater networks to add smart characteristics to the processes\
    \ of water distribution [19]. \nOffering early warning systems to identify problems\
    \ in water networks is one of these \nduties. For instance, it is simple to identify\
    \ leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary fixes \ncan be implemented to prevent\
    \ water wastage and future network threats or damage \n[20]. \nWSN-based monitoring\
    \ of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides \nwell-organized control\
    \ for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level in green-\nhouses [21].\
    \ Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control,\
    \ \nmonitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare\
    \ sys-\ntems based on edge computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine\
    \ the physical \nhealth of users [25]. \nFigure 2 shows some important applications\
    \ including smart traffic surveillance and \nmanagement, smart healthcare, weather\
    \ and air quality monitoring, smart waste man-\nagement, smart street lighting,\
    \ smart emergency response system, and smart home. \n \nFigure 2. Facilitating\
    \ networking and communication amongst SCAs.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n6 of\
    \ 63\nAnalysis of Smart City Applications/Systems\nThis subsection analyses the\
    \ SCAs shown in Figure 2.\nSmart Trafﬁc Surveillance Systems: These systems are\
    \ based on centralized pro-\ncesses and may fail due to networking problems. Thus,\
    \ to automate such an innova-\ntive system, centralized and distributed methods\
    \ must be used to maintain local servers.\nJavaid et al. [26] suggested a smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system using a mixture of central-\nized and decentralized\
    \ processes to optimize the ﬂow of vehicles on roads and an algorithm\nto manage\
    \ a variety of trafﬁc conditions efﬁciently. In the context of smart cities, effec-\n\
    tive trafﬁc management implies that a decision-making model identiﬁes and quantiﬁes\n\
    trafﬁc congestion as well as predicts trafﬁc patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered\
    \ a theoreti-\ncal analysis that takes into account such effective trafﬁc management.\
    \ Notably, existing\ndecision-making models are primarily devoted to urban and\
    \ highway trafﬁc management,\nnot considering the closed campuses and collector\
    \ roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] iden-\ntiﬁed this weakness and proposed\
    \ an IoT-based system model that collects, processes,\nand stores real-time trafﬁc\
    \ data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based trafﬁc man-\nagement system,\
    \ various challenges emerge. These challenges include security issues,\nextremely\
    \ sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required adjustments,\n\
    and speciﬁc information ﬁelds in the protocol header and structure, as well as\
    \ higher costs.\nSmart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of health\
    \ parameters, these sys-\ntems are progressively being associated with and connected\
    \ via the Internet to numerous\ntypes of available smart wearable sensing and\
    \ computing devices. These systems face\nseveral problems [29] that must be resolved.\
    \ A security/privacy perspective, inter-realm au-\nthentication, interoperability\
    \ issues, device-to-device informal communication, and collec-\ntion and management\
    \ of medical data are among the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30]\naddressed\
    \ issues related to cyber-security while using IoT for such applications. They\n\
    sought to examine secure techniques’ deployment and implementation from the perspec-\n\
    tive of preventing and reducing cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys\
    \ and\nreviews [31,32] on smart healthcare applications tackle the problem of\
    \ integrating IoT\nsystems with any healthcare application particularly.\nWeather\
    \ and Air Quality Monitoring Systems: These systems use environmental\nmonitoring\
    \ stations, which are extremely pricey to acquire and maintain. For example,\n\
    these stations require engineers with specialized skill sets and data analysts.\
    \ Therefore, it is\nimpractical to deploy such monitoring stations densely. Instead,\
    \ they are often deployed\nsparsely, which creates the problem of limited spatial\
    \ resolutions for useful measurements.\nLately, cheap monitoring sensors have\
    \ evolved in the market, signiﬁcantly assisting in\nreﬁning the granularity of\
    \ monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors [33]\nemphasized\
    \ the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with air quality\n\
    monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle with the\
    \ issue of\ncross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.\
    \ Moreover, these sensors\nare extremely susceptible to unexpected variations\
    \ in humidity, temperature, and wind\ndirection, and as a result, their accuracy\
    \ deteriorates with time. A recalibration routine\nmight be a way to maintain\
    \ and enhance such accuracy. However, because it would take\na lot more time and\
    \ work, this technique is highly improbable and would not work for\nlarge-scale\
    \ deployments. In a weather monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex\n\
    and involves three steps [34]:\n(1)\nObserving: It can be performed by monitoring\
    \ satellite imagery, precipitation reports,\nsurface data, and gathering data\
    \ from other nearby forecasters.\n(2)\nForecasting: It can be performed by forecasters\
    \ as short-term and long-term forecasting.\nShort-term forecasting is carried\
    \ out by evaluating the current weather conditions\nand projecting them over the\
    \ next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics\nof the weather. Long-term forecasting,\
    \ however, is possible through weather (nu-\nmerical) modeling and the projection\
    \ of such modeling using computer simulations.\nTo produce these simulations for\
    \ future forecasting, these modeling techniques use\nenvironmental data from satellite\
    \ photography, weather balloons, and surface ob-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    7 of 63\nservations. Following completion of the forecasting, the forecasters\
    \ translate the\nproduced simulated expected output into a perceptible format\
    \ for non-specialists so\nthat they can respond appropriately.\n(3)\nCommunicating:\
    \ Finally, they communicate such output or forecasted information to\nappropriate\
    \ authorities.\nDespite the fact that all of these computer models are used to\
    \ forecast the weather, the\nsuccess of each one is largely inﬂuenced by three\
    \ different elements: (a) the quantity of\nprecise data; (b) the length of time\
    \ needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity of\ndynamic atmospheric\
    \ weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data for a region\nis the\
    \ placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed distant from\
    \ rural\nareas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather enough\
    \ information for desert,\nsea, or even rural areas to supply the computer models\
    \ used to predict weather conditions\naccurately. Forecasters also use satellite\
    \ data to combat this issue. However, because\nof cloud cover and signiﬁcant changes\
    \ in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere,\nsatellite data accuracy can\
    \ occasionally be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and\nmap information\
    \ or surface/land features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence,\nit\
    \ further impacts temperature and precipitation values signiﬁcantly. This further\
    \ makes\nthings harder for a computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there\
    \ is a need to re-\nevaluate and re-modify such models’ mathematical equations\
    \ so that they can predict the\nchanges more accurately.\nSmart Waste Management\
    \ Systems: Automated smart waste management is crucial for\nthe following reasons:\
    \ (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure; (2) thin or delicate\nwaste\
    \ collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective waste logistics management;\n\
    (4) insufﬁcient use of cutting-edge trash treatment and recycling technologies;\
    \ and (5) lack\nof workers and specialists with the necessary technical and non-technical\
    \ skills to handle\ngarbage disposal and the associated infrastructures. Smart\
    \ waste management schemes\ninclude various steps such as (1) waste collection;\
    \ (2) differentiation of waste as per their\nbiological and physical properties;\
    \ (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage\ndisposal infrastructures/treatment\
    \ plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova\nand Porras [35] identiﬁed\
    \ issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing data from\nsmart deployed\
    \ sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some operational issues\n\
    such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure and smartly\
    \ managing\nwaste vehicle routes.\nSmart Street Lighting Systems: This system\
    \ is a network-oriented solution that uses\nstreetlights ﬁtted with speciﬁc actuators\
    \ and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities\nand connectivity interfaces\
    \ [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a\nmechanism that\
    \ gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting\n\
    with the use of smart wireless nodes (ﬁtted out with numerous forms of sensors\
    \ and\nactuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the\
    \ streetlights, and\nthey are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device.\
    \ Zanella et al. [37] insist\nthat their system could assist in gathering environmental\
    \ parameters such as humidity, air\ntemperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors\
    \ stated that optimizing street lighting\nefﬁciency is a paramount concern that\
    \ must be addressed. This monitoring system makes\nit possible to maximize efﬁciency\
    \ since it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity\nin response to the\
    \ time of day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this\nsystem\
    \ is simple and built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns\
    \ that\nrequire particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions\
    \ and communication\namong heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right\
    \ light lamp is critical for a\npower-efﬁcient lighting mechanism. Their selection\
    \ is based on how effective they are in\nterms of power usage and lifespan. The\
    \ existing metropolitan system relies on Metal Halide\n(MH) or High-Pressure Sodium\
    \ (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs, these bulbs are frequently seen\nas being inefﬁcient\
    \ in terms of power consumption and requiring signiﬁcant maintenance,\nwhich adds\
    \ signiﬁcantly to the cost. In addition, the system should be designed following\n\
    the advised design standards (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201)\
    \ [36].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n8 of 63\nCurrently, there are three kinds\
    \ of control systems for smart lighting systems in use:\ncentralized, decentralized,\
    \ and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a\nvariety of security\
    \ assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem\nthus far.\n\
    Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and security\
    \ of\nits residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention, dealing\
    \ with natural\ncalamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data collection\
    \ is ﬁrst and foremost\nimportant for the designing portion of these applications.\
    \ Depending on the gathered\nfacts, the development of intelligence (which aids\
    \ in making important decisions) and the\nability to respond swiftly and quickly\
    \ are the issues that require special attention. When\nit comes to gathering data,\
    \ we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated trafﬁc\nsensors. A developer\
    \ can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will\nconduct\
    \ predictive analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore,\n\
    this kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather signiﬁcant information\
    \ that\nwill help the relevant authorities (e.g., the ﬁre safety department, the\
    \ police department,\nand law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and\
    \ preventive measures. The\nconcept of widespread surveillance has important beneﬁts\
    \ for security and safety. However,\nkeeping track of such vast amounts of data\
    \ also prompts a lot of worries and issues for\ndesigners and developers, including\
    \ storage; the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and,\nmost importantly, the\
    \ question of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track\nof each\
    \ individual (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether\
    \ this\nkind of widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such\
    \ as China and India,\nwhere a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation.\
    \ Further, Gharaibeh et al. [38]\nclaimed that combining information transmission\
    \ technologies with well-implemented\ndata analytics models is necessary for quick\
    \ and swift collaboration. To save as many lives\nas possible during natural disasters,\
    \ it is imperative to gather, assess, and communicate\nvital information to the\
    \ relevant authorities. As a result, there is currently a lot of work\nbeing done\
    \ to enhance the performance of information exchange systems. Although this\n\
    system is based on the IoT concept and is relatively simple, it faces important\
    \ problems\nthat need consideration, such as complex networking solutions and\
    \ information sharing\nacross heterogeneous devices on time (time-sensitive application).\n\
    Smart Residence/Home Automation: A smart home has highly developed systems\nsuch\
    \ as a control system for devices or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems,\
    \ TVs,\nand other smart appliances), automated door openers, smart appliances\
    \ that may send\nusers remote status updates, smart refrigerators, and washing\
    \ machines. A user can control\nthe majority of smart home appliances remotely\
    \ with two recently produced gadgets:\nGoogle Home and Amazon Echo. In a smart\
    \ home, the end-user demands a high-speed\ninternet connection, so they can access\
    \ networking sites that control the home with HD live\nstreaming services. In\
    \ contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to\ncomputing\
    \ servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence, data\n\
    management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to concentrate\n\
    on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than just recommending\n\
    distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38]. The concept of\
    \ smart home\nautomation raises serious concerns about security and privacy risks.\
    \ A smart home includes\nsecurity monitoring systems with motion sensors, wirelessly\
    \ opening smart door locks,\ntelevisions, phones, and other smart appliances that\
    \ are highly outﬁtted with cameras and\nmicrophones. Although these gadgets improve\
    \ the system, little research has been done on\ntheir privacy and security features.\
    \ If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we\nwill discover that their\
    \ manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.\nIndeed,\
    \ Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully examining\n\
    Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market. They\n\
    argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already\
    \ more\nprivileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated\
    \ applications. As a\nresult, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this,\
    \ according to a published document\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n9 of 63\nby WikiLeaks\
    \ [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the tools to access, control,\n\
    and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the world. Furthermore, criminal\n\
    entities and hackers could seize control of smart personal devices, capture delicate\
    \ private\ninformation, and exploit that information immorally typically through\
    \ user tracking and\nproﬁling. Additionally, a hacker may break into one of these\
    \ smart applications, grab vital\ninformation, and then use it to launch any kind\
    \ of attack. For instance, based on motion\nsensors, security camera feeds, and\
    \ power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where\nand when to break into\
    \ the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized\nparties,\
    \ they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware and\n\
    software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard\
    \ against\nall these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators,\
    \ etc., are impervious to\nsuch security and privacy attacks.\nSmart Grid Networks:\
    \ The functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirec-\ntional (i.e.,\
    \ electricity is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers).\n\
    Electricity has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks\
    \ to\nthe deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in\
    \ an open-loop\nfashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures\
    \ in the distribution\nsector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little\
    \ or no real-time knowledge of the\nsystem’s operating conditions and dynamically\
    \ changing load. There are also several tech-\nnical, economic, and environmental\
    \ problems with this conventional approach. Therefore,\nthis conventional system\
    \ must become dependable, manageable, and scalable, as well as\nﬂexible, secure,\
    \ and interoperable [42].\nThe smart grid is the next invention of the Electric\
    \ Power System (EPS) that incor-\nporates quicker, more secure, and reliable communication\
    \ networks [43]. Smart grids\nsupplement the conventional electricity grid by\
    \ incorporating renewable energy sources\nsuch as biomass, solar energy, and wind\
    \ energy. These energy sources are much cleaner\nand more ecologically friendly\
    \ than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels.\nHowever, it is important\
    \ to identify the most suitable communication technology for the\nsmart grid’s\
    \ successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s overall commu-\n\
    nication style is unique compared with conventional network communication patterns.\
    \ The\ncommunication network architecture of the smart grid must be able to handle\
    \ information\nexchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,\
    \ and numerous smart meters\nin such a particular environment with little to no\
    \ human intervention. This type of com-\nmunication, called Device-to-Device (D2D)\
    \ communication, is autonomous and may be\ninitiated in response to an event or\
    \ at regular intervals. Notably, depending on how these\nsmart grid applications\
    \ were built, their QoS requirements and characteristics differ greatly\nin terms\
    \ of delay, burst size, and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement\n\
    of a smart meter event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent\
    \ grid\nnetworks, the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the\
    \ same network\npresent the issues of ﬂexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications\
    \ based on the smart\ngrid can be developed and implemented using the current\
    \ wireless and wired networking\ninfrastructure and technologies. For some devices,\
    \ such as smart meters, designing and\nstandardizing acceptable smart grid-based\
    \ protocols is a critical matter [45]. Furthermore,\nthese smart grid-based networks\
    \ are too dependent on intelligent sensors, actuators, and\nother devices. This\
    \ makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. These\nsmart\
    \ grids could be taken over by malevolent users or hackers, who could then obtain\n\
    unauthorized access to many smart meters and alter crucial data. Moreover, as\
    \ the existing\nelectricity system is insufﬁcient for establishing smart grid\
    \ systems, high-level adjustments\nto current power infrastructure scenarios are\
    \ required. Subsequently, these smart systems\nrequire high installation costs\
    \ because the installation requires a large number of smart\nmeters, sensors,\
    \ and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efﬁcient operation of\n\
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free\
    \ network\nchannel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent\
    \ applications.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n10 of 63\nMany surveys [42–45,47]\
    \ reviewed communication frameworks for smart grids, smart-\ngrid-based networking\
    \ technologies, trafﬁc management, and the requirements of numer-\nous smart grid\
    \ applications. Further, Kansal and Bose [48] presented their insights on\ntransmission\
    \ grid applications regarding their latency and bandwidth requirements.\n3. Network\
    \ Requirements for SCAs\nThis section considers several communication requirements\
    \ including reliability, delay\ntolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security,\
    \ network type, heterogeneous network\nsupport, and mobility support. It also\
    \ studies the aptness of different network protocols for\ndissimilar SCAs.\nSmart\
    \ city services and applications need robust and dependable communication\nsupport\
    \ as well as an effective networking infrastructure, which will permit competent\n\
    message-sharing procedures among the components of the smart city systems [49].\
    \ Every\nsmart city system has an intricate networking architecture made up of\
    \ various networking\ncomponents. Therefore, smart city systems are innately required\
    \ to have a variety of net-\nworking requirements. To access the far-off destination,\
    \ which may be clouds, the network\ntrafﬁc from a broad variety of deployed diverse\
    \ applications uses a common networking\narchitecture and resources. These resources\
    \ may consist of switches, routers, communica-\ntion connections (links), and\
    \ other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing\nfaraway clouds or\
    \ far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently brings\nup problems\
    \ with high packet loss probability, signiﬁcant delay, and constrained network\n\
    bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered when\
    \ develop-\ning, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart\
    \ cities. Otherwise, users\nwould be reluctant to approve the use of such applications\
    \ in the absence of adequate secu-\nrity safeguards. Such intelligent applications\
    \ need a high-speed networking environment\nwhere the quick reaction may be managed\
    \ with the support of the ability of a fast-processing\nspeed. Furthermore, a\
    \ variety of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city,\nbased on\
    \ their usefulness and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have\n\
    different networking requirements, particularly in terms of response and security\
    \ [50]. For\nexample, the networking requirements of smart emergency response\
    \ systems are quite\ndifferent compared to other applications such as smart healthcare\
    \ systems. Emergency\nresponse smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick\
    \ to react [50]. In contrast,\nsmart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily\
    \ need to be especially dynamic.\n−\nNetwork Protocols: Monitoring applications\
    \ for smart cities often use a dense network\nof heterogeneous sensor nodes, including\
    \ ﬁxed sensor nodes, mobile sensor nodes,\nand crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for Machines (LTE-M),\nextended coverage GSM IoT,\
    \ and ﬁfth-generation (5G) technologies [52] are intriguing\noptions to support\
    \ such heterogeneous networks. First, the bulk of crowd-sensing\nnodes (smartphones)\
    \ is already supported by LTE communications. Consequently, no\nfurther wireless\
    \ communication devices are required. To save energy, LTE and 5G can\nbe utilized\
    \ on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads) to allow the data gathered\n\
    by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring center via base stations\
    \ (the\nbackbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.\n−\nZigbee [53], WiFi,\
    \ and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary nodes\nto communicate\
    \ within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing the sensor\nnode\
    \ clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network connectiv-\n\
    ity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes maintenance\n\
    simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies also\
    \ make\npossible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance\
    \ of real-time\nmonitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance,\
    \ can accommodate video\nstreams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.\
    \ The fast data rates\nprovided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous\
    \ for the sink nodes or clusters.\nThe use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)\
    \ in structural health monitoring\napplications of bridges, tunnels, or towers\
    \ is fairly common. The cluster heads will be\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n11\
    \ of 63\nable to send the vibration data in this situation in real time. In conclusion,\
    \ practically\nall applications for smart city monitoring that demand a high data\
    \ throughput and\nminimal delay may be satisﬁed by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there\
    \ are some new\nsensor node standards, such as IEEE 802.11ah [55], LoRaWAN [56],\
    \ and Narrowband-\nIoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband protocols offer numerous\
    \ advantages: greater\ncoverage, improved scalability, reduced energy usage, and\
    \ increased device longevity.\nResearchers have tested these standards in more\
    \ than a few applications, including\nstreet lighting, energy metering, and home\
    \ automation, even though some are still\nbeing discussed and revised. The new\
    \ narrowband communication standards enable\nthe sensor nodes to run more sustainably,\
    \ which is beneﬁcial for applications that\naim for long-term monitoring. In addition\
    \ to these protocols and standards, the FogC\narchitecture [58] aids in monitoring\
    \ smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile\nusers (the potential crowd-sensing\
    \ providers) and the cloud are connected via fog\nservers. These fog servers are\
    \ WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users\nare more inclined\
    \ to participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing\nmeasurements\
    \ to the fog server in just one hop, signiﬁcantly decreasing the cost and\nenergy\
    \ usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give\n\
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the\n\
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the\
    \ FogC\narchitecture, such as the nearby trafﬁc conditions. The service latency\
    \ and response\ntime are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates\
    \ directly from\nthe fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone\
    \ network. Lastly,\nusing the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is\
    \ crucial to getting the\nbest possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and\
    \ cost. The networks may be\nhierarchical so that diverse roles and functions\
    \ can be assigned at various layers to\nincrease the networks’ dependability and\
    \ cost-effectiveness. As a result, certain nodes\nmay be able to transmit data\
    \ utilizing various protocols.\n−\nBandwidth requirements: Many video applications\
    \ in smart cities require high band-\nwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors\
    \ capture video from the physical environment.\nMoreover, video transmission is\
    \ more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional scalar\ndata trafﬁc in IoT. Examples\
    \ of these applications are intelligent multimedia surveil-\nlance systems for\
    \ home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring systems,\ntrafﬁc monitoring\
    \ systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based monitoring\nof an environmental\
    \ system.\n−\nDelay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart transportation, only tolerate\
    \ a small\namount of end-to-end delay. For example, to prevent imminent danger\
    \ to the ve-\nhicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data that are being relayed\
    \ must arrive within\nmicroseconds. Therefore, the control systems must react\
    \ in time. However, other\napplications have a higher tolerance for delays [49].\
    \ Such applications rely on data\nmonitoring and information gathering for upcoming\
    \ analysis.\n−\nPower Consumption: Another crucial need for applications is power\
    \ consumption.\nSmart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy\
    \ sources can tolerate\nprotocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45].\
    \ Other applications have medium\npower needs and require energy sources with\
    \ limited capacities. One example of such\nan application is intelligent transportation.\
    \ Other applications demand protocols with\nlow or very low energy consumption\
    \ characteristics since they have limited energy\nresources. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), smart water networks, and pipeline\nmonitoring for gas and oil are a\
    \ few examples of such uses.\n−\nReliability: The majority of applications have\
    \ medium reliability requirements. A\ntypical example of such applications is\
    \ smart water networks. Some other applications\nhave high-reliability necessities\
    \ such as intelligent transportation and smart grids [49].\n−\nSecurity: The majority\
    \ of applications need medium to high security. Applications\nsuch as production\
    \ control and monitoring, for instance, need medium security, whilst\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n12 of 63\nothers, such as smart grids, need high security because\
    \ of the sensitivity of the data\nand the importance of the operations carried\
    \ out [50].\n−\nHeterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city\
    \ systems use network-\ning protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent\
    \ transportation and smart\nbuildings are two examples of such systems. These\
    \ protocols must coexist in such\nsituations without conﬂicting with one another.\
    \ To ensure seamless and effective\noperation, it is also necessary to correctly\
    \ map the control information in the head-\ners at the various networking stack\
    \ tiers used by the many heterogeneous protocols\nand networks.\n−\nWired/wireless\
    \ connectivity: The majority of SCAs that include wireless connectivity\nare UAVs\
    \ and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines. Others, including intelligent\ntransportation\
    \ and smart buildings, use wired and wireless connectivity [50]. In\nthese situations,\
    \ wired networking may be used for communication within a speciﬁc\nphysical system\
    \ (such as within a UAV), while wireless communication may be used\nto link the\
    \ physical system to other such systems that are comparable to it or to the\n\
    backbone and infrastructure networks.\n−\nMobility: Some systems, such as the\
    \ smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil,\nand smart water networks,\
    \ have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such\nas UAVs and intelligent\
    \ transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility\nsmart city systems\
    \ can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and\nadaptable to\
    \ node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control\nmessages\
    \ and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.\nTable\
    \ 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each\n\
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network\
    \ with\nlow, medium, or high trafﬁc rates and supporting high or low mobility\
    \ of devices. Each\nSCA is based on different protocols and requires different\
    \ bandwidth and latency tolerance.\nIn each SCA, the number of devices involved\
    \ differs.\nTable 1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements.\n\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n13 of 63\n3.1. Additional Challenges\n−\nInteroperability:\
    \ Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous networking\nprotocols\
    \ that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at the physi-\ncal and\
    \ data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated seam-\nlessly,\
    \ these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks, the IEEE\n\
    1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface between\
    \ physi-\ncal/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this\
    \ function. Future\nresearch should focus on the creation of similar protocols\
    \ to increase the support\nsystem for smart city systems.\n−\nScalability: A smart\
    \ city platform must manage many devices that are connected to\nthe city’s infrastructure.\
    \ Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously\nproduced and consumed\
    \ by devices and client applications, must be stored and\nprocessed. The platform\
    \ must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests\nfrom users and services\
    \ that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change\ndepending on the\
    \ features of the city as well as the installed applications and services.\nRecently,\
    \ Del Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-\n\
    source smart city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale\n\
    systems, apps, and services for smart cities.\n−\nLoad Balancing: To maximize\
    \ the usage of resources, load balancing assigns appro-\npriate resources (i.e.,\
    \ network resources, storage capacity, computational resources,\nand energy resources)\
    \ to user tasks. A large-scale IoT network performs better and\navoids overload\
    \ thanks to an effective load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time,\ncost, throughput,\
    \ performance, and resource usage are all improved in terms of\nQoS parameters.\n\
    −\nThe Cloud/Edge/FogC Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation\
    \ of\nsmart city prototypes. These computing paradigms efﬁciently aid in the gathering,\n\
    upkeep, and analysis of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that\
    \ demand\nadvanced processing and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems\n\
    for smart cities have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time\
    \ applica-\ntions present the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently,\
    \ FogC and\nEdge Computing have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing,\
    \ imple-\nmenting, deploying, and controlling such systems/applications. These\
    \ paradigms\nbring computing resources closer to the IoT/device plane so that\
    \ the primary computa-\ntion can be done locally [65,66]. Each computing paradigm\
    \ offers particular assistance\nbased on the requirements of the application at\
    \ hand. For example, to support a cloud-\nbased SCA, ClCom offers centralized\
    \ storage and processing capacity. For certain\nSCAs, ClCom can offer scalable\
    \ processing power and data storage [5]. The features of\nClCom (e.g., powerful\
    \ processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge\nsoftware services)\
    \ can be used to provide various support services for a variety of\nSCAs. ClCom\
    \ can be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The\ncity’s ClCom\
    \ services can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs\nto gather,\
    \ process, store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes\nof data\
    \ are gathered across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The\n\
    sophisticated platforms required for storing and analyzing this massive amount\
    \ of\ndata to improve operations and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing.\
    \ To\neffectively support SCAs, the communication between city sensors and actuators\
    \ and\nClCom may involve various communication requirements. The network architectures\n\
    used in the smart city should meet these requirements. Smart applications require\n\
    the integration of sensors, actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function\
    \ well\nwith a robust network that offers good communication services linking\
    \ both sides.\nThe fact that cloud services are either provided at a single central\
    \ location or across\nnumerous distributed platforms in various locations is another\
    \ problem that occurs\nwhen adopting ClCom for a smart city. For many cloud applications,\
    \ the distributed\nClCom strategy can offer greater quality and dependability\
    \ support [67]. However,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n14 of 63\nit is frequently\
    \ necessary to establish effective communication channels between the\ndistributed\
    \ ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability\n\
    and efﬁciency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another\n\
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and\n\
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,\n\
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control\
    \ of\nnetwork resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot\
    \ be\navoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated\
    \ the QoS require-\nments of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment\
    \ to recognize\nQoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog)\
    \ that is\ninspired by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture\
    \ [69] for\na FogC system.\n3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks\n\
    A smart city network has the following features [70]:\n1.\nLarge Densities: A\
    \ smart city network has a very large density as thousands of smart\ndevices are\
    \ distributed in the area of a city.\n2.\nAbnormal Trafﬁc Patterns: Cascading\
    \ or synchronization among smart devices produces\nextremely bursty or correlated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. These trafﬁc patterns differ from\nthe regular social-generated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns on which most existing schemes and\ntechnology used in our society\
    \ are based.\n3.\nDisorganized Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless\
    \ connectivity features,\nsmart city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology.\
    \ The problem arises\nwhen smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless\
    \ channels, where packet\nlosses caused by wireless channel special properties\
    \ are extremely common and even-\ntually have an impact on the functioning of\
    \ the smart city system. Therefore, it appears\nvery improbable that a single\
    \ high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.\n4.\nHeterogeneity: SCAs use\
    \ a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,\nlatency, throughput,\
    \ and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates\nat a unique trade-off\
    \ threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist on\na single platform.\n\
    5.\nCoexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication technologies used\
    \ in smart\ncities are distributed over the same radio space. At the same time,\
    \ independent radio\ninfrastructures are connected through a variety of wireless\
    \ channels. Under such\ncircumstances, the SCA must handle interference issues\
    \ with competence.\n6.\nSecurity and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to\
    \ several risks from malevolent\nusers. The majority of specialized smart sensors,\
    \ actuators, and other intelligent\ndevices are developed by designers without\
    \ considering security measures. Such\napplications may be highly vulnerable due\
    \ to hostile actors’ ease of access to these\ncutting-edge technologies and potential\
    \ threats to people’s security and privacy.\nThe main challenges for smart city\
    \ networks are as follows [70]:\n•\nLack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies for Personal\nArea Networks (PANs) and the IEEE\
    \ 802.11 groups for wireless LANs adopt the\nconcept of single-hop ad-hoc networking.\
    \ These standards permit direct communi-\ncation between two devices that are\
    \ in the transmission range of each other. At the\nsame time, the multi-hop ad-hoc\
    \ networking paradigm enables the communication\nbetween any two devices which\
    \ are not necessarily in their transmission range [71]. A\nproblem that researchers\
    \ must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous sets of\ndevices (i.e., actuators,\
    \ sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate uniformly\nwithout any standardization.\
    \ Global distributors and manufacturers must propose\nand accept standardized\
    \ network solutions that enable communication between di-\nverse devices on homogeneous\
    \ communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard\nis the dominant solution\
    \ that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical Layer.\nThis standard\
    \ deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication range, and\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n15 of 63\npower consumption. Several revisions or amendments\
    \ (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE\n802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released.\
    \ The IEEE 802.15.4g amendment\nallows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing\
    \ data rates and communication ranges\ncompatible with neighborhood mesh (wide)\
    \ networks. Then, it is followed by another\ncutting-edge modiﬁcation, known as\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4e, which modiﬁes and enhances\nthe method used by devices to access\
    \ wireless channels while also using time-slotted\nchannel hopping mode. This\
    \ hopping mode further delivers low-power consumption\nand improved dependability.\
    \ From another viewpoint, many researchers customized\nappropriate upper-layer\
    \ protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They made the necessary\nmodiﬁcations\
    \ there to make smart applications compatible with conventional infras-\ntructure.\
    \ Since the network of low-power smart devices is conﬁned, the researchers\ndeveloped\
    \ numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make them easily adapt-\n\
    able. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72] and 6LoWPAN [73],\n\
    which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.\n•\nInterference\
    \ problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same radio\n\
    space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless\
    \ channels.\nBecause of this, the smart application must handle interference problems\
    \ in such\nsituations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate\
    \ and be\ncompatible with one another.\n•\nVertical handover (soft): Multiple\
    \ radios are used by the rapidly expanding number of\nsmart devices being developed.\
    \ These devices should be able to recognize and use the\nbest interface that is\
    \ currently available while balancing power usage and throughput.\n•\nD2D Communications:\
    \ In the IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication de-\nmands. Unfortunately,\
    \ conventional network gateways cannot handle such generated\nmessages from heterogeneous\
    \ devices.\n•\nShort Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support\
    \ and recommend\nacceptable performance for longer data packet scenarios. However,\
    \ smart devices\ncommunicate with one another using short messages (since most\
    \ of them are tiny\nand operate over low-powered battery devices). To this end,\
    \ short communicating\nmessages will positively impact network congestion detection\
    \ and avoidance policies\nand promote in-band aggregation.\n•\nLocal Network Trafﬁc\
    \ Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-speciﬁc devices frequently use the\nsame network\
    \ infrastructure. However, most cellular data networks are exclusively\nplanned,\
    \ implemented, deployed, and managed for smartphone usage. Fitting trafﬁc\nfrom\
    \ these heterogeneous devices onto a single platform is now the main challenge\n\
    that cellular data network providers face. It is difﬁcult to integrate the trafﬁc\
    \ from these\ntwo types of heterogeneous devices into the same network infrastructure\
    \ due to several\nintrinsic factors and the speciﬁed features of this traditional\
    \ network. Additionally,\nD2D devices use a more signiﬁcant proportion of scarce\
    \ resources than smartphones,\nunnecessarily creating a problem of unfairness\
    \ in the system [74]. Therefore, we\nmust ﬁrst comprehend D2D trafﬁc patterns\
    \ and how they differ from trafﬁc patterns\ngenerated by smartphones. Understanding\
    \ trafﬁc patterns can provide insights into\nmanaging and allocating shared network\
    \ resources more effectively and guarantee\nthe highest level of service quality\
    \ for both types of devices.\n•\nSecurity mechanisms: Denial of Service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are a remarkable threat to the\nsecurity of smart city networks and\
    \ must be identiﬁed. Some statistical methods\nhave been proposed to solve this\
    \ problem. Such a statistical method is presented\nin [75] that is based on feature\
    \ distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis\nprocess. Another security\
    \ mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying\nusers and devices in\
    \ a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-\nmanipulated devices.\
    \ Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT\nsystems such as\
    \ the reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation\nattack, and\
    \ the Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be\nencrypted.\
    \ However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n16 of 63\nbe able to embed general-purpose microprocessors for\
    \ this task. In addition, low\nresources and constrained devices can only embed\
    \ application-speciﬁc integrated\ncircuits. Therefore, conventional cryptographic\
    \ primitives are not suitable for low-\nresource smart devices due to their low\
    \ computation power, limited battery life, small\nsize, small memory, and limited\
    \ power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography\nmay be an efﬁcient encryption\
    \ for these devices. Trust management is another security\nmechanism that detects\
    \ and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure access\ncontrol. Automated\
    \ and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate the trust\nvalues of the\
    \ participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of trust management\nschemes\
    \ focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based access control\n\
    methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large number of\
    \ smart\nthings storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,\
    \ transparent, and\neasy access control management so that different nodes/users\
    \ can be granted different\nlevels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain\
    \ technology can be used to\ncreate secure virtual zones where things can identify\
    \ and trust each other [77]. Self-\norganization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can\
    \ also be planned to set up the relationship\nbetween Blockchain and IoT, as suggested\
    \ in [78].\n•\nAnomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that ﬂow\
    \ through the IoT system\ncan vary to a great extent, in terms of either format,\
    \ shape (in time and space), and\nsemantics. Therefore, the process of separating\
    \ normal from abnormal sensed data is\nextremely demanding. In the context of\
    \ IoT applications, sensors are the real source\nof big data, which suggests that\
    \ anomaly detection at the edge could be a powerful\ntool to address the inevitable\
    \ data communication bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is\nconcerned with identifying\
    \ data patterns that deviate remarkably from the expected\nbehavior. This is critical\
    \ in the process of ﬁnding out important information about\nthe IoT system’s functioning,\
    \ detecting abnormalities that are often rare or difﬁcult\nto model or, otherwise,\
    \ to predict [79]. A timely identiﬁcation of anomalies is vital to\npreventing\
    \ IoT system failure.\n•\nAdvanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI), machine learn-\ning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) play a key role in the evolution of the\nsmart city sectors [80]. These\
    \ techniques are now being developed as solutions for com-\npletely automated\
    \ IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal analysis of\nthe big data\
    \ is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing DRL/ML approaches\ncan\
    \ improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency; and increase\n\
    precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality prediction,\n\
    person detection, trafﬁc management, etc. For example, an intelligent transportation\n\
    system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize self-driving\
    \ vehi-\ncles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques\
    \ are also used to\nprecisely monitor and estimate the real-time trafﬁc ﬂow data\
    \ in an urban environment.\nIn SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned\
    \ techniques can enhance the\nsafety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,\
    \ management, and power\ngrid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective\
    \ use of smart meter big data\nfor different applications such as load assessment\
    \ and prediction, baseline estimation,\ndemand response, load clustering, and\
    \ malicious data deception attacks. In health\nintelligence, extensive use of\
    \ AI, ML, and DRL techniques is implemented due to\nhigh-performance IoT devices,\
    \ Cloud Computing, and an increase in data rates. These\ntechniques can play a\
    \ vital role in disease diagnosis, cure prediction, social media ana-\nlytics\
    \ for a particular disease, and medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role\
    \ of\nAI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques is also outstanding. These techniques\
    \ can be used\nfrom an advanced security perspective of IoT to confront security\
    \ threats. Notably, the\naccuracy and precision of the aforementioned techniques\
    \ can be further enhanced by\nincreasing the amount of training data to strengthen\
    \ their learning capabilities and\nhence the automated decision efﬁciencies [82].\n\

    partially applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies\
    \ and commu-\nnication strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication\
    \ perspective.\nIEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput\
    \ performance\nfor fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior\
    \ context. Due to the\nlimitations of its initial design, this standard does not\
    \ support IoT applications. Hence,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n18 of 63\nto enable\
    \ IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the community (IEEE 802.11ah\nTask\
    \ Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efﬁcient protocol [55]. They aim to create\
    \ a\nsystem that enables effective communication between several indoor and outdoor\
    \ devices.\nNevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need\
    \ to be improved by\nthe absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.\nIEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular\n\
    3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards\n\
    and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs.\
    \ Smart\nhome automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require\
    \ short-\nrange communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth\
    \ and Zigbee) from\nthe WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower\
    \ bandwidth requirement,\nminimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication\
    \ infrastructure environment.\nIn contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used\
    \ for SCAs that require longer-range\ncommunication. Such applications are smart\
    \ transportation management systems.\nThe protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular\
    \ and WiMAX, can be adopted by\napplications that need wide-range communication,\
    \ such as smart emergency response\nsystems, weather and air quality monitoring\
    \ systems, and smart grid systems. These\nfeatures designed in terms of standards\
    \ or protocols have enough capability that allows for\nboth synchronous and asynchronous\
    \ data connections. The best-effort trafﬁc (which can\neffectively tolerate latency)\
    \ allows the asynchronous data connections feature to be linked\nwith smart city\
    \ services or applications. Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connec-\ntions\
    \ is possible for those services or applications that generate trafﬁc mandating\
    \ strict\nQoS standards such as low latency and high accessible network capacity\
    \ [49]. Since IEEE\n802.15.4 (Zigbee) is a short-range (low bit rate) communication\
    \ protocol that often suggests\nhigher ﬂexibility for small devices running on\
    \ low power, such a protocol can signiﬁcantly\nincrease network lifetime. Moreover,\
    \ such a protocol encourages and indicates support\nfor applications and services\
    \ with relatively relaxed latency and throughput conditions in\nWPANs. The authors\
    \ of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and proposed an intelli-\ngent\
    \ system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted the beneﬁts of using\
    \ wireless\nemulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation and deployment,\
    \ relatively easier in\nexpanding a network, and ﬂexibility in the system due\
    \ to the use of wireless technology,\nwhich supports the usage of heterogeneous\
    \ devices in the same implemented and deployed\nstructure. Furthermore, they emphasized\
    \ the advantages of employing the same intelligent\ninfrastructure for a variety\
    \ of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring,\nand cost-effectiveness.\
    \ For example, by including speciﬁc smart metering devices such as\nwater or gas\
    \ meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established\
    \ to\ntarget smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering\
    \ applications.\n5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called\
    \ BDMA and FBMC\nmultiple access, which was ﬁrst launched in 2015. In the case\
    \ of BDMA multiple access, an\northogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that\
    \ resources can be distributed in parallel to\neach mobile base station by dividing\
    \ the antenna beam in accordance with the position of\nthe mobile stations to\
    \ enable multiple accesses to the base stations. Successively, this helps\nin\
    \ improving the capacity of 5G networks [86]. Speciﬁcally, the idea of moving\
    \ towards\n5G is based on current technology advancements and particularly on\
    \ unique customer\nneeds. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed that implemented\
    \ 5G cellular networks should\naddress noteworthy complications that are not successfully\
    \ addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced\nnetwork capacity and data rate, lower End-to-End\
    \ (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and con-\nsistent user QoE provisioning. In addition,\
    \ massive and rapid growth in the number of\nhighly developed connected devices\
    \ leads to a sharp increase in network trafﬁc and a\nwidening range of applications\
    \ with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta\nand Jha [86] studied numerous\
    \ facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive\nMIMO, trafﬁc and power\
    \ management policies, ofﬂoading (local), and self-conﬁguring and\norganizing\
    \ networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time managing\n\
    and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days thanks\
    \ to 5G. 5G\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n19 of 63\nultimately targets some networking\
    \ possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Com-\nmunications (uRLLC),\
    \ enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive Machine Type\nCommunications (mMTC).\
    \ In a smart city context, eMBB controls data transfer between a\nvariety of networked\
    \ user end devices, edge devices, or cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC\naims to\
    \ manage huge connected, complex devices, such as wearables, actuators, and sen-\n\
    sors, through dense urban deployment. Finally, uRLLC takes responsibility for\
    \ managing\nhighly time-critical communication such as vehicular communication,\
    \ base stations, and\nedge devices communication [87]. Although 5G has completely\
    \ brought about a new\nrevolution in the ﬁeld of networking, numerous unknown\
    \ challenges still are possible in\nthese cases of communication when 5G is deployed\
    \ in the context of smart cities. One major\nproblem is power-efﬁcient communication,\
    \ especially when communicating low-powered\nbattery devices such as sensors and\
    \ other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when\ntwo distinct technologies\
    \ (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Speciﬁc device-\nlevel compatibility\
    \ problems might always persist when communication infrastructures\nmigrate to\
    \ next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely, how to\n\
    handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or difﬁcult-to-reach\n\
    places, as well as the potential high costs associated with building and maintaining\
    \ 5G\nnetworks.\nTable 2 compares protocols used for smart cities, while Table\

    \ excellent capacity and\nhigh data rates are possible. This technology’s ultra-lean\n\
    design seeks to decrease interference and improve system\npower efﬁciency by effectively\
    \ reducing always-on\ntransmissions [93,94].\nThis technology utilizes sophisticated\
    \ access procedures such\nas Beam Division and FBMC Multiple Access to adapt 4G\
    \ to\n5G networks. Beam Division Multiple Access (BDMA)\nschemes’ central design\
    \ principle is concurrently serving\nnumerous mobile users. This technique typically\
    \ uses an\northogonal beam, which suggests that resources can be\nallocated in\
    \ parallel to each mobile base station by separating\nthe antenna beam in accordance\
    \ with the position of the\nmobile stations to enable numerous accesses to the\
    \ base\nstations. This subsequently assists in improving the capacity\nof 5G networks\
    \ [79].\nE2E Network\nSlicing\nWAN\nIn the case of the NLoS\nstate, the effectiveness\

    \ runs\nat high frequencies\nbecause wireless\nchannels’ basic nature is\ninconsistent\
    \ when the\nfrequency changes to\nhigher values. Due to\nhigher frequencies’\n\
    extreme vulnerability to\ninterference from\nobstructions, this\ndisadvantage\
    \ exists.\nSubsequently, this\nhampers the throughput\nperformance of\nunderlying\

    \ 802.11 Standards\nTable 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features.\n\
    Table 4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features.\nStandards (Year\
    \ Released)\nEnhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11 (1997) (Original)\n\
    The standard and its amendments serve as the foundation for\nwireless network\
    \ products bearing the WiFi brand. This signiﬁes\ntwo raw data rates of 1 and\
    \ 2 Mbps that must be transferred via\nDSSS and FHSS at 2.4 GHz in the ISM band.\n\
    Wireless Standard (basic)\nIEEE 802.11b (1999)\nThis standard is intended to operate\
    \ in the 2.4 GHz spectrum;\nhowever, the level of interference issues is higher\
    \ when this\nstandard-based device tries to interoperate with many other\ndevices/standards\
    \ operating on the same band. It can attain a\ntheoretical data rate of 11 Mbps.\
    \ Nevertheless, dynamic\nadaptations can be applied to the transfer rate subject\
    \ to the current\ninterference level and signal power to minimize the error rate\
    \ (ARS\nPolicy). Depending on the channel conditions, the raw data rates\ncan\
    \ be adapted to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 1 Mbps. Additionally, it\nprovides somewhat\
    \ simpler deployment processes (e.g., upgrading\nthe current chipsets) as it demonstrates\
    \ backward compatibility\nwith the original standard due to the use of CDMA and\
    \ DSSS (same\nas the original standard) [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor\n\
    ranges are 115 feet and 460 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-1\nIEEE 802.11a (1999)\n\
    Designed to operate on the 5 GHz spectrum and to have the least\namount of interference\
    \ compared to other devices. Depending on\nthe needs, the raw data rates can be\
    \ changed to 48 Mbps, 36 Mbps,\n24 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 9 Mbps, and 6 Mbps.\
    \ However, it can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 54 Mbps. The coverage\
    \ indoor\nand outdoor ranges are 115 feet and 391 feet, respectively [89].\nWiFi-2\n\
    IEEE 802.11g (2003)\nAllows for device compatibility with devices that operate\
    \ and\nfollow IEEE 802.16b standards. It can also attain a theoretical\ntransfer\
    \ rate of 54 Mbps. In real-time situations, it can achieve a\npractical data rate\
    \ of 24 Mbps. Nonetheless, when IEEE\n802.11b-based devices are introduced into\
    \ IEEE 802.11g networks,\nor when these heterogeneous compliant devices interoperate,\
    \ the\nrate decreases drastically to accommodate IEEE 802.11b-based\ntransmission\
    \ speeds every time that the compliant device tries to\ncommunicate [89]. The\
    \ coverage indoor and outdoor ranges are\n148 feet and 296 feet, respectively.\n\
    WiFi-3\nIEEE 802.11e (2005)\nIt speciﬁes a set of QoS augmentations for WLAN applications\n\
    through extensive amendments to the MAC sub-layer. It addressed\nQoS requirements\
    \ by emphasizing two-channel access schemes:\n(1) the contention-based EDCA scheme\
    \ and (2) the contention-free\nHCCA scheme. This standard, via EDCA, provides\
    \ trafﬁc\nprioritization support based on QoS classes (similar to\ndifferentiated\
    \ services). Conversely, this standard suggests\nparameterized QoS (similar to\
    \ integrated services) via HCCA. It\nalso speciﬁes enhancement over the conventional\
    \ IEEE 802.11\npower saver method (APSD) and reduces the signaling load [95].\
    \ It\nis designed to operate at frequencies ranging from 2.4 to\n2.4835 GHz or\
    \ from 5.75 to 5.850 GHz. This standard also speciﬁes\nthat a high transmission\
    \ rate may not be sufﬁcient to meet the QoS\nrequirements imposed by real-time\
    \ audio, voice, video, and\nlive-streaming applications. Following that, the provisions\
    \ of trafﬁc\nprioritization at the MAC sub-layer were insisted upon.\nQoS improvements\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n24 of 63\nTable 4. Cont.\nStandards (Year Released)\n\
    Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11n (2009)\nThis standard was suggested\
    \ while keeping the increased speed\nrequirement in mind. Later, it was able to\
    \ boost the attainable\nspeeds of WiFi networks beyond what was possible with\
    \ 802.11g.\nAchieving such high performance required several new features,\nincluding\
    \ a modiﬁed OFDM scheme, power-saving mechanisms,\nantenna technology, MIMO, and\
    \ wider channel bandwidth.\nNonetheless, backward compatibility in the standard\
    \ has been\nsigniﬁcantly affected (reduced) under exceptional scenarios.\nWhenever\
    \ or not an old standard compliance-based device attempts\nto communicate with\
    \ an IEEE 802.11g-based device in an 802.11g\nnetwork, the network’s operation,\
    \ performance, and other\ncapabilities suffer signiﬁcantly. These standard-based\
    \ APs can\noperate in Legacy mode (choosing one standard amongst\n802.11a/b/g),\
    \ Mixed mode (choose (out of 802.11a/b/g/n) and\noperate on heterogeneous conditions),\
    \ and Greenﬁeld mode\n(operate with a single (common) 802.11n altogether) [89].\
    \ It can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 600 Mbps. The coverage indoor\n\
    and outdoor ranges are 230 feet and 821 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-4\nIEEE 802.11ac\
    \ (2013)\nThis standard (called initially VHT) was suggested while keeping\nincreased\
    \ speed requirements in mind (likewise with other\nstandards). This standard was\
    \ later able to increase the achievable\nspeeds (up to 1 Gbps (minimum) to 7 Gbps\
    \ (maximum)) of WiFi\nnetworks beyond what 802.11n was capable of. The standard\n\
    enables the transmission of HD videos, online interactive games,\nlive-streaming,\
    \ and other demanding applications. It operates\nusing MU-MIMO technology, which\
    \ enables a single AP and its\nantenna to send data concurrently to several devices.\
    \ As a result,\nthis helps to increase airtime efﬁciency so that every associated\n\
    client—regardless of the 802.11 types it operates on—ﬁnally\nreceives the amount\
    \ of airtime it is supposed to receive, depending\non the technology used.\nWiFi-5\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah (2017)\nDesigned to operate on unlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz,\
    \ it can\nprovide signiﬁcantly more transmission coverage than traditional\n802.11\
    \ standards, which typically operate on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.\nThis standard can\
    \ be employed in those scenarios where accessible\nbandwidth is comparatively\
    \ narrow. It can normally apply with\nWiFi (outdoor) for performing CTO, large-scale\
    \ WSNs (i.e., smart\ngrid), and extended-range hotspots. Supporting a reasonably\
    \ large\ntransmission range/coverage property aids in managing large-scale\nnetworks\
    \ where the number of devices may be much greater than\nwhat the conventional\
    \ 802.11 standard can support. It advises that\nchanges to the PHY and MAC layers\
    \ be made to provide important\nimprovements including energy-saving capabilities,\
    \ support for\naccommodating a high number of devices, reliable media access\n\
    techniques, and throughput performance improvement by using\nsmall frame formats\
    \ [96].\nExtended coverage, low-power\nWLAN\nIEEE 802.11ax (2021)\nThis standard\
    \ was proposed with the consideration of higher speed\nrequirements. Later, this\
    \ standard increased WiFi network\nachievable speeds above what was made possible\
    \ by earlier\nstandards. Speciﬁcally, it can offer support for a 10 Gbps data\
    \ rate,\nconsistency, and low power consumption. It operates using\nMU-MIMO and\
    \ MU-OFDMA multi-user technologies, which\nenables a single AP and its antenna\
    \ to send data concurrently to\nseveral end devices. Although the 802.11ac standard\
    \ is where\nMU-MIMO technology was ﬁrst introduced, 802.11ax now allows\nfor groups\
    \ of up to eight clients. In addition, this standard also\nsuggests several improvements\
    \ in spatial reusing policies and\npower-saver schemes [97].\nWiFi-6\n* ARS: Adaptive\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n25 of 63\n4.2. IEEE 802.15.1\nThe IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN\
    \ protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave\ntime division duplex\
    \ mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with a\n1 Mbps data\
    \ rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services designed\n\
    to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include Bluetooth\
    \ and\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the IoT [98].\
    \ The deployment\nof services offered for tracking and localization devices is\
    \ typically suggested by BLE-based\ndevices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.\
    \ These beacons produce a signal that other\ncompatible devices can pick up between\
    \ 50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises\ngreater indoor localization\
    \ accuracy than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can\nbe used for\
    \ a wide range of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch\n\
    of points of sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally,\
    \ to provide\nspeciﬁc services of interest, it is frequently required to combine\
    \ the BLE technology with\nother technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the\
    \ aim of BLE technology (Bluetooth\nClassic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous\
    \ wireless connection, i.e., BlueTooth\nBasic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR).\
    \ It became the perfect option for the IoT\nsince it permits connectivity and\
    \ audio-streaming applications using brief bursts of long-\ndistance radio, which\
    \ lowers the battery consumption of mobile devices (because they need\nnot be\
    \ connected all the time). Using the idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE\n\
    speciﬁcation, smartphones or regular phones can be linked to other heterogeneous\
    \ devices\n(such as headphones) in BR/EDR mode. Otherwise, they can be connected\
    \ to wearables\nin LE mode. A low-power radio called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends\
    \ to broadcast data\nacross 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range.\
    \ Wireless audio streaming is\nprimarily made possible through BCR, which has\
    \ evolved into the industry-standard radio\nprotocol for in-car entertainment\
    \ systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims to\ntransmit data over\
    \ 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To facilitate the\ndeployment\
    \ of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks to provide support\n\
    for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast; and, most\
    \ notably,\nmesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create distribution\
    \ and locating\nmaps utilizing ﬁngerprint templates for indoor device and user\
    \ localization. Due to BLE’s\ngreater susceptibility to abrupt fading and substantial\
    \ changes in received signal strength,\nit has been proven that using BLE is more\
    \ efﬁcient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101].\nHowever, Bluetooth technology\
    \ has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly\nwhen its BR/EDR mode\
    \ is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the\nmaster nodes\
    \ to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.\n\
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered\
    \ a variety\nof scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the\
    \ BR/EDR mode reveals\na lack of scalability that further restricts the performance\
    \ of the system.\n4.3. LoRA\nThe LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications\
    \ and operated as a low-\ndata-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum\
    \ that could go up to 10 km.\nLoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth:\
    \ 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Even while\nthis technology can function at the largest\
    \ bandwidth class, which further improves data\nrate, it still causes issues with\
    \ high power consumption, a shorter communication range,\nand an increase in the\
    \ likelihood of interference because it is free to operate in a wider\nfrequency\
    \ spectrum. This method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation\n\
    and a CSSM variant with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission\
    \ range\nwill expand as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption\
    \ will rise\nas well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby\
    \ making it resilient to\nchannel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not\
    \ differentiate the noise in the channel\nsuch as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK\
    \ modulation approach, which normally identiﬁes\nsignals that are 8 to 10 dB above\
    \ the noise ﬂoor, the CSSM feature enables this technology\nto sense, perceive,\
    \ and capture signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise ﬂoor [103]. Its\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n26 of 63\narchitecture uses a star network topology and includes\
    \ gateways and end nodes. In this\ndesign, end nodes are referred to as slaves\
    \ and run on battery-powered devices with\nlimited power, but gateways are thought\
    \ of as powerful machines that gather data from\nslave nodes. Furthermore, LoRaWAN\
    \ is a communication layer that operates on top of\nLoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates\
    \ the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability\nand suitability\
    \ for low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over\ncellular\
    \ technologies, which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice,\n\
    LoRaWAN improved network features and functionalities by addressing the concept\
    \ of\na specialized server (network) and speciﬁcally deﬁning numerous device types\
    \ to meet\nthe needs of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet\
    \ ﬁltering, and\npacket scheduling are all made possible using specialized network\
    \ servers. LoRaWAN\nhas also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission\
    \ power and rate, which\naids in optimizing network performance in terms of power\
    \ consumption and throughput.\nThis technology can be employed for a wide range\
    \ of applications, such as smart health\nnursing [104], trafﬁc monitoring [105],\
    \ agriculture monitoring [106], localization [107],\nand smart grid applications\
    \ [108]. In particular, this technology is useful for non-latency-\nsensitive\
    \ applications and those that call for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al.\
    \ [109]\nand Adelantado et al. [110] emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart\
    \ metering,\ntracking, and localization-based applications. At the same time,\
    \ it is not so feasible for\nreal-time monitoring and video surveillance.\n4.4.\
    \ WiMAX\nWiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential peak data rate of 60\
    \ Mbps for an\nentire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps for an entirely\
    \ uplink operation, based on\nthe original IEEE 802.16 air interface standard\
    \ (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amend-\nment [112]. It can be done using two\
    \ antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz.\nAdditionally, it may provide support\
    \ for multimedia services with different trafﬁc charac-\nteristics and wide area\
    \ mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety\nof QoS\
    \ scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as Internet\
    \ data\ntrafﬁc, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio trafﬁc, and voice and video\
    \ streams [113].\nTable 5 shows the speciﬁed WiMAX standards and their operational\
    \ parameters [114].\nThis standard provides a communication channel between geographically\
    \ separated de-\nvices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges\
    \ between 30 km and\n100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such\
    \ as high installation costs\nand the possibility of complications and irregularities\
    \ when dealing with high-deﬁnition\nmultimedia trafﬁc.\nWireless network trafﬁc\
    \ has recently increased extraordinarily due to the rapid pro-\nliferation of\
    \ smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators. These devices, along with\n\
    smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based specialized devices,\
    \ are\nthe most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network environments. In\
    \ such a dense\nnetwork environment, interference is a critical issue that must\
    \ be addressed if satisfactory\nperformance and, thus, proﬁcient spatial frequency\
    \ reuse is required. Subsequently, the\nstandards IEEE 802.11 were designed and\
    \ implemented to support these requirements.\nNumerous international organizations,\
    \ including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved\ntheir technologies in response\
    \ to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance,\nthe original IEEE\
    \ 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior\nthroughput\
    \ performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as\
    \ a\nresult, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a\
    \ result, to address\nthe challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11ah\
    \ Task Group (TG) was formed by\nthe IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to\
    \ redesign and extend the applicability\nof WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They\
    \ focused on the critical issue of power-aware\nefﬁcient schemes and protocols\
    \ to extend the functionality and applicability of 802.11-based\nnetworks while\
    \ dealing with a variety of small power-constrained smart outdoor and\nindoor\
    \ devices [55,97].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n27 of 63\nTable 5. WiMAX standards\

    \ Protocol Suite\nIn IoT, smart sensing motes, devices, and actuators share unique\
    \ features such as\nconstrained memory, power, and processing capabilities; the\
    \ need for facilitating real-time\nrequirements of smart applications; extremely\
    \ vulnerable radio environments; and little to\nno human involvement after deployment\
    \ [115]. By enabling communication amongst these\ndevices utilizing low-power-cost\
    \ technologies, a new infrastructure for deployed smart\nservices has been formed.\
    \ Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP protocol suite might\nprovide a solution\
    \ and be ﬂexible enough for a variety of evolving IoT communication\nscenarios.\
    \ Unfortunately, there were additional challenges that network administrators,\n\
    designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers were searching for the\
    \ best way\nto install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally\
    \ use the system’s limited\nresources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of\
    \ such power constraints, researchers\nhighlighted the requirements of low-power\
    \ Layer-2 technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4)\nand low-power WiFi usage. In\
    \ contrast with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies\noperate with smaller\
    \ maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission\nspeeds. IoT network\
    \ protocol designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining\nthe ideal\
    \ MTU size. Another obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless\n\
    networks and thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies.\
    \ This\nvulnerability brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture:\n\
    (1)\nThe current IP addressing model cannot assist mesh communication (since it\
    \ relies on\na multi-link subnet prototype) at all.\n(2)\nIn mesh communication,\
    \ the multicasting and broadcasting communication methods are\nquite expensive,\
    \ power-demanding, and prohibitive as the network nodes are extremely\npower constrained.\
    \ Moreover, unicasting is the only remaining alternative method.\n(3)\nUnicasting\
    \ is power intensive in and of itself because it may take many hops while\nforwarding\
    \ and may wake up an excessive number of nodes that are asleep. Notably,\nidle\
    \ nodes and hops can modify the radio state’s operation mode to save power. Ad-\n\
    ditionally, a large amount of power is used and saved by a node during transmission,\n\
    reception, overhearing, idle, and sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful\n\
    delivery, we cannot just alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective\n\
    coordination and intricate synchronization [117,118].\n(4)\nThere is a high requirement\
    \ for scalable routing/forwarding schemes for IP communi-\ncation to take place\
    \ over mesh architectural systems.\n(5)\nFor many IoT applications requiring data\
    \ prioritizing and customized control, original\nTCP-suited features such as those\
    \ operational on ﬁxed MSS sizes (such as MTU sizes)\nthat further lead to silly\
    \ window syndrome or in-order byte-stream delivery to ensure\ndependability, are\
    \ unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF started deﬁning standard\nInternet protocols\
    \ such as RPL [120] for such specialized environments to minimize\nprotocol overheads\
    \ that impair the computing ability and memory management of\nthese specialized\
    \ resource-constrained devices.\nWiFi-based infrastructure networks enable backhauling\
    \ support, which helps estab-\nlish and sustain seamless connectivity among smart\
    \ IoT devices. In smart home wireless\nnetworks, this form of connectivity can\
    \ be provided through TCP connections. The TCP/IP\nprotocol suite supports dependable\
    \ data delivery and congestion control strategies to main-\ntain network throughput\
    \ performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP is a protocol that has been\nregularly modiﬁed\
    \ and improved over the years to effectively transport large amounts of\nbyte-stream\
    \ in-ordered data via resilient P2P connections with comparatively lower latency\n\
    needs. IoT services deal with atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP\
    \ protocol\nsuite-based protocols, such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns\
    \ adequately [119].\nThere are severe problems that TCP faces when it deals with\
    \ an IoT application:\n(1)\nTCP connection establishment and termination (three-way\
    \ handshaking) incur signiﬁ-\ncant overhead in the system as most communication\
    \ in an IoT application includes\nthe transmission of brief segments and relatively\
    \ little data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n29 of 63\n(2)\nTCP functionality needs\
    \ resilient P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these con-\nnections\
    \ in an IoT network environment because smart sensors and other connected\ndevices\
    \ switch their mode of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119].\n\
    (3)\nSome IoT applications might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns,\n\
    and enabling such patterns via TCP will result in substantial network overhead\
    \ in the\nentire IoT system and high-power consumption.\n(4)\nSome IoT services\
    \ have very granular delay requirements, and any extra delay in\nthe form of connection\
    \ establishment or MSS creation (waiting for data to ﬁll the\nentire MSS) is completely\
    \ unacceptable for their performance. Thus, TCP is unable to\nprovide much support\
    \ for these IoT services.\n(5)\nIoT applications that rely on wireless communication\
    \ scenarios must deal with crit-\nical wireless channel characteristics such as\
    \ channel error, interference, and wire-\nless interface properties that result\
    \ in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer\ncontention-induced, and collision-induced\
    \ packet losses. When TCP operates in such\na setting, its stringent in-order\
    \ delivery requirements and retransmission policies\n(i.e., fast retransmission)\
    \ may occasionally result in very serious system problems\nsuch as Head-of-Line\
    \ (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in\na reduction\
    \ in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121–124].\nFurthermore,\
    \ wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may fur-\nther impair\
    \ TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP\nRetransmission\
    \ Time Out timer.\nSome standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement\
    \ Layer-4\nfunctionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed\
    \ to utilize UDP as an\nunderlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should\
    \ depend on an application’s\nrequirements, which may vary from application to\
    \ application. However, TCP and its\nupdated variants rely on the concept of data\
    \ delivery deferment and try to perform retrans-\nmissions from an already created\
    \ copy in the sender buffer. However, this is not the only\napproach to dealing\
    \ with packet losses in the network. Another method is for AppL to\naccept packet\
    \ delivery that is not completely ﬂawless and proceed with its current opera-\n\
    tions. This feature will be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution.\
    \ Additionally,\nretransmission is an additional option. However, AppL should\
    \ handle this retransmission\nrather than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such\
    \ as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost data\nbits, doing so enables the source\
    \ application to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in situations\nwhere real-time\
    \ services are severely constrained, the transmitting application may transmit\n\
    fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair” the effects of the\
    \ initial loss [126].\nClark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these concepts and\
    \ subsequently introduced the\nconcept of Application Level Framing (ALF). Implementing\
    \ Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself\nbrings the idea of employing ALF into the\
    \ system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF,\na network can recognize individual\
    \ Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently\ncan offer support for ﬂexible\
    \ Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission\nprocedures for\
    \ diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using\nin-network\
    \ caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding\n\
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails\
    \ to provide\nsupport for the ALF scheme [119].\n4.6. Compound TCP for IoT\nCompound\
    \ TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel\nutilization\
    \ and fairness performances. It will play a signiﬁcant role in home networks with\n\
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128].\nPokhrel and Williamson [115]\
    \ studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an\nIoT scenario involving\
    \ sensors and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home\nappliances).\
    \ They analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of con-\n\
    nections made using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks\
    \ in the\npresence of signiﬁcant buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and severely degraded\
    \ transmission\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n30 of 63\nchannel circumstances. The\
    \ authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements\nfor all IoT devices\
    \ as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional bandwidth-\nhungry\
    \ Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated a\n\
    thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted classical\n\
    devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and signiﬁcantly\n\
    deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of [115,129] suggested\
    \ models\nthat aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion and ﬂow control of\
    \ several concurrently\nrunning competitive long-lived compound TCP connections.\
    \ In evaluating and developing\nthese models, they considered MAC-level retransmissions,\
    \ link-layer contention, channel\nfailures, and collision. The authors of [130]\
    \ utilized a transient model suggesting a new\nqueue management scheme to capture\
    \ the interactions of short-lived TCP ﬂows (the most\nworkable ﬂows in IoT scenarios)\
    \ over conventional trafﬁc patterns over WiFi networks.\nHowever, the performance\
    \ of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using\na single shared\
    \ Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale well and\n\
    provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially when\
    \ wireless\nchannels are often reused by several APs [131].\n4.7. Viewpoints of\
    \ Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems\nThe network architectures for IoT are\
    \ heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless\nMesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular\
    \ Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks\n(MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due\
    \ to the large-scale production of intelligent sensing\ndevices, survivability\
    \ and self-organization of deployed functional networks are essential. A\nWSN\
    \ is deployed for a variety of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and\
    \ military\napplications. It is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which\
    \ the sensor nodes\ncommunicate over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered,\
    \ low-power sensors\ncapable of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating,\
    \ and regulating communication.\nNumerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2,\
    \ TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have\nbeen suggested. Therefore, some standards were\
    \ introduced to enable interaction and\nother compatibilities among these numerous\
    \ heterogeneous platforms. For example, the\nIEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates\
    \ the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT. WSNs provide\ncritical functionalities\
    \ for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered battery-operated\nEnd Devices\
    \ (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to the Internet. A WSN can be\n\
    considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several equipped sensor nodes.\
    \ Due\nto the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability must be\
    \ obtained from the\nviewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability\
    \ issue, various works\nsuggested a standardized arrangement that could enable\
    \ the usage of IP over LoWPAN.\nThe IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability\
    \ for Low power and Lossy\nNetworks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard\
    \ outlines the physical and data link\nlayers of the network and offers a low-cost\
    \ framework for network operations. To link\nLPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may\
    \ be used as an adaptation layer to enable sensors\nto implement an IP stack and\
    \ become approachable by other conventional devices over\nthe Internet. This adaptability\
    \ layer also supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables\na variety of applications\
    \ and permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding\nalgorithms at the\
    \ Internet layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot\n\
    be supported when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72]\
    \ considers\nthe LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained,\
    \ and they are\nconnected by some lossy links that only support low data rates.\
    \ These links are thought\nto be extremely unstable and have poor performance\
    \ in terms of packet delivery rates. In\nsuch specialized networks, the trafﬁc\
    \ patterns are often P2MP and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint\n(MP2MP) rather than just\
    \ P2P [72]. These networks contain hundreds of smart devices.\nThis makes the\
    \ implementation of routing policies more difﬁcult than ever. In addition,\nnumerous\
    \ existing traditional ad-hoc wireless network routing methods, such as DSR and\n\
    AODV, cannot manage these unique situations and unforeseen circumstances. Designing\n\
    and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking settings has been more difﬁcult\
    \ due to the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n31 of 63\nmobility aspect and the resource\
    \ limitations at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’\ndesign principles\
    \ emphasize QoS elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end\nlatency [134,135].\
    \ The forwarding rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations\ntake\
    \ into account the increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the\
    \ node\nenergy [117,136]. As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and\
    \ maintain solely\ninside their operational infrastructure, this was very feasible.\
    \ However, the interoperability\nof these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when\
    \ such networks are integrated with\nIoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration\
    \ with IoT needs novel routing policies\nthat support scalability and assure QoS,\
    \ fairness, and connectivity between two nodes\n(both in APs and ad-hoc networks)\
    \ with the least amount of power consumption. The\nstandard classical forwarding\
    \ strategies were intended to ensure QoS between a pair of\ndevices/nodes. In\
    \ the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures should suggest\nenough\
    \ fairness so that each node can sufﬁciently get enough chances to communicate\
    \ with\nnearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing solutions\
    \ are followed\nto decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation. Researchers\
    \ have often raised\nconcerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules, which\
    \ lead to the consumption of\nexcess energy in networks while taking into account\
    \ mobile and static ad-hoc network\nscenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood\
    \ of frequent network disconnections,\nroute failures, and even network partitioning,\
    \ all contributing to the system’s signiﬁcant\nMAC-level and routing-level overhead\
    \ problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the\nhigh-power consumption problem,\
    \ many researchers presented numerous smart routing\nparadigms [118,134,135,137].\
    \ Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the\ndesired QoS.\n\
    Cross-layer design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion\n\
    control are well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless\
    \ channel\nattributes. Therefore, signiﬁcant work has been done in these areas.\
    \ These designs provide\nsupport for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely\
    \ variable channel parameters\nat lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing\
    \ and Transport layers to further\noptimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations\
    \ decisions [121,134,135,138–140].\nThe Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ indicates how well a device can hear a\nsignal from an AP or router. A network\
    \ layer forwarding policy can effectively utilize the\nRSSI (accessible through\
    \ lower layers dynamically) to assess link quality. AODV and DSR\nare examples\
    \ of the traditional ad-hoc routing protocols used in various smart forwarding\n\
    systems designed for IoT scenarios. The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing\
    \ mecha-\nnisms were suggested for the IoT scenarios and talked about node and\
    \ link disjoint paths\nwhile discovering routes. However, the proposed schemes\
    \ do not shed light and discuss\nanything related to performance issues when there\
    \ is a signiﬁcant level of interference in\nthe network because of trafﬁc running\
    \ parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned\ntechniques do not always perform\
    \ well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.\nRecently, the scheme [140]\
    \ considered different critical factors such as interference level,\nlink-layer\
    \ contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related to\n\
    wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution\
    \ policies’\nefﬁciency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,\
    \ different possible\ndisjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might\
    \ be able to interfere\nwith one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting\
    \ behavior in wireless\ncommunication. Consequently, such separate disconnected\
    \ pathways could be utilized to\nenhance the performance of the network as a whole\
    \ [138,140].\nWhen employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend\
    \ on WSN-based\nnetworking connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from\
    \ smart things to sink\nnodes. These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes\
    \ (IoT-GW). To balance\nenergy usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous\
    \ such static and mobile IoT-GWs\ncan be deployed in the system. In the whole\
    \ system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous\ntypes of critical data, are connected\
    \ to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee speciﬁed\nthree forms of devices:\
    \ Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee End Device, and\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2490\n32 of 63\nthree forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh.\
    \ Moreover, the Zigbee stack\nembraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the\
    \ case of star network topology, the\nReduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e.,\
    \ RFDs and FFDs) can communicate with the\nPAN central coordinator only. They\
    \ are not capable of communicating with one another.\nHere, the PAN coordinator\
    \ may be powered by mains, while the RFDs and FFDs run on\nlow-powered limited\
    \ battery devices. Moreover, in the case of the mesh network topology,\nany device\
    \ can communicate to within-range devices at a point of time. Moreover, this\n\
    topology contains a PAN coordinator, which can communicate with other RFDs and\
    \ FFDs.\nFurthermore, this networking topology offers support for the usage of\
    \ the integrated\nforwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree and AODV routing\
    \ procedures. Lastly,\nthe tree (cluster) network topology is a subset form of\
    \ mesh networking topology, consisting\nof RFDs and FFDs (which may act as coordinators).\
    \ However, the FFD count could be\nmore than the RFD count in the network. RFDs\
    \ may attach to tree (cluster) network\ntopology as the end nodes in the system.\
    \ The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization\nfunctionalities to other connected\
    \ coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single\nPAN coordinator amongst\
    \ these coordinators [144].\n4.8. IoT Application Protocols\nEach IoT application\
    \ is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.\nThese protocols\
    \ can be the following:\n•\nRepresentational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer\
    \ Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is\nthe primary client/server protocol that\
    \ adopts the request/response model. HTPP has\nbeen related to the REST architecture\
    \ [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar\nentities over web-based services.\
    \ The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices\nto make their status readily\
    \ available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read,\nupdate, delete)\
    \ functions [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET,\nPUT, and DELETE\
    \ techniques of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build\na REST model\
    \ for dissimilar IoT devices [148].\n•\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ [149]: It is a lightweight RESTful protocol lately\nstandardized by the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF). CoAP is used by IoT\ndevices for IP-based, HTTP-like\
    \ interactions. It uses UDP with acknowledgment mes-\nsages to set up reliable\
    \ communication based on a request/response interaction. It has\nreduced complexity,\
    \ and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained IoT applications\nand machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) communication.\n•\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [150] is\
    \ established for IoT messaging.\nAccording to MQTT design principles, network\
    \ bandwidth and device resource re-\nquirements should be kept to a minimum while\
    \ also aiming to assure dependability\nand some level of delivery assurance. Since\
    \ June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by\nISO as a standard (ISO/IEC 20922). The\
    \ protocol continues to progress by formalizing\npopular capability options and\
    \ adding new functionalities. The most recent version,\nMQTT v5.0, was released\
    \ in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe\nparadigm. Clients connect\
    \ to a centralized broker when using MQTT.\n•\nOpen Platform Communications Uniﬁed\
    \ Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoper-\nability standard is used for the\
    \ secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial\nautomation domain and\
    \ other industries. It is platform independent and ensures\nthe seamless ﬂow of\
    \ information among IoT devices from multiple vendors. It sup-\nports two different\
    \ communication methods: the Client/Server method as well as\nPublish/Subscribe\
    \ (e.g., over UDP or MQTT) to mainly meet different industry re-\nquirements from\
    \ the production systems to edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main\nIoT vendors\
    \ including IBM, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage\nsecure, standardized\
    \ information exchange in edge-to-cloud applications based on\nOPC UA.\n•\nExtensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is\n\
    based on text messages that use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n33 of 63\nit can implement both request/response and\
    \ publish/subscribe methods by using\nsuitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant\
    \ messages between clients, and this\nhappens in real-time using a push mechanism\
    \ to avoid increasing unnecessary network\nloads. XMPP also determines the state\
    \ of an XMPP entity as online, ofﬂine, busy, etc.\n•\nAdvanced Message Queuing\
    \ Protocol (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing\nbusiness messages between\
    \ applications or organizations using TCP. It connects sys-\ntems, feeds business\
    \ processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits\nonward the\
    \ instructions that achieve their goals using the point/point and pub-\nlish/subscribe\
    \ interaction modes. AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of\nmessage orientation;\
    \ queuing; routing; security; reliability; and interoperability.\n•\nData Distribution\
    \ Service (DDS) [154]: DDS was developed by the Open Management\nGroup (OMG).\
    \ DDS is a real-time M2M protocol that enables dependable, high-\nperformance,\
    \ interoperable, scalable data exchanges using a publish–subscribe pattern.\n\
    DDS provides low-latency data connectivity, high reliability, and scalability\
    \ in publish–\nsubscribe and request/response patterns over TCP and UDP. The needs\
    \ of various\nIoT applications requiring real-time data exchange can be addressed\
    \ using DDS. Such\napplications are air trafﬁc control, transportation systems,\
    \ autonomous vehicles, and\nsmart grid management.\nLastly, Glaroudis et al. [155]\
    \ provided a comparison among IoT application protocols\nin terms of well-accepted\
    \ key performance indicators and discussed their suitability in the\nframework\
    \ of smart farming.\n5. Networking Architectures and Protocols\n5.1. Generic Architectures\n\
    Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an urban IoT’s enabling technolo-\n\
    gies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated the implementation of\
    \ an IoT\nisland as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City of Padova. In the IoT,\
    \ two methods provide\ndata access to objects/things. The ﬁrst involves deploying\
    \ multi-hop mesh networks with\nshort-range communication among network nodes\
    \ using unlicensed frequency. The second\ninvolves using licensed frequency band\
    \ long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM).\nCentenaro et al. [156] presented\
    \ a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wire-\nless connectivity)\
    \ called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based\non a star topology\
    \ characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in\nthe unlicensed\
    \ sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide\nconnectivity\
    \ in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed\n\
    the advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efﬁciency,\n\
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled\
    \ SCA\nthat uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled\
    \ street\nlighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental\
    \ research\nfacility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander\
    \ supports testing\nproposed protocols, services, and conﬁgurations in a realistic\
    \ setting at an appropriate\nscale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is\
    \ a signiﬁcant part of IoT. Vilajosana\nand Dohler [159] reviewed currently used\
    \ smart city M2M technologies (i.e., sensors, data\nloggers, wireless modems,\
    \ and gateway). They considered one of the most famous deploy-\nment use cases,\
    \ i.e., smart parking. In any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount\n\
    of M2M communication requests occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways\n\
    cannot face this challenge. Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control\
    \ model for\nM2M communications. Their model differentiates all M2M requests into\
    \ delay-sensitive\nand delay-tolerant. Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant\
    \ requests by routing them into\none low-priority queue, aiming to reduce the\
    \ number of requests from various devices\nto the access point in the IoT for\
    \ smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up\narchitecture after\
    \ analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture has four\n\
    layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each layer integrates\n\
    security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer, located at the\
    \ bottom of the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n34 of 63\narchitecture, collects\
    \ data from physical devices. The transmission layer is located above\nthe sensing\
    \ layer. Several communication technologies are used to transmit data from the\n\
    transmission layer to the (upper) data management layer. The data management layer\n\
    performs data fusion, data analysis, data processing, and data storing. It stores\
    \ valuable\ninformation that various applications use at the application layer\
    \ to provide services.\nThe majority of the above works mainly focus on a single\
    \ characteristic, such as quality\nof service [162].\nMarques et al. [163] proposed\
    \ a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities infrastructure\nmanagement architecture\
    \ that allows the integration of physical objects, communication\ninfrastructure,\
    \ cloud platform, and IoT-based services in a pervasive way. This architecture\n\

    35 of 63\nare processed by a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing\
    \ unit\nresponsible for gathering information used by the application providing\
    \ a service.\nThe local processing unit brings elements of edge computing, as\
    \ it pushes part of the\ncomputation to edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating\
    \ all the computation in\na centralized remote server.\n2.\nThe Communication\
    \ Layer: The architecture supports a variety of network access\ntechnologies.\
    \ The communication layer supports the implementation of various\nwireless technologies.\
    \ The local processing unit located at the Physical Objects Layer\ndeﬁnes the\
    \ technology to be used and relays data to the communication layer using\nthe\
    \ interface of a network access point.\n3.\nThe Cloud Platform Layer provides\
    \ three services: processing, database queries, and\ndata storage. In the context\
    \ of providing services for smart cities, each of these services\ncan be dynamically\
    \ allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably,\nonly some\
    \ applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.\n\
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation\n\
    is optional.\n4.\nThe Services Layer implements four groups, which are called\
    \ classes of services:\n(I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III)\
    \ Infrastructure, and (IV) Tech-\nnology. In each class, different kinds of applications\
    \ can be implemented to deal with\nthe challenges of smart cities.\nThis architecture\
    \ is a generic solution, so the underlying layers are designed to offer\nsupport\
    \ to the applications. Therefore, it can be adapted to the speciﬁc implementa-\n\
    tion of a given service. To this end, the authors adapted their architecture to\
    \ a waste\nmanagement scenario.\nAnother multi-level smart city architecture [164]\
    \ was built on semantic web technolo-\ngies, and its design is mostly used in\
    \ smart city wireless sensor network applications. Data\ncollection, data processing,\
    \ integration and reasoning, and device control and alerts make\nup its four layers.\
    \ Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s edge, Gheisari et al. [165]\n\
    suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in the smart city that protects\
    \ privacy.\nSaadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer architecture for mobile\
    \ object authentication in the\ncontext of IoT smart cities. Their architecture\
    \ is based on the applicability of a proposed hier-\narchical elliptic curve identity-based\
    \ signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167]\npresented a Fog-based\
    \ smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network\n(FOCAN). To\
    \ reduce latency and increase the efﬁciency of services among things with\nvarious\
    \ capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating\n\
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through\
    \ the smart\ncity environment. One of FOCAN’s primary beneﬁts is that the IoT\
    \ device can deliver\nservices effectively and with less energy consumption.\n\
    5.2. SDN-IoT Architectures\nSoftware-deﬁned networking (SDN) [168] is an approach\
    \ to enable ﬂexible and efﬁ-\ncient network conﬁguration to enhance a network.\
    \ SDN can provide many advantages\nfor conﬁguring city networks to support different\
    \ applications. For example, SDN can\nimprove the QoS of city networks against\
    \ link failures [169] and meet smart city latency de-\nmands [170]. While some\
    \ efforts are investigating this approach for supporting SCAs, there\nis room\
    \ for developing more advanced management and networking mechanisms in SDN\nfor\
    \ efﬁcient, reliable, and secure network conﬁgurations in smart cities. Jazaeri\
    \ et al. [171]\nconsidered the advantages of integrating edge computing, SDN,\
    \ and IoT technologies and\nreviewed different frameworks and platforms.\nLiu\
    \ et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples urban sensing applications\n\
    from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture, centralized controllers\
    \ manage\nphysical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition, transmission,\
    \ and processing services\nto develop urban sensing applications. Bi et al. [173]\
    \ proposed a scalable SDN-enabled\narchitecture that integrates a variety of smart\
    \ city components and provides reliable and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n36 of\
    \ 63\ntimely scheduling for big data transfer to support smart city services.\
    \ They also studied\nthe time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS)\
    \ problem under this architecture\nand proposed a heuristic with an intelligent\
    \ scheme that can maximize the throughput and\nschedule the multi-ﬂow transfer\
    \ dynamically.\nIoT systems collect and process data vulnerable to availability,\
    \ integrity, and privacy\nthreats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed a collaborative\
    \ and intelligent-network-based in-\ntrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture,\
    \ namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT\nnetworks. SeArch is a security architecture\
    \ in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS\nnodes, i.e., Edge-IDS, Fog-IDS,\
    \ and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration\namong nodes.\n\
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy\
    \ in smart\ncities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network\
    \ architecture for the\nsmart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN\
    \ and Blockchain technologies. To\nachieve efﬁciency and address the current limitations,\
    \ their architecture is divided into\ncore and edge networks. By designing a hybrid\
    \ architecture, their architecture inherits\nthe strength of centralized and distributed\
    \ network architectures. “PrivySharing” [177]\nis a Blockchain-based innovative\
    \ framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data\nsharing in a smart city\
    \ environment. This framework protects data privacy by segmenting\nthe blockchain\
    \ network into different channels, consisting of a limited number of approved\n\
    businesses and handling a certain category of data, such as health, smart auto,\
    \ smart\nenergy, or ﬁnancial information. Additionally, smart contracts contain\
    \ access control rules\nthat regulate who has access to the users’ data within\
    \ a channel. In addition, private\ndata gathering and encryption are used to further\
    \ isolate and safeguard the data within\na channel.\nIslam et al. [178] designed\
    \ a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT\necosystem that addresses\
    \ the existing challenges through the use of the technologies\nBlockchain, SDN,\
    \ and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architec-\nture\
    \ confronts the problems of scalability, ﬂexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,\n\
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats.\n5.3. Architectures\
    \ for Smart Grid\nThe automated and intelligent management of the next-generation\
    \ electric power\nsystems determines their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Smart\
    \ Grid (SG) is the name given to\nthe next generation of electricity systems,\
    \ which are anticipated to offer various beneﬁts\nover the current systems in\
    \ terms of digitization, ﬂexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustain-\nability,\
    \ and customization [179]. Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies\n\
    to improve power quality. Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric\n\
    devices remotely in real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate\
    \ their local\ndevices. The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented\
    \ by using the electrical and\ncommunication infrastructures that connect the\
    \ transmission and customer domains. The\ndistribution domain includes distribution\
    \ feeders and transformers to supply electricity.\nIt interacts with much different\
    \ equipment, such as distributed energy resources (DERs),\nplug-in electric vehicles\
    \ (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), and sensors with\ncommunication\
    \ capability. The distribution domain is responsible for delivering electricity\n\
    to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability. To provide quality\
    \ electricity,\nthe stability of this domain is monitored and controlled.\nTypical\
    \ applications [44] of the smart grid communications network are automatic\nmeter\
    \ reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and DERs/microgrid.\n\
    DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked to the distribution\
    \ system.\nDistributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS), or a combination\
    \ of renewable\nand non-renewable sources are all possible sources for DER. Solar\
    \ panels, wind turbines,\ncombustion turbines, fuel cells, battery storage systems,\
    \ etc., are a few examples of DER.\nAn electric power system with one or more\
    \ DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    37 of 63\nThe communication infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities\
    \ of the\nsmart grid and complies with performance standards. This infrastructure\
    \ connects a huge\nnumber of electric devices and manages complex device communications.\
    \ As a result, it is\nbuilt in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected\
    \ individual sub-networks, and each\nsub-network is responsible for separate geographical\
    \ regions. The extremely dispersed\nsmaller area networks that support the power\
    \ systems at various locations are connected by\nWANs, which act as the communication’s\
    \ backbone. When the control centers are located a\ngreat distance from the substations\
    \ or the end-users, the real-time measurements made at\nthe electric devices are\
    \ transported to the control centers through the WANs, and in the\nopposite direction,\
    \ the WANs carry out the instruction communications from the control\ncenters\
    \ to the electric devices.\nThe authors of [43] present a communication architecture\
    \ in an SG. This architecture\nincludes (1) an energy smart house with electric\
    \ appliances connected to the smart grid,\n(2) a residential complex with AMI,\
    \ (3) a residential subdivision installed with solar panels,\n(4) a PEV charging\
    \ station, (5) a power substation, and (6) power transmission lines. In this\n\
    architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as the backbone in connecting the distributed\
    \ sub-\nnetworks. Demertzis et al. [180] presented and categorized the communication\
    \ network\nstandards that have been established for smart grids and should be\
    \ considered in planning\nand implementing new infrastructures. Such standards\
    \ are IEC 61850 for substation\nautomation. This standard is based on open architecture\
    \ and incorporates sampling\nand timing synchronization speciﬁcations based on\
    \ IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181].\nNotably, IEEE 1588 is the standard for a\
    \ precision clock synchronization protocol for\nnetworked measurement and control\
    \ systems [182].\nDue to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)\
    \ throughout the\npower grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution\
    \ networks in smart grids would\nundergo signiﬁcant changes to accommodate the\
    \ nature of non-radial power ﬂow. For the\nmost part, the low-voltage distribution\
    \ networks where RERs (such as solar cells) may be\nattached are not monitored\
    \ by the majority of the present supervisory control and data ac-\nquisition (SCADA)\
    \ systems for power grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control,\nAbdrabou\
    \ [183] presented a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse\n\
    structure that may supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage\
    \ distribu-\ntion networks. A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also\
    \ presented as a useful\nmethod for prioritizing data transfer across the newly\
    \ introduced network architecture.\nHetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network\
    \ design with a speciﬁc QoS routing method\nfor power distribution grid applications.\
    \ It delivers QoS assurances across the network\nwhile taking into account three\
    \ factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability. The authors\ncreated two components\
    \ to accomplish this:\n•\nA multipath routing mechanism that compensates critical\
    \ applications for their high-\nreliability requirements by using end-to-end physically\
    \ disjoint paths, and\n•\nAltruistic resource allocation with the QoS routing\
    \ mechanism that targets communi-\ncation with QoS guarantees for applications\
    \ with strict QoS requirements.\nThe ﬁndings in [184] show that the HetGrid overlay\
    \ network architecture enables ex-\ntremely effective, trustworthy, and QoS-aware\
    \ communication in heterogeneous networks.\nThe major characteristics that set\
    \ SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are\nthe ability to execute\
    \ two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time\npricing. The present\
    \ SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to\nbe protocol\
    \ independent. Therefore, global communication network management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approaches have been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network\nadministrators\
    \ may more efﬁciently manage their networks by separating the control plane\n\
    from the data plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication\n\
    networks. SDN implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efﬁciency\n\
    and resilience. SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and\
    \ protocols\nby virtue of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity\
    \ capabilities to\ncope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185]\
    \ presented SDN-based\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n38 of 63\nSGC architectures,\
    \ along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for SDN-\nbased SGC\
    \ and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to\n\
    SDN-based SGC.\nAlam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication\
    \ networks in\nterms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,\
    \ and applications.\nThey proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication\
    \ Network for Smart Grid.\nCR is a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platform that can\
    \ quickly reconﬁgure its operating\nparameters, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ compression algorithm, and error coding\ntechniques, according to changing circumstances\
    \ and requirements, through cognition. In\nsuch an SDR platform, radio transceivers\
    \ can switch functions and operations on demand\nonly. Molokomme et al. [187]\
    \ reviewed architectures that aim to accomplish the various\nand strict QoS requirements\
    \ in SG communication systems.\nWireless communication networks have been motivated\
    \ to harvest energy from\nambient environments and run energy-efﬁciently for economic\
    \ and ecological beneﬁts\nthrough improvements in the smart power grid and the\
    \ advocacy of “green communica-\ntions”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments\
    \ in energy harvesting, redistribution,\ntrade, and planning for future wireless\
    \ networks integrating with smart grids. The authors\nconsidered the optimization\
    \ of various energy-harvesting wireless systems as well as tradi-\ntional models\
    \ of renewable energy-harvesting technologies. Moreover, they discussed how\n\
    to distribute redundant (unused) energy generated by cellular networks, plan for\
    \ energy\nunder dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and engage in two-way\
    \ energy\ntrading using smart grids.\nFrom a different viewpoint, including IoT\
    \ devices and providing connectivity, au-\ntomation, and monitoring for such devices\
    \ enables SG systems to sustain multiple network\noperations during the generation,\
    \ distribution, transmission, and expenditure of energy.\nNumerous IoT-aided SG\
    \ systems have been proposed in the literature. The survey [189] on\nIoT-aided\
    \ SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures, uses, and prototypes.\n\
    5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings\nThere are various building applications\
    \ such as heating, cooling, load control, air\nquality, ventilation, lighting,\
    \ water management, and cooking gas management. A smart\nbuilding incorporates\
    \ the major building systems on a common network and functionality\nto provide\
    \ operational efﬁciency, ﬁre safety, and security. A smart building architecture\n\
    (SBA) manages several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation,\n\
    air cleaning, HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation\n\
    and monitoring); smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management);\
    \ a\nsmart ﬁre detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart\
    \ building [190]\nhas security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality\
    \ system, a ﬁre alarm system, a\nwater management system, and an energy management\
    \ system. Moreover, it can detect\nintrusion and supports HVAC services.\nDiverse\
    \ SBAs include complex operational systems, sensing, and communication\ntechnologies.\
    \ Such architectures have converged into an IP-based architecture. This con-\n\
    vergence is occurring rapidly with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices\
    \ driven\nthrough IoT concerning conventional building management and smart buildings.\
    \ Tradi-\ntionally, numerous building systems utilized varied forms of networking\
    \ protocols and\ncabling systems. This variety makes the whole system more complex\
    \ and highly infeasible\nfrom both a deployment and a system administration standpoint\
    \ [191]. SBAs entail making\nplans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational\
    \ technologies that improve the\napplication’s, service’s, or provision’s operational\
    \ steps while also boosting the well-being\nof its users. Researchers, policymakers,\
    \ and implementers should pay attention to several\ncrucial issues, such as reliable\
    \ communication/connection procedures, power-efﬁcient\nmeasures, competent security\
    \ measures, efﬁcient sensors and actuators, and data analyt-\nics procedures.\
    \ Amalgamating new systems and technologies with conventional (base)\ntechnologies\
    \ to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes, but is not limited to, WSN\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n39 of 63\ndeployment; advanced power-aware trafﬁc\
    \ engineering policies; cloud, edge, and fog com-\nputing paradigms; big data\
    \ engineering and analytics; and human–computer interaction\nprocedures [192].\
    \ The rapid development of ICT technologies has enhanced the connect-\nedness\
    \ of intelligent sensing, actuators, and communication devices to real-time physical\n\
    entities. Recently, smart sensing mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology\n\
    have boosted the area of SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies\
    \ for\na particular smart building domain poses signiﬁcant difﬁculties, including\
    \ heterogeneity\nof IoT devices and applications, workable networking protocols\
    \ and architectures, power\nefﬁciency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One\
    \ solution is the SDN paradigm, which\nmanages the network more efﬁciently than\
    \ a customary one. SDN also assists network\nservices, including storage, routing,\
    \ dynamic bandwidth management, and QoS. Hence,\nthese simpliﬁcations offer a\
    \ creative environment through the implementation of proper\nsoftware tools for\
    \ smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation for in-\ntelligent\
    \ infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home automation\n\
    and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing based\
    \ on\nSDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that improves\
    \ critical SB\nparameters such as bandwidth efﬁciency, energy efﬁciency, latency,\
    \ security, and reliability.\nSilva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things (WoT)\
    \ SBA that is integrated with the repre-\nsentational state transfer (RESTful)\
    \ application programming interface (API). The RESTful\nAPI employs HTTP requests\
    \ (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT\ndata. Regarding network\
    \ performance and smart building power management, the authors\nshowed how their\
    \ recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance.\nSmart sensing\
    \ devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or\nmodifying\
    \ vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These\n\
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.\
    \ These sys-\ntems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms,\
    \ power, and transceiver\nmodules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based\
    \ SBAs for assessing and regulat-\ning air quality, smart lighting systems, ﬁre\
    \ detection systems, power management, and\nother basic building operations.\n\
    An indoor-air-quality-based SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for\n\
    monitoring and regulating air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing\n\
    system was initially suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature,\
    \ and\nrelative humidity. Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198].\
    \ Con-\nsidering smart indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed\
    \ in the\nliterature. In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system\
    \ to satisfy the users’\nneeds. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption\
    \ reduction via energy-efﬁcient\nsmart lighting systems. Today’s smart building\
    \ employs low-power usage LED-based\nlight sources that last longer than Compact\
    \ Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In reality, the\ndevelopment of control technologies,\
    \ heterogeneous networks, and embedded systems\nhas made it promising to create\
    \ smart innovative lighting systems that can effectively\naddress the problem\
    \ of energy conservation. Researchers have recently begun testing by\nintegrating\
    \ different power-saving techniques in a single illumination system for improved\n\
    energy efﬁciency while enhancing lighting performance without sacriﬁcing user\
    \ satisfac-\ntion. According to the authors of [201], using several cheap detectors,\
    \ as opposed to a\nsingle expensive sensor, would result in improved performance\
    \ and higher power savings.\nConsidering the same motivation, various authors\
    \ [202–204] have suggested similar types\nof smart lighting systems for several\
    \ room types, such as classrooms and ofﬁces. In [205],\nthe authors provide a\
    \ deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing\non power\
    \ savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration\
    \ of\nvisible light communication technology [206].\nRecently, researchers focused\
    \ on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work perfor-\nmance and thermal comfort,\
    \ to propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented\nTechnologies (OOT)\
    \ have been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal\ncomfort while\
    \ conserving energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n40 of 63\ndrawbacks of the automatic control used today. In\
    \ practice, thermal comfort analysis is\nbased on parallel objective and subjective\
    \ evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises\nmonitoring, assessing, and recording\
    \ the status of environmental parameters through dedi-\ncated sensors and instruments\
    \ following standardized guidelines. Subjective evaluation\ninvolves monitoring,\
    \ assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal sensation, and\nthermal\
    \ environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor results as the cumulative\n\
    method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found in [193].\nGreen building\
    \ refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that adjusts to\npredetermined\
    \ circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation, the system makes\n\
    full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather data and subsequently\n\
    allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The ambient intelligence\
    \ concept aims\nto conserve natural resources with limited and efﬁcient use of\
    \ them to offer comfort to the\noccupants. Through unconventional energy sources,\
    \ it also meets some of the conventional\nenergy requirements [207]. Many aspects\
    \ of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and\npower efﬁciency, are the subject\
    \ of extensive study. However, one of the most important\nfunctions of an SB system\
    \ is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by\nHVAC systems\
    \ [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial\nbuildings\
    \ for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for\
    \ this\ncontext. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of\
    \ rated fan energy\ncan be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect\
    \ on a building’s indoor\ntemperature. The method of computational control for\
    \ passive and active sources was\nused in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized\
    \ the problem that the ambient and\nactive sources of lighting, heating, ventilation,\
    \ cooling, and shading are not synchronized\nin buildings. Such a computational\
    \ control scheme is also suitable for reducing daily power\nusage. Similarly,\
    \ numerous methods [211–213] considering HVAC systems have been\nproposed with\
    \ respect to frequency regulation, predictive control, and smart controller.\n\
    An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks environmental situations. It also notiﬁes\n\
    when measurements exceed thresholds and provides data on energy usage and consump-\n\
    tion. In addition, it can autonomously turn equipment intermittently at programmed\n\
    times. As individuals spend more time indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed\
    \ spaces)\nthan outdoors, the air quality inside buildings should be improved\
    \ along with that of the\nexternal surroundings. This is the task of indoor Air\
    \ Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS).\nThe basic parts of an AQMS (Figure 5) are\
    \ a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal\nconditioning circuit, a\
    \ small amount of external memory, and a communication module\nthat is typically\
    \ wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors that can\n\
    detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2, CO, and\
    \ O3, as\nwell as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity and\
    \ temperature. These\nsensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values\
    \ of the real-time indoor air quality\nparameters and an external memory used\
    \ to store real-time data [214]. When deploying\nsuch systems, various communication\
    \ (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and\nLoRAWAN technologies, are considered.\n\

    \ IoT and BI stakeholders\nmust make a concerted effort to give modern BI access\
    \ to a generic IoT framework with\ncognitive intelligence and context-aware computing\
    \ capabilities.\n5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring\nRetroﬁtting\
    \ the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some\nbeneﬁts,\
    \ including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].\n\
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert\
    \ utilities\nto pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network,\
    \ allowing them to remotely\nadjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224].\
    \ Automation can be used for both\noperational procedures and components that\
    \ provide functionality. For instance, when a\nwater problem occurs during operation\
    \ or with the element itself, the smart components\ninform the system center and\
    \ then take action to avert a crash. The water utility can also\ndetermine a sensor’s\
    \ requirement for maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic\nself-veriﬁcation\
    \ mechanism [225].\nIn [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid\
    \ architecture that includes\ntechnical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework.\
    \ Moreover, this smart water\nsystem (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms,\
    \ simulation procedures, diag-\nnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control\
    \ mechanisms. Although an SWS incor-\nporates ofﬂine performance, real-time performance\
    \ is deﬁned by online procedures such\nas online data monitoring, online data\
    \ assimilation, online modeling, online charting,\nand online results output.\
    \ An SWS must have real-time functionality to implement the\nnecessary smart features\
    \ [227]. Researchers put a lot of effort [228] into developing wa-\nter systems\
    \ that operate intelligently. Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time\n\
    controlling, etc., which seek to reduce the lag between system input and system\
    \ output,\nshould be added to the smart performance of SWS. It was discovered\
    \ that using SCADA\nwould considerably increase the data transfer efﬁciency [229].\
    \ A smart water architec-\nture [230] often includes ﬁve layers: (1) the physical\
    \ layer; (2) the sensing and control layer;\n(3) the communication layer; (4)\
    \ the data management layer; and (5) the data fusion layer.\nWithin the framework\
    \ of the GST4Water project, the authors of [230] presented a system\nthat allows\
    \ for receiving consumption data sent by a generic smart meter installed in a\n\
    user’s house and transferring them to a cloud platform. The consumption data are\
    \ saved\nand processed to characterize leakage at the district meter area and\
    \ the individual user level.\nMeanwhile, the processed data are returned to the\
    \ Water Utility and can be used for billing.\nOn the other hand, they provide\
    \ regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness\nof their consumption\
    \ behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework\nbased on\
    \ FIWARE that aims to realize a highly ﬂexible standards-based open-source soft-\n\
    ware solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting of\
    \ various\nFIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis\
    \ et al. [232]\nconsidered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding\
    \ conventional water\nmetering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted\
    \ bi-directional (whenever re-\nquired) data exchange between water ﬂow devices,\
    \ metering equipment, and end-users.\nThe authors’ ultimate objective is to design,\
    \ implement, and deploy more sophisticated\ninfrastructure offering improved performance\
    \ in bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit\nthe amount of data that needs\
    \ to be shared between the various system layers, their ap-\nproach makes use\
    \ of the FogC paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water\ngrid\
    \ model.\nThe Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the\
    \ Efﬁcient\nWater Resources Management project was funded by the European Commission\
    \ under the\nauspices of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the\
    \ Smart Water project is\nto examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively\
    \ managing urban water systems,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n44 of 63\nwith a\
    \ focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related\n\
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues\
    \ such as\nleakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.\
    \ Kulkarni\nand Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,\
    \ proposed\na framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost\
    \ of ownership, and\nhighlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’\
    \ Smart Water case studies.\nPipelines are used to transport water, gases, and\
    \ oil. Since they are frequently under-\nground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes\
    \ them, which may result in leaks. In addition,\nwater in the pipelines may get\
    \ contaminated by infectious agents or substances that are\nmistakenly or purposely\
    \ introduced into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline\nnetworks is crucial\
    \ for maintaining public health and protecting the environment. The sen-\nsor\
    \ node deployment profoundly impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline\n\
    network monitoring, including coverage area, coverage population, and detection\
    \ time.\nThe sensor nodes should typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s\
    \ junctions [234].\nGiven the design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor\
    \ node deployment challenges\nare therefore formulated as integer optimization\
    \ problems, where the integer variables\nrepresent the maximum amount of sensor\
    \ nodes that must be placed at each junction. The\ndeployment difﬁculties for\
    \ pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging to solve\nbecause of the\
    \ integer decision variables.\nPipeline network ﬂows are not predictable. As a\
    \ result, depending on the ﬂow pattern,\nthe sensing performance of a deployed\
    \ sensor node may vary. As a result, the ﬂow pattern\nis taken into account in\
    \ [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to\ndecide how to\
    \ deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious\n\
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a\
    \ branch\nand bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify\
    \ the ideal answer,\nthe time complexity is typically signiﬁcant. This means that\
    \ large pipeline networks cannot\nbe used with the method. Similarly, the study\
    \ in [236] considers the various demand\npatterns of water ﬂows through pipes.\
    \ The authors used a genetic-based method to ﬁnd the\nbest deployment locations\
    \ to increase coverage under various monitoring station demand\npatterns. The\
    \ global optimum of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach.\n\
    The performance of the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices.\n\
    Consequently, we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks.\nSingapore’s\
    \ WaterWise@SG program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate\nburst incidents\
    \ [237,238]. PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to ﬁnd pipeline\n\
    leaks, where three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure.\
    \ To\nreduce water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track\
    \ water\nconsumption for businesses. A Steamﬂood and Waterﬂood Tracking System\
    \ [240] has been\ncreated to ﬁnd irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks\
    \ and bottlenecks. With the\naid of all these technologies, the investigators\
    \ had the opportunity to evaluate the efﬁciency\nof the monitoring algorithms.\
    \ However, these technologies rely on ﬁxed sensors, and we\nstill need to put\
    \ innovative testbed models and systems built around crowd sensing and\nmobile\
    \ WSN into place.\n5.6. Architectures for Smart Transportation\nThe Internet-of-Vehicles\
    \ (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce trafﬁc congestion\nand accidents. It\
    \ also enables information exchange involving the vehicle and all entities\nthat\
    \ may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking and vehicle intelligence are the\
    \ two\ntechnologies that underpin IoV implementation. The three components that\
    \ compose\nvehicle networking are the onboard information service, VANET, and\
    \ mobile network.\nVANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range communication.\
    \ Providing remote loca-\ntion, remote diagnostics, navigation, and other information\
    \ services is referred to as an\nonboard information service. Every car can be\
    \ utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks\nto mobile networks. Vehicle intelligence\
    \ is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI),\
    \ big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n45 of 63\n(CogC), to facilitate information sharing among people\
    \ and vehicles, as well as between\nvehicles and the environment, infrastructure,\
    \ or other vehicles.\nVehicular networks consist of data-gathering sensors and\
    \ inter-vehicle communica-\ntion systems. Such networks require an open and ﬂexible\
    \ layered architecture to handle\ncharacteristics such as interoperability, scalability,\
    \ dependability, and modularity. Recently,\nthe research community proposed efﬁcient\
    \ vehicle network architectures. For example,\nthe Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture\
    \ [241] includes seven layers. Offering services and\nchoosing messaging protocols\
    \ are tasks that fall within the application layer. Data prepro-\ncessing, big\
    \ data processing, and intelligent transmission are all tasks that the multimedia\n\
    and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems, the cloud service layer’s\
    \ ClCom and\ncloud virtualization technologies offer hardware computing platforms,\
    \ infrastructure, and\nsoftware services. In the UIoV architecture, the communication\
    \ layer and the intra–inter\ndevices layer are merged to accomplish the connectivity\
    \ of many heterogeneous objects\nand networks. Notably, there is no intra–inter\
    \ devices layer in classical architecture. The\nUIoV system’s physical objects\
    \ layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter\ndevices layer for\
    \ additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are\n\
    identiﬁed using the Identiﬁcation Layer.\nLiu et al. [242] suggested another IoV\
    \ network architecture to increase the ﬂexibility of\napplication management while\
    \ enhancing the scalability and dependability of information\nservices. This architecture\
    \ has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety\nof nodes with\
    \ various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of IoV\nis frequently\
    \ changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced and trans-\nmitted\
    \ at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the underlying resources,\n\
    the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes and the network, computation,\n\
    communication, and storage resources in IoV. To execute applications such as road\
    \ safety\nmanagement and data sensing, the control layer’s SDN controller is responsible\
    \ for schedul-\ning the abstraction resources of the virtualization layer and\
    \ interacting with the application\nlayer. A difﬁcult topic in network architecture\
    \ design is dealing with diverse networks.\nInteroperability, scalability, dependability,\
    \ and adaptability are some of its network features.\nThe design seeks to increase\
    \ layer separation and network architecture’s total number of\nlayers. In addition\
    \ to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture should facilitate\n\
    the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other communication devices.\n\
    By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving systems, the learning\
    \ ability\nof autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved. Utilizing both\
    \ physical and network\ndata space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV)\
    \ paradigm [243] improves network\nsecurity and transportation safety. CIoV enables\
    \ IoV to bear more accurate perceptive\nability through cognition in the intra-vehicle\
    \ network (driver, passengers, smart devices,\netc.), inter-vehicle network (adjacent\
    \ intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network\n(road environment, cellular\
    \ network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture\nincludes a\
    \ cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of\n\
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road\
    \ condition\ninvestigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture\
    \ of CIoV. The gathering\nand preprocessing of big data from several sources are\
    \ done by the sensing layer. As\nopposed to the previous communication layer (of\
    \ other architectures), the architecture’s\ncommunication layer uses a cloud/edge\
    \ hybrid structure to accommodate various applica-\ntion schedules. The data cognition\
    \ engine at the cognition layer processes and interprets\nheterogeneous data streams\
    \ (machine learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety\nof cognitive\
    \ analysis approaches. The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in\ncharge\
    \ of allocating and scheduling network resources with the aid of technologies\
    \ such\nas NFV, SDN, network slicing, and self-organized networking (SON). There\
    \ are primar-\nily two categories in the application layer (i.e., usual application\
    \ services and intelligent\ntransportation applications).\nEfﬁcient message authentication\
    \ and integrity are required to guarantee vehicle pri-\nvacy and safeguard vehicular\
    \ communications. To protect V2V and V2I communications\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n46 of 63\nin the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber threats,\
    \ Karim [244] provided\na cryptography-based routing solution. This solution includes\
    \ a data encryption and de-\ncryption mechanism based on attributes and identity\
    \ that has the lowest computational\noverhead while keeping the optimum level\
    \ of security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245]\nsuggested a seven-layer network\
    \ architecture. The user interface layer, which controls infor-\nmation exchange\
    \ between the user and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units\n\
    (RSUs) and onboard sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing\n\
    and ﬁltering layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data\
    \ before\nsending the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission.\
    \ Making\nchoices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities\
    \ of control and\nmanagement. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing\
    \ layer to create\nthe pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop\
    \ assaults, the security layer\ndirectly manages each of the layers above. A unique\
    \ network architecture with enhanced\nthroughput, reduced latency, higher security,\
    \ and widespread connectivity was recently\nproposed by Ji et al. [246]. This\
    \ architecture consists of four layers:\n1.\nSecurity authentication layer: The\
    \ RSUs on the road may monitor trafﬁc environment\ndata in real-time after setting\
    \ several sensors, surveillance footage, and radar. This\nlayer determines the\
    \ legality of the car and RSU that are requesting to join the network.\nPerhaps\
    \ an illegal vehicle or an RSU that has been installed unlawfully will attempt\n\
    to steal or alter the information of a real vehicle.\n2.\nData acquisition layer:\
    \ This layer collects and categorizes many types of data from\nvarious networks.\
    \ To ensure that the data can be sent to the edge layer securely, it\ndigitizes\
    \ the data.\n3.\nEdge layer: Edge devices produce several data streams. As a result,\
    \ processing and\nanalyzing data in one go using ClCom will result in signiﬁcant\
    \ delays. As a result, we\nmust process data more closely related to the data\
    \ source. The edge node, a physical\ndevice situated closest to the data source,\
    \ is used by the edge layer to carry out basic\nprocessing and analysis on the\
    \ acquired local data. It releases data analysis ﬁndings\nfor nearby trafﬁc incidents\
    \ and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a\nlocal decision-making\
    \ plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud\ndata center’s\
    \ computing power.\n4.\nCloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses the\
    \ information it has collected\nabout global trafﬁc in this tier, develops a plan,\
    \ and rationally distributes trafﬁc\nresources. This layer, having the ability\
    \ to implement connection management, data\nmanagement, aided autonomous driving,\
    \ intelligent navigation, path planning, and\ninformation security, is the “smart\
    \ brain” of the IoV.\nA blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)\
    \ for the smart city was\npresented in [247]. Building innovative distributed\
    \ transport management systems is made\npossible by the robust and secure Block-VN\
    \ architecture. The authors considered how the\nnetwork of vehicles evolves with\
    \ paradigms focused on networking and vehicular informa-\ntion. To handle real-time\
    \ transportation data, Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing\ntransportation\
    \ data using Spark and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four\nlayers:\
    \ data collection and acquisition, network, data processing, and application.\
    \ Each\nlayer is built to process and manage data in a structured manner. On the\
    \ data processing\nlayer, Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing\
    \ the suggested event and\ndecision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249],\
    \ the data are made available\nto a smart community member. The suggested approach\
    \ was examined using transporta-\ntion datasets from some reliable sources. The\
    \ outcomes demonstrate data processing and\nreal-time distribution to citizens\
    \ in the shortest amount of time. Spark with the Hadoop\nenvironment produces\
    \ ﬁndings that are quite accurate. From another viewpoint, Social\nIoV (SIoV)\
    \ are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks [250], where vehicular nodes\n\
    share/exchange information with different entities and are thus forth comparable\
    \ with\ntraditional social networks. Kerrache et al. [251] proposed a trust-aware\
    \ communication\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n47 of 63\narchitecture for social\
    \ IoV (TACASHI), which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and\ninter-vehicle\
    \ communication architecture for SIoVs.\n5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart\
    \ Villages\nThe smart village paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities\
    \ using IoT\ntechnologies. In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried\
    \ out, including smart\nagriculture, waste management, irrigation management,\
    \ livestock management, smart\nenergy, smart healthcare, and smart education.\
    \ A smart village or smart rural area can\nenable real-time data analytics and\
    \ automate decision-making for local villagers regard-\ning healthcare, agriculture,\
    \ environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from a\nsmart city as there\
    \ are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and sustainability)\nbetween\
    \ urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart village goal, The Euro-\n\
    pean Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in which it proposed to\
    \ interfere\nICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254] addressed the meaning\
    \ of “smart” in\nrural contexts as well as its link with sustainability. The European\
    \ Commission-funded\nSmart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the ultimate goal\
    \ of encouraging and motivat-\ning communities to create and execute smart village\
    \ methods and tactics throughout\nEurope as a tool for rural development, serving\
    \ as the authors’ primary source. IEEE\nSmart Village [256] also supports the\
    \ world’s energy-impoverished communities by pro-\nviding a complete solution\
    \ combining renewable energy, community-based education, and\nentrepreneurial\
    \ opportunities.\nMalik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart\
    \ villages with different\ntechnologies. They concluded that digitization is only\
    \ possible if a reliable and robust net-\nwork and communication infrastructure\
    \ are installed in the village environment. Shrestha\nand Drozdenko [258] proposed\
    \ a Smart Rural framework to mitigate the effects of climate\nchange using IoT\
    \ and the Cloud, building a prototype on the Louisiana Tech University\ncampus.\
    \ Their framework is an energy-efﬁcient monitoring system for observing the envi-\n\
    ronmental conditions that affect agricultural production and human health. It\
    \ consists of\nthe following subsystems: Wireless Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud\
    \ Services, and a Web\nDashboard. The dashboard converts raw sensor data into\
    \ meaningful information from\nwhich public ofﬁcials and residents can adapt to\
    \ or frustrate the effects of climate change.\nMonzon Baeza and Alvarez Marban\
    \ [259] proposed a ﬂexible and scalable Smart Rural\nsystem for gathering and\
    \ processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional\ncommunication\
    \ coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in\n\
    separate segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS).\
    \ Their\nproposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs\
    \ of the system in the\ncollection of IoT data from these remote rural areas,\
    \ its coverage by space vehicles, and its\nprocessing and storage through 5G terrestrial\
    \ networks and cloud services. Their proposal\nincludes the deployment of IoT\
    \ sensors and the development of Amazon Web Services.\nConversely, the part of\
    \ the space segment, considered by HAPS, has been simulated for\ndifferent space\
    \ channels. This method provides a complete and automated smart rural\nsystem\
    \ that allows access to these IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet.\
    \ To\nprovide secure services close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored\
    \ the integration\nof a Distributed Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with\
    \ IoT in improving security\nand privacy solutions for villagers and consumer\
    \ electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,\nthe authors designed and evaluated\
    \ the performance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nin a DFC-based smart\
    \ village environment. Moreover, they discussed open security issues\nand challenges\
    \ regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. Rohan et al. [261] proposed\n\
    a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering the resource constraints\
    \ in a smart\nvillage. The authors illustrated the concept of collaborative edge\
    \ computing as applicable\nto reduce cost and better manage the existing infrastructural\
    \ facilities. Collaboration occurs\nbetween the multiple IoT edge devices (e.g.,\
    \ the edge data centers or edge routers) for data\nprocessing and storage. For\
    \ example, in times of high computational load demand, one\nvillage’s edge devices\
    \ can collaborate with another village’s edge devices.\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n48 of 63\n6. Summary\n•\nVarious SCAs have different network requirements\
    \ such as bandwidth, delay toler-\nance, power consumption, reliability, wireless\
    \ connectivity, mobility, security, and\nprivacy. Therefore, they need different\
    \ protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network\narchitectures for IoT are heterogeneous\
    \ and include various network technologies such\nas WiFi, WSNs, Mesh Wireless\
    \ Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile\nCommunication Networks (MCNs)\
    \ (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these\narchitectures must allow interoperability,\
    \ while cross-layer design-based recommen-\ndations for power consumption and\
    \ congestion control are well-suited proposals.\n•\nState-of-the-art generic network\
    \ architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm\nand are based on FogC\
    \ to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.\n•\nFog\
    \ and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in the\n\
    future to fulﬁll QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication\n\
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efﬁciency.\
    \ The\nCR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this\
    \ technology can\nquickly reconﬁgure the operating parameters of the SG communication\
    \ system to the\nchanging requirements through cognition.\n•\nBy extracting usable\
    \ data from both the physical and network data space, it is possible\nto increase\
    \ network security and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures\n\
    will become cognitive. These architectures will include cognitive data engines\
    \ that\nwill conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g.,\
    \ driving behavior\nmodel analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition investigation.\n\
    •\nThe networking performance of SDN is better than the customary networking of\
    \ smart\nbuildings (SB). However, as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been\
    \ facing some\nchallenges such as network management in terms of maintenance,\
    \ east–west interface,\nsouthbound interface, trafﬁc management, energy, ML-based\
    \ SDN networking for SB,\nand the network resources issue of SB SDN-based networking.\n\
    7. Open Research Issues\n−Network slicing management is required: IoT services\
    \ such as smart transportation and\nsmart energy have diversiﬁed requirements.\
    \ To accommodate diverse IoT services, the\nnetwork slicing paradigm is suggested\
    \ because it enables multiple independent logical\nnetworks running on the same\
    \ physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented\nan architecture for\
    \ intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT)\nfocusing\
    \ on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).\
    \ The\nauthors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing\
    \ management\nin this ﬁeld.\n−NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The\
    \ ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation\nGroup proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions\
    \ that were before performed\nby some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the\
    \ ﬂexible provisioning of software-\nbased network functionalities on top of an\
    \ appropriately shared physical infrastructure by\nseparating the network functions\
    \ from the underlying hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing\ninexpensive commodity\
    \ servers, it solves the issue of operating costs associated with\nadministering\
    \ and controlling this closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is\nused in\
    \ conjunction with NFV (the software-deﬁned NFV architecture), it can overcome\n\
    the difﬁculties associated with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic\
    \ resource\nmanagement [263]. SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service\
    \ environment through\nNFV. As a result, the need for specialized hardware and\
    \ labor-intensive effort to fulﬁll\na new service request is avoided. In conjunction\
    \ with the use of SDN, NFV also allows\nreal-time and dynamic function provisioning\
    \ along with ﬂexible trafﬁc forwarding. The\nSDN-IoT network may be improved and\
    \ secured with NVF. It enables the software-based\ndeployment of network devices\
    \ as virtualized components. Throughput is increased\nbecause of NFV integration\
    \ in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances network performance.\nTo this end, Sinh\
    \ et al. [264] proposed a practical model for hosting IoT services and building\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n49 of 63\nSDN controller applications to show that\
    \ SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services.\nRecently, Mukherjee et al. [265]\
    \ proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV\nimplementation for smart\
    \ cities.\n−Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology\
    \ can address the\nbandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can\
    \ be enabled with cognitive\nfunctionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic\
    \ spectrum accessing, circumstantial\nperceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs\
    \ and services can be based on CR technology\nbecause it can do dynamic sensing\
    \ and cognition of the surrounding environment. For\nexample, in smart grid applications,\
    \ cognitive IoT can achieve the objective of enabling\nusers to know their energy\
    \ consumption at any time and anywhere [267]. In smart home ap-\nplications, cognitive-radio-equipped\
    \ sensors can handle potential heterogeneous network\ninterference [268]. At the\
    \ same time, cognitive IoT can help with smoother real-time moni-\ntoring over\
    \ longer distances in the healthcare industry without worrying about spectrum\n\
    availability [269]. The complete utilization of cognitive radio technology in\
    \ IoT demands\nextensive research in spectrum optimization, standardization, hardware\
    \ design, privacy\nprotection, heterogeneous network fusion, scalability and ﬂexibility\
    \ problems, etc. [270].\nFor this reason, many CIoT-based smart city network architectures\
    \ must be proposed to\nsolve such problems. In this regard, Park et al. [271]\
    \ suggested a CIoT-based smart city\nnetwork architecture that outlines how data\
    \ collected from SCAs may be analyzed using\nthe CogC paradigm and manage the\
    \ scalability and ﬂexibility challenges.\n−Challenges in IoT communication through\
    \ TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access\nPoints (APs) can utilize identical\
    \ WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interfer-\nence problems that\
    \ can signiﬁcantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many\nAPs can\
    \ provide support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with\n\
    the DownLink multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY\n\
    layer technology (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the\
    \ capacity\nof WLANs by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations.\
    \ As a result, it\nis possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to\
    \ the number of antennas on APs.\nThus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel\
    \ and Singh [131] stressed the employment\nof CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods\
    \ with many APs to improve the Compound\nTCP’s performance in wide-area Industry\
    \ 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL method can accelerate\nthe learning processes of the\
    \ transport protocols such as Compound TCP. In FL, training\ndata are dispersed\
    \ across a large number of clients, each having unreliable and compar-\natively\
    \ slow network connections, with the aim of developing a high-quality centralized\n\
    model. The authors of [131] insisted on using these specialized strategies to\
    \ coordinate\nnumerous APs with regard to losses caused by unique wireless channel\
    \ characteristics and\nWiFi downloading and uploading dynamics. Through the use\
    \ of FL and CR approaches in\ndual AP settings, it is now possible to improve\
    \ the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions.\nAnother study [274] assumed TCP Cubic\
    \ [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the\nFL approach for IoVs. The\
    \ authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting the FL\ntechnique, which\
    \ enhances the efﬁciency and privacy protection for the case of IoVs.\n−Digital\
    \ Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources, personnel, proce-\n\
    dures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital twin. Digital\
    \ twin technology\ncan be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including humans,\
    \ IoT devices, aircraft en-\ngines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original\
    \ vehicle is created, for instance, when\nan automobile business creates a virtual\
    \ representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car\nmodel. If a manufacturer\
    \ creates a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the\nreplicated\
    \ process is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a proﬁle\
    \ of\nthe actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this\
    \ virtual graphic, the\ndynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation\
    \ are depicted. The digital twin\ncan offer the location, state, and/or status\
    \ of physical assets in real-time due to continual\nlearning and advancements.\
    \ This fusion of the real and digital worlds enables organizations\nto monitor\
    \ systems, set strategies, and anticipate problems before they occur. Digital\
    \ twins\nare created using digital twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure\
    \ graphs,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n50 of 63\nAI, software analytics, and the\
    \ IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is\ndemonstrated. This\
    \ technology can efﬁciently administer the city, from urban planning to\nthe optimization\
    \ of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before putting\n\
    them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.\
    \ If a digital twin\nis in place, government organizations can only fully assess\
    \ what might be achieved with\nthe data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic\
    \ opportunity, and establish a more cohesive\ncommunity. Although the idea is\
    \ currently novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few\nyears [277].\n\
    −The 6G Network for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense\
    \ and\nAI-centric city because massive device connectivity with vast data trafﬁc\
    \ is estimated in\nthe future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted\
    \ to the concept of Internet of\nEverything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart\
    \ cities should have a huge bandwidth, low\nlatency, and AI integration. Such\
    \ networks should also provide ubiquity, high QoS, and\non-demand content for\
    \ thousands of interconnected devices. The 6G network [278] is the\nproblem-solving\
    \ network of futuristic cities, with huge bandwidth and low latency. It is\nunder\
    \ development for wireless communications technologies supporting cellular data\n\
    networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks will probably be broadband cellular\
    \ networks,\nin which the service area is divided into small geographical areas\
    \ (cells). It is expected that\n6G will be supported by existing 5G infrastructures\
    \ such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing,\ntogether with new infrastructure. The\
    \ network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:\n(1) ultra-fast data rates\
    \ as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than 1 ms; (3) increased\n\
    mobility and coverage; (4) ﬂexible and efﬁcient connection of trillion level objects;\
    \ (5) peak\nspectral efﬁciency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very high system reliability;\
    \ and (7) improved network\nsecurity [279]. However, the main problem of 6G is\
    \ that transmitting at a higher frequency\nspectrum is prone to high path loss,\
    \ making the distance for transmission limited [280].\nThe expected 6G of the\
    \ radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the\ncapability\
    \ of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability\
    \ of\ncarrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks,\
    \ such as short-\nrange and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can\
    \ introduce complications\nand hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ such complications of THz waves\nmust be considered, and efﬁcient AI-centric\
    \ multilayer physical network architectures of 6G\nmust be proposed for futuristic\
    \ smart cities. Farooq et al. [280] considered the expectations\nfrom a network\
    \ of futuristic smart cities and the problems of THz waves and proposed\na conceptual\
    \ terrestrial network (TN) architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a\n\
    scalable multilayer architecture designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart\
    \ cities. It\nprovides an on-ground cloud network that helps smart devices to\
    \ run AI applications\npartially on their own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore,\
    \ the distributed and edge\ncomputing-oriented infrastructure of Bee Hive provides\
    \ security and reduces trafﬁc load on\nthe upper layer of the network. Undoubtedly,\
    \ pervasive AI is the main enabling technology\nin 6G, while some forms of AI\
    \ are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples of\nusing AI on wireless\
    \ communications have been proposed, from physical layer designs\n(e.g., channel\
    \ estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation (e.g., trafﬁc control\n\
    and cache storage management), to security and authentication, to dynamic cell\
    \ and\ntopology formation and management, to fault prediction and detection, etc.\
    \ However,\nDL-based solutions require high computational complexity, which might\
    \ not ﬁt in current\nmobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN)-based\nRL algorithms must be carefully designed to decrease\
    \ the computational resources required\non these devices [282]. Quantum communication\
    \ [283] offers a promising approach to\navoiding the challenge of limited computational\
    \ resources and energy efﬁciency. Applying\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also\
    \ comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy\nand computational/energy\
    \ requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above\nissues and\
    \ envisioned 6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous\n\
    systems. Apart from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important\
    \ enabling\ntechnologies of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies\
    \ are as follows:\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n51 of 63\n•\nReconﬁgurable Intelligent\
    \ Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reﬂect signals and help in places\nwhere maintaining\
    \ Line of Sight (LoS) is difﬁcult. RISs will be mainly deployed on\ndoors, windows,\
    \ and buildings.\n•\nCell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology is introduced\
    \ in 5G with\na more dense network of access points (APs), and this is further\
    \ developed in 6G\nto include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287]. Cell-Free\
    \ Massive MIMO im-\nproves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks, but there\
    \ are some health risks\nassociated with such a dense network of APs.\n•\nCubeSat\
    \ communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class\n\
    spacecraft) is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up\
    \ to 6U,\nand U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units.\n•\nUAVs/satellite communication.\n\
    •\nTerahertz communication and Optical Wireless Technology [289].\n•\nBlockchain\
    \ technology [290] and quantum communication [283].\nThe development of futuristic\
    \ smart cities keeps up with the development of energy-\nefﬁcient 6G communication.\
    \ Kamruzzaman [291] presented the key trends in the IoT for\nenergy-efﬁcient 6G\
    \ wireless communication in smart cities. He argues that the application\nof IoT\
    \ devices to 6G in smart cities will provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency\
    \ rate,\nup to 1000 km/h mobility rate, 100 bps/Hz spectral efﬁciency, and 1000\
    \ GHz frequency.\nThis will resolve the issues of energy inefﬁciency and other\
    \ concerns in conventional\ncommunication networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ 6G in smart cities via IoT\ndevices probably will solve various problems that\
    \ are encountered by existing smart city\nsystems. In futuristic smart cities,\
    \ residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer\ninterface (BCI) technology\
    \ [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on the signals\nand information\
    \ that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable headsets and\ndevices.\
    \ It uses human consciousness more than external sources for better interaction.\n\
    As humans have ﬁve senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), BCI comprises\
    \ ﬁve\ndatasets, comprising features of human senses that are used for human interaction\
    \ with the\nmachine [292].\n8. Conclusions\nUtilizing resources efficiently, reducing\
    \ operating expenses, and enhancing city\ndwellers’ quality of life are the objectives\
    \ of the smart city paradigm. This goal is ob-\ntained by combining various technologies\
    \ including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big\ndata analytics, and robots. For this\
    \ model, the effective networking and communication\nbetween the many components\
    \ required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving its\nobjectives. The\
    \ ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic and manageable\nplatforms\
    \ for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings, smart home, smart water,\n\
    and smart transportation systems. The networking needs of the key SCAs were examined\n\
    in this research, and the appropriate protocols that can be applied at different\
    \ system\nlevels have been identiﬁed. Additionally, we provided examples of networking\
    \ protocols\nand smart grid, intelligent building, smart residence, and smart\
    \ transportation system\narchitectures. We concentrated on key criteria for a\
    \ variety of networking designs, such as\nenergy savings, routing, security, dependability,\
    \ mobility, and support for heterogeneous\nnetworks. In addition, we presented\
    \ open research issues.\nThis survey can assist researchers to recognize research\
    \ gaps/problems working in the\nnetworking architectures for smart cities, and\
    \ it provides an overview of available protocols\nand architectures for SCAs.\n\

    of irrigation farming is not having full control over the activities on the farmland
    and its unpredictable environment factors which in most cases, if not well managed,
    brings about low agricultural productivity. In this paper, as against the traditional
    manual control procedures which are time consuming, labor expensive, and most
    time led to taking bad key decisions concerning the three important environmental
    factors vis: temperature, humidity, and moisture of the farmland, we presents
    the design and implementation of farm management support system using WSN to sense
    and sent SMS about these three important farm field parameters to farmers using
    ATMEGA 328 controller. The system is designed to allow remote tracking of the
    parameters via an IoT cloud computing platform (ThingSpeak) and perform some Statistical
    analysis like temperature humidity variation and difference at a particular point
    in time on the sensed data using matlab. The developed system is scalable to incorporate
    the tracking of many other parameters and actions such as soil fertility, required
    soil nutrient, or trigger actions such as releasing water valve or activate alarming
    unit if certain parameter/s cross defined threshold. This research shows the importance
    of using wireless sensor network in precision farm field as the system solves
    the problem of continuous monitoring of data acquisition. DOI 10.11648/j.iotcc.20190704.12

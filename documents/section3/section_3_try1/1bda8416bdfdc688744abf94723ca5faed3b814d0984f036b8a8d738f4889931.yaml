  description: 'AgroNIT is an integrated IoT framework aiming to foster innovative
    solutions for the optimization of clingstone peach production in central Macedonia,
    Greece. AgroNIT features energy-autonomous mesh wireless sensor networks (WSN),
    cloud computing and decision-support systems (DSS) using artificial intelligence
    (AI). It serves as a hybrid smart-farming service, as well as a large-scale living
    laboratory (testbed). The AgroNIT system consists of three services-tiers: the
    data collection (Edge System), the data analytics (NITOS Cloud) and the data presentation
    service (Software Application). The WSN testbed consists of 25 custom-made IoT
    sensing devices and 13 LTE gateway nodes. The end nodes feature various sensors
    with two main functional types: (i) the agrometeorological node for monitoring
    key crop, soil and climatic parameters at field or microclimate level, and (ii)
    the visual crop node, an image-aware module equipped with an RGB camera to enable
    crop monitoring via 2D image collection. The gateway nodes are responsible for
    the collection and transmittance of the sensing data to the proprietary Cloud
    via the internet. The Cloud is a data aggregation and data analytics service,
    whose purpose is to extract knowledge from the raw data by employing big data
    analysis, machine/deep-learning and data mining algorithms. The produced knowledge
    can contribute to sustainable production management through precise determination
    of peach phenological stages including bud dormancy breaking, targeted plant protection,
    critical stages for optimal fertilization and irrigation, severe weather phenomena
    forecasting and management, fruit ripening and yield prediction. For the data
    visualization the AgroNIT software application was developed for Web and mobile
    devices and integrates various decision-support services related to key cultivation
    practices supporting all the involved parties (farmers, advisors, industry).'

    Abstract: AgroNIT is an integrated IoT framework aiming to foster innovative solutions
    for the optimization of clingstone peach production in central Macedonia, Greece.
    AgroNIT features energy-autonomous mesh wireless sensor networks (WSN), cloud
    computing and decision-support systems (DSS) using artificial intelligence (AI).
    It serves as a hybrid smart-farming service, as well as a large-scale living laboratory
    (testbed). The AgroNIT system consists of three services-tiers: the data collection
    (Edge System), the data analytics (NITOS Cloud) and the data presentation service
    (Software Application). The WSN testbed consists of 25 custom-made IoT sensing
    devices and 13 LTE gateway nodes. The end nodes feature various sensors with two
    main functional types: (i) the agrometeorological node for monitoring key crop,
    soil and climatic parameters at field or microclimate level, and (ii) the visual
    crop node, an image-aware module equipped with an RGB camera to enable crop monitoring
    via 2D image collection. The gateway nodes are responsible for the collection
    and transmittance of the sensing data to the proprietary Cloud via the internet.
    The Cloud is a data aggregation and data analytics service, whose purpose is to
    extract knowledge from the raw data by employing big data analysis, machine/deep-learning
    and data mining algorithms. The produced knowledge can contribute to sustainable
    production management through precise determination of peach phenological stages
    including bud dormancy breaking, targeted plant protection, critical stages for
    optimal fertilization and irrigation, severe weather phenomena forecasting and
    management, fruit ripening and yield prediction. For the data visualization the
    AgroNIT software application was developed for Web and mobile devices and integrates
    various decision-support services related to key cultivation practices supporting
    all the involved parties (farmers, advisors, industry). Article - full text (enhanced

    Nowadays, conventional agriculture farms lack high-level automated management
    due to the limited number of installed sensor nodes and measuring devices. Recent
    progress of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies will play an essential role
    in future smart farming by enabling automated operations with minimum human intervention.
    The main objective of this work is to design and implement a flexible IoT-based
    platform for remote monitoring of agriculture farms of different scales, enabling
    continuous data collection from various IoT devices (sensors, actuators, meteorological
    masts, and drones). Such data will be available for end-users to improve decision-making
    and for training and validating advanced prediction algorithms. Unlike related

    of specific layers of the IoT stack, this work considers a versatile approach
    and technical aspects at four layers: farm perception layer, sensors and actuators
    layer, communication layer, and application layer. The proposed solutions have

    1. Introduction In Chile, agriculture is an important sector of development with
    a significant impact on economic growth. Chile is located in the southern hemisphere
    and has great opportunities for agriculture and forestry production due to the
    diversity in climates throughout the country and high standards for quality and
    safety [1]. Agriculture farms can be classified into small, medium, and large
    farms [2]. According to the 2007 national agriculture and livestock census, 73.4%
    of farms are small (less than 20 hectares), 19% medium size (20–100 hectares),
    and 7.6% are large farms (more than 100 hectares). For the future development
    of Chilean agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture has developed a framework
    that targets four main axes: associativity, rural development, sustainability,
    and modernization of activity [1]. While agriculture plays an essential part in
    the economy of Latin American countries, technology is still far from being deployed
    in the field [3]. This research is directed toward the role of Internet of Things
    (IoT) technology in agriculture farms to modernize farm activity and improve management
    and efficiency. Nowadays, modern technologies of sensors, communication networks,
    IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence are converging into complex cyber-physical
    systems and digital twins for different agriculture applications [4]. Agriculture
    applications include living plants/trees, agriculture products, agriculture fields/farms,
    agriculture buildings, and agriculture machines. These applications aim to enable
    stakeholders and farmers to remotely monitor, control and coordinate daily farm
    operations, and improve their decision making capabilities. There are many studies
    and publications in the domain of IoT for smart agriculture that aim to solve
    different problems and provide various solutions [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18].
    The main issues for developing such solutions include hardware, networking, and
    platform challenges. The hardware challenges are related to hardware implementation
    and the harshness of the operational environments, including temperature, humidity,
    rain, dependence on a limited battery power source, and other dangers that may
    affect/destroy the electronic circuits. The networking challenges are related
    to the lack of communication infrastructure in rural areas, sensing large-scale
    farms, and connecting isolated areas. Wireless technologies will play an important
    role in deploying IoT-based solutions that enable sensor/actuator nodes to exchange
    data without human intervention. The platform challenges are related to building
    a suitable platform and applications that will allow real-time monitoring. This
    work targets the networking challenges of large-scale farms in Chile to enable
    the integration of a massive number of sensor nodes, devices, and equipment. Long-range
    (LoRa) technology is a promising candidate to provide long-range communication
    over several kilometers based on low power consumption battery-powered devices.
    The main objective of this work is to design an IoT-based platform for remote
    monitoring of large-scale agriculture farms. The developed solution (hardware
    and software) can provide real-time tracking of labor activities for people and
    machines during harvest and measure different ambient and soil condition parameters
    for two fruit species, including blueberry and Hass avocado. The developed prototype
    offers a low-cost solution to access real-time data. The contribution of this
    article relies on proposing a flexible hardware and software platform oriented
    on monitoring agriculture farms of different scales, based on LoRaWAN technology.
    Even though previous work can be found using similar technologies, they focus
    on specific applications or evaluate technical aspects of specific layers of the
    IoT stack. 2. Related Work Agriculture is one of the biggest food industries in
    the world and currently one of the most critical sectors of the economy in many
    countries due to the great demand for food required by the world population. As
    food demand increases every day, maximizing food production and minimizing food
    losses and costs are necessary. With the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT)
    technologies, more companies and organizations are interested in developing new
    solutions that enable remote monitoring and control to improve crop productivity.
    IoT is a promising technology that provides great opportunities to support many
    new applications and services in different domains such as smart home, smart city,
    smart industry, smart health, and smart agriculture [5,6,7,8,9]. The authors in
    [5] reviewed IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental fields, identifying
    different application areas (monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics),
    trends, architectures, and open challenges covering the time period from 2006
    to 2016. The authors in [6] present a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art
    for the role of IoT in agriculture, covering network architectures, technologies,
    and protocols. Furthermore, agriculture policies for the standardization of IoT-based
    agriculture and open research issues have been discussed. The authors in [7] developed
    a device named “FarmFox” to monitor soil health. The device uses REST API and
    TCP protocol. The developed sensor node monitors several soil parameters such
    as pH, turbidity, soil moisture, and temperature based on Wi-Fi technology and
    sends the sensor information to the end-user. The authors in [8] present a review
    of the applications of LoRaWAN for future smart farming, which include automatic
    irrigation systems, small/large arable farming, livestock and animal welfare,
    and greenhouse/indoor horticulture. The paper covers the basic applications of
    LoRaWAN for smart farms and highlights technology limits and future research directions.
    The author in [9] reviews various potential applications and challenges associated
    with IoT in agriculture and farming applications. Various case studies have been
    presented and explored regarding communication networks, cloud services, and hardware
    platforms. In [10], the author studies the impact of variant physical layer parameters
    on the performance of the LoRa network with respect to range, reliability, and
    RSSI in a tree farm located in Indiana, United States. The authors in [11] present
    a hardware and software system for the remote monitoring of vineyards. Two different
    nodes were developed and deployed to collect atmospheric data and soil parameters
    based on Wi-Fi technology in Ribeira Sacra, Spain. The authors in [12] propose
    a user-centered design model where each farmer decides their own installations.
    The experimental work considered a greenhouse with two levels of communication
    and processing nodes (edge and fog). In [13], the authors present the major applications
    of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and IoT in smart farming. The work highlights
    connectivity requirements, network functionalities, and communication technologies
    for smart agriculture. In [14], the authors present an IoT scheme based on LoRa
    technology for long-range communication in the agriculture area. The monitoring
    parameters consist of humidity, temperature, soil pH and soil moisture. In [15],
    the authors present a comparative study for LPWAN such as Sigfox, LoRa, and NB-IoT
    for large-scale IoT deployment with respect to range, coverage, deployment, cost,
    battery life, latency, and scalability. The authors in [16] present a low-cost
    solution for an automatic irrigation system. The system consists of a LoRa network
    between sensor nodes and a local gateway with an internet connection through the
    Sigfox network. In [17], the authors present a case study for an IoT-based architecture
    for research and development in precision agriculture and ecological domains.
    The authors in [18] describe the AFarCloud project that aims to support the integration
    and cooperation of the agriculture system to offer better productivity, efficiency,
    food quality, and animal health. Table 1 shows comparisons between previous research
    work on IoT-based architectures for smart farming. Table 1. Comparison among previous
    research work on IoT-based architectures for different smart farming applications.
    As connectivity is one of the most crucial factors that affect smart farming,
    there is a need for seamless connectivity and highly efficient communication among
    different devices and equipment [13]. Previous research has aimed to provide a
    sensor-specific solution such as soil health [7,11], atmospheric data [11], or
    technology-specific solutions such as Wi-Fi [11] and LoRa [10], where the detailed
    analysis of the developed system from different perspectives is missing. Furthermore,
    the selection of a particular technology for a specific application should be
    based on different requirements such as data rate, range, and power consumption.
    Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies will play an important role to
    support the deployment of different smart farming applications compared with traditional
    cellular systems [13]. For the adaption of precision agriculture services, the
    integration of heterogeneous IoT devices, the interoperability between different
    platforms and proprietary systems, and the cost of the required technological
    infrastructure are among the main barriers that hinder the adoption of new technologies
    [19]. Furthermore, different parameters should be taken into account for properly
    designing farming applications and services, such as coverage, cost, data delivery
    ratio, energy consumption, throughput, and collisions. The main contributions
    of this work are as follows: Propose an IoT-based platform for remote monitoring
    of large-scale agriculture farms. The proposed architecture consists of four layers:
    farm perception layer, sensors and actuators layer, communication network layer,
    and application layer. Develop a simulation model for the LoRa-based communication
    network of large-scale farms that enable remote monitoring of different sensor
    nodes and measurement devices in the field. Investigate the feasibility of using
    LoRa-based communication for large-scale farms concerning packet delivery ratio,
    number of collisions and throughput. Design, prototype, and implement a LoRa-based
    platform using low-cost devices that enable GPS LoRa tracking and real-time monitoring
    of ambient and soil conditions. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. IoT-Based Architecture
    for Smart Farming This section presents the complete IoT-based architecture for
    smart farming [20,21]. The proposed architecture consists of four layers: farm
    perception layer, sensors and actuators layer, communication network layer, and
    application layer, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. IoT-based architecture for
    smart farming. Farm Perception Layer This layer includes the different monitoring
    parameters such as weather conditions, soil moisture and humidity, plant monitoring,
    machine status, and water monitoring. The farm field includes various sensor nodes,
    actuators, and measurement devices. These nodes could be fixed sensor nodes, mobile
    sensor nodes, agro machines, etc. Sensor nodes are used for acquiring different
    measuring parameters covering, for example, plant, soil, and environment. The
    main objective of this layer is to enable data transmission with minimum human
    intervention. This work targets large-scale farms in Chile. The developed sensor
    nodes are designed to provide real-time tracking of labor activities (human and
    machines) during harvest for traceability and yield mapping. Furthermore, the
    system will be used for measuring the field conditions for two fruit species,
    including blueberry and Hass avocado. Sensors and Actuators Layer Different sensor
    nodes and measurement devices are installed in the field to collect data (e.g.,
    temperature sensors, soil sensors, weather stations, light sensors, humidity sensors,
    images, and videos). The collected data are transmitted to gateways or data collection
    points via wired/wireless communication. Monitoring data from this layer is used
    to keep track of the crop growth, where different parameters could be adjusted
    from the control center side, such as irrigation, fertilization, and pesticides.
    Communication Network Layer The main function of the communication network layer
    is to enable data transmission from the farm perception layer to the application
    layer based on different long-range and short-range communication technologies.
    Such solutions include wired (Ethernet) and wireless (ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
    3G/4G, LoRa, NB-IoT, Sigfox) communication technologies that are used to exchange
    data with the help of field gateways distributed in the field. Other network equipment
    includes network switches, routers, gateways, and base station infrastructures.
    Application Layer The application layer handles all the data received from sensor
    nodes and measuring devices via the communication network layer, as well as data
    storage, analytics, and visualization for different agriculture parameters such
    as weather conditions, irrigation information, soil quality, etc. The received
    data allows the end-user to remotely monitor and control farm operations. Thus,
    the application layer enables farm management, including planning and decision
    making. 3.2. LoRa-Based Architecture for Large-Scale Agriculture Farms 3.2.1.
    LoRa Technology LoRa technology is a promising candidate to support remote monitoring
    of large-scale agriculture farms due to their flexibility and simplicity. The
    LoRa network is based on two main components: LoRa physical layer and LoRaWAN.
    The proprietary LoRa physical layer was developed by the Semtech corporation based
    on spread spectrum modulation and chirp spread spectrum (CSS) [22], while the
    LoRaWAN is an open specification developed by LoRa Alliance [23]. Each LoRa transmission
    includes different parameters such as transmission power, spreading factors (SF),
    code rate (CR), center frequency, and bandwidth. These parameters affect the data
    rate, communication range and robustness of the signals [23,24]. Spreading Factor
    (SF): The ratio between the data symbol rate and chirp rate. The configuration
    of SF affects the data rate and coverage distance. The high spreading factor supports
    low data rates and a long communication range. Code Rate (CR): Is the forward
    error correction rate that affects the airtime of packet transmission. Central
    Frequency: It depends on the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band used.
    Bandwidth: It affects the data rate of transmissions. In general, the communication
    network for a LoRa-based architecture consists of a hierarchical topology, formed
    by LoRa nodes which communicate through gateways. The architecture consists of
    LoRa nodes, LoRa gateways, network servers, and application servers. There is
    no association between LoRa nodes and the gateways; however, all gateways within
    the range of a LoRa node can receive messages. The central network server is responsible
    for processing the incoming packets, filtering the duplications, and forwarding
    the messages to the application servers. Figure 2 shows the main elements of the
    LoRa-based network architecture layout for smart farms. Figure 2. LoRa-based network
    architecture for smart farms. Data Acquisition: LoRa sensor nodes are responsible
    for collecting sensing data or control actions (actuators) through communication
    with gateways. Gateways: LoRa gateways are internet-connected devices responsible
    for receiving/transmitting data packets from/to different LoRa sensor/actuator
    nodes. Network Server: The network server is responsible for managing the LoRa
    gateways and handling the duplication of the received packets. Additionally, it
    is responsible for sending/scheduling data and acknowledgment to be transmitted
    for specific nodes. Application Server: The application server is responsible
    for handling LoRaWAN application layer, such as downlink/uplink data encoding/decoding
    and encryption/decryption. 3.2.2. Design Requirements This section provides the
    design requirements that should be considered while designing the IoT-based platform
    for large-scale farms. The performance evaluation metrics include modular design,
    unit cost, system scalability, robustness (ability to handle seasonal climate
    variability), and power management [5,6,19]. Hardware and energy efficiency requirements:
    All sensor nodes and measuring devices in the farm perception layer are exposed
    to harsh environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, rain, and wind
    that may affect the electronic circuits. These challenges should be considered
    during hardware design and implementation. Cost requirements: The total cost of
    the IoT system includes the price of sensor nodes, measuring devices, gateways,
    and base stations. Scalability requirements: The system back-end and databases
    should be able to support receiving information from a large number of sensor
    nodes and measuring devices. Additionally, the system should be able to add new
    hardware and/or software. Network coverage requirements: Wireless communication
    offers many advantages compared with wired-based solutions. However, network reliability,
    interference, and data loss should be evaluated as many sensor nodes use an unlicensed
    spectrum such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, LoRa, etc. Interoperability requirements: Smart
    Agriculture farms should be able to integrate heterogeneous IoT devices, different
    proprietary systems, and/or platforms at different levels (data acquisition, communication
    network, and applications). 4. Results 4.1. LoRa Network Model and Simulation
    Results The LoRa communication network model is evaluated through simulation.
    The simulation models are based on the Open Source (Framework for LoRa) FLoRa
    Simulator, which is a simulation tool based on OMNeT++ [23,24,25]. FloRa Simulator
    includes different modules that simulate LoRa physical layer, LoRaWAN, gateways,
    and network servers. In FloRa, all the transmission parameters of the physical
    layer could be configured, such as the transmission power, code rate, bandwidth,
    center frequency, and spreading factor. Figure 3 shows the configured network
    topology for sensor nodes located in the playfield of the Universidad Técnica
    Federico Santa María (UTFSM) campus, Valparaiso, Chile. Figure 3. (a) UTFSM campus;
    (b) FLoRa simulation. This experiment aims to evaluate the performance of LoRa
    PHY and LoRaWAN technologies. The main metrics are data delivery ratio (DR), energy
    consumption (EC), throughput, number of collisions, and spreading factor (SF)
    distribution. The main features of LoRa links, energy consumer modules, and network
    elements are given below [20]. LoRa Links: The LoRa transmission is successful
    if the received power is greater than the receiver sensitivity. The model is based
    on the log-distance path loss model and shadowing, where the path loss is based
    on the distance between the transmitter and receiver. Energy Consumer Modules:
    The three main states for the LoRa radio are transmit, receive, and sleep. The
    energy consumed is based on the amount of time spent by the LoRa radio in a particular
    state. Network Elements: The simulation model enables the network end-to-end simulation
    by modeling end-nodes, gateways, and network servers. The gateways and the network
    servers are communicating over IP such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi links. The performance
    of the LoRa communication network is evaluated with adaptive data rate (ADR) and
    without ADR. Different configurations with different numbers of LoRa nodes (100,
    200, 300, and 400) are considered. The main simulation parameters are given in
    Table 2. The simulation scenarios consider one LoRa Gateway connected to the network
    server. Table 2. Simulation parameters for FloRa Simulator. 4.1.1. Delivery Ratio
    The delivery ratio for LoRa networks is defined as the ratio between the number
    of messages correctly received by the network server and the total number of packets
    sent by every node. The delivery ratio gives a number between “0” and “1”. If
    the delivery ratio is close to “1”, then the network could be considered with
    an ideal behavior. However, a value close to “0” means that every transmitted
    packet may not reach the destination. Figure 4a,b show the results of the delivery
    ratio. Figure 4. Delivery ratio: (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. The ADR-enabled
    scheme is preferred for networks with a high density of nodes, as their performance
    does not decrease dramatically over time. For a small number of nodes, LoRa networks
    with ADR-disabled achieve a better delivery ratio than those with ADR-enabled
    due to their less saturated spectrum and fewer collisions. While increasing the
    number of nodes, the communication with ADR-disabled tends to be unstable compared
    with the ADR-enabled scheme, as this value decreases dramatically (about 0.75
    in the case of 400 nodes). 4.1.2. Energy Consumption The energy consumption for
    LoRa networks is defined as the accumulated energy consumption of every node in
    the network in millijoule (mJ). The ADR-disabled case shows similar results of
    power consumption for different packet frequency (28 and 56 packets) with a different
    number of sensor nodes (100, 200, 300, and 400). The energy consumption values
    did not show a significant difference in terms of the number of nodes in the network.
    Compared to the case with ADR-disabled, ADR-enabled communication schemes achieve
    better results with lower power consumption. Figure 5a,b show the results of the
    energy consumption for end nodes. Figure 5. Energy consumption for end nodes:
    (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. 4.1.3. Throughput The reception throughput
    corresponds to all the acknowledgment and control messages perceived by the gateway,
    which are sent to the end devices, as shown in Figure 6a,b. The transmission throughput
    corresponds to all the data flow that the gateway perceives and is forwarded to
    the network server, which corresponds to the data packets transmitted by the end
    devices. Both scenarios (ADR-enabled and ADR-disabled) are very similar, as shown
    in Figure 7a,b. This confirms that networks operating with or without the “ADR”
    mechanism transmit the same amount of data. Figure 6. Gateway reception throughput:
    (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. Figure 7. Gateway transmission throughput:
    (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. 4.1.4. Collisions The collision metric is defined
    as the number of perceived collisions concerning the gateway. As shown in Figure
    8a,b, there is a noticeable reduction in collisions in the case of ADR-enabled
    networks. The ADR-enabled mechanism helps in providing better energy usage, a
    higher reception throughput, and fewer collisions. Figure 8. Collisions perceived
    by LoRa gateway (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. 4.1.5. SF Distribution This
    section analyzes and comments on the SF distribution, comparing the results with
    and without ADR. We chose the distribution result of the 29th run in each case,
    as it is one of the 30 executed runs. The chosen scenario is when nodes communicate
    with the network server every 15 min. When the ADR mechanism is disabled, no SF
    change is taken in the network, resulting in every node having its initial SF
    value. However, with ADR-enabled, at different communication ranges different
    SF values take place in order to provide better performance metrics, as shown
    in Figure 9. Figure 9. SF distribution with different number of sensor nodes:
    (a) 100 nodes ADR-disabled; (b) 100 nodes ADR-enabled; (c) 200 nodes ADR-disabled;
    (d) 200 nodes ADR-enabled; (e) 300 nodes ADR-disabled; (f) 300 nodes ADR-enabled;
    (g) 400 nodes ADR-disabled; (h) 400 nodes ADR-enabled. 4.1.6. Discussion The simulation
    results for data delivery show that more transmission packets imply a lower delivery
    ratio because more sensor nodes are transmitting simultaneously and occupying
    the same channel. In the case of ADR-enabled, a higher delivery ratio is achieved
    compared with ADR-disabled. We can conclude that ADR-enabled is recommended for
    networks supporting a high density of sensor nodes. At the same time, ADR-disabled
    offers better behavior for networks with a lower number of sensors and lower transmission
    frequency. As most of the sensor nodes in the agriculture field will be battery-powered,
    energy consumption is an essential factor for the network lifetime. The results
    of ADR-enabled showed a lower energy consumption than ADR-disabled. Concerning
    the throughput of transmission/reception at the gateway, the results showed that
    end devices are transmitting the same amount of data for ADR-enabled and ADR-disabled
    scenarios. However, the SF distribution in the case of ADR-enabled offers better
    performance and energy usage. In general, the network performance with ADR-enabled
    provides better performance for energy consumption, reception throughput, and
    collisions. A trade-off should be considered while designing a communication network
    with a small number of sensor nodes. 4.2. Localization Results In large-scale
    farms, there are different activities that require information about locations,
    such as people and equipment [26]. This section aims to study different scenarios
    for localization using a low-cost solution, considering off-the-shelf GPS LoRa
    nodes, in order to evaluate the accuracy and operation capability in a real environment.
    The collected real data from the GPS nodes are compared with different high precision
    and high-cost mobile devices. In this work, the GPS LoRa tracking nodes are called
    “Farm Tracker”. These Farm Trackers can be used by persons/machines during the
    cultivation process to acquire GPS data for real-time tracking and harvest management
    and relay it to the control center using LoRa communication. The Farm Tracker
    system has been implemented and tested in UTFSM (Universidad Técnica Federico
    Santa María) campus, Valparaiso, Chile. The collected data from the GPS LoRa nodes
    are compared with Geo Tracker Mobile applications installed on different high
    precision and high-cost mobile devices. The current prototype is a proof-of-concept
    and can be used in various farm applications. Figure 10a shows the satellite map
    for the experimental scenarios for the Farm Trackers. The GPS LoRa nodes setup
    is implemented and tested on the playfield located around the coordinates 33°02′05.3″
    S 71°35′38.5″ W of the UTFSM campus. The total area is about 6705 m2. The playfield
    is covered with grass and surrounded by trees and buildings. There are no obstacles
    (e.g., buildings, trees) in the intermediate terrain. The location of the LoRa
    gateway (Dragino DLOS8) is shown in Figure 10b,c. This is an outdoor LoRaWAN gateway
    which includes a 1 × SX1301 + 2 × 1257 LoRa transceiver. Table 3 shows the technical
    specifications for the Dragino DLOS8 LoRa Gateway [27]. Figure 10. Experiment

    3. Technical specifications for Dragino DLOS8 LoRa gateway. The experiments were
    carried out on 26 January 2022 at 05:00 PM. The Geo Tracker Mobile application
    was the software installed on four mobile phone devices (D1–D4) to collect data
    during the experiment. A smartwatch (D1) was used for data collection among the
    devices. For scenario 1, the closest and longest distance between the mobile devices
    and the LoRa Gateway is about 50 m and 90 m, respectively. For scenario 2, the
    closest and longest distance between the mobile devices and the LoRa Gateway is
    about 20 m and 50 m, respectively. Table 4 shows the mobile device types, brands,
    and models. The data collected from the field are stored in a laptop connected
    to the LoRa gateway for further analysis. The results of the GPS LoRa nodes are
    visualized using OpenStreetMap. Table 4. Mobile devices characteristics. GNSS:
    Global Navigation Satellite System. The measurement was collected using GPS LoRa
    nodes (ESP32 TTGO GPS NEO6 board). In the backside of the module, there is a battery
    holder for a Li-Ion battery which enables the portable operation of the nodes.
    The GPS LoRa nodes are named: ESP32-1, ESP32-2, ESP32-3, ESP32-4, and ESP32-5.
    The node ESP32-2 had a problem during the experiment and was not considered for
    data collection. Smart mobile devices used are smartwatch (D1), LG K41S (D2),
    Samsung S20 (D3), and Xiaomi POCO F3 (D3). The measurements were collected by
    four people. Each person ported a GPS LoRa node (ESP32 TTGO GPS NEO6) and a mobile
    device with Geo Tracker Mobile APP. The four persons start moving simultaneously
    and in the same direction. Table 5 shows the parameter settings for the GPS LoRa
    nodes. The measurements were collected using four LoRa nodes (ESP32-1, ESP32-3,
    ESP32-4 and ESP32-5). Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the movement direction and
    routes for scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively, using the Geo Tracker Mobile
    APP. Figure 11. GPS LoRa results in experiment site for scenario 1 (movement direction

    the GPS LoRa nodes. As explained in the previous section, the prototype of the
    GPS LoRa nodes consists of four nodes. Each node includes a LoRa transceiver,
    GPS receiver, a microcontroller, and Li-Ion battery. Figure 13 shows the schematic
    diagram for the Farm Tracker network. The network is configured as a star topology
    where GPS LoRa nodes transmit data to a central system using LoRa communication.
    For each LoRa frame, the payload includes the device ID and GPS data information.
    The received data can show, in real-time, the locations of the moving nodes and
    visualize them on a map. In this work, the system has been designed to determine
    the real-time locations of farmworkers inside the farm during different cultivation
    activities. However, the system can be extended to support other tracking applications.
    Figure 13. Schematic diagram for the Farm Tracker network. At this stage, the
    most critical metric was to test the ability to receive GPS LoRa data from different
    nodes and GPS accuracy. Figure 14, Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the results of
    scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively, for the movement direction and route
    using GPS LoRa nodes. The collected data includes the information of Device ID,
    GPS location (latitude and longitude), and a time stamp. The results verify the
    success of the GPS data reception. Figure 16 shows aggregated GPS LoRa results
    for movement direction and route of scenario 1 and scenario 2. In large-scale
    farms, such information is valuable for harvest management [26] and human/machine
    safety [28], which could be used for improving the field logistics and creating
    yield maps. Figure 14. GPS LoRa results for Scenario 1 movement direction and

    Implementation This section explains the design and implementation of the low-cost
    sensor nodes and data transmission. Five sensor nodes have been designed and implemented
    for monitoring different parameters of ambient and soil conditions, including
    temperature, humidity, moisture, etc. Table 6 shows the main specifications of
    sensors used in the design. There are two types of measurements: ambient parameters
    (temperature, pressure, relative humidity, vibration, and ultraviolet) and soil
    parameters (soil moisture and temperature). The complete list of the main sensors
    is shown in Figure 17. Figure 17. Real sensor nodes used for the design (a) Capacitive
    Soil Moisture; (b) DS18B20; (c) BME280; (d) SW-18010-P; (e) GYML8511. Table 6.

    the assembling of the sensor nodes. Figure 20 shows the complete system architecture
    where the configuration of LoRaWAN server on The Things Network (TTN) stack has
    been configured to receive monitoring data from LoRa sensor nodes and visualized
    using ThingSpeak Platform. Figure 21 shows the measurements from sensor node number
    “Heltec 04” since 19 February 2022. The data are available online using the following
    links: Heltec 04 (https://thingspeak.com/channels/1657668), Heltec 03 (/channels/1657672),
    Heltec 02 (/channels/1657658), Heltec 01 (/channels/1657655), and Heltec 00 (/channels/1657654).
    The stored data on ThingSpeak platform includes air temperature, air humidity,
    soil temperature, soil humidity, pressure, and UV intensity, as shown in Figure

    6. Discussion The applications of IoT and LoRa technologies have received great
    interest for their support of different applications in large-scale agriculture
    farms. This work presented the results of the hardware and software platform which
    target large-scale farms. The proposed platform overcomes the challenge of legacy
    solutions, including hardware and services, to support extended coverage. Detailed
    descriptions for the proposed architecture have been given, including the communication
    between sensor nodes, LoRa gateways, and the network server for real applications
    in Chile. Although most of the research has been carried out by conducting different
    experiments for different crop farms, this work has focused on designing and building
    the complete sensor network with low costs (infrastructure investment and operating
    expenses). Furthermore, the developed LoRa simulation model using FloRa showed
    the network performance with respect to data delivery ratio, energy consumption,
    throughput, number of collisions and spreading factor distribution. The main results
    include: Propose IoT-based architecture consisting of four layers: farm perception
    layer, sensors and actuators layer, communication network layer, and application
    layer. Present a complete system architecture, components, interconnections, and
    detailed implementation of the proposed solution. Design, prototype and implement
    LoRa-based platform using low-cost devices that enable GPS LoRa tracking (Farm
    Tracker) and remote real-time monitoring of ambient and soil conditions. All the
    components have been acquired and purchased from the Chilean market. The platform
    allows the integration of new sensor nodes as well as data visualization. The
    system could be adjusted to collect data locally in a local database without the
    need to access the internet. The current cost of the sensor node is 53,500 CLP.
    The ongoing research work aims to: Develop the energy harvest module using a small
    solar panel to support the autonomous operation of the developed sensor nodes
    for remote real-time monitoring of ambient and soil conditions. Add more low-cost
    sensors to the current prototype, such as wind speed and wind direction. Enable
    notification for critical situations and abnormal values (sudden change from the
    rated values) as well as advanced data processing techniques. Such information
    will help to improve farm operation and productivity. Integrate the monitoring
    data collected from moving nodes such as drones and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV).
    7. Conclusions This work developed an innovative LoRa-based platform that provides
    an inexpensive solution for real-time monitoring of different applications in
    large-scale agriculture farms, including GPS LoRa tracking and monitoring atmospheric/soil
    data. The proposed IoT architecture consisted of four layers: farm perception
    layer, sensors and actuators layer, communication network layer, and application
    layer. The data transmission in the proposed solution is based on low power wide
    area network (LPWAN) using LoRaWAN, which meets the design requirements of large-scale
    agriculture farms. The system has been validated using an actual prototype as
    well as simulation. Data from different sensor nodes are transmitted to the LoRAWAN
    Gateways and then to The Things Network (TTN) platform. The TTN platform is responsible
    for data collection, formatting, and rerouting to ThingSpeak platform for data
    storage, visualization, and analysis. The received data opens new opportunities
    for different data analytics solutions which enable real-time data processing
    and support various forecasting services for farm management. Our ongoing work
    is to develop actuator nodes for controlling and automating different farm operations
    and processes such as irrigation. The developed sensor/actuator nodes will be
    installed in different real environments (mountains and rural areas). Although
    this work was focused on large-scale agriculture farms, it could be applied for
    other applications with similar requirements in the smart grid and smart cities
    domain. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.A.A. and M.D.Z.; methodology,

  description: Modern digitalized era of our 21st century needs automation in each
    and every sector. In India forming is called the vertebrae of the country because
    most part of India depend upon agriculture so automation in agriculture will surely
    help in lifting up lift the country's economy and irrigation is the most basic
    requirement of the agriculture. The exercise of proper method of irrigation system
    is very reasonable and proficient this method will reduce the human interference
    with the irrigation and provide the proper water management. To achieving the
    automation in the fields with irrigation we require various hardware and software
    components such as GSM for wireless communication, sensors to check the status
    of the soil and Arduino etc. The arranged framework is working with programmed
    activity, which considers detected information alongside the climate conjecture
    boundaries like precipitation, air temperature, stickiness, and UV for the not-so-distant
    future. The total framework has been created and conveyed on a pilot scale, where
    the sensor hub information is remotely gathered over the cloud utilizing webservices
    and an online data perception and choice emotionally supportive network gives
    the continuous data bits of knowledge dependent on the investigation of sensors
    information and climate estimate information [1]-[2]. This paper targets fostering
    the GSM based mechanized water system framework which give satisfactory water
    needed by crop by checking the dampness of soil and environment condition to forestall
    the wastage of water asset. It will likewise enjoy numerous benefits for ranchers.

    era of our 21st century needs automation in each and every sector. In India forming
    is called the vertebrae of the country because most part of India depend upon
    agriculture so automation in agriculture will surely help in lifting up lift the
    country’s economy and irrigation is the most basic requirement of the agriculture.
    The exercise of proper method of irrigation system is very reasonable and proficient
    this method will reduce the human interference with the irrigation and provide
    the proper water management. To achieving the automation in the fields with irrigation
    we require various hardware and software components such as GSM for wireless communication,
    sensors to check the status of the soil and Arduino etc. The arranged framework
    is working with programmed activity, which considers detected information alongside
    the climate conjecture boundaries like precipitation, air temperature, stickiness,
    and UV for the not-so-distant future. The total framework has been created and
    conveyed on a pilot scale, where the sensor hub information is remotely gathered
    over the cloud utilizing webservices and an online data perception and choice
    emotionally supportive network gives the continuous data bits of knowledge dependent
    on the investigation of sensors information and climate estimate information [1]-[2].

    The process of artificially supplying water to field where crops are grown is
    called irrigation. The conventional way to irrigate the fields is to supply water
    in fields through the canal and pumps, canals, drips etc. but these methods are
    not very precise and accurate and increases the work load on the farmer it’s not
    quite accurate to regulate the water supply into the fields [3]. Fields should
    neither the over irrigated nor the under irrigated. The existing conventional
    irrigation system has several limitations like leaching of soil nutrients due
    to access of water in field, wastage of water which may leads to water shortage
    in in draught areas, spooling the crops or may be production of unhealthy crops,
    to secure all these problems related to irrigation we need to introduce the automation
    in irrigation which will provide the exact amount of water to the crops depending
    on their requirement on the exact time. Thus, AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING
    GSM MODULE will provide the automation in agriculture field. This GSM based agriculture
    system has two major portions. first portion is containing the GSM (global system
    for mobile communication) is a unit which sets the communication between the mobile
    phone. GSM is used to control the irrigation in the field and also send the information
    to the farmer via SMS. Second portion is the controller unit which is the set
    of Arduinos, sensor, relay, pump etc. Arduino will command the switching the ON
    and OFF of the motor depending upon the condition detected by the respective sensors.
    Relay is used as a switch for connecting the motor or pump. This idea is going
    to be a revolutionary thing for the aquaponic and hydroponic farming. It is a
    very suitable method of raising both fish and vegetables. and controlling the
    quantity of water is main concern here [4]. The improvements of these new methods
    will arrive at our objective of economic advancement just as to remove the discharge
    of ozone depleting substances to a base level. As the name of our undertaking
    that is AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEM with the assistance of the Solar force is
    a stage to use some new designing methods. This procedure will be an awesome alternative
    for the little and medium ranchers who endure each year due to disappointment
    of harvests that occurred each year that occurred each year. SECTION II. Design
    Methadology The central intension of our endeavor is to add the in the farming
    framework. The programmed water system framework is configuration to consistently
    detect the dampness level of soil then the framework will reaction properly by
    watering he dirt with precise required measure of water at that point shut down
    the water siphon when the necessary measure of dampness will be accomplished in
    the dirt. Specification of components of the proposed system: Diode-1N4007 Transistor-2N2222

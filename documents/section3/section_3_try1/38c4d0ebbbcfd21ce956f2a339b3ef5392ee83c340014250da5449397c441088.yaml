    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;
    Positives / (True\\; Positives + False\\; Positives)$$ (15) $$Recall = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    recommendation. Full size image A confusion matrix is an illustrative format that
    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: 'Human viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 continue to attract public
    and research attention due to their disruption of society, global health, and
    the economy. Several earlier reviews have investigated the occurrence and fate
    of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and the potential to use such data in wastewater-based

    A large body of evidence predominantly drawn from developed countries shows that
    SARS-CoV-2 and its proxies occur and persist in raw wastewater from centralized
    municipal sewer systems, the dominant sanitation systems in high-income settings.
    This motivates the application of wastewater-based epidemiology for estimating
    COVID-19 prevalence in sewered catchments in such settings. However, >4 billion
    people, mostly in low-income settings in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean
    region, still lack access to centralized municipal sewer systems and clean drinking
    water supply. Hence, they rely on shared community on-site sanitation and unsafe
    drinking water supply systems. The lack of advanced multi-barrier systems for
    wastewater and solid waste management leads to poor wastewater management systems
    resulting in the discharge of raw and partially treated wastewater into surface
    water and groundwater systems serving as drinking water supply sources in low-income
    settings. This increases the risk of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and
    other human pathogens via polluted aquatic environments. Several reviews exist
    on SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the application of wastewater-based epidemiology
    to estimate COVID-19 prevalence (e.g., Ahmed et al., n.d.; Randazzo et al., 2020;
    Hart and Halden, 2020). However, the bulk of these earlier reviews focus on high-income
    or developed countries where centralized wastewater systems dominate (Hu et al.,
    2022). A few reviews and perspectives exist focusing on low-income countries (LICs),
    but these were based on inferential evidence (Adelodun et al., 2020; Gwenzi, 2022a,
    Gwenzi, 2022b; Street et al., 2020). This is because until just recently, no empirical
    data existed on SARS-CoV-2 in municipal wastewater, shared on-site sanitation
    systems, and water and drinking water supply systems in low-income settings. An
    increasing number of recent studies, including those drawn from low-income settings,
    have detected SARS-CoV-2 in the following environmental media relevant to low-income
    settings. This includes (1) municipal wastewater from conventional wastewater
    treatment systems (Kumar et al., 2020; Pillay et al., 2021), (2) shared on-site
    sanitation systems such as septic tanks and pit latrines (Amoah et al., 2021;
    Del Brutto et al., 2021a, Del Brutto et al., 2021b; Liu et al., 2021; Zhang et
    al., 2020), and (3) raw source water (surface water and groundwaters) impacted
    by wastewaters (Guerrero-Latorre et al., 2020; Maidana-Kulesza et al., 2021; Mahlknecht
    et al., 2021; Rimoldi et al., 2020; Kolarević et al., 2021). Source water refers
    to bodies of surface water (e.g., lakes, streams, rivers, and reservoirs) as well
    as groundwater (e.g., springs, wells, and boreholes) that provide water to public
    and private drinking water supplies (CDC, 2022; Liu et al., 2024b). Yet until
    now, a comprehensive review of these recent early results and their implications
    on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and human health risks in low-income settings is still
    lacking (Hu et al., 2024). Therefore, the availability of early results on SARS-CoV-2
    in municipal wastewater, shared on-site sanitation systems and water and drinking
    water systems present an opportunity for a more nuanced analysis of the human
    exposure and health risks via multiple exposure routes (Lan et al., 2022). The
    present review posits that wastewater from municipal and shared on-site sanitation
    systems, surface water and groundwater systems and drinking water supply systems
    in low-income settings are characterized by strong spatial and temporal hydrological
    connectivity. This hydrological connectivity, which facilitates faecal and SARS-CoV-2
    contamination of surface water and groundwater systems, occurs via (1) accidental
    and illegal discharges and spillages of raw and partially treated municipal wastewaters,
    (2) infiltration and groundwater recharge by effluents and seepages from on-site
    sanitation systems, and (3) surface water-groundwater interactions. Thus, the
    wastewater-source water-drinking water systems constitute a SARS-CoV-2 continuum,
    facilitating the circulation and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens
    to humans. In the present paper, we present the empirical and inferential evidence
    on the occurrence and fate of SARS-CoV-2 and other human viral pathogens in municipal
    wastewaters from typical wastewater treatment systems used in low-income settings,
    on-site sanitation systems, surface water and groundwater, and drinking water
    supply systems. Fig. 1 shows the low-income countries where viral pathogens were
    detected in wastewater, source water and drinking water systems. Then, potential
    human health risks and appropriate mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater-source
    water-drinking water continuum are discussed. Download : Download high-res image

    reporting viral pathogens in the wastewater-source water-drinking water systems.
    Based on data in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4. Future perspectives and research
    needs are presented focusing on (1) weak quantitative evidence linking SARS-CoV-2
    in wastewater, source water and drinking water to specific human health outcomes
    in terms of infection, morbidity and mortality, (2) the need for further empirical
    evidence on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and stability in wastewaters, water and drinking
    water systems in low-income settings such informal settlements, (3) source tracking
    of SARS-CoV-2 and its proxies in the wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum,
    (4) human health exposure and health risk assessment based on quantitative microbial
    risk assessment (QMRA) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) approach, and
    (5) opportunities and constraints offered by emerging analytical and monitoring
    tools. This includes prospects to develop and validate environmental surveillance
    of SARS-CoV-2 using municipal wastewaters, shared on-site sanitation systems,
    raw surface water and groundwater, and drinking water supply systems. The present
    review uses the Source-Pathway-Receptor-Impact-Mitigation (SPRIM) framework to
    track the occurrence, and human exposure and health risks along the wastewater-source
    water-drinking water continuum in low-income settings. Compared to studies focusing
    on one aspect (e.g., occurrence and persistence), the SPRIM framework allows a
    more comprehensive analysis of the exposure and health risks and their mitigation,
    focusing on the wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum. Therefore, the
    objectives of this paper are to: (1) Critically examine the early empirical results
    to highlight the occurrence and stability of SARS-CoV-2 and viral pathogens in
    the wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum, (2) Discuss the anthropogenic
    and hydro(geo)logical processes controlling the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and
    viral in the wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum. (3) Discuss the
    risky behaviours, drivers and high-risk settings in the wastewater-source water-drinking
    water continuum. (4) Present a risk assessment and mitigation strategy based on
    the available empirical evidence. (5) Present future research directions on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19
    and viral pathogens in low-income settings. 2. SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens
    in wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum The unhindered human-environmental
    interactions have continued to promote the pathogenic contamination of water systems.
    The prevalence of human pathogenic viruses (HPVs), including both enveloped and
    non-enveloped viruses, and their fate in the water environment, have become a
    serious health concern, especially with the scourge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
    Viruses are regarded as one of the most hazardous pathogens in wastewater, with
    low infectious doses sufficient to cause infections among the vulnerable population
    (Karimzadeh et al., 2021; Okoh et al., 2007). The microscopic size of viruses
    (22–140 nm) and their surface properties facilitate their easy transport in different
    environmental media while exhibiting high infectivity and disinfection resistance
    (Anand et al., 2021; Xagoraraki et al., 2014). The monitoring of these viruses,
    including their presence and fate in water environments, such as in wastewater,
    surface water, groundwater, and drinking water systems, is critical to assess
    the microbiological quality and safety of the water used for various functions
    (Adelodun et al., 2021c). Besides, the prevalence of HPVs and the associated indicators
    in water media can dictate the spread of viral diseases in a community using an
    approach called wastewater-based-epidemiology (Daughton, 2020; Kumar et al., 2020;
    Randazzo et al., 2020; Scott et al., 2021). While wastewater, especially from
    urban settlements, is subjected to different treatment processes before being
    reused for domestic and agricultural purposes or discharged into the environment,
    several studies have reported the prevalence of viruses before and after the subjected
    treatments (Adelodun et al., 2022; Tanhaei et al., 2021), indicating the recalcitrant
    nature of the viruses in different water media. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and
    other viral pathogens and the associated health risks are more complex in low-income
    settings due to the inadequate availability of and accessibility to good water,
    sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in the form of clean drinking water supply and
    centralized municipal sewer systems (Adelodun et al., 2020; Donde et al., 2021;
    Gwenzi, 2021; Street et al., 2020). Thus, this could exacerbate the risk of community
    transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogens and subsequently spread the
    disease among the population. The fate of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater-source water-drinking
    water continuum is, however, not yet fully developed as various factors affect
    the survival of HPVs, especially the enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in the
    water systems. Understanding the behaviour and survival of the HPVs as they transcend
    the boundaries of different water systems could aid in mitigating the transmission
    of the viruses and the associated health risks of human exposure. Fig. 2 shows
    the occurrence of viral pathogens in the wastewater-source water-drinking water
    continuum. Download : Download high-res image (261KB) Download : Download full-size

    systems indicating potential points to control viral transmission via water treatment.
    Note that the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 occurs via inhalation, not
    ingestion. Therefore, quantitative microbial risk assessment was limited to wastewater
    and surface water, while excluding drinking water. However, in Section 2.4 of
    the present paper, there are data and discussions about the potential human health
    hazards of viral polluted drinking water. 2.1. SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens
    detection and fate in wastewater HPVs, including the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2,
    have been identified in wastewater in different countries (Fig. 1). While the
    majority of the reported cases are from high-income and developed countries, studies
    with quantitative data on the occurrence and fate of SARS-CoV-2 are limited in
    LICs despite the vulnerability of the population to contracting the viral infections
    and waterborne related diseases (Adelodun et al., 2021b); thus, creating a significant
    knowledge gap in low-income settings. Nevertheless, emerging studies from selected
    LICs with data on the presence and fate of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens
    in wastewater can provide clues for understanding the behaviours of the viruses
    in such settings (Gwenzi, 2022). Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the most
    commonly detected pathogenic viruses in wastewater of low-income settings included
    human adenoviruses (HAdV), rotaviruses (RoV), enteroviruses (EV), noroviruses
    (NoV), and hepatitis A viruses (HAV), among many others (Kuodi et al., 2020; O''Brien
    et al., 2017; Okoh et al., 2010). These viruses are excreted through human faeces
    and subsequently concentrated in the wastewater system, where they are expected
    to be disinfected and removed. However, some studies have reported the detection
    of these viruses, not only in the influents but also, from the effluents of wastewater
    treatment plants (WWTPs), with many of the studies reporting detection rates above
    40 % (Table 1). Table 1. Detection and treatment systems of SARS-CoV-2 and other

    et al., 2015) The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has recently been reported in wastewater
    in LICs. In a study conducted in India, the three genes (ORF1ab, N, and S) of
    SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in all the collected influent samples from a WWTP
    located in Ahmedabad, which is regarded as the largest in Asia with a capacity
    of 180 m3 per day (Kumar et al., 2020). However, the viral particles were not
    found in the effluents, which was attributed to the advanced treatment processes
    of up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket and aeration pond in the plant. Another study
    from Ahmedabad reported about 95 % (111/116) detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
    from the influents of wastewater sampled from pumping stations and treatment plants
    for thirteen weeks (September to November 2020) to confirm the temporal pattern
    of the virus detection and diseases incidence (Kumar et al., 2021). Similarly,
    In Iran, wastewater samples collected from sewage manholes had 100 % and 75 %
    detection rates of the N and ORFlab genes of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, respectively
    (Rafiee et al., 2021). Arora et al. also reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2
    RNA (S, E, ORF1ab, RdRp, and N genes) from untreated samples from WWTPs and hospital
    wastewater taken under the ambient temperature of 45 °C in Jaipur City, India
    (Arora et al., 2020). Contrary to the negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
    the outlet samples of the treatment plants, Tanhaei et al. (2021) investigated
    the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both raw and treated wastewater samples in
    Tehran, Iran. The treated wastewater samples had an 80 % detection rate of the
    viral RNA (ORF1ab and N genes). Also, Chakraborty et al. (2021) examined the detection
    of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent and sludge samples of treatment plants and pumping
    stations from Chennai City in India and hospital wastewater from the city''s suburb.
    An elevated concentration of the viral particles was detected in the influent,
    sludge, and samples from the pumping station compared to the hospital wastewater
    samples. These results support the existing literature on the possible partitioning
    of enveloped virus in solid phase medium due to high levels of dissolved and suspended
    solids in sludge samples (Adelodun et al., 2022). Meanwhile, Nasseri et al. (2021)
    also studied the detection of viral particles in raw and treated wastewater from
    three WWTPs that used different treatment disinfection methods from three cities
    (Tehran, Qom, and Anzali) in Iran, with all the influent samples showed positive
    detection rate (12/12). However, all the treated wastewater samples (14) subjected
    to ultraviolet disinfectant showed negative detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, except
    for two samples collected from the treatment plant using chlorine as a disinfectant,
    which could be attributed to the inappropriate disinfectant dose or faulty operation
    and lack of maintenance of the treatment plant (Adelodun et al., 2022; Nasseri
    et al., 2021). The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater
    samples has also been carried out in some LICs (Table 1). A viral load of up to
    1.0 × 107 copies/L was detected in the wastewater samples collected from drains
    near the isolation centre for COVID-19 patents in Bangladesh (Ahmed et al., 2021).
    Similarly, in seven regions of Tunisia, the range of viral load detected from
    the sampled wastewater was 1.8 × 103–6.0 × 105 copies/L (Jmii et al., 2021). In
    a recent study conducted in Iran, a high viral particle load (4.0 × 101–4.5 ×
    104 copies/L) was reportedly present in the influent samples collected from seven
    WWTPs between September 2020 to April 2021 in Tehran (Amereh et al., 2022). Also,
    in Africa, a high viral load of up to 7.3 × 106 copies/L was detected in wastewater
    samples from centralized municipal sewer systems in South Africa (Pillay et al.,
    2021). Other LICs where the studies on the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration
    from wastewater have been conducted include India and Pakistan (Table 1). The
    virus concentration and recovery methods, and targeted genes, play important roles
    in detecting the virus in wastewater (Adelodun et al., 2022). Differences in the
    detection and recovery of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses have been reported,
    with the information on the SARS-CoV-2 as an enveloped virus still evolving (Tanhaei
    et al., 2021). The concentration and recovery methods used for the SARS-CoV-2
    in wastewater include centrifugal ultrafiltration, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation,
    aqueous two-phase PEG/dextran method, adsorption-extraction technique utilizing
    electronegative membrane, flocculation with beef extract solution, and aluminium
    hydroxide adsorption-precipitation technique; real-time reverse transcription
    polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or droplet digital polymerase chain reaction
    (dd-PCR) is often used for the detection. Rafiee et al. (2021) observed different
    results by comparing three sampling methods such as Moore swabs, composite (16-h),
    and grab sampling for sewage manholes. The Moore swabs and composite sampling
    schemes had the same performance level for qualitative monitoring with a 100 %
    detection rate (34/34) of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA; it was more consistent and sensitive
    than the corresponding grab sample following the polyethylene glycol precipitation
    concentration method and targeting N and ORFlab genes. Furthermore, Chakraborty
    et al. (2021) found that wastewater viral concentration by supernatant extraction
    is more effective than sediment, composite or syringe filtration. These variations
    in the methodologies could also account for the differences in the detection of
    SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater samples. Furthermore, Amereh et al. (2022) opined
    that differences in results from different studies could be attributed to the
    severity and rate of faecal shedding in wastewater, viral particles recovery efficiency
    from sewage samples, and possible losses of the viral RNA in sewage pipes and
    during the experiment. The Moore swab sampling and centrifugation concentration
    method are suggested for disease surveillance in LICs considering their sensitivity,
    simplicity, and affordability (Rafiee et al., 2021). The survival of SARS-CoV-2
    and other HPVs outside the living host, especially in water environments like
    wastewater, depends on the temperature, pH, relative humidity, presence of organic
    matter, and exposure to light, among other environmental factors. A previous investigation
    on the inactivation of SAR-CoV-2 in urban and hospital wastewaters showed that
    the virus maintained its virulence for up to 14 days at low temperatures (4 °C)
    but was inactivated after only two days at a higher temperature of 20 °C (Wang
    et al., 2005). Gundy et al. (2009) demonstrated significant inactivation (99 %)
    of the human coronavirus 229E at 23 °C in urban primary and secondary WWTPs for
    2.36 and 1.85 days, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was found to maintain its viability
    for more than five days on contaminated surfaces at 22 to 25 °C and 40–50 % relative
    humidity (Chan et al., 2011). Similarly, the use of more residual chlorine (>
    0.5 mg/L) or chlorine dioxide concentration of 2.19 mg/L completely inactivated
    SARS-CoV-2 in 30 min (Wang et al., 2005). It has been reported that ultraviolet
    light, temperatures above 23 °C, appropriate dose, and retention and contact time
    of disinfectant could inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while the abundance of organic materials
    could enhance the virus'' survival by providing adsorbent surfaces (Adelodun et
    al., 2022; Collivignarelli et al., 2020; WHO, 2020b). This has been demonstrated
    by Chin et al., where the virus resistance declined from 7 days to 1 day with
    a temperature change from 22 °C to 70 °C (Chin et al., 2020). Randazzo et al.
    (2020) also used NaClO and UV as disinfectants during tertiary treatment in a
    WWTP, achieving complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. However, a later study reported
    that the new SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.529) variant had higher environmental stability
    and virulence compared to other variants of the virus, indicating a concern for
    its extended survival outside living hosts (Hirose et al., 2022; NICD, 2021).
    This variant was named omicron (a variant of concern) by the WHO (2021), and first
    detected in South Africa. Several studies have investigated the impact of various
    wastewater treatment unit processes on the fate of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2
    (Masindi et al., 2021). However, the results appear to vary significantly among
    studies, potentially due to differences in the design and operational conditions
    of the unit processes. For instance, a comprehensive study conducted in South
    Africa detected SARS-CoV-2 genomes exclusively in the primary settling tanks,
    with none found in the source water (dams, rivers) and drinking water within the
    same catchment (Masindi et al., 2021). These findings suggest that most SARS-CoV-2
    viral genomes were effectively eliminated through primary settlement with the
    sludge. One study conducted in two wastewater treatment plants in Mexico also
    showed secondary sludge had a higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration than influent
    wastewater, indicating that viral RNA becomes enriched in the activated sludge
    (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2021). Another study investigating the impact of different
    temperatures and solid contents on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and
    river water revealed that the virus''s viability was longer in filtered than in
    unfiltered samples, indicating that the presence of solids promoted the persistence
    of the virus (Oliveira et al., 2021). Further studies investigating the effects
    of advanced wastewater treatment processes demonstrated their effectiveness in
    removing SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Randazzo et al., 2020). One study conducted on six wastewater
    treatment plants in the region of Murcia in Spain determined SARS-CoV-2 RNA titres
    in influent, secondary and tertiary treated effluent wastewater samples (Randazzo
    et al., 2020). The results showed that; (1) all untreated wastewater samples tested
    positive with average concentrations of 5.4 ± 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L, (2)
    only 2 out of 18 secondary water samples, equivalent to 11 % tested positive,
    while (3) all 12 tertiary water samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These
    results indicate that the trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titres decreased with increasing
    levels of treatment. However, in China, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in medical
    wastewater sampled from a septic tank even after disinfection with 800 g/m3 sodium
    hypochlorite (Zhang et al., 2020). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after chlorination
    of raw medical wastewater could be attributed to the absence of free chlorine
    in the effluent. Comprehensive reviews on the fate of SARS-CoV-2 in aquatic systems,
    including wastewaters, are available elsewhere in the literature (Gwenzi, 2021;
    Saawarn and Hait, 2021; Foladori et al., 2022; Balboa et al., 2021). 2.2. SARS-CoV-2
    and viral pathogens in on-site sanitation systems On-site sanitation has become
    a common phenomenon in LICs. Informal settlements, including isolation centre
    for COVID-19 patients essentially depended on the shared on-site sanitation facilities,
    with sewage from these settings mostly not treated before discharging into the
    environment (Gwenzi, 2022). For instance, the percentages of households from Mali
    in sub-Saharan Africa, Philippines in Asia, and in Latin America that are not
    connected to a central sewerage system are 98 %, 98 %, and above 50 %, respectively
    (Strauss et al., 2006), while countries like India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Philippines,
    and Indonesia are only able to treat about 37 %, 10 %, 8 %, 4 %, and 1 %, respectively,
    of their wastewaters (Pandey et al., 2021). Another study shows that <10 % of
    the generated septage is reportedly treated in countries like Vietnam, Indonesia,
    and the Philippines (World Bank Group, 2013). Meanwhile, on-site treatment and
    disposal of faecal sludge and septage to satisfactory or acceptable standards
    have also become a serious health concern in many LICs. It was reported that the
    unsafe management of 80 % of faecal sludge generated in the cities of Dhaka and
    Khulna in Bangladesh led to environmental faecal contamination from exposure to
    partially treated and untreated faecal sludge (Amin et al., 2019). Available data
    showed that the top ten countries that overtly rely on open defecation and other
    non-sewered sanitation systems are in sub-Saharan Africa (UNICEF and WHO, 2019).
    In Ghana, for instance, it was reported that open defecation is practised by more
    than one in every five households (Adzawla et al., 2020). Shared sanitation systems
    such as pit latrine are very common in many densely populated urban settlements
    of LICs, with 16 % of the population depending on shared sanitation (Rheinländer
    et al., 2015). For example, pit latrines account for 53 % of the toilet facilities
    in informal settles in South Africa (Mutyambizi et al., 2020), while 67 % of the
    toilet facilities in Kampala, the capital city of Uganda is shared pit latrine
    with lack of handwashing facilities (Ssemugabo et al., 2021), despite the critical
    role of handwashing with soap in mitigating the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2
    and other viral pathogens (Donde et al., 2021). Also, countries like Bangladesh,
    Mongolia, and the Philippines have over 15 % of their population solely depending
    on all forms of shared sanitation (UNICEF and WHO, 2014). The situation is worrisome
    in sub-Saharan Africa, which has the highest population proportion (19 %) of multi-households
    using shared sanitation, among which the urban population stands at 33 %, with
    this figure increasing daily (Morella et al., 2008; Rheinländer et al., 2015;
    Street et al., 2020; Susmita et al., 2018). Elimination open defecation and providing
    adequate and equal access to sanitation and hygiene have been an ambitious aim
    of the UN sustainable development goal (SDG) 6 by 2030 (WHO, 2014). The detection
    of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens have been reported in on-site sanitations,
    which are often impacted by untreated wastewater discharge and faecal pollution
    (Table 2). Table 2. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in on-site sanitation systems of low-income

    2021) SARS-CoV-2 RNA Drain near COVID-19 isolation centre/ wastewater Guwahati,
    India 5.6 × 103 The presence of SARS-CoV-2 is impacted by the faecal pollution
    and low sanitation (Kumar et al., 2022) The SARS-CoV-2 virus and other HPVs, after
    being excreted in human faeces, are released into the on-site sanitation facilities
    (Amereh et al., 2022). The surfaces, wastewater, and the air in the on-site sanitation,
    especially which lack adequate sanitation and are often shared by multi-households,
    can easily be contaminated by viral pathogens (Amoah et al., 2021; Del Brutto
    et al., 2021a; Gholipour et al., 2021; van Doremalen et al., 2020). Amoah et al.
    (2021) reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA up to 1.3 × 102 gene copies/cm2
    on different surfaces of on-site sanitation facilities in South Africa. The faecal
    contamination of surfaces could promote a high risk of viral infections like COVID-19
    (Amoah et al., 2021). Gholipour et al. (2021) reported a medium infection risk
    from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-contaminated wastewater and aerosols in a LIC
    (Iran) when compared to the baseline of infection risks proposed by EPA and WHO.
    Liu et al. (2021) also demonstrated the mechanism of possible transmission of
    SARS-CoV-2 from contaminated excreta in pit latrines to potential animal hosts
    in rural areas of China. Moreover, on-site sanitation, such as pit latrines has
    made it difficult to adequately treat or disinfect sewage from any pathogenic
    contamination to prevent further migration into surface water and groundwater
    systems. Meanwhile, these water systems are often used, especially in rural areas
    of LICs, for domestic and agricultural activities without any advanced treatment
    processes (Adelodun et al., 2021b). The use of pit latrines and open cesspools
    as form of sanitation systems in rural settings and LICs has been suggested to
    facilitate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other waterborne pathogens via exposure
    to the virus-contaminated excreta (Del Brutto et al., 2021b; Jakariya et al.,
    2021; Liu et al., 2021). The available data on the existing status of sanitation
    systems and hygiene pointed to potential associated risks of faecal-oral transmission
    of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic viruses in LICs (Adelodun et al., 2020; Guerrero-Latorre
    et al., 2020; Pandey et al., 2021). Del Brutto et al. (2021b) demonstrated a high
    level of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (45 %) in rural settings of Ecuador due
    to the poor state of on-site sanitation. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic
    material for on-site sanitation systems in rural areas was also found to be higher
    than the off-site sanitation with sewerage systems in Bangladesh (Jakariya et
    al., 2021), suggesting the negative impact the on-site sanitation could have on
    the transmission of the virus in LICs. 2.3. SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens
    in raw surface water and groundwater systems The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in drinking
    water sources such as surface water and groundwater systems is critical to understand
    potential transmission risks. A limited number of studies have detected SARS-CoV-2
    RNA in raw water sources, especially those impacted by raw or poorly treated sewage/wastewater
    in low-income and high-income countries. A comprehensive discussion of the evidence,
    including concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected, is presented elsewhere, hence
    is not repeated here (Gwenzi, 2022). Briefly, data from South America provide
    the most direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw surface water and groundwater
    (Guerrero-Latorre et al., 2020; Maidana-Kulesza et al., 2021; Mahlknecht et al.,
    2021; Kolarević et al., 2021). For example, in Quito (Ecuador), SARS-CoV-2 RNA
    was detected in surface water sampled from various sites along a river receiving
    raw sewage (Guerrero-Latorre et al., 2020). Mahlknecht et al. (2021) detected
    SARS-CoV-2 RNA in various water sources in Monterrey Metropolitan Area in Mexico,
    including surface water in dams and rivers and groundwater. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
    also detected in approximately half of the river water samples (75) receiving
    effluent from WWTPs (Maidana-Kulesza et al., 2021). In Europe, SARSCoV-2 RNA was
    detected in surface water samples in the Danube River impacted by raw wastewater
    from Belgrade, Serbia (Kolarević et al., 2021). Elsewhere in Europe in metropolitan
    Milan, Italy, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detected in surface waters, and the source
    was claimed to be partially treated wastewater and/or combined sewer outflows
    (Adelodun et al., 2020; Rimoldi et al., 2020). These studies demonstrate strong
    connectivity between wastewater and drinking water systems through surface water
    and groundwater and wastewater flows, thus forming a continuum. Here, a summary
    of the evidence is presented. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 and viral pathogens in
    surface water and groundwater systems is often due to the wastewater being discharged
    into surface water bodies and the environment without adequate treatment, especially
    when basic sanitation facilities are lacking in such settings. This has been demonstrated
    in a rural area of Brazil where SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the river water samples
    due to the direct release of human sewage in the river waters (Fongaro et al.,
    2021). Similarly, Kumar et al. (2022) observed high concentration of SARS-CoV-2
    RNA in the river water samples collected from Ahmedabad in India, despite the
    wastewater being treated from the treatment plants before its discharge in the
    rivers. On-site sanitation is often responsible for the pathogenic contamination
    of water systems, including surface water and groundwater sources. For instance,
    about 64 % of the residences in a densely populated Tehran in Iran are connected
    to the central sewerage system, while the sewage from other residences flows over
    the surfaces and underground, thereby contaminating the surface water and groundwater
    systems (Rafiee et al., 2021). The operational performance of sewerage and sanitation
    systems in many LICs is poor, with effluent generated not meeting the standard
    levels (Nakagiri et al., 2016; Pandey et al., 2021). It was reported that effluents
    from nearly 39 % of the sewage treatment plants in India do not meet the discharge
    standards into the surface waters as prescribed by the Environmental Protection
    Agency in India (IIHH, 2021). Besides, natural events like heavy rainfall and
    flooding could damage wastewater systems or overflow of the on-site sanitation
    systems like pit latrines, leading to overflow of untreated sewage (Dorji et al.,
    2019; Street et al., 2020; WHO, 2019). The evidence of highly contaminated effluents
    being discharged into the environment due to the overflow of septic tanks, especially
    when the soak pit system is lacking, was reported in Bhutan (Dorji et al., 2019).
    The discharged effluents in the environment were reported to likely contribute
    to the impacted water quality of the nearby Thimphu River (Giri and Singh, 2013).
    However, limited studies from LICs investigated the detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2
    or its genetic materials in surface water and groundwater systems. However, many
    studies have reported the contamination of surface water and groundwater systems
    from other forms of HPVs, especially those impacted by faecal pollution and wastewater
    discharges, which could provide a clue on the fate of SARS-CoV-2 in the same water
    systems (Table 3). Table 3. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in surface water and groundwater

    2017) The detection of high loads of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the surface water from
    low-sanitation regions of Ecuador and Brazil points to the possibility of the
    prevalence of the virus in the water systems of LICs due to the high level of
    poor sanitation and hygiene in addition to the poor state of sewage treatment
    and disposal systems in such settings (Fongaro et al., 2021; Guerrero-Latorre
    et al., 2020). Mahlknecht et al. (2021) reported a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2
    RNA in nearly 44 % (22 of the 50 samples) of the groundwater samples tested in
    Mexico, which was attributed to the possibility of untreated sewage entering the
    groundwater system via leaked sewerage system. Kolarević et al. (2021) detected
    up to 1.32 × 104 copies/L of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the Danube River in Serbia
    with only the samples impacted by the wastewater discharges indicating the virus''s
    presence. Similarly, water samples from the Arenales River in Argentina were reported
    to contain RNA due to discharge from a WWTP, which significantly impacted the
    river by faecal pollution (Maidana-Kulesza et al., 2021). High concentrations
    of viral load genetic material close to the reported influent samples (Table 1)
    indicates the poor state of WWTPs discharging into the river. Some studies have
    reported other viral pathogenic contamination of surface water and groundwater
    from unregulated sewage or wastewater disposals in LICs (Bedada et al., 2019;
    Eze et al., 2017). The incessant water scarcity and unequal access to improved
    sanitation facilities have often led to the use of untreated water from streams
    in many LICs, which could impact the transmission of HPVs and contracting of waterborne
    diseases (Adelodun et al., 2021b; Pandey et al., 2021). However, in the literature,
    data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA in drinking water systems in other low-income regions of
    Africa, Asia, and Oceania are scarce. In addition, some studies also suggest that
    even in high-income settings, households and communities using decentralized water
    and sanitation systems similar to those in low-income settings also exist. However,
    data on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in such water and sanitation systems are scarce.
    Such low-income settings often rely on raw or partially treated drinking water,
    which increases the risk of human exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and other waterborne
    pathogens. This highlights the need for further work in such settings, particularly
    crowded settlements. 2.4. SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens in drinking water
    supply systems The accessibility to safe drinking water systems devoid of pathogenic
    contamination has remained one of the challenges facing the world, with LICs being
    more adversely affected (Adelodun et al., 2021b). Recently, Nigeria has witnessed
    a decline in access to piped water in many of its urban areas from 32 % in 1990
    to 7 % in 2015 among its population (World Bank Group, 2017). While the quality
    or level of allowable contaminants in water supply systems varies with the intended
    purpose, the purest form with the least contaminants, including pathogenic levels,
    is required for drinking purposes. The drinking water system in LICs is usually
    sourced from groundwater (open and deep wells), surface water (streams or rivers),
    and harvested rainwater. The seasonal factor plays an important role in the type
    of water sources used for drinking (Liddle et al., 2016). Although there are relatively
    available water resources in many of these LICs despite their huge populations,
    the inadequate water infrastructure required for distribution and storage has
    limited the accessibility to clean and contaminants-free water resources for drinking
    and other domestic purposes (Adelodun et al., 2021b). These water sources are
    often contaminated by anthropogenic activities and other forms of natural contaminants
    due to the distance between the water source(s) and consumption point and the
    lack of adequate sanitation and hygiene in low-income settings (Mukherjee et al.,
    2015; Treacy, 2019). Some studies have reported the presence viral pathogens in
    drinking water systems in LICs (Table 4). The main source of human viral pathogens
    in drinking water systems in these settings is faecal contamination from untreated
    sewage disposals. Since most low-income populations source the water directly
    from either groundwater or surface water without any form of treatment, these
    water sources are contaminated by anthropogenic activities and other natural contaminants.
    The incidences of waterborne diseases caused by various forms of HPVs are due
    to contaminated groundwater, indicating pathogens'' potential to successfully
    transmit from disposed untreated wastewater to groundwater source (Craun et al.,
    2010). Table 4. Presence of human pathogenic viruses in the drinking water systems

    (Vivier et al., 2004) Removing SARS-CoV-2, coronaviruses and other viral pathogens
    often requires advanced treatment techniques and expertise in operating and deploying
    the treatment processes. The majority of the countries in low-income settings
    cannot deploy such advanced treatment systems for solid waste, wastewater, and
    drinking water to effectively remove HPVs, including SARS-CoV-2 (Adelodun et al.,
    2021a; Gwenzi, 2022). The conventional treatment processes are the most recognised
    and available means of water treatment for drinking in the urban setting, while
    the water is directly sourced and used in rural settings without any major form
    of treatment targeting removing the viral pathogens (Gwenzi, 2022). Thus, there
    is a need for low-cost but effective methods that can be deployed in low-income
    settings to remove SARS-CoV-2, coronaviruses and other viral pathogens in drinking
    water systems. The use of low-cost household kits for drinking water purification,
    specifically for the removal of viral pathogens, are encouraged since the existing
    water treatment systems in many LICs are not properly maintained and often overloaded
    leading to their inefficiency in the water treatment for human consumption. The
    use of disinfectant has also been suggested as an effective tool to inactivate
    SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. However, the accessibility to disinfectant reagents
    could be very challenging in rural settings of LICs. Moreover, the determination
    of an appropriate dose of disinfectant that can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and other
    viral pathogens without causing ecological and human hazards requires technical
    expertise, which is lacking in many low-income communities. Thus, there is a need
    to consider non-chemical alternatives that could effectively inactivate or remove
    the viral pathogens in water systems in LICs. The catalogue of non-chemical treatment
    processes that have been previously adopted to inactivate viruses and their relative
    performances is provided in (Adelodun et al., 2021b), which include coagulation-sedimentation,
    rapid sand filtration, ceramic water filter, micro and ultrafiltration, ultraviolet
    irradiation, and solar water disinfection. The use of hybrid systems combining
    two or more treatment processes and techniques has been found to be more effective,
    especially at the plant scale and could serve as an alternative to chemical and
    other advanced treatment processes in LICs due to their low-cost and easy-to-use
    features (Adelodun et al., 2021b). Furthermore, the effective storage of drinking
    water at the household plays an important role in protecting the drinking water
    supply from viral pathogenic contamination, which includes storage location, media
    or containers, and handling practices. Oftentimes, the drinking water is sourced
    from a far distance in rural communities of LICs, and there is a need to store
    it for an extended period. Brick et al. (2004) reported an increasing contamination
    of 67 % (25/37) of stored drinking water samples from 1 to 9 days. Thus, there
    is a need for an appropriate point-of-use device that could decontaminate the
    water in households before consumption (Adelodun et al., 2020). 2.5. Controls
    on SARS-CoV-2 and viral circulation in wastewater-source water-drinking water
    continuum Several anthropogenic and natural factors (e.g., hydrogeology) control
    the circulation of SARS-Cov-2 in the wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum.
    These factors control the degree of connectivity and water and microbial flows
    between the viral source (wastewater, sanitation systems) and the drinking water
    receptor (surface water, groundwater). Hydrological processes controlling the
    connectivity and circulation of viruses and other pathogens include (1) rainfall
    particularly extreme high-flow events such as heavy storms, cyclonic events and
    floods), (2) sewage discharges and spillages from poorly maintained decentralized
    and centralized wastewater systems, and runoff/erosion impacted by sewage, (3)
    infiltration and groundwater recharge from effluents from on-site sanitation systems.
    Hydrogeological processes and factors controlling the circulation of SARS-CoV-2
    and other wastewater-borne pathogens include (1) coarse-textured soils or geological
    systems, (2) fractured geological systems such as karst aquifers, and (3) shallow
    groundwater systems or aquifers such as wells and springs in wetlands or close
    to surface water bodies. In turn, these hydrogeological settings are characterized
    by; (1) high hydraulic saturated conductivity or transmissivity, (2) rapid or
    fast transit times between source and receptors, and (3) limited viral removal
    due to low residence times of fast transit times. For example, installing a soak
    pit system in the septic tank is expected to aid in removing pathogenic viruses
    and other pollutants as a part of land treatment measure of on-site sanitation
    for safe disposal of effluents in the septic tank. However, the soil conditions
    in some urban areas are not fit for the construction of soak pits due to the high
    compaction and low infiltration capacity required of a soak pit (Dorji et al.,
    2019). Leakage of septic tanks often occurs due to poor soil conditions and poor
    design and construction (Dorji et al., 2019). Septic tanks for on-site sanitation
    in developing or LICs are recommended to have a mean hydraulic retention time
    (HRT) of 1 to 3 days in addition to the soak pit system to absorb the overflowing
    effluents from the tank (Dorji et al., 2019; Iwugo, 1981). The role of hydraulic
    retention time in removing SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater has also been emphasized
    (Gwenzi, 2022). Anthropogenic factors promoting the contamination of drinking
    water systems with SARS-CoV-2 and other wastewater-borne pathogens include (1)
    overcrowding leading to overloading and spilling of wastewater systems and on-site
    sanitation facilities, (2) weak and poorly enforced regulations promoting the
    illegal discharges of raw or partially treated wastewaters, (3) poor siting of
    on-site sanitation facilities relative to and drinking water sources, and (4)
    poor hygiene in shared sanitation and water supply systems. For example, the siting
    of on-site sanitation, especially soak pit, close to the residences and drinking
    water sources, has become a challenge in LICs. In urban areas, the increasing
    level of urbanization has reduced the space for the proper siting of soak pits
    in suitable locations away from drinking water sources (Dorji et al., 2019; Gwenzi,
    2022; Nelson and Murray, 2008). In rural areas, however, on-site sanitation, and
    sometimes open defecation, is performed close to streams and rivers, the main
    drinking water sources in rural settings. The ideal recommended distance for siting
    a soak pit is 3 m from a building structure, with a minimum diameter of 1.5 m,
    and a minimum distance of 3 m away from drinking water sources or 10 m from waterbodies
    for domestic purposes in saturated soil conditions (Dorji et al., 2019; Mondal
    et al., 2014). However, these design requirements are not often considered, undermining
    the safety of the drinking water sources and human health. When there is adequate
    space, the soil conditions are inappropriate (Dorji et al., 2019). Aside from
    open defecation close to water bodies like streams and rivers in rural settings,
    the indiscriminate disposal of septage close to riversides is rampant in urban
    areas of LICs due to the lack of dedicated landfill or sites for such. The downstream
    users of the river impacted by either faecal pollution or wastewater discharge
    are mostly farmers, and villagers who depend on these water sources for domestic
    use and agricultural purposes could be susceptible to viral infections and waterborne
    diseases. For instance, it was reported that septage collected from Khuruthang
    town in Bhutan is disposed of at a site 30 m away from the Punatsangchu River,
    which many people downstream rely on for their domestic and agricultural water
    needs (Dorji et al., 2019). A mini-scale low-cost decentralized treatment system
    that can be adopted at the community level has been suggested (Dorji et al., 2019).
    This system has a community soak pit with individual septic tanks or community
    septic tanks with soak pit systems in which materials are locally sourced for
    the anaerobic treatment and anaerobic baffled reactor (Dorji et al., 2019). Once
    in drinking water systems, viruses and other pathogens may enter the human body
    via (1) ingestion of contaminated water and/or (2) inhalation of viruses in bioaerosols.
    Potential high-risk settings for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been discussed
    in an earlier paper (Gwenzi, 2022). These include prisons and correctional services
    facilities, which are often crowded, have poor sanitation facilities, and are
    well-known hotspots for the prevalence and transmission of respiratory infections
    such as tuberculosis. Educational institutions using shared on-site sanitation
    systems such as schools, universities or college campuses, often have large populations
    that may promote transmission. Healthcare facilities such as clinics and hospitals
    often use shared sanitation facilities and may promote transmission via fomite,
    bioaerosols or human-human contact. Lastly, quarantine and isolation centres housing
    symptomatic and non-symptomatic COVID-19 patients may promote transfer to other
    people due to overcrowding and shared sanitation facilities. 3. Risk assessment
    and mitigation strategy under low-income settings Risk assessment and mitigation
    strategies for pathogenic viruses in low-income settings require a comprehensive
    approach to address the unique challenges faced by these communities (Qin et al.,
    2023; Liu et al., 2024a). These challenges can include limited access to testing
    and healthcare facilities, lack of suitable control and prevention measures, and
    limited data collection (Chang et al., 2021). Despite these challenges, conducting
    risk assessments is crucial in identifying and mitigating potential risks associated
    with the pathogenic viruses. Risk assessment of microbial pathogens is the qualitative
    or quantitative estimation of adverse health risks following exposure to these
    agents which can be accomplished via epidemiological studies or quantitative microbial
    risk assessment (QMRA). The epidemiological approach is, however, more time-consuming
    and more expensive which practically may be unachievable in low-income settings.
    QMRA addresses the adverse health risks (infection, illness, death) for a specific
    exposure scenario to microbial pathogens such as viral particles through contaminated
    water. Since, exposure to even low levels of viral pathogens may pose some risk
    of infection, illness, or even mortality to susceptible populations, QMRA as a
    promising tool could predict risks associated with exposure to contaminated water
    (Bitton, 2011, Bitton, 2014; Hass et al., 2014). On the other hand, QMRA could
    provide comprehensive information for controlling and management of adverse effects
    associated with exposure to contaminated water and therefore, WHO has emphasized
    the importance of applying QMRA in preventing waterborne diseases (WHO, 2017).
    Several QMRA studies have been conducted to estimate the probable infection risk
    and disease burden attributed to both enteric and non-enteric viruses in various
    aquatic environments, including wastewater, drinking water, and recreational water
    (Gholipour et al., 2021, Gholipour et al., 2022b, Gholipour et al., 2023; Mcbride
    et al., 2013; Moazeni et al., 2017; Schijven et al., 2019; Vergara et al., 2016).
    Although comprehensive risk assessments can be difficult to carry out in low-income
    settings due to the limited availability and quality of data, this approach helps
    identify vulnerable populations and provides decision-makers with valuable information
    to make informed decisions on public health interventions, resource allocation,
    and mitigation strategies. In other words, comprehensive risk assessment and implementation
    of management strategies is needed to prevent potential health problem associated
    with exposure to viral particles in wastewater and impacted surface water. In
    this study, we comprehensively presented and discussed human health risks associated
    with the exposure to pathogenic viruses including enteric viruses and SARS-CoV-2
    from wastewater/ surface water. 3.1. Health risks from enteric viruses 3.1.1.
    Hazard identification and exposure assessment Several enteric viruses released
    in the faeces of infected individuals can potentially contaminate aquatic environments.
    Enteric viruses cause a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from gastroenteritis
    to aseptic meningitis and paralysis which gastroenteritis is probably the most
    frequent waterborne illness (Bitton, 2011; Pepper et al., 2015). The presence
    of enteric viruses in the wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum is
    of significant health importance due to their high excretion from infected individuals
    (even from asymptomatic individuals), inadequate removal in conventional water/wastewater
    treatment processes, prolonged survival in the environment, and low infectious
    doses (Gholipour et al., 2022a). From a public health perspective, the most important
    enteric viruses include rotaviruses, adenoviruses, noroviruses and enteroviruses
    (Bitton, 2011). Enteric viruses primarily spread through the faecal–oral route,
    either via direct contact with an infected person or through contaminated water.
    Transmission thorough contaminated water can occur directly (e.g., drinking water
    and swimming) or indirectly via contaminated food (e.g., aquaculture or agricultural
    use of polluted water) (Bitton, 2011; Pepper et al., 2015). As indicated in Table
    4, enteric viruses were identified in various drinking water sources, treated
    water, and even in tap water, with the highest frequency of detection observed
    for human Adenovirus, emphasizing the potential risk of viral infections thorough
    water consumption in low-income countries. Enteric viruses, particularly human
    Adenovirus with double-stranded DNA, have demonstrated high environmental persistence
    and resistance to chlorination (Rames et al., 2016). Inadequate water treatment
    and improper wastewater and sewage disposal practices can contaminate water sources
    with enteric viruses. Exposure to viral contaminated surface water during recreational
    activities such as swimming or fishing, may also pose a risk for recreational
    users (Gholipour et al., 2023). Accidental ingestion of contaminated water and
    wastewater poses an occupational risk for farmers during field irrigation and
    wastewater workers, respectively, serving as another route of exposure to enteric
    viruses. Furthermore, the utilization of inadequately treated wastewater or contaminated
    water in agriculture, particularly for the irrigation of raw-consumed vegetables
    is a significant concern for foodborne exposure to enteric viruses. Additionally,
    the agricultural reuse of wastewater may introduce enteric viruses into irrigated
    soil, potentially leading to gastroenteritis through the accidental ingestion
    of contaminated soil by farmers or children playing in the field. Based on the
    exposure routes, the Eqs. (1), (2), (3) could be used for calculating exposure
    doses: (1) (2) (3) where Cw is the concentration of viral particles in contaminated
    water (drinking water, recreational water, wastewater, irrigation water). Vw stands
    for the volume of drinking water consumed daily or volume of recreational water
    ingested per event, as well as the volume of water ingested accidentally by WWTPs
    workers or farmers. Vs is the volume of soil accidentally ingested by farmers
    during their works or by children when playing in wastewater-irrigated field.
    Vc represents the volume of crops consumed by people. SoilLog signifies the reduction
    of virus concentration in the soil due to soil properties, climate condition and
    predators'' activity. S is the volume of irrigation water remained on crops (retention
    capacity of irrigation water). K is virus kinetic decay constant based on the
    environmental conditions, t is the interval time between the last wastewater irrigation
    event and harvesting, and Rwash is the reduction of viruses on crops surface due
    to washing with water. Based on the interval time between the harvesting and consumption
    as well as application of disinfectants more reduction of virus dose through food
    consumption can occur (Farhadkhani et al., 2018). However, it is important to
    note that detection and quantification of many pathogenic enteric viruses such
    as adenovirus, rotavirus and norovirus through cell culture-based is difficult.
    Therefore, these viruses generally detected by quantitative real-time PCR methods
    which reports the genomic copy (GC) number. Since all the viral particles detected
    by real-time PCR are not infectious, therefore, the conversion factor of genomic
    copies to TCID50 should be added to dose equations. 3.1.2. Influential factors
    on estimated risks and management strategies Sensitivity analysis in QMRA studies
    has revealed that the virus concentration in aquatic environments is the most
    influential factor on estimated risks. However, the majority of viral particles
    detected in environmental samples using molecular methods may not pose health
    risks. In other words, to address the potential overestimation in microbial risk
    analysis, virus concentrations should be adjusted based on the infectious fraction
    value, which maybe varible based on the type of virus and media in which the viral
    particle is present as well as the climate condition. Additionally, in irrigated
    fields with wastewater/contaminated surface water, the viruses in soil and on
    crop surfaces would be reduced or inactivated by UV radiation and unfavorable
    conditions such as dry weather and high temprature. This is highlighting the importance
    of utilizing the virus decay rate and the interval time between irrigation and
    crop harvesting in QMRA. The use of personal protective equipment during occupational
    activities and crop washing/disinfection are additional factors that reduce the
    exposure dose. Additionally, it is important to note that the extent of crop contamination
    with viral particles through irrigation with wastewater/ contaminated surface
    water is related to the the type of crop and the retention capacity of irrigation
    water by cultivated crop. Although there is limited data on the potential persistence
    of enteric viruses in the soil and on the crop surfaces, the consumption of wastewater-
    or contaminated water-irrigated crops eaten raw represents an additional pathway
    for exposure to enteric viruses (Farhadkhani et al., 2018). The frequency of exposure
    to viruses is another important influential factor in the estimated risk. Furthermore,
    viruses exhibit varying minimum infectious doses, infection-to-disease rates,
    and disease severity, resulting in differences in dose-response models and ultimately
    calculated risks. Among the enteric viruses detected in the wastewater-source
    water-drinking water continuum, norovirus has the lowest infectious dose (<18
    viral particles) (Hall, 2012), indicating a potentially higher risk compared to
    the other enteric viruses. However, the infectious dose can vary in different
    situations, and the actual risk depends on multiple factors, including the specific
    circumstances of exposure and the health status of exposed individuals. Considering
    these influential factors is helpful to estimate more accurate and reduce uncertainties
    in QMRA of viral particles. There are acceptable health risk values available
    in guidelines for exposure to contaminated water. WHO and EPA proposed an acceptable
    infection risk of 10−3 and 10−4 per person per year (pppy) from exposure to waterborne
    pathogens, respectively (Gholipour et al., 2021; Mara et al., 2007). To meet this
    target, the implementation of mitigation strategies aimed at reducing exposure
    doses through various pathways, such as the promotion of water/wastewater treatment
    processes, utilization of personal protective equipment, extending the interval
    time between irrigation and crop harvest, and other measures, should be considered.
    3.2. Health risk from SARS-CoV-2 3.2.1. Hazard identification and exposure assessment
    During the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have reported survival of SARS-CoV-2 in
    gastrointestinal tract and shedding in faeces of infected individual, resulting
    in its high presence in WWTPs and surface waters contaminated with faecal matter
    (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3). Although, genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 has been
    found in raw wastewater, there is no evidence about the incidence of COVID-19
    because of direct exposure to treated or untreated wastewater or its spreading
    to people through the water in natural bodies of water (CDC, 2022). Since the
    berating of droplets and aerosols containing the SARS-CoV-2 is the main transmission
    route for COVID-19 (CDC, 2022), understanding the risk of COVID-19 from potential
    sources that may release SARS-CoV-2 aerosols, where some individuals are exposed,
    can help authorities make informed decisions to keep exposed people safe. Evidence
    from an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amoy Gardens apartment building in Hong
    Kong showed that aerosolized droplets of faecal-contaminated water were responsible
    for the spread of the viral infection in large numbers of people (McKinney et
    al., 2006). In WWTPs, some wastewater treatment processes such as pumping station
    and activated sludge release considerable aerosols/droplets which can carry infectious
    agents, including SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, might contribute to transmission
    of COVID-19 to the wastewater workers. Additionally, turbulent flow of surface
    water can spray droplets and produce aerosols. Therefore, inhalation of aerosols/droplets
    is emitted from different stages of WWTPs and from contaminated surface waters
    may pose health risks for exposed individuals via exposure to infectious agents
    such as SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, we estimated the potential risk of COVID-19
    from exposure to aerosols/droplets produced from SARS-CoV-2 contaminated wastewater/surface
    water. For this purpose, QMRA using Monte-Carlo simulation technique with 10,000
    random sampling from each distribution input was performed on SARS-CoV-2 concentrations
    reported in wastewater and surface water (Table 1, Table 3), following the approach
    proposed by Gholipour et al. (2021). Briefly, the dose of SARS-CoV-2 inhaled by
    exposed individuals (d) for 1 h was determined using Eq. (4). (4) Cw represents
    the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater or surface water (TCID/L). PCwa
    denotes the microbial water-to-air partitioning coefficient or aerosolization
    ratio (L/m3). IR is the average inhalation rate (m3/h). and RR represents the
    aerosol retention rate in the lungs. We assumed that WWTPs and surface water could
    generate inhalable-size aerosols (smaller than 10 μm) containing viral particles.
    The probability of SARS-CoV-2 illness in exposed individuals for one hour Pi (h
    = 1) or longer exposure time Pi (h ≥ 1) was estimated by Eqs. (5), (6), respectively.
    (5) (6) Where, d is the exposure dose and k is the model parameter suggested by
    Watanabe et al. (2010) (Table S1) and n is the frequency of exposure (the number
    of hours on which an individual may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 bioaerosols). QMRA
    input parameters and distributions introduced in the study are presented in Table
    S1. 3.2.2. Risk characterization The results of this study showed a median illness
    risk of 2.4 × 10−4 (95 % CI: 4.34× 10−8- 3.9× 10−2) and 3.39 × 10−5 (95 % CI:
    3.5× 10−7- 1.5× 10−2) thorough one-hour exposure to wastewater and surface water
    aerosols, respectively. As shown in the Fig. 3A, the estimated illness risk of
    SARS-CoV-2 thorough exposure to wastewater and surface water were lower than the
    WHO guideline value of 10−3 pppy. However, the results showed a higher risk thorough
    exposure to wastewater than surface water which is attributed to higher concentrations
    of SARS-CoV-2 reported in wastewater (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 & Table S1), since
    we applied similar assumptions for exposure to wastewater and surface water, except
    the concentrations of viral particles. However, as shown in Fig. 3B, an increase
    in exposure time led to an increase in the risk of illness, emphasizing the importance
    of exposure time in the context of COVID-19 risk. The results of Gholipour et
    al. (2021) also showed an annual respiratory illness risk of about 10−2 pppy for
    WWTPs workers. Download : Download high-res image (454KB) Download : Download

    Consistent with other viral QMRA studies, concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater/surface
    water is an important influential factor on the estimated risk. However, it is
    worth noting that detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and surface water
    does not necessarily indicate the viability and infectivity of the viral particles.
    Despite employing a conversion factor for genomic copy to TCID50 (Eq. S1 and Table
    S1), the estimated concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in our risk analysis and other
    QMRA of SARS-CoV-2 is a significant uncertain parameters which could lead to under-
    or over-estimation of the risk. Moreover, the lack of optimized dose-response
    model for SARS-CoV-2 and variability of water-to-air partitioning coefficient
    due to the type of microorganism and the quality of water, are other critical
    limitations for conducting QMRA for this pathogen. In addition, viruses in bioaerosols
    may experience significant dilution through air currents or be inactivated by
    environmental factors. Virus survival in the atmosphere is highly affected by
    the type of virus and the weather conditions including temperature and relative
    humidity (Bitton, 2011; Pepper et al., 2015). In this study, we assumed a similar
    rate of aerosolization for wastewater and surface water, which may introduce uncertainties
    in the calculated human health risks. In WWTPs certain units such as pumping stations
    and aeration tanks may generate more aerosols/droplets containing viral particles
    compared to other units and surface water. Therefore, working close to wastewater
    pumping stations and aeration tanks may pose higher risks than exposure to other
    units at WWTPs and surface water. Overall, the accuracy and reliability of the
    risk assessment heavily depend on the availability and quality of data, which
    can be challenging especially in low-income settings. Therefore, to enhance the
    effectiveness of risk assessments in low-income settings, contextual factors specific
    to these settings should be considered. 3.2.3. Appropriate preventive and control
    methods of SARS-CoV-2 transmission Despite the wide research on SARS-CoV-2, similar
    to influenza A virus, there is still debate about the modes of its transmission,
    specifically whether it is mainly transmitted via bioaerosols, or by droplets,
    or by direct or indirect contact (Pepper et al., 2015). However, due to the global
    health and socioeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventive measures
    must be taken wherever there is a potential risk for the transmission of viral
    particles. Although, the SARS-CoV-2 can be easily inactivated by the disinfection
    methods used in water/wastewater treatment (CDC, 2022), limited resources and
    infrastructure for water/wastewater treatment in some low-income countries could
    pose a barrier to control the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater-source
    water-drinking water continuum. The following measures are proposed to prevent
    and control the circulation and human health risks of SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater-water-drinking
    water system. (1) Occupational exposure Wastewater workers or persons which may
    experience the exposure to aerosols/droplets of surface water should be encouraged
    to use appropriate PPE, especially N95 respirator, which is highly efficient for
    filtration of airborne particles such as bioaerosols. The exposed individuals
    should perform hand hygiene frequently; and they should avoid touching eyes, nose,
    and mouth with unwashed hands (WHO, 2020b). It is important to note that reduction
    of the exposure time decreases considerably the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2,
    therefore, rotating work shifts could effectively decrease the risk of COVID-19.
    (2) On-site sanitation systems Transmission via shared on-site sanitation systems
    can be minimized via (1) using PPE, (2) regular cleaning, (3) rotating shifts
    between men/boys and women/girls, (4) having on-site fixed handwashing facilities
    and sanitizers, and (4) improving sanitation and personal hygiene during outbreaks.
    (3) Safeguarding drinking systems Drinking water systems can be safeguarded via;
    (1) practicing proper sanitation to avoid sewage spillages and discharges into
    drinking water sources, (2) proper siting of sanitation facilities relative to
    drinking water sources considering the anthropogenic, hydrological and hydrogeological
    factors controlling the circulation of wastewater-borne pathogens. Several low-cost
    drinking water treatment systems also exist, and these are discussed in an earlier
    paper (Gwenzi, 2022). Other measures to mitigate transmission during outbreaks
    include (1) identifying and using low-risk drinking water sources (e.g., far away
    from human settlements), and (2) supply of clean drinking water during outbreaks.
    Implementing these mitigation measures should also address gendered aspects of
    COVID-19 discussed earlier. 4. Future perspectives and research directions Several
    knowledge gaps exist with respect to viruses in the wastewater-source water-drinking
    water continuum. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems, some of these
    gaps are discussed in earlier studies focusing on low-income settings (Adelodun
    et al., 2020; Gwenzi, 2022). Most of the gaps are cross-cutting and relevant to
    other viral pathogens. In summary, future research on viral pathogens in the wastewater-source
    water-drinking water system continuum should address the gaps highlighted here.
    (1) Establishing strong quantitative evidence on human exposure and health risks.
    Quantitative data linking viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater,
    water and drinking water to specific human health outcomes regarding infection,
    morbidity and mortality are still lacking. Potential tools to achieve this include
    (1) quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), and (2) disability-adjusted
    life years (DALYs) approach. Quantitative risk assessment should consider multiple
    sources of SARS-CoV-2 and multiple exposure routes or pathways. Quantitative risk
    assessment data are needed to serve as decision and policy-making tools. (2) Comprehensive
    database on viral pathogens in wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum.
    The few available studies are limited to viral RNA, which does not indicate viable
    viruses. There is a need for further empirical evidence on the occurrence and
    stability of viable viral particle in wastewater, water and drinking water systems
    in low-income settings such as informal settlements. (3) Viral source tracking
    and apportionment in wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum. The need
    for source tracking and apportionment of viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-2
    and its proxies in the wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum. Source
    tracking and apportionment will identify the specific viral and SARS-CoV-2 sources
    and their relative contribution to the total viral load in drinking water systems
    and the human body. Such information is critical for decision-making, such as
    prioritizing resources to mitigate transmission from sources to receptors. (4)
    Development and validation of wastewater, source water and drinking water-based
    epidemiology. The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 and viral pathogens in the wastewater-source
    water-drinking water continuum could form the basis of wastewater-based epidemiology
    in low-income settings. The potential for using viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater-source
    water-drinking water continuum as a tool for environmental surveillance has been
    discussed (Gwenzi, 2022). Specifically, an earlier paper has discussed in detailed
    the wastewater-epidemiology, including principles, opportunities, potential applications
    and limitations (Gwenzi, 2022). However, there is a need to validate such a tool
    in low-income settings. To date, the bulk of studies have been limited to the
    use of wastewater, while excluding raw drinking water as a potential surveillance
    medium. (5) Currently under-utilized emerging and novel tools relevant to low-income
    settings. Several currently under-utilized tools can offer insights into virus
    transmission dynamics via the wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum.
    These include genomics, big data analytics or artificial intelligence, sero-surveillance,
    GIS, and statistical techniques e.g., Bayesian inferences. During future outbreaks,
    drones or unmanned air vehicle systems can also be valuable technologies for delivering
    emergency and healthcare supplies. An earlier review presented details of how
    these tools can be used for understanding SARS-CoV-2 (Gwenzi, 2022), and these
    applications can be extended to other viral pathogens. (6) Topical challenges
    in fighting SARS-CoV-2 and viral pathogens in low-income settings. Several topical
    issues unique to low-income settings also exist. Detailed discussion of the risks
    and challenges associated with SARS-CoV-2 unique to in low-income settings relative
    to high-income settings are discussed in earlier papers by the first authors (Gwenzi,
    2021; Gwenzi and Rzymski, 2021; Gwenzi, 2022). These earlier papers cover a range
    of topical issues in low-income settings including weak research systems, healthcare
    and diagnostic facilities, vaccine inequity, gender inequality, and poor water,
    sanitation and hygiene facilities (Gwenzi, 2021; Gwenzi and Rzymski, 2021; Gwenzi,
    2022a, Gwenzi, 2022b; Rzymski et al., 2021). Therefore, tacking future outbreaks
    of viral infections including those caused by SARS-CoV-2 calls for addressing
    several other underlying topical issues. 5. Conclusions and outlook The present
    review examined evidence to trace the occurrence and assess human exposure risks
    related to viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, within the wastewater-source
    water-drinking water continuum. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative
    analyses, the study revealed that viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, have
    been identified in wastewater, on-site sanitation systems, and surface water and
    groundwater serving as potential sources for drinking water. Anthropogenic and
    hydro(geo)logical factors and processes were identified as crucial determinants
    governing the dissemination and circulation of viral pathogens within various
    aquatic compartments. Various risky behaviours and practices, such as wastewater
    reuse, were identified as contributors to human vulnerability in high-risk settings.
    The interactions of these risk drivers with anthropogenic and hydro(geo)logical
    factors demonstrate the multifaceted nature of the challenges posed by viral pathogens.
    A quantitative microbial risk assessment indicated that human exposure to viral
    pathogens through the inhalation of bioaerosols was higher for wastewater than
    for surface water. However, the potential for novel exposure pathways, including
    fomite transmission and drinking water ingestion, added complexity to the assessment.
    While viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in surface water and groundwater
    serving as potential drinking water sources, limited evidence links this to viral
    disease outbreaks. Additionally, data on viable viral particles in drinking water
    systems, particularly for SARS-CoV-2, remain limited, preventing the quantification
    of human exposure risks through these systems. In addressing these uncertainties,
    a qualitative discussion explored multiple exposure pathways and gendered aspects
    of SARS-CoV-2 in low-income settings. The integration of both qualitative and
    quantitative analyses facilitated the development of a comprehensive risk assessment
    and mitigation strategy based on existing empirical evidence. This framework,
    designed to address and alleviate risks associated with viral pathogens, including
    SARS-CoV-2, across the wastewater-source water-drinking water continuum, stands
    as a foundational guide for mitigating future viral infections. Ultimately, future
    investigations into the complexities of viral pathogens were discussed to provide
    a research roadmap for the effective mitigation and prevention strategies in the
    face of future viral outbreaks. CRediT authorship contribution statement Willis

  description: The Indian coastal waters are stressed due to a multitude of factors,
    such as the discharge of industrial effluents, urbanization (municipal sewage),
    agricultural runoff, and river discharge. The coastal waters along the eastern
    and western seaboard of India exhibit contrasting characteristics in terms of
    seasonality, the magnitude of river influx, circulation pattern, and degree of
    anthropogenic activity. Therefore, understanding these processes and forecasting
    their occurrence is highly necessary to secure the health of coastal waters, habitats,
    marine resources, and the safety of tourists. This article introduces an integrated
    buoy-satellite based Water Quality Nowcasting System (WQNS) to address the unique
    challenges of water quality monitoring in Indian coastal waters and to boost the
    regional blue economy. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services
    (INCOIS) has launched a first-of-its-kind WQNS, and positioned the buoys at two
    important locations along the east (Visakhapatnam) and west (Kochi) coast of India,
    covering a range of environmental conditions and tourist-intensive zones. These
    buoys are equipped with different physical-biogeochemical sensors, data telemetry
    systems, and integration with satellite-based observations for real-time data
    transmission to land. The sensors onboard these buoys continuously measure 22
    water quality parameters, including surface current (speed and direction), salinity,
    temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, Coloured Dissolved
    Organic Matter, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, dissolved methane, hydrocarbon (crude
    and refined), scattering, pCO2 (water and air), and inorganic macronutrients (nitrite,
    nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, silicate). This real-time data is transmitted to
    a central processing facility at INCOIS, and after necessary quality control,
    the data is disseminated through the INCOIS website. Preliminary results from
    the WQNS show promising outcomes, including the short-term changes in the water
    column oxic and hypoxic regimes within a day in coastal waters off Kochi during
    the monsoon period, whereas effluxing of high levels of CO2 into the atmosphere
    associated with the mixing of water, driven by local depression in the coastal
    waters off Visakhapatnam. The system has demonstrated its ability to detect changes
    in the water column properties due to episodic events and mesoscale processes.
    Additionally, it offers valuable data for research, management, and policy development
    related to coastal water quality.

    sea 1. Introduction Coastal ecosystems harbour diverse marine life due to being
    rich in nutrients through several natural processes such as river discharge, upwelling,
    and wind-driven mixing (Hutchings et al., 1995). These ecosystems are highly pressurized
    by anthropogenic activities, such as the direct discharge of industrial effluents,
    municipal sewage, submarine groundwater discharge, and atmospheric pollutants
    (Hader et al., 2020). In addition, the heavy traffic of ships and boats increases
    hydrocarbon concentrations in the upper ocean, which may have a toxic effect on
    marine organisms (McGrath et al., 2017; Paquin et al., 2018). The unique circulation
    and surface current structure at specific locations threaten the tourists bathing
    in the coastal waters. The sewage from the urban regions brings organic debris
    to the coast, enhancing the pathogenic bacterial load in the coastal waters (Prasad
    et al., 2015). Its consumption during bathing may cause water-borne diseases,
    such as cholera, diarrhea, etc. Coastal waters are used for activities like swimming,
    fishing, and boating, and therefore, monitoring helps identify and mitigate health
    risks from contaminants as well as safeguarding public well-being (World Health
    Organization, 2003). The coastal regions cater to a wide range of ecosystem services,
    boosting the country''s blue economy in terms of fisheries, aquaculture, maritime
    transportation, and tourism (Costanza et al., 2014). The blue economy components
    thrive in healthy marine environments. Safeguarding the quality of coastal waters
    and forecasting currents and wave patterns would help to avoid unwanted situations
    such as the drowning of people, pathogenic bacterial contamination, and health-related
    issues. Monitoring provides information for managing resources sustainably and
    boosting regional economies (Christie, 2005). The beaches attract tourists, and
    allied activities contribute to a significant fraction of the country''s economy,
    and maintaining good water quality increases its contribution to the economy.
    Coastal areas are vulnerable to climate change, including rising sea levels, intensified
    storms, ocean acidification, and nutrient loading associated with shifts in the
    ecosystem structure (Laurent et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018). Monitoring physical,
    chemical, and meteorological variables associated with biology provides evidence
    to address these impacts on coastal ecosystems. The release of anthropogenic nutrients
    to the coastal zones may trigger Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), which release toxins
    that may be harmful to marine life and human health upon their consumption (Anderson,
    2009). Monitoring nutrient loads in coastal waters aids in predicting and managing
    HAB events, protecting ecosystems and public health (Davidson et al., 2014). Coastal
    areas in the Indian subcontinent support a sizable population, and their livelihoods
    are closely linked to the coastal ocean. The hydrography and biogeochemistry of
    the east and west coastal waters significantly differ due to various forcings
    (Shetye et al., 1991, 1996; Gauns et al., 2005). For instance, intense upwelling
    occurs along the southwest coast of India during the summer monsoon period, where
    comparatively weak river discharge was noticed, in contrast to that observed along
    the east coast of India (Sarma et al., 2013). Similarly, the atmospheric pollutants
    over the east coast of India are several-fold higher than on the west coast (Sarma
    et al., 2021). The input of nutrients through submarine groundwater discharge
    is higher on the southwest coast of India than on the northwestern coast (Kumar
    et al., 2021). The magnitude of industrial effluents and municipal sewages are
    variable along India''s east and west coasts. Therefore, the human pressure on
    the coastal ecosystem is not uniform along the Indian coast due to variable input
    of pollution and waste disposal, which are ever-growing (Islam and Tanaka, 2004).
    The magnitude of pollutants and their impact exhibit significant variations over
    different timescales (Shaik et al., 2015) due to tidal oscillations, episodic
    heavy winds, precipitation, and eddies (Sarma et al., 2013). Natural disasters,
    such as cyclones, depressions, and storm surges, and anthropogenic activities,
    such as modification in the freshwater discharge through the construction of dams
    and inter-linking of rivers, and deposition of atmospheric pollutants, can enhance
    the nutrient composition, vertical fluxes, and ecosystem structure (Balakrishnan
    Nair, 2006; Sarma et al., 2010, 2021; Acharyya et al., 2012; Sridevi et al., 2023).
    The occurrence of cyclones modifies phytoplankton biomass, primary production
    (Maneesha et al., 2011; Sarma et al., 2019), and trace gas flux (Kumari et al.,
    2019). The Indian coastal waters are rapidly warming due to higher atmospheric
    pollutants than the global average (Sridevi and Sarma, 2021). The rapid acidification
    of coastal waters of the east coast of India was reported to be mainly caused
    by increased deposition of atmospheric pollutants (Sarma et al., 2021; Kumari
    et al., 2021). Ocean acidification, driven by excessive atmospheric CO2 absorption,
    risks marine life with calcium carbonate protective shells, like corals and some
    plankton species, disrupting marine food webs and the broader ecosystem (Hofmann
    et al., 2010; Doney et al., 2020). These drivers can reshape coastal ecosystems
    by affecting marine species’ behavior and distribution, including coral reefs
    and their dependent species. Elevated temperatures can also impact fish migration,
    affecting fisheries and coastal communities. Besides ocean warming and acidification,
    coastal hypoxia expansion is a global concern for oceans. The Indian coastal waters
    face various extreme conditions, such as oxygen minimum zones or hypoxic conditions.
    Such conditions are mainly caused by natural processes, such as coastal upwelling
    and stratification driven by river waters (Gupta et al., 2009; Sarma et al., 2013).
    Changes in land use, agricultural activities, urbanization, industrialization,
    and new port constructions along the Indian coast make it especially vulnerable
    to human-induced disruptions, significantly altering material flows to coastal
    waters and impacting biogeochemistry and marine ecology, including marine resources.
    The recurrence of HAB leads to the deterioration of water quality in the Indian
    coastal water and is attributed to a complex interplay of natural and anthropogenic
    factors (Oyeku and Mandal, 2021; Samanta et al., 2023). Specifically, several
    anthropogenic factors, such as aquaculture practices, the introduction of non-native
    species, wastewater discharges, excessive input of nutrients into water bodies
    from agricultural runoff, and industrial discharges, promote the rapid growth
    of algae. HABs also exert cascading effects on marine biota and coastal populations
    attributed to the consequent events of oxygen depletion, fish kills, changes in
    food web dynamics, economic impact on fisheries and tourism, etc (Baliarsingh
    et al., 2016; Samanta et al., 2023). Despite the high sensitivity of Indian coastal
    waters to natural and human influences, there is a lack of high-frequency time-series
    observation on physical, chemical and biological processes. While some studies
    have been conducted at specific locations, long-term data from fixed sites in
    Indian coastal waters is scarce. Though two coastal stations on the east and west
    coasts were established and measured for a few decades (Sarma et al., 2021; Shenoy
    et al., 2011, 2012), these measurements are biased by the tide and coarse temporal
    resolution. Establishing and maintaining measurements with high temporal resolution
    in the coastal waters is crucial to address this gap (Mathew et al., 2021; Samanta
    et al., 2023; Baliarsingh et al., 2023). A network of coastal stations, particularly
    moored buoys equipped with sensors for measuring biogeochemical parameters and
    traditional physical and atmospheric measurements, with real-time data transmission
    capabilities, is essential for addressing this lacuna. Envisioning a system for
    monitoring and understanding the coastal processes for nowcasting of water quality
    as well as model validation, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information
    Services (INCOIS) has initiated the “Coastal Monitoring” programme, funded by
    the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India, to develop a state-of-the-art
    Water Quality Nowcasting System (WQNS) augmented with autonomous coastal water
    quality observatory and ocean remote sensing data for the Indian coast. Against
    this backdrop, this article introduces WQNS to address the unique challenges of
    water quality monitoring in Indian coastal waters. 2. System setup The WQNS is
    an advanced monitoring and data transmission system that provides real-time information
    on water quality conditions in coastal waters. WQNS consists of a real-time data
    monitoring mechanism through autonomous water quality observatories, ocean remote
    sensing data, wireless mediums for transmitting data, a data processing system,
    and a web-based data visualization application. A schematic of the WQNS is presented

    black lines with arrows represent the boundary currents during summer and winter,
    respectively. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
    the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) 2.1. Sensors Measurements
    of specific water quality parameters are vital to assess the condition of water
    quality in coastal areas. The seasonal reversal of the current direction occurs
    in the coastal waters of India, resulting in significant variability in the physical,
    chemical, and biological properties. The equatorward flow of currents brings low
    saline, low concentrations of nitrate and phosphate, high concentration silicate,
    high chlorophyll-a, relatively basic pH, and low pCO2 levels. The contrasting
    features are observed when the current reverses to the poleward direction (Sarma
    et al., 2018). Ship-based time-series observations suggested that coastal currents
    play a significant role in food-web dynamics, greenhouse gas fluxes at ocean-to-atmosphere
    interface, formation of algal blooms, and intensification of oxygen minimum zones.
    In order to capture all these signatures, temperature, salinity, currents (speed
    and direction), dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, nutrients, turbidity, bloom indicators
    (phycocyanin and phycoerythrin), pH, pCO2 and CH4 sensors were installed on the
    buoy. Among these sensors, most of the sensors measure directly the targeted parameters,
    except bloom indicators parameters. Due to measurements of multidisciplinary data,
    the understanding of basic biogeochemical processes, interactions among land-ocean-atmosphere,
    and human impact on these processes is possible. However, the optical sensors
    are prone to lose their accuracy due to biofouling; hence frequent calibration
    is warranted. Nevertheless, accurate measurement of these parameters help in understanding
    the health and suitability of coastal waters for various purposes, including human
    use, and aquatic life. Considering the ecological perturbations and impacts of
    climate change, better insight into biogeochemical processes in ensuring public
    safety, and to take appropriate decisions about coastal resource use, a set of
    parameters using selected sensors were installed onboard the buoy component of
    the WQNS and their details are given in Table 1. Table 1. Details of parameters/sensors

    observatory design The autonomous buoy-based coastal water quality observatory
    (hereafter, coastal observatory) measures the environmental parameters at the
    deployed locations in the coastal waters. Sensors for measuring parameters, listed
    in Table 1, are installed in the coastal observatory with the provision to add
    new sensors. The sensors are installed on the buoy at depths between surface level
    and 6 m, depending on the sensor type (Table 1). All sensor readings, except nutrients,
    are logged internally at an interval of 30 min and transmitted through telemetry
    at user-defined intervals, while nutrients are measured at 3-h intervals. The
    long-term time-interval for nutrient measurements was chosen, taking into consideration
    the capacity of the reagent chemicals in the sensors. The nutrient measurements
    at 3-h intervals can cover the complete tidal cycle, and the chemicals in the
    mooring can last for one month. The GPS-based location tracker is utilized to
    track the coastal observatory''s location. The buoy setup is powered by rechargeable,
    sealed-maintenance-free lead-acid batteries recharged by solar panels. Key components
    of the coastal observatory are a data logger, sensors, power management system
    (solar charge controller, solar panels, batteries), junction box with cabling,
    INSAT transmitter, HF, and GPRS for data transmission. The other important parts
    of the coastal observatory are the mast, passive radar reflector, pressure relief
    valve, vandalism measures (360° viewing camera), beacon lamp, location tracker,
    and anti-biofouling measures. A schematic of the coastal observatory is illustrated

    pump and the sensors (left). 2.3. Observatory mooring Oceanographic moorings (Fig.
    3) are secured to the seabed using mooring lines attached to one or multiple anchors.
    These lines extend upwards from the anchors to buoyant floats positioned within
    the water column or on the sea surface. Typically, the mooring consists of a flexible
    segment connecting the surface buoy and the sinker weight. This segment acts as
    a buffer, restraining the buoys against the forces generated by wind, waves, and
    currents, even during extreme weather events. Moorings generally consist of three
    fundamental parts: a means of anchoring such as an anchor, chain, or line where
    instrumentation can be affixed, along with flotation devices that prevent the
    line and instruments from sinking to the ocean floor. Connecting shackles and
    links are commonly employed to join the various components of the mooring system
    and to ensure the instruments remain in alignment. The observatory is powered
    by five batteries, each battery 12V, 100Ah connected in parallel and recharged
    through four 65W solar panels protected with a polarity reversal diode. The battery
    panels are sealed under regular operation and do not generate hydrogen gas. 2.4.
    Software configuration and Graphical User Interface The data on different parameters
    are acquired from the coastal observatory in real-time and presented in a Graphical
    User Interface (GUI). The dashboard is available on the workstation at the two
    locations. The GUI displays critical information about the coastal observatory''s
    location, battery voltage, values of all the water quality parameters, and statistical
    data about the parameters. The dashboard, consisting of the front end, back end,
    and a database to store coastal observatory data, was created using free, open-source
    software (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (628KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Graphical user interface widget screen. 2.5. Wireless
    communication The data collected and stored by sensors are transmitted to a PC
    and processed into a human-readable format. WQNS uses three techniques of telemetry,
    namely the Indian National Satellite System (INSAT), Radio Frequency (RF) communication
    through HF, and the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) modem. These telemetries
    get activated at any time based on functioning and availability of signal. 2.6.
    Augmenting water quality observatory with Algal Bloom Information Service (ABIS)
    The rising occurrence of algal blooms poses a significant implication because
    of their adverse impacts on fisheries, marine ecosystems, and water quality. The
    Algal Bloom Information Service (ABIS) disseminated by INCOIS (Samanta et al.,
    2019; Baliarsingh et al., 2020, 2022) is actively producing and distributing near
    real-time information regarding the spatial and temporal presence and expansion
    of phytoplankton blooms, alongside related data, across the North Indian Ocean.
    This is accomplished using satellite-derived ocean colour data (Fig. 5). To provide
    value-added information on phytoplankton blooms along with parameters measured
    by the coastal observatory, regions covering the buoy locations have been added
    to INCOIS - ABIS and has been augmented with the data dissemination page of the
    WQNS. ABIS has been integrated with WQNS for users interested in detailed algal
    bloom information. Augmentation of ABIS with WQNS enables the users for comprehensive
    evaluation of the algal bloom events in relation to collocated water quality parameters.
    On the other hand, it is also aimed to improve the performance of ABIS through
    continuous validation-calibration by using the high-frequency time-series data
    on chlorophyll-a measured by the coastal observatory. In particular, in situ measurements
    by the coastal observatory will be very useful for the performance assessment
    of satellite retrieval algorithms and provide an avenue for tuning existing algorithms
    or the genesis of regional algorithms. Furthermore, the coastal observatory''s
    capacity to measure phycocyanin and phycoerythrin offers crucial insights into
    the evolution of blue-green algae and their blooms, ultimately contributing to
    ABIS''s ability to characterize algal blooms more effectively. Download : Download

    Quality control Active biofouling is anticipated in the coastal waters and may
    damage the quality of data collected by the sensor. In order to examine the deterioration
    of the quality of the data, several experiments were conducted. At each location,
    three sets of each sensor were procured, and one set of sensors is always in the
    laboratory, and it is called a master sensor. Before sensors were attached to
    the coastal observatory, they were calibrated following traditional methods (Table
    2) and with the master sensor. The coastal observatory is moored for one month,
    and during this period, the buoy location is occupied using a mechanized boat,
    and samples were collected close to the buoy location and compared with sensor-based
    data. After 30 days, the sensors were retrieved from the coastal observatory and
    brought to the laboratory, and measured each parameter along with the master sensor.
    The difference in measurements between the master and moored sensor was noted,
    and this difference was accounted for the biofouling impact on sensors. It was
    noticed that the impact is 2–5% on some sensors, which is below the sensors''
    accuracy. Table 2. Brief summary of the laboratory analysis protocols. Parameter

    parameters Two important environmental parameters, i.e., oxygen saturation and
    Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU), are derived from the real-time feed from the
    coastal observatory after a reasonable period of scrutiny. Oxygen saturation,
    expressed as a percentage, represents the proportion of oxygen concentration measured
    compared to the oxygen concentration of water in equilibrium with the surrounding
    atmosphere, taking into account potential temperature and salinity. This metric
    is crucial for understanding the exchange of oxygen between the air and the sea.
    AOU, on the other hand, indicates the variation between the measured dissolved
    oxygen and the expected oxygen solubility at the given temperature and salinity
    conditions. AOU offers insights into the collective biological processes affecting
    oxygen levels, encompassing both oxygen consumption and production. These two
    derived parameters are processed at the data processing facility and fed into
    the data dissemination system (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    water quality nowcasting data through a web domain for public monitoring effectively
    provides real-time information to the public, researchers, policymakers, and other
    stakeholders interested in the water quality information at the specific locations.
    INCOIS-WQNS disseminates near real-time variability of biogeochemical parameters
    through web-based infographics to serve the needs of various stakeholders and
    contribute to informed decision-making regarding water quality and environmental
    management (Fig. 6). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Significance of coastal observatory
    locations The coastal observatories are strategically positioned at the two important
    locations (Visakhapatnam on the east coast and Kochi on the west coast) of the
    Indian coastal waters, covering a range of environmental conditions (Fig. 1).
    Visakhapatnam is the center of the east coast of India, which is devoid of direct
    discharge of freshwater by any river; however, the seasonal reversal in currents
    bring Ganges River-influenced waters during October–December whereas relatively
    high saline water dominates during other periods (Sarma et al., 2018). This region
    receives urban and industrial discharges and is also related to port operations.
    Seasonal hypoxic conditions at depths below 50 m were observed during March–May
    caused by weak coastal upwelling and October–December when strong salinity stratification
    occurs (Sarma et al., 2013). The coastal Bay of Bengal acts as a strong sink for
    the atmospheric CO2 between October and December, associated with the spread of
    low salinity water from the Ganges River discharge whereas source to the atmosphere
    during other periods caused by coastal upwelling (Sarma et al., 2012, 2018). The
    disposal of sewage in the coastal waters has also affected the water quality by
    increasing the bacterial abundance, mainly pathogenic, in the shore waters (Prasad
    et al., 2015). Based on the isotopic composition of nitrogen in particulate organic
    matter, the spread of nitrogen pollution from anthropogenic activities was observed
    up to a range of 25 km from the coast (Sarma et al., 2020). The rapid acidification
    of coastal waters was reported due to the deposition of atmospheric pollutants,
    the spread of river discharge, and coastal upwelling along the coastal Bay of
    Bengal (Sarma et al., 2021). Millions of tourists visit Visakhapatnam City annually,
    with an increasing trend over the years. Visakhapatnam City is among the rapidly
    developing urban centers in South and Southeast Asia. With its swift industrialization,
    there''s a pressing need for ongoing monitoring of the environmental parameters
    in this area to understand the human-induced pressures on the coastal environment
    (Miranda et al., 2020). Coastal waters of Kochi forms a part of the southeastern
    Arabian Sea and is connected to Cochin Backwaters, the northern end of the Vembanad
    Lake system. The coastal waters off Kochi are influenced mainly by freshwater
    discharge (Revichandran et al., 2012). Seasonally reversing monsoon wind system,
    which reverses the surface circulation and freshwater discharge, is the major
    physical process for variation in hydrographical conditions (Seena et al., 2019).
    The summer monsoon, originating from the southwest, spans from June to September,
    while the winter monsoon, originating from the northeast, lasts from December
    to February. The study area experiences strong coastal upwelling during summer,
    associated with high primary and secondary productions (Kumar and Kumar 1996;
    Habeebrehman et al., 2008; Joshi and Rao, 2012). The study region receives pollutants
    from the port activities, such as ballast water, oil spills from oil-carrying
    tankers, Merchant and Naval vessels, and dredging activities, etc. The freshwater
    from river discharge carries highly variable optically active substances, making
    the coastal water more complex from the remote sensing perspective. The strong
    freshwater discharge from the backwaters protrudes to the coast as a buoyant plume
    with high suspended load and terrestrial efflux, ultimately hinter the light penetration
    to the deep layers, which results in the lowest primary production in the area
    (Srinivas and Kumar, 2006; Habeebrehman et al., 2008; Seena et al., 2019). The
    study area draws special attention because of the occurrence of seasonal mud banks
    at certain locations during the southwest monsoon period (Balachandran, 2004;
    Karnan et al., 2017; Muraleedharan et al., 2018) and phytoplankton blooms (Kumar
    et al., 2018; Samanta et al., 2023). During the summer monsoon period, strong
    CO2 flux to the atmosphere was reported from this region due to coastal upwelling
    (Sarma, 2003). 3.2. Performance assessment of coastal observatory at deployment
    location After a series of intercomparison tests with sensor-derived data and
    laboratory analysis, the observatory was deployed in the coastal waters off Kochi
    from 3rd to 21st March, 2022 and collected data at half-hourly intervals. During
    this period, the battery charging/discharging cycles and performance of the coastal
    observatory were examined with respect to the biofouling, algal growth, and, finally,
    drift in the values. Some of the optical sensors, such as ECO FLNTU (chlorophyll-a
    and turbidity) and ECO-Triplet (CDOM, phycocyanin, and phycoerythrin), are equipped
    with a bio-wiping mechanism, which cleans the sensor area before every measurement.
    Especially the sensors such as SEAPHOX (depth, water temperature, conductivity,
    dissolved oxygen, pH), SEA OWL (scattering at 700 nm, hydrocarbon crude and refined),
    PRO OCEANUS (pCO2 air and water), METS (methane), and SYSTEA (nitrate, nitrite,
    ammonium, phosphate, and silicate) have its respective sampling pumps and intakes
    ambient water from the respective depth to the sensor, for measurement. The oxygen
    sensor of the SEAPHOX module is designed for use in a CTD''s pumped flow path,
    providing optimal correlation with CTD measurements and thereby ensuring proper
    optical measurement of the dissolved oxygen concentration. However, biofouling/algal
    growths were noticed in the water intake pump/nozzle during the test period. Therefore,
    to prevent such growth, sensors and water intake systems were wrapped with copper
    mesh and successfully protected the equipment from severe biofouling, enhancing
    the sensors'' endurance, by which the servicing period extended from 2 weeks to
    a month (Fig. 3). Additionally, the intake pump''s plumbing''s black tubing also
    blocks light, reducing insitu algal growth. Every month, during the coastal observatory''s
    maintenance, copper mesh and plumbing were replaced. The performance assessment
    of a coastal observatory at its deployment location is critical in ensuring the
    reliability and accuracy of the data it generates. Such assessments are essential
    for various applications, including environmental monitoring, research, and resource
    management. Monthly field surveys are conducted near the observatory to accomplish
    this. Physical, chemical, and biological parameters are measured separately using
    standard protocols during each field survey. A brief summary of the methods and
    analytical conditions for different parameters is detailed in Table 2. Several
    measurements were made at room temperature and then computed for in situ temperature
    conditions. The coastal observatory data are validated using the field survey
    data to ensure its quality and reliability. Validation involves checking for data
    completeness, consistency, and adherence to predefined quality standards. Any
    data gaps or inconsistencies are also addressed. The performance assessment of
    the coastal observatory at its deployment location is a systematic and ongoing
    process ensuring the data collected is accurate, reliable, and fit for its intended
    purpose. The comparison of measurements by sensors and laboratory measurements
    of the same sample for both locations is given in Table 3. For all parameters,
    except nutrients, <10% deviation was adopted as an acceptance criterion, whereas
    25% for nutrients. The high percentage deviations (>25% discrepancy) between sensor
    and validation data primarily occurred when nutrient concentrations were below
    5 μmol/l. Thus, these high percentage deviations are still based on only fairly
    small absolute deviations. Different standards used for the analysis of specific
    parameters are provided in Table 4. Table 3. Intercomparison between sensor measurements

    results from the coastal observatory 3.3.1. Kochi: west coast of India The coastal
    observatory was deployed in the coastal waters off Kochi (9° 51.154′N; 76° 11.955′E)
    at a bathymetry of 20 m. The deployment location was chosen to address the estuarine-land-atmosphere
    interaction with the coastal ocean and its role in biogeochemical cycles (Mathew
    et al., 2021). The first measurement was carried out from 25th May, 2022 (tail
    end of the pre-monsoon) to 20th August, 2022 (peak southwest monsoon). After that,
    the coastal observatory was operational from 17th October, 2022 to 22nd December
    2022. During 2023, it was operational from 15th May 2023 to 3rd October 2023.
    The high-resolution dataset generated from the coastal observatory portrayed the
    physical and biogeochemical processes at different time scales (hourly to inter-annual),
    from diurnal to seasonal shifts in the coastal environment. Strong and steady
    southward currents (Fig. 7) were noticed during the southwest monsoon period,
    which carries terrestrial influx from the inlet regions far south of the domain.
    Similarly, northward currents were observed mainly during the winter monsoon period.
    Significant east-west currents noticed in the diagram indicate the existence of
    tidal currents. Hence, it can be inferred that the large-scale coastal currents
    and tidal forcings significantly influence currents observed off Kochi. Download

    Measured currents in the coastal waters off Kochi (Left) and off Visakhapatnam
    (Right). A large variation in the dissolved oxygen concentration (2–5 ml/l) was
    noticed in accordance with temperature and pH during the fall inter-monsoon period
    (Fig. 8). During this period, a slight freshening of the water column was noticed,
    where salinity values were inversely varied to temperature (Fig. 9). This is a
    clear indication of the prevalence of coastal upwelled water and its mixing with
    low saline surface waters over the shelf even after the southwest monsoon period.
    The data from the coastal observatory addressed the intensity and duration of
    upwelled waters and their mixing rates during this period. The high chlorophyll-a
    (>1 mg/m3) concentrations during October could be attributed to the persistence
    of coastal upwelling in this region (Fig. 10). The elevated levels of phycocyanin
    and phycoerythrin concentrations confirmed the occurrence of cyanobacteria in
    the coastal waters. In agreement with the coastal observatory data, ABIS also
    depicted elevated levels of chlorophyll-a in coastal waters off Kochi, which were
    restricted mostly to the coastal region (Suppl. Fig. 1). Overall, the coastal
    observatory effectively detected elevated levels of chlorophyll-a, whereas the
    satellite provided the extent of spatial spread. Download : Download high-res

    variation of chlorophyll-a, CDOM, phycocyanin, and phycoerythrin in coastal waters
    off Kochi. A drastic change in the hydrographic properties was observed from the
    first week of November as warming (1.5 °C) and freshening (by 1.8 PSU) of the
    coastal waters. It is evident that the coastal waters were transforming from an
    upwelling-dominated system to warm, low saline, well-oxygenated waters due to
    the intrusion of the Bay of Bengal waters (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). The pH in the water
    column was almost uniform except for a few low values for a short duration, which
    coincided with high methane (290 nM) and pCO2 (600 ppmv) concentrations. The CDOM
    data reflects the typical seasonal variability characterized by a mixed organic
    matter with considerable contribution from the autochthonous-allochthonous origin
    during the post-monsoon period (Minu et al., 2020). This could be attributed to
    the Bay of Bengal water intrusion and also to the influx of low-saline waters
    from the Cochin backwaters. The ship-based data could not be able to capture the
    changes in the biogeochemical processes during the transition from non-monsoon
    to monsoon period in the study region. However, the coastal observatory has sufficiently
    high data acquisition frequency to resolve such short events. In general, the
    coastal waters of Kochi experience frequent algal blooms, including diatom, dinoflagellates,
    and cyanobacteria (D''Silva et al., 2012). However, during the period of mooring
    of the coastal observatory, there were algal bloom events were not observed. However
    it is possible to capture such signatures in the future. The high-frequency, long-term
    real-time data records through the coastal observatories and near real-time mapping
    by the ABIS over a large spatial scale around the mooring location can provide
    valuable insights to understand the bloom dynamics and develop algal bloom predictive
    capabilities. 3.3.2. Vishakhapatnam: east coast of India The coastal observatory
    off Visakhapatnam was deployed on 21st August 2023 and collected successfully
    one-month long data. The coastal waters around the observatory mooring region
    experienced several episodic mixing events associated with the local depressions/rainfall.
    A slight low depression associated with rainfall, ranging between 20 and 50 mm,
    was observed during 24–28th August, associated with a decrease in air temperature
    (Fig. 11). This triggered the mixing of coastal water as evidenced by the decrease
    in sea surface temperature from ∼28.5 to 27.7 °C on 28th August 2023. Similarly,
    low sea level pressure of ∼995 hpa was observed during 4–7th September 2023, followed
    by a decrease in air temperature by 2 °C between 9 and 12th September (Fig. 11).
    The cooling air temperature led to the mixing of the water column between 9 and
    12th and 15–17th September 2023. As a result of these mixing events, waters that
    are rich in nutrients, poor in oxygen and chlorophyll-a were pumped to the surface
    from the subsurface waters as evidenced by the increase in nutrients (nitrate,
    phosphate, and silicate), low oxygen and chlorophyll-a concentrations (Fig. 12,
    Fig. 13). The pH, pCO2, and CH4 concentrations also responded to the mixing events
    as a decrease in pH and an increase in pCO2 and CH4 levels were observed, which
    were much above the atmospheric levels (Fig. 14). Download : Download high-res

    The decrease in salinity was observed at two periods (2–7th and 20–24th) in September
    2023 associated with a change in the direction of surface currents. The water
    flowed from offshore (northeast) from the last week of August and turned eastward
    between 2 and 7th September, bringing low saline coastal water to the coastal
    observatory''s location. A similar change in the direction of current occurred
    from 20 to 24th September, associated with a decrease in salinity, suggesting
    the advection of coastal waters to the coastal observatory''s location (Fig. 15).
    Despite both times, advection of coastal waters was observed, however, the magnitude
    of change in salinity associated with nutrients were different due to different
    current speed. The current speed during 2–7th September was lower (∼0.2 m/s) than
    20–24th September 2023 (up to 0.6 m/s), suggesting that more magnitude of coastal
    waters was advected to the buoy location during the latter period associated with
    high nutrients concentrations (Fig. 12, Fig. 15). The strong alongshore component
    (V) in comparison to the cross-shore component (U), in which southward-moving
    currents (-ve part of the V component) were dominated in the October month that
    shifted northward during November to early December (Fig. 15). Similarly, west-ward
    moving currents were also dominated in the late October month, which depicts the
    occurrence of coastal upwelling during this period. Even though weak, northward
    moving currents were noticed in November and December carrying low saline, oligotrophic
    waters from the Bay of Bengal to the coastal observatory region (Fig. 15). The
    periodic changes in the current pattern associated with biogeochemical features
    need to be understood with long-term datasets. Download : Download high-res image

    V components) in coastal waters off Visakhapatnam. The measurement by a suite
    of sensors moored in the coastal observatory has given the opportunity to examine
    how episodic events modify different biogeochemical properties in the coastal
    ocean. Episodic events are highly important in modifying the upper ocean biogeochemical
    properties and ecosystem structure. Though the seasonal variability in the physical
    and biogeochemical properties is relatively well understood, however, the role
    of episodic events is absolutely unclear. The coastal observatory could capture
    the mesoscale/atmospheric extreme events very well, and such events are difficult
    to study using ship-based observations. Continuing the measurements in the future
    may enable to measure the role of cyclones and depressions, which are common in
    the period of October to December, on biogeochemical properties and trace gas
    fluxes associated with pollutant release to the coastal ocean through surface
    runoff (Sarma et al., 2021; Kumari et al., 2019). 3.4. Challenges and recommendations
    Marine water quality observatories are required to examine the role of anthropogenic
    impact on coastal ecosystems and to manage the sustainable use of coastal resources.
    The physical, chemical, and biological properties of coastal waters vary at the
    time scale of minutes to hours due to atmospheric episodic events and tidal cycles.
    The ship/boat-based observations cannot be able to capture such variabilities
    and unmanned automated sensors can be able to give a wealth of information on
    mixing patterns, pollutants inputs, and their impact on the ecosystem. Due to
    harsh environments and high biological production, the sensor quality may be degraded
    due to biofouling, resuspension of sediments, and extreme atmospheric events.
    Therefore, it is mandatory to do routine calibration of sensors, clean, and set
    them up properly on a regular basis. Further, organisms attaching to the sensors
    can disrupt the data, so special measures like coatings and cleaning are used
    to prevent this. Some sensors, especially those measuring inorganic macronutrients,
    require more maintenance, including regular cleaning and the use of specific chemicals.
    In the present case, the targeted accuracy of measurements for nutrients using
    chemical methods was not achieved; efforts are underway to improve this. There
    is also a need to plan to handle the potential threats, including theft, vandalism,
    and natural hazards. Collaboration with local authorities to ensure the safety
    of coastal observatories is essential. Addressing these challenges in marine water
    quality observatories requires a multidisciplinary approach involving scientists,
    engineers, data managers, and policymakers. Regular assessment, adaptive management,
    and collaboration with relevant stakeholders are essential for the continued success
    of marine observatories in providing valuable insights into the state of our oceans
    and coastal areas. The ocean is constantly changing, and it is challenging to
    distinguish between variability driven by natural and anthropogenic forcing. To
    address this, long-term data collection, along with satellite sensor data and
    numerical approaches, are required. 4. Conclusion INCOIS has put a first-of-kind
    initiative for the Indian coastal waters towards autonomous measurement of physical,
    chemical, and biological parameters using a moored-buoy-based water quality observatory
    and web-based data visualization system. Data acquisition and its analysis revealed
    the occurrence of hypoxic waters and their persistence on the shelf off Kochi
    during the southwest monsoon period. Similarly, the changes in biogeochemical
    processes in the coastal waters during heavy river discharge periods and the incursion
    of the Arabian Sea''s high salinity water were monitored through this observatory.
    In addition to the real-time measured parameters, derived environmental parameters
    add valuable insights to the understanding of ambient water quality. Additionally,
    the augmentation of the remote sensing-based Algal Bloom Information Service (ABIS)
    with real-time data from coastal observatories enables an understanding of the
    consequences of algal bloom in terms of water quality deterioration. Furthermore,
    data from coastal observatories and near-real-time mapping by the ABIS over a
    large spatial scale near the observatory deployment location can offer insightful
    information for comprehending the dynamics of the bloom and enhancing algal bloom
    prediction capabilities. This forms India''s first marine Water Quality Nowcasting
    System (WQNS), providing real-time information to stakeholders, including fishery
    resource managers, tourists, tourism industries, ecologists, fishermen, researchers,
    and environmentalists. Taking advantage of high-frequency real-time measurement
    efficacy, INCOIS-WQNS envisions monitoring long-term changes in water quality
    parameters that will enable an understanding of the impacts of climate change
    and ecological response to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Currently,
    WQNS acquires in situ data from two strategic locations, one along the east coast
    (Visakhapatnam) and the other on the west (Kochi), through an autonomous moored-buoy-based
    observatory. The initial observations from the WQNS have shown promising results,
    e.g., the alternating oxic and hypoxic regimes that occur within a day in the
    coastal waters off Kochi during the monsoon season and the evidence of water mixing
    provided by the signatures of decreasing temperature associated with the local
    depressions in the coastal waters off Visakhapatnam. INCOIS envisages expanding
    the WQNS network to cover other biogeochemical hotspots of the Indian coastal
    waters. CRediT authorship contribution statement T.M. Balakrishnan Nair: Writing

  description: Soil moisture, also referred to as soil water content, is a crucial
    geophysical state variable in various fields, including agriculture, hydrology,
    meteorology, and remote sensing calibration/validation (cal/val). Therefore, accurate
    measurements of in situ soil moisture are essential to ensure the improved modeling
    of geophysical processes, perform cal/val, and apply them in decision-making for
    societal benefits. There are many ways to measure soil moisture, though the gravimetric
    method of soil moisture measurement is the most accurate, however, it is not suitable
    for real-time or large-scale field studies due to labor- and time-intensive procedures.
    In other words, the gravimetric method-based soil moisture measurements are not
    very feasible for hydrological or agricultural applications where a large number
    of in-situ observations are needed frequently as well as for validation of the
    remote sensing-based products that require sampling in a narrow time window during
    satellite passes. Hence, alternative modern methods like electronic sensors that
    measure soil moisture instantly are necessary for such applications. Since soil
    moisture sensors usually operate on the principle of dielectric characterization
    of the soil and water and use conversion relationships to provide soil moisture,
    these sensors require appropriate calibration for precise measurements. Although
    various procedures for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors are available
    in the scientific literature, factors affecting calibration, the technical complexity
    of calibration, and lack of confidence in their effectiveness limits their use
    in field studies. In this context, a review of soil moisture sensor calibration
    protocols has been conducted with the aim of examining the effectiveness and limitations
    of various calibration methods and approaches for dielectric permittivity-based
    soil moisture sensors. The importance of selecting an appropriate calibration

    Get rights and content Highlights • Accurate soil moisture measurement is essential,
    but gravimetric method is impractical for real-time or large-scale studies. •
    Dielectric-based sensors require precise calibration. • The review evaluates calibration
    methods, including regression equations and neural networks, highlighting effectiveness
    and limitations. • Selecting the proper calibration method based on sensor type,
    soil, and environment is crucial for accurate data. Abstract Soil moisture, also
    referred to as soil water content, is a crucial geophysical state variable in
    various fields, including agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and remote sensing
    calibration/validation (cal/val). Therefore, accurate measurements of in situ
    soil moisture are essential to ensure the improved modeling of geophysical processes,
    perform cal/val, and apply them in decision-making for societal benefits. There
    are many ways to measure soil moisture, though the gravimetric method of soil
    moisture measurement is the most accurate, however, it is not suitable for real-time
    or large-scale field studies due to labor- and time-intensive procedures. In other
    words, the gravimetric method-based soil moisture measurements are not very feasible
    for hydrological or agricultural applications where a large number of in-situ
    observations are needed frequently as well as for validation of the remote sensing-based
    products that require sampling in a narrow time window during satellite passes.
    Hence, alternative modern methods like electronic sensors that measure soil moisture
    instantly are necessary for such applications. Since soil moisture sensors usually
    operate on the principle of dielectric characterization of the soil and water
    and use conversion relationships to provide soil moisture, these sensors require
    appropriate calibration for precise measurements. Although various procedures
    for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors are available in the scientific
    literature, factors affecting calibration, the technical complexity of calibration,
    and lack of confidence in their effectiveness limits their use in field studies.
    In this context, a review of soil moisture sensor calibration protocols has been
    conducted with the aim of examining the effectiveness and limitations of various
    calibration methods and approaches for dielectric permittivity-based soil moisture
    sensors. The importance of selecting an appropriate calibration method based on
    the sensor type, soil type, and environmental conditions is highlighted in this
    review. We also examine various calibration methods, including traditional equations
    based on linear or polynomial regression and advanced methods such as the nonlinear
    approach (i.e., artificial neural network). The need for regular calibration and
    maintenance of soil moisture sensors to ensure accurate and reliable data is also
    emphasized. The review concludes by providing recommendations for selecting the
    appropriate calibration method/approach for dielectric soil moisture sensors to
    achieve the required accuracy and future directions. Overall, this review provides
    valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of dielectric
    sensor-based soil moisture monitoring and management. Previous article in issue

    (FDR) 1. Introduction Accurate measurement of soil moisture is crucial in various
    hydrological, agricultural, and remote sensing applications (Chen and Or, 2006,
    Lamaoui et al., 2018, Robinson et al., 2008, Rosenzweig et al., 2014). It determines
    crop water needs (Dong et al., 2020) and affects crop growth (Mane and Kadam,
    2021). Surface soil moisture (∼5 cm) significantly impacts rainfall-runoff relationship
    (Brocca et al., 2017, Mohanty et al., 2000, Pan, 2012, Rowlandson et al., 2013)
    and plays role in drought, floods, groundwater recharge, and water management
    (Robinson et al., 2008; Susha Lekshmi et al., 2014, Vereecken et al., 2014). These
    applications rely on soil moisture’s influence on various atmospheric processes,
    affecting hydrology, weather predication and agriculture (Lal et al., 2023, Seneviratne
    et al., 2010, Vargas Zeppetello et al., 2019). Understanding these interactions
    informs decisions on water resources, drought and flood mitigation and land use
    practices. Though soil moisture is an important hydrological state variable for
    various applications, these applications require soil moisture measurements at
    different spatial scales i.e., point- (for soil moisture monitoring stations),
    field- (such as farms), watershed-, and regional-scale. Fairly accurate soil moisture
    measurement at various spatial scales is essential to fulfilling the technical
    requirements of applications such as initializing the state, data assimilation,
    optimization of model parameters, and validation of model outputs (Lal et al.,
    2022). However, obtaining the soil moisture value (average) at a particular spatial
    scale beside the point-scale is no trivial task. As spatial evolution of soil
    moisture across scales depend on the soil texture, vegetation, terrain, and variability
    in precipitation (Pan and Wang, 2009, Yao et al., 2012). Thus, conducting in-situ
    soil moisture measurements at various locations within the chosen scale is necessary
    to obtain an accurate estimate of average soil moisture. The conventional approach
    of soil moisture measurement i.e., gravimetric sampling is the most precise in-situ
    method (Gardner, 2018), but not feasible to extend measurements at watershed-/regional-scale
    (Singh et al., 2019) and real-time continuous measurements at point-/field-scale
    (Mukhlisin et al., 2021, Mwale et al., 2005). Hence, there is a need for alternatives
    to gravimetric sampling, providing precise, spatially distributed in-situ soil
    moisture measurements over large regions with less time and effort to support
    various applications and validate remote sensing data. Over the past decade, the
    use of sensor-based techniques, for indirect measurement of soil moisture, has
    increased significantly (Yin et al., 2021). Various commercial sensors, including
    neutron, electromagnetic, tensiometry, and hygrometry types, have revolutionized
    soil moisture measurement (Gorthi et al., 2020, Nagahage et al., 2019; Susha Lekshmi
    et al., 2014). Electromagnetic sensors, like Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR),
    Transmission Line Oscillator (TLO), Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR), and
    Capacitance-based sensor are popular due to their simplicity and efficient data
    handling (Barkunan et al., 2019, Soulis et al., 2015, Spelman et al., 2013). These
    sensors typically measure soil dielectric permittivity, indirectly estimating
    volumetric water content (VWC) by assessing electrical conductivity or charge-storage
    capacity or travel time. Calibration is a crucial process that involves adjustment
    of the sensor readings to account for the specific conditions and properties of
    the soil to provide accurate and consistent soil moisture readings (Bogena et
    al., 2007, Spelman et al., 2013). For example, soils with higher clay content
    typically exhibit higher electrical conductivity, whereas soils with higher sand
    content often display lower electrical conductivity (Heil and Schmidhalter, 2012,
    Stadler et al., 2015). This difference can significantly affect accuracy of soil
    moisture sensors, especially those operating at lower frequencies, up to 150 MHz
    (Kizito et al. 2008a). Hence, the development of a robust calibration for a dielectric
    principle-based sensor is crucial to consider the frequency of the sensor and
    the type of soil where measurement needs to be carried out (Baumhardt et al.,
    2000, Bogena et al., 2007, Chandler et al., 2004, Seyfried and Grant, 2007). Several
    studies on calibration of soil moisture reveal conflicting results in the performance
    of lower-frequency soil moisture sensors and their relationship to the effects
    of temperature. Chen and Or (2006) established a relationship between frequency
    and electrical conductivity for soil moisture sensors having operating frequencies
    less than 150 MHz but did not investigate temperature sensitivity. Kizito et al.
    2008a suggested a solution to improve the accuracy of soil moisture sensors by
    increasing their frequency to more than 150 MHz. This helps to make the sensors
    more sensitive and reduces the effect of temperature. As a result, a single calibration
    curve can be used across different types of soils. In contrast, Ojo et al. (2015)
    found temperature and salinity sensitivity for the low frequency sensor at 50
    MHz such as Stevens Water Hydra Probe, and Cosh et al. (2016) reported a low absolute
    error (± 0.013 m3m−3) estimates for the low frequency impedance probe such as
    Theta Probe at 100 MHz. However, the recent study by Zawilski et al. (2023) emphasized
    the inadequacy of a single calibration curve (i.e., generalized calibration) for
    dielectric-based soil moisture sensors in same soil textural class at different
    locations, and suggested to develop soil-specific calibrations to achieve high
    accuracy in measurement. The many past studies (Cosh et al., 2016, Rowlandson
    et al., 2013, Singh et al., 2021, Zawilski et al., 2023) highlight the importance
    of developing various calibrations i.e., field-specific, soil-specific, and generalized
    calibration for achieving reliable accuracy based on the available resources.
    The divergent results in the literature emphasize the importance of appropriate
    calibration procedures for dielectric-based soil moisture sensors. While calibration
    of dielectric soil moisture sensors is crucial for accurate measurements, there
    is currently a lack of standardization and consistency in calibration methods
    among different studies (Francesca et al., 2010, Mittelbach et al., 2012, Ojo
    et al., 2015, Rowlandson et al., 2013, Singh et al., 2021). In this regard, the
    review conducted by Ochsner et al. (2013) focused on describing the state of large-scale
    soil moisture monitoring and identifying critical research needs to optimize the
    use of available soil moisture data. Their review covered emerging sensing techniques,
    remote sensing missions, monitoring networks, and applications of large-scale
    soil moisture measurements. From this review it was revealed that the lack of
    standardization in sensor calibration is a significant challenge for monitoring
    accurate soil moisture over a large area. Without standardized protocols for sensor
    calibration, the quality and accuracy of soil moisture measurements collected
    across different soil types and a wide geographic extent remain uncertain, making
    it difficult to quantify the associated uncertainty. Although the review did not
    specifically address the critical calibration methods employed for soil moisture
    sensors, these methods are integral components of comprehensive soil moisture
    monitoring. Also, the literature on soil moisture sensing techniques, calibration,
    and factors affecting soil moisture sensing lacks a comprehensive organization.
    As a result, reviewing existing calibration practices and methods for soil moisture
    sensors becomes imperative. In the modern era of smart agriculture and advanced
    sensing technology, soil moisture measurement is increasingly shifting toward
    the adoption of indirect measurement technologies especially use of electromagnetic
    dielectric soil moisture sensor. Furthermore, with the upcoming launch of the
    NISAR mission, set for 2024, which will provide high-resolution satellite soil
    moisture measurements, there will be a growing need for ground validation of these
    satellite-derived soil moisture products. Dielectric soil moisture sensors can
    play a crucial role in the satellite soil moisture products validation process
    due to its instantaneous and reliable in-situ measurements. However, several challenges
    persist for the dielectric sensor based accurate soil moisture measurements in
    a large region. Firstly, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding
    the specific calibration requirements of various commercially available dielectric
    sensors used in this domain. Although numerous research studies have addressed
    dielectric-based soil moisture sensor calibration, the difficulty lies in translating
    these research findings and recommendations into practical guidelines for farmers,
    agricultural practitioners, and researchers. This aspect is often overlooked,
    creating a gap in the implementation of effective sensor-based soil moisture management
    practices. Establishing standardized protocols for dielectric sensor calibration
    can improve the quality of data, promote comparability, and enable a better understanding
    of soil water resources, which will be need of various Governmental as well as
    Non-Governmental Organization. Failure to address these issues could result in
    unreliable measurements, misinformed decision-making, and, ultimately, environmental,
    and economic consequences. Therefore, a comprehensive review of previous research
    on dielectric soil moisture sensor calibration is needed to gain a deeper understanding
    of the most effective calibration methods and the limitations of current commercially
    available sensors. The primary goal of this review is to identify the most suitable
    calibration approach or strategy and establish guidelines to enhance the calibration
    process of dielectric soil moisture sensor, ensuring consistently reliable and
    accurate measurements. 2. Soil moisture measurement technique by using sensors
    Generally, there are two types of sensors used to measure soil moisture: volumetric
    water content (VWC) and soil matric potential (Sharma, 2019). The VWC sensor indirectly
    measures the soil moisture (Jackson et al., 2010), whereas soil matric potential
    sensors measure the amount of force required to extract the water from the soil,
    which can further be converted to VWC using soil–water retention curve (Yu et
    al., 2021a). Usually, soil moisture sensors that measure VWC are considered over
    soil matric potential sensors because their measuring range is limited to 0 to
    − 85 kPa which is not useful for dryer soil and repeatability of calibrations
    is poor in the field even when the same sensor is repeatedly recalibrated in the
    same soil and perform (Evett et al., 2008, Noborio et al., 1999, Spaans and Baker,
    1992). Several techniques are available to measure VWC by using soil moisture
    sensors like neutron scattering, gamma attenuation, COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing
    System (COSMOS) and dielectric techniques, including TDR, Transmission line oscillator
    (TLO), and capacitance probes (Caldwell et al., 2018, Campbell and Anderson, 1998).
    Neutron moisture meters (NMM) were once considered a reliable tool for determining
    soil water content in the soil profile. The NMM sensors work by measuring the
    amount of thermal or epithermal neutrons that are scattered or absorbed by the
    soil. However, due to radiological regulations and the need for constant supervision
    and trained personnel, the use of NMMs became limited, as highlighted in studies
    by Kafarski et al. (2019) and Susha Lekshmi et al. (2014). Furthermore, research
    by Yu et al. (2021b) has discussed that the NMM''s vertical precision is low,
    making it challenging to obtain accurate measurements of the surface layer. In
    contrast, the gamma-ray attenuation technique is a non-destructive in-situ technique
    that uses changes in saturated density to determine moisture content by using
    gamma rays (Evett et al., 2008). However, it comes with greater safety risks than
    NMM due to the use of gamma rays. Moreover, the operational costs of the gamma
    attenuation technique are relatively high compared to NMM. Despite its effectiveness
    in measuring soil moisture, potential hazards make it practically impossible to
    use gamma-ray attenuation techniques on a large scale, as emphasized by Zazueta
    and Xin (1994). The Cosmic-ray method, used to measure area-average soil moisture
    at the hectometre horizontal scale, is implemented within the COSMOS. This system
    utilizes a stationary cosmic-ray soil moisture probe to measure neutrons generated
    by cosmic rays interacting with air, soil, and other materials (Zreda et al.,
    2008). These neutrons are predominantly moderated by hydrogen atoms, primarily
    in soil water, and subsequently emitted into the atmosphere, where they mix instantaneously
    over hundreds of meters. The density of these neutrons is inversely correlated
    with soil moisture levels (Bogena et al., 2022, Zreda et al., 2012). This approach
    offers an advantage over the NMM sensor. It operates in a manner similar to the
    neutron probe, with a key distinction being its utilization of cosmic rays as
    the source of fast neutrons. This design choice eliminates the challenges associated
    with handling a radioactive source (Zreda et al., 2008). The COSMOS system offers
    a landscape-scale perspective on soil moisture, complemented by point measurements
    obtained through dielectric-based electromagnetic soil moisture sensors. However,
    it is important to note that the practicality of employing COSMOS in agriculture
    (as highlighted by Li et al. (2019)) and the probe''s measurements alone may not
    fully capture changes in soil moisture at greater depths (Dimitrova-Petrova et
    al., 2020, Peterson et al., 2016). A dielectric-based soil moisture sensor is
    a powerful tool for accurately measuring soil moisture content. Unlike other methods,
    such as NMM and Gamma-ray attenuation, this sensor works by detecting changes
    in the electrical properties of the soil, specifically the dielectric permittivity
    (Topp et al., 1980). The dielectric permittivity of the soil changes as the soil
    moisture content varies, which is reflected in the EM signal measured by the sensor.
    Analyzing these changes in the EM signal allows for estimating the soil moisture
    content with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, this type of sensor has a
    rapid response time (Mwale et al., 2005), making it ideal for applications where
    real-time data is crucial. Moreover, it can be easily calibrated for specific
    soil types and fields thus, enhancing its measurement accuracy. The versatility
    of the dielectric-based soil moisture sensor is another advantage, as it can be
    used as either a stationary or portable unit with minimal cost of operation. Overall,
    dielectric-based reliable and effective solution for measuring soil moisture content
    can be used in various other applications including agriculture and hydrology
    (Chen et al., 2012, Kameyama et al., 2014, Scheuermann et al., 2009, Schimleck
    et al., 2011). The dielectric-based soil moisture sensor has advantages over other
    methods, such as NMM and Gamma-ray attenuation. It is a valuable tool that has
    gained popularity due to its accuracy, rapid response time, and versatility. 3.
    Principle of dielectric soil moisture sensors Soil moisture sensors based on dielectric
    permittivity operate on the principle that when a sensor propagates electromagnetic
    (EM) wave through the soil, it encounters variations due to changes in soil dielectric
    permittivity. Dielectric permittivity is an electrical property of the soil that
    is highly influenced by the soil moisture content. The soil dielectric permittivity
    is defined as the ratio of the permittivity of the soil to that of free space,
    and is commonly referred to as the relative permittivity of soil or soil dielectric
    constant, which usually denoted as εr. The εr ranging from 80 for water to 1 for
    air, with variations between 2 and 5 for dry soil (Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018,
    Singh et al., 2019). Since the εr of water is much higher than the air and dry
    soil, the εr of soil–water mixture, is greatly influenced by the proportion of
    water present in the soil pores. As a result, electromagnetic dielectric soil
    moisture sensors, which make use of relative dielectric permittivity (εr), have
    evolved into well-established technologies for measuring the VWC of soil (Blonquist
    et al., 2005, Robinson et al., 2008, Topp et al., 1980, Wobschall, 1978). An essential
    aspect of comprehending the principle of operation of dielectric sensors used
    to measure soil moisture content is measuring the encountered variations in EM
    waves’ frequency, or charge-storage capacity, or travel time when passes through
    the soil–water medium. The variations in EM wave influenced by water content in
    soil as well as vary from one soil type to another, and may also influenced under
    different environmental conditions. In a soil–water mixture, a water molecule
    has the ability to either store energy (i.e., charge storage capacity) or release
    heat as a loss of energy when exposed to an EM field, which influences the EM
    wave and helps in measurement of εr. The εr is a dimensionless number that is
    in generally a complex-value, which can be characterized by its real (εr′) and
    imaginary (εr˝) parts, where the εr′ indicates the energy storage capacity (correlated
    with VWC) and the εr˝ denotes the amount of energy loss as heat (Mohamed and Paleologos,
    2018, Wang and Schmugge, 1980). The equations to calculate the real and imaginary
    parts of εr are as follows: (1) (2) The contribution of the σdc term is relevant
    only when the material has some ionic conduction, and its value is non-zero. The
    refractive index is represented by n, while εs stands for the static relative
    permittivity. ω is the applied angular frequency (2πf) and τ is the relaxation
    time (time required for the water molecule to align itself with an applied field).
    In general, dielectric soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture content by
    analyzing the ability of soil to store electrical energy in an electric field
    based on the soil dielectric permittivity (Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018, Wang
    and Schmugge, 1980). This unique property of soil, which enables the storage of
    electric charge without polarizing salt ions, is measurable in terms of the dielectric
    permittivity. Since soil consists of solid, liquid, and gas, each with a different
    dielectric permittivity, dielectric sensors relate the change in the dielectric
    permittivity of the solid and liquid components by volume to determine the VWC
    (Blonquist et al., 2005, Campbell et al., 2021). 3.1. Types of dielectric permittivity-based
    soil moisture measuring techniques Generally, three dielectric sensor types are
    used for soil moisture measurements, such as Time domain reflectometry (TDR),
    Capacitance, and Transmission line oscillator (TLO). 3.1.1. TDR technique TDR-based
    soil moisture sensor is a commonly used technique to measure soil moisture based
    on the relative dielectric permittivity (εr) of soil. In general, TDR is based
    upon the cable testing technology, where sensors measure the time taken by the
    EM wave (travel time) to propagate along the stainless-steel rods that are surrounded
    by the soil, and this travel time depends upon the dielectric permittivity of
    soil. The schematic for measuring the soil moisture by using TDR is shown in Fig.
    1. The sampling oscilloscope generates an EM pulse and sends it into the soil
    through a TDR probe. It encounters a change in the εr at the soil–water interface,
    leading to alterations in εr and variations in EM pulse speed along the length
    of the TDR probe rods. Consequently, the initial pulse reflection occurs at the
    beginning of the probe rods within the soil, while the subsequent pulse reflections
    originate from the end of the probe rods. The elapsed time between these reflections
    serves as the basis for subsequent calculations. The technique involves measuring
    the time delay between the initial pulse and the reflected pulse is directly proportional
    to the distance between the probe, length of probe rods inside the soil, and the
    charge storage capacity (or dielectric permittivity) of the soil–water interface
    (Blonquist et al., 2005, Chavanne and Frangi, 2022). TDR calculate the εr of soil
    by measuring the time delay (Δt) in EM pulse propagation along the TDR probe rods
    of length (Le) that are surrounded by the soil medium using the following relationships
    given by Topp et al. (1980): (4) where, c is the velocity of EM wave in free space
    and Le is length of metal tine or rods or waveguide. The term c×Δt/2 in Eq.4 can
    be referred as the apparent length (La) of TDR probe. The La measures as a distance
    between EM pulse’s initial reflection (occurs at the beginning of the probe rods
    within the soil) and reflection originate from the end of the probe rods (Baker
    and Allmaras, 1990). Thus, the Eq.4 can be written as: (4.1) since La is related
    to εr, it can also be correlated with VWC. Saturated soil experiences an increase
    in La of the EM pulse along the probe rods, leading to a high εr value due to
    the presence of a high-water content in the soil. However, in dry soil, the La
    of the EM pulse along the probe rods is shorter, resulting in a low εr value.
    Readers can refer to Noborio (2001) for more details about La of the EM pulse
    along the probe rods under different soil wetness conditions. The TDR based sensors
    considered as the highly accurate and reliable soil moisture sensors (Baker and
    Allmaras, 1990, Fellner-Feldegg, 1969, Heimovaara, 1994, Noborio, 2001, Smith
    and Mullins, 2001, Topp et al., 1980). The equipment required for TDR measurements
    is relatively expensive compared to other soil moisture measurement methods, such
    as capacitance-based sensors and frequency domain sensor (Scheberl et al., 2019,
    Singh et al., 2023, Staub et al., 2010). Download : Download high-res image (274KB)

    apparent length (La) of the TDR probe across different soil wetness conditions
    (). Source: Noborio, 2001 3.1.2. Capacitance technique The capacitance sensors
    measure the capacitance namely electrical charge storage capacity, of the soil
    (Kelleners et al., 2004a, 2005a). The ability of soil to store charge is related
    to its water content present in the soil pores, allowing the sensor to determine
    the soil moisture. These sensors are cost-effective, and report acceptable accuracy
    with error less than ± 0.04 m3m−3 in soil moisture measurements (Bogena et al.,
    2007, Entekhabi et al., 2010, Francesca et al., 2010, Parvin and Degré, 2016).
    The relative permittivity or charge storage capacity of water is very high (εr
    = 80) as compared to dry soil (εr = 3–5) and air (εr = 1), thus any change in
    soil water content changes the εr of the soil–water mixture (Robinson et al.,
    2002, Singh et al., 2019). Since soil acts as a dielectric medium, the charge
    time of the sensor capacitor was used to measure the εr of soil. The capacitance
    sensor utilizes an electronic oscillator that generates a repetitive square waveform
    with a characteristic frequency (less than 100 MHz) to measure the εr of the soil–water
    mixture surrounding the two thin electrodes of the sensor, as illustrated in the
    schematic of the capacitance operation shown in Fig. 2. The relationship between
    the time (t) taken to charge a capacitor with a starting voltage (Vi) to a final
    voltage (V) with an applied voltage, Va of capacitor is as follows (Kargas and
    Soulis, 2012): (5.1) if resistance (R), Vi, and Va held constant then using Eq.
    (5.1), then charge time of capacitor (t) can be relate to capacitance (C), which
    is a charge-storage capacity of the dielectric material like soil–water mixture.
    The capacitance varies according to the water content present in the soil. The

    image Fig. 2. Capacitance-based schematic for measuring soil moisture. The capacitance,
    C, is related to the dielectric permittivity of a soil–water mixture and sensor
    geometrical factor, F (F = A/d, A is the area of conductive plates cross-section
    and d is the distance between the conductive plates) and can be calculated by:
    (5.2) By assuming charge time (t) as a linear function of dielectric permittivity
    of the soil–water mixture, the εr can be calculated as: (5.3) where, ε0 is the
    permittivity of free space. The εr of the soil is calculated by utilizing the
    charge time (t) of a capacitor in Eq.5.3. At a high-water content in soil the
    capacitor charge slowly and therefore the charge time is higher in wet soil as
    compared to the dry soil (Bogena et al., 2007). A typical capacitance sensor provides
    the outputs in terms of voltage (V) level, which is directly related to the charge
    time of the capacitor. The resulted output voltage is then related to εr or directly
    to VWC using specific calibrations. Capacitance sensors, which operate at low
    frequencies (less than 100 MHz), are widely used for measuring soil moisture content.
    However, their accuracy is highly sensitive to temperature and salinity, and therefore,
    a robust calibration is required to compensate for these factors during the measurement
    process (Bogena et al., 2007, Kelleners et al., 2004b). Despite this limitation,
    studies have demonstrated that low-cost capacitance sensors can provide soil moisture
    measurement with an acceptable absolute error less than ± 0.04 m3m-3 in the 0
    °C to 20 °C soil temperature range and up to 9 dS/m salinity. This makes them
    a viable option for validating remote sensing based soil moisture products (Mittelbach
    et al., 2012). Capacitance-based soil moisture sensing is relatively simple, instantaneous,
    and inexpensive, giving it an advantage for regional scale soil moisture measurements.
    However, the accuracy of capacitance sensors is limited by the depth of placement
    (Mazahrih et al., 2008), length of probe and the presence of salts in the soil
    (Kelleners et al., 2004a, Kelleners et al., 2004b, Kizito et al., 2008). Therefore,
    while capacitance sensors are a promising option for soil moisture measurement,
    their limitations must be taken into account when using them for different applications.
    3.1.3. Transmission line oscillator (TLO) technique and frequency domian Reflectometry
    (FDR) The TLO technique involves transmitting an EM wave into the soil and measuring
    its reflection, which is influenced by the soil''s dielectric permittivity (Caldwell
    et al., 2018, Munoz Carpena, 2021). The TLO sensor consists of a transmission
    line, a probe, and a measurement system as shown in Fig. 3. The transmission line
    is used to transmit the electromagnetic wave into the soil, and the probe (which
    act as an extension to transmission line) is used to measure the reflection of
    the wave. This measurement is then used to calculate number of reflection (Kelleners
    et al., 2005) or probe impedance (Gaskin and Miller, 1996). A differential oscillator
    circuit (frequency generator) is connected to the rods, and it experiences a state
    change in its oscillator when it detects the reflected signal from either of the
    rods. The measurement system is used to analyze the two-way travel time (t) or
    period (P) of the reflection of the EM wave and determine the soil moisture content
    as per the varying dielectric permittivity of soil under different soil wetness
    conditions (Caldwell et al., 2018). The travel time of the reflection is inversely
    proportional to number of reflections per second (fr, T−1) of the EM wave (Caldwell
    et al., 2018). The commercially available TLO sensors like Campbell Scientific’s
    CS-615 and CS-616 utilizes this principle for soil moisture measurement. The travel
    time (t) for the reflectometer can be related as follows: where, L is the length
    of probe rods, Sf is scaling factor, c is speed of light in free space, td is
    delay time in the probe head before the next pulse is triggered. Download : Download

    for moisture measurement. The radiometric coaxial transmission line oscillator
    technique, such as used in Stevenson’s Hydra Probe, utilizes probe impedance (Zp)
    to measure the dielectric permittivity. It is also referred as the FDR technique
    to measure soil moisture, which is based on swept frequency (i.e., collecting
    the data over a wide range of frequencies) of the EM wave. The sensing probe acts
    like an extra section of the transmission line, and its impedance changes based
    on the dielectric permittivity of soil around the probe rods (Gaskin and Miller,
    1996). Notably, the both TLO and FDR sensor-based measurement process involves
    repetition of multiple frequencies to obtain a frequency response of the soil
    based on the wetness. The frequency response of the soil is analyzed using mathematical
    models to determine the soil moisture content (Seyfried et al., 2005, Topp et
    al., 1980; Xu et al., 2012). When the voltage applied to the coaxial FDR, the
    response of signal is related to Zp is as follows (Seyfried et al., 2005): where
    Zc is the characteristic impedance of the coaxial cable (determined independently)
    and Γ is the complex ratio of the reflected voltage to the incident voltage. Under
    these conditions, the probe impedance is determined by the electrical properties
    of the probe itself (Z0) and the εr of the media in the soil–water mixture. The
    relationship is as follows: where L is the probe length and c is the speed of
    light. By using the raw signal outputs i.e. voltage level, it can be solved for
    εr (Seyfried and Grant, 2007). TLO and FDR technique offers significant advantages
    over other soil moisture measurement methods, such as TDR and capacitance sensors.
    Similar to TDR, TLO is also utilized for continuous measurements of soil moisture
    content at various points over a larger area (Lievens et al., 2015, Sanchez et
    al., 2012), and can measure moisture content to a greater depth (Bosch et al.,
    2006, Cosh et al., 2016). Capacitance sensors are limited in their ability to
    measure moisture content to shallow depths. However, the TLO technique is more
    expensive than capacitance sensors. Despite the higher cost, TLO provides more
    accurate measurements of soil moisture content, particularly in clay and organic
    soils. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of TLO in measuring
    soil moisture content in a range of soil types. For instance, Bosch et al., 2006,
    Kelleners and Verma, 2010, and Zawilski et al. (2023) found that Hydra probe provides
    more accurate soil moisture measurements in clay and organic soils compared to
    TDR and capacitance sensors. However, it is important to note that Bittelli, (2011)
    and Zawilski et al. (2023) reported that the accuracy of TLO or FDR measurements
    may still be affected by various factors, such as salinity, clay and organic soil.
    Although some experimental and theoretical approaches have been studies by Caldwell
    et al., 2018, Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2015, and Zawilski et al. (2023) to
    address this issue and all of them suggesting a soil specific calibration to improve
    the accuracy which is also the similar for other two types of techniques we discussed.
    Furthermore, from a cost perspective, the sensor based on TDR technique notably
    more expensive than both the Capacitance and the TLO or FDR technique. Specifically,
    the sensor based on TDR technique is approximately 3.08 times more costly than
    the Capacitance based sensor. Comparatively, the sensor based on TLO technique
    is around 1.29 times more expensive than the Capacitance sensor. Furthermore,
    when directly comparing the TDR and TLO or FDR, the TDR is roughly 2.41 times
    more expensive than the TLO or FDR sensor. The given costs comparison for a single
    sensor with a data logger were obtained from Kukal et al. (2020) and quote obtained
    from the respective companies. These cost differentials underscore the financial
    considerations associated with choosing the TLO or FDR sensor for soil moisture
    measurement, especially in large-scale applications. Therefore, while TLO or FDR
    offers many advantages over other soil moisture measurement techniques, users
    should carefully consider their specific needs and circumstances before choosing
    this technique. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the accuracy in soil moisture measurement
    of different technique-based dielectric sensors as reported in various research
    studies. Table 1 lists the measurement accuracy details of manufacturer-provided
    calibration or factory calibration and the calibration developed in various research
    studies for popular commercially available dielectric soil moisture sensors such
    as 10HS, TDR, EC 5, Hydra Probe, and Theta Probe. It is evident from the Table
    1 that the accuracy of measuring soil moisture using a dielectric sensor varies
    depending on the type of sensor used, the calibration method adopted, and the
    specific application. For instance, the 10HS sensor shows an accuracy of approximately
    ± 0.03 m3m−3 with factory calibration as well as specific calibrations developed
    in various research studies. However, the CS616 and CS625 sensors found to have
    soil moisture measurement accuracy of ± 0.025 m3m−3 with factory calibration and
    an accuracy range of ± 0.016 m3m−3 to ± 0.129 m3m−3 using specific calibrations
    developed in various research studies. The widely used Hydra Probe and Theta Probe
    found to have an accuracy range between ± 0.0177 m3m−3 to ± 0.0623 m3m−3 and ±
    0.018 m3m−3 to ± 0.055 m3m−3, respectively, in various research studies. These
    past studies also revealed that soil or field-specific calibrations can significantly
    improve the accuracy of the sensors in measuring soil moisture, as seen in the
    examples provided in Table 1. These finding highlights the importance of calibrating
    sensors to specific soil types and conditions to obtain accurate soil moisture
    measurements (Burns et al., 2014, Colliander et al., 2017, Cosh et al., 2005).

    affecting the accuracy of dielectric soil moisture sensors The soil moisture sensors
    are criticized for being non selective because of soil environmental impacts since
    they frequently operate at the low end of the frequency (Chen and Or, 2006, Kizito
    et al., 2008). The data presented in Table 1, demonstrates that the accuracy of
    the sensor differs when the identical equation is applied in the same soil type.
    This indicates that factors other than soil moisture content, including temperature,
    salinity and soil texture, affect the accuracy of the sensor. The laboratory and
    field calibration methods are commonly used in academic, scientific, as well as
    professional studies. Several studies have been conducted in past and still, there
    is a lot of research scope to ascertain how factors in the soil environment, such
    as temperature, salinity, and soil type, affect the measurement''s accuracy and
    dependability (Chandler et al., 2004, Kelleners et al., 2005b, Seyfried and Murdock,
    2004, Topp et al., 2000). Following we discuss such environmental factors (soil
    type, soil temperature, and salinity) that introduce uncertainties in the development
    of a robust calibration of the dielectric sensors and restrict them to become
    applicable universally. Another factor influencing the accuracy of sensor measurements
    during any application is the cost of the sensor under consideration (Mittelbach
    et al., 2012). 4.1. Soil properties The physical properties of soil, such as particle
    size, organic content, and management practices, are significantly influenced
    by a combination of factors. The amount and composition of the soil solution,
    along with porosity, density, and mineralogical composition, primarily determine
    these properties and depend on the soil type. Together, these factors constitute
    crucial parameters that distinguish different types of soil. The polarization
    and conduction of electric charge in the soil water system are significantly affected
    by the soil physical properties (Heil and Schmidhalter, 2012, Wobschall, 1978).
    The soil moisture sensor which utilizes dielectric permittivity a physical property
    of soil that measures the polarization and conduction of electric charge in the
    soil water system. However, alterations in the soil, arising from variations in
    soil physical properties, impede the precision of these sensors, necessitating
    their consideration and universal applicability (Arsoy et al., 2013, Bogena et
    al., 2017, Kargas and Soulis, 2012, Kargas and Soulis, 2012, Stangl et al., 2009).
    Soil texture classification primarily divides soil into two categories: mineral
    soil and organic soil. Clay soil within the mineral category is known for its
    high reactivity, while coarse-textured soil in the same category exhibits lower
    reactivity (Ojo et al., 2015). The electromagnetic soil moisture sensor uses relative
    dielectric permittivity (εr) for the estimation of the soil moisture in soil water
    medium. The TDR soil moisture sensor relies on apparent relative permittivity
    and employs the calibration equation developed by Topp et al. (1980). However,
    when dealing with soil high in organic matter, this calibration equation may not
    be suitable, necessitating the determination of a separate calibration equation
    as suggested by Kirkham (2014). Furthermore, Topp et al. (2000) observed that
    the equation proposed by Topp et al. (1980) becomes less reliable, especially
    for soil samples with a VWC exceeding 0.15 m3m−3, particularly when soil rich
    in salt or clay content. This inconsistency may arise from the complexities of
    conduction inherent in this method. To address this issue, they recommended incorporating
    the imaginary component of relative permittivity (εr) during the TDR calibration
    process. Similarly, Vaz et al. (2013) conducted an evaluation of multiple soil
    moisture sensors across various soil textures and reported variations in accuracy
    attributed to the type of soil. Additionally, Singh et al. (2021) conducted a
    comprehensive analysis of soil moisture sensors utilizing TLO or FDR techniques,
    with a specific focus on the ML3 Theta Probe. Their research findings underscored
    that the accuracy of these sensors exhibited variability depending on the soil
    type under investigation. In the course of their studies, they recommended the
    implementation of soil-specific calibration when dealing with soils rich in clay
    and organic matter. In a related study, Kim et al. (2020) delved into the performance
    of various electromagnetic-based soil water content probes, including the Hydra
    Probe, HS2, and FS100, in sandy loam soils. They noted Root Mean Square Deviation
    (RMSD) values around ± 0.040 m3m−3 without employing a specific calibration approach.
    However, they observed a significant improvement, with RMSD values falling to
    less than ± 0.025 m3m−3, when a soil-specific calibration was utilized. In conclusion,
    when calibrating soil moisture sensors, it is essential to consider the soil type
    under examination. For soils rich in clay and organic matter, it is advisable
    to develop a soil-specific calibration to achieve high accuracy. Conversely, when
    dealing with coarse-textured soils, a general calibration may yield acceptable
    accuracy. This approach ensures the precise measurement of soil moisture content,
    as highlighted in the studies conducted by Datta and Taghvaeian (2023) and Zawilski
    et al. (2023). Their research underscores the critical importance of tailoring
    calibration to the specific properties of the soil, particularly clay content,
    for accurate soil moisture measurements. 4.2. Soil temperature The dielectric
    soil moisture sensor utilizes frequency or electromagnetic waves to determine
    electric property of soil (i.e., dielectric permittivity) to measure VWC of the
    soil. The temperature of soil influences the physical and chemical properties,
    including its electrical properties (Andry et al., 2009, Kekane et al., 2015).
    Temperature fluctuations induce variations in electrical conductivity, consequently
    enhancing the interfacial polarization of water molecules. This leads to an increase
    in the real component of the dielectric permittivity of the soil, which can significantly
    impact the performance of dielectric soil moisture sensors, as highlighted in
    studies by (Bogena et al., (2017); Chakraborty et al., 2019, Yu et al., 2021.
    Contrastingly, Kelleners et al., (2005a) and Chen and Or (2006) have proposed
    that dielectric sensors operating at high frequencies (more than 100 MHz) exhibit
    considerable potential for accurately measuring soil moisture while minimizing
    sensitivity to changes in soil electrical conductivity and temperature. Notably,
    TDR sensors, widely acknowledged for accurate soil moisture measurements, operate
    within a high frequency range from 0.1 to 1.5 GHz. Within this frequency range,
    the impact of temperature on the calibration equation proposed by Topp et al.
    (1980) is generally minor, except under conditions of very high soil moisture
    levels (Yu et al., 1999). In contrast, TLO or FDR sensors operating at low frequencies
    (less than 100 MHz) exhibit minimal sensitivity to temperature variations. These
    sensors determine the real component of the soil relative dielectric permittivity
    by calculating it from both the soil dielectric permittivity and bulk electrical
    conductivity (σb). Notably, the Hydra Probe, an FDR sensor, records four voltages
    readings, with one specifically accounting for changes in soil temperature. These
    four voltage readings are then utilized to compute the relative dielectric permittivity
    of the soil through an empirical equation (Stevens Water Monitoring Inc, 2018).
    This implies that the Hydra Probe indirectly incorporates the influence of soil
    temperature into its measurements of the soil relative dielectric permittivity.
    Several studies have shown that capacitance sensors are highly sensitive to soil
    temperature (Evett et al., 2006, Kizito et al., 2008, Seyfried and Grant, 2007).
    Capacitance sensors operate at the lower end of the frequency, typically less
    than 50 MHz. The sensitivity of capacitance sensor measurements to temperature
    changes is primarily affected by operating at a low frequency (Chen and Or, 2006).
    The high sensitivity of capacitance sensors to temperature changes arises from
    their working principle. This is because capacitance sensors incorporate the soil
    as dielectric medium where the permanent dipoles of water molecules within the
    dielectric medium align themselves in response to an electromagnetic field and
    become polarized. For contributing to the dielectric permittivity, the electric
    dipoles, regardless of their origin, must respond to the frequency of the electromagnetic
    fields (Paltineanu and Starr, 1997). As mentioned previously, an increase in temperature
    leads to an increase in soil electrical conductivity, thereby enhancing the interfacial
    polarization of water molecules. This effect significantly influences the estimation
    of the relative dielectric permittivity of soil, especially when using capacitive
    sensors. Several studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity of capacitance
    sensors to soil temperature (Evett et al., 2008), while TDR sensors have been
    found to be less impacted by temperature (Olmanson and Ochsner, 2006, Robinson
    et al., 2008; Susha Lekshmi et al., 2014). Previous studies have proposed methods
    such as the measurement of temperature-based imaginary dielectric components and
    the application of temperature correction factors to reduce the temperature sensitivity
    (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2015, Fares et al., 2016, Saito et al., 2009).
    This highlights the importance of considering the soil moisture sensor technique
    as a potential factor of soil temperature when selecting sensor for accurate soil
    moisture measurements. Moreover, it is crucial to investigate the influence of
    temperature on sensor electronics amplification drift, especially when considering
    materials with relative dielectric permittivity. While there are a few studies
    that touch upon this aspect, such as Dean et al. (1987), who investigated the
    dimensional changes in electrode geometry induced by temperature fluctuations,
    highlighting the significance of the temperature effect on soil moisture measurements.
    They noted that it can be minimized in circuit design by incorporating component
    capacitors in parallel. Noborio et al. (1994) conducted a study on the impact
    of temperature changes on stainless-steel probes, specifically analyzing the TDR
    waveform. Their findings suggested no significant effects on the waveform due
    to temperature variations of the probes. In a study, Seyfried and Grant (2007)
    et al. examined the impact of instrument temperature on the calculated volumetric
    water content derived from the dielectric permittivity-volumetric water content
    relationship. They observed that the instrument''s effect exceeded 0.01 m3m−3
    in dry soil, diminishing at higher water content. Notably, their investigation
    spanned a temperature range of 5–45 °C. Despite these valuable contributions,
    the available literature remains scarce regarding the compensation for temperature-induced
    effects on sensor electronics amplification drift, especially concerning materials
    of relative dielectric permittivity. More extensive research is needed to elucidate
    the extent to which compensation mechanisms operate under these specific conditions.
    Future studies should aim to address this gap and contribute to a comprehensive
    understanding of the effect of temperature on sensor electronics. 4.3. Salinity
    Soil salinity refers to the concentration of salts in the soil, typically measured
    in terms of electrical conductivity (EC) or ion concentration which exhibit strong
    dependence on temperature. The presence of dissolved salts increases the EC of
    soil, which in turn increases the dielectric losses or conductive loss (i.e.,
    imaginary part of the relative dielectric permittivity) due to ionic conductivity
    and relaxation (Kargas and Soulis, 2019, Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018). As discussed
    in above sections, the dielectric soil moisture sensor utilizes various principles
    such as capacitance, TDR, and TLO or FDR to generate an electrical signal. It
    then measures a specific parameter (either frequency, travel time, period, impedance
    and charge time) in response to changes in the apparent permittivity or relative
    dielectric permittivity of the soil to infer the VWC using calibration equation
    (Blonquist et al., 2005, Robinson et al., 2003). Consequently, the accuracy of
    soil moisture sensors is influenced by the increasing soil salinity due to the
    effect on the electrical property of soil (Kargas et al., 2011, Kelleners et al.,
    2004b, Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018). In capacitance sensor, VWC depends on how
    fast an electrical circuit in the sensor oscillate. This oscillation speed is
    decided by how much the soil affects the circuit''s ability to hold electrical
    charge, and that, in turn, is influenced by the soil''s electrical properties
    (Kelleners et al., 2004b). As salinity levels rise, there is an increase in the
    concentration of ions in the soil–water mixture. These ions facilitate the flow
    of electrical currents through the soil more readily than usual. Thus salinity
    presents in soil interrupts the usual behaviour of the dielectric sensor and leads
    to either over or underestimation of actual moisture content of soil (Baumhardt
    et al., 2000). Thompson et al. (2007) studied the effect of salinity on the capacitive
    soil moisture sensor and found that the VWC increases in the well-irrigated treatment
    fields. In TDR, when a signal is transmitted through the soil, the extent to which
    the signal can pass through depends on the soil''s conductivity. If the soil conducts
    electricity too effectively, the signal can be lost, rendering it impossible for
    the sensor to make measurements. This occurs when the soil''s conductivity is
    so high that it essentially short-circuits the sensor. The presence of ions in
    the soil (related to salinity) increases soil conductivity, ultimately affecting
    the performance of TDR sensors (Susha Lekshmi et al., 2014). TDR measurements
    remain reasonably accurate without overestimation for soils with bulk electrical
    conductivity values up to 5 dS/m (Blonquist et al., 2005, Louki et al., 2019).
    However, if EC exceeds this threshold, correction becomes necessary. The calibration
    trend is non-linear within the EC range of greater than 5 dS/m (Wyseure et al.,
    1997), and it is advisable to employ non-linear calibration, incorporating EC
    into the calibration equation to rectify sensor performance. Singh et al.(2021)
    have described a method for integrating EC and dry bulk density into the non-linear
    calibration equation. In saline soils, the low-cost dielectric sensors may overestimate
    VWC due to the high relative dielectric permittivity of the soil. This issue has
    been reported in several recent studies, including a study by Inoue et al. (2008).
    This highlights the importance of calibrating the soil moisture sensors under
    conditions that accurately reflect the soil and environmental conditions in which
    they will be used. In these efforts, researchers have developed correction methods
    aimed at minimizing the impact of soil salinity on soil moisture measurements.
    One such approach is the two-step correction method developed by Kelleners et
    al. (2005). This method involves calibration of the sensors using soil samples
    with known salinity levels, followed by the development of a correction factor
    to adjust the sensor readings for the influence of soil salinity. Apart from this,
    in a study conducted by Peng et al. (2022) the impact of soil salinity on the
    Thermo-Time Domain Reflectometry (TTDR) method for measuring VWC, was investigated.
    The findings indicated that correcting for the effect of soil salinity in VWC
    measurements contributes to improved accuracy. 4.4. Cost In scientific applications,
    priority is generally given to the accuracy of soil moisture sensors over cost,
    as precision and reliability are critical for producing valid and meaningful results.
    However, in the context of large-scale studies and commercial agriculture, cost
    becomes a crucial consideration in addition to accuracy (Kukal et al., 2020).
    This is because these applications often require the use of numerous sensors,
    which can be expensive to purchase, calibrate, install, and maintain (Songara
    and Patel, 2022). Moreover, the labor and management costs involved with retrieving,
    analyzing, and interpreting data (Spelman et al., 2013). Therefore, while accuracy
    remains a top priority, it is important to balance it with the financial consideration
    of using a particular sensor in these contexts. The study by Czarnomski et al.
    (2005) evaluated three soil moisture measurement devices and found that the low-frequency
    sensor (ECH2O) was low-cost and performed well compared to the other devices.
    As a result, there is an increasing interest in using low-frequency techniques
    to reduce the error in estimating soil moisture measurements for large areas (Kelleners
    et al., 2004a, 2004b). Nonetheless, the high cost of some sensors has led researchers
    to develop low-cost soil moisture measurement sensors that maintain accuracy (Adla
    et al., 2020, Bogena et al., 2007, Chavanne and Frangi, 2022, González-Teruel
    et al., 2019, Kargas and Soulis, 2012, Mane and Kadam, 2021, Nagahage et al.,
    2019). The use of TDR and TLO techniques in hydrological research (Buytaert et
    al., 2014, Mohanty et al., 2000, Robinson et al., 2008, Singh et al., 2021) and
    remote sensing-based calibration/validation research (Cosh et al., 2016, Cosh
    et al., 2005, Jackson et al., 2010) suggests that these techniques are precise
    and reliable for soil moisture measurement. However, it is crucial to consider
    the trade-off between cost and accuracy, as some low-cost sensors may not be as
    accurate as high-cost ones. Therefore, while accuracy remains a top priority,
    it is necessary to balance the cost and feasibility of using a particular sensor
    for soil moisture measurement in different applications, such as scientific and
    commercial agriculture. Low-cost sensors, while offering affordability and accessibility,
    often face challenges during installation due to their construction using less
    expensive materials and simplified designs. Further research required on the durability
    of low-cost dielectric sensors. 5. Calibration strategies across spatial domains
    Upon examining multiple studies regarding soil moisture sensor calibration, the
    calibration process can be classified into four major categories: (i) point or
    site-specific calibration, (ii) field-specific calibration, (iii) soil-specific
    calibration, and (iv) generalized calibration. This classification aids in comprehending
    each individual calibration condition and facilitates its adoption in research
    endeavors. 5.1. Point or site-specific calibration Point calibration refers to
    the calibration of the soil moisture sensor at a single point or a specific site
    in the field having no variation in soil type, topography, vegetation, and environmental
    conditions. This calibration involves measuring the response of the sensor to
    different known moisture levels (i.e., gravimetric sampling) and then establishing
    a calibration curve that relates the sensor''s output to the moisture content
    of the soil. Point calibration is straightforward and easy to perform (Gasch et
    al., 2017). From Fig. 5, it is observed that the accuracy of the point or site-specific
    calibration is better than ± 0.04 m3m−3 i.e., ± 0.022 m3m−3. The highest accuracy
    of ± 0.004 m3m−3 was found by Matula et al. (2016), which is significantly better
    than the accuracies reported for other methods, such as soil and field-specific
    calibrations. Matula et al. (2016) also observed that the accuracy of soil moisture
    measurements is influenced by the dry bulk density factor, which refers to the
    degree of packing between the sensing rods of the soil moisture sensor and the
    soil/sand particles. The authors found that good contact between the sensing rods
    and soil/sand particles is important for achieving high accuracy and that significantly
    higher Root-Mean-Square -Error (RMSE) values were obtained for loose packing.
    Based on these observations, Matula et al. (2016) concluded that direct regression
    approaches, such as point calibration, may be necessary for achieving high accuracy
    with soil moisture sensors in sand/soil with lower dry bulk density values. This
    highlights the importance of carefully considering calibration approaches and
    measurement conditions when selecting a soil moisture sensor. Additionally, it
    is important to note that all three studies, including the studies by Sharma et
    al. (2017) and Burns et al. (2014), were conducted in a laboratory setting for
    point calibration. Therefore, it is necessary to validate the findings in a field
    setting, as the behavior of soil moisture sensors in the field may differ from
    that in the laboratory. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Comparison of accuracy of soil moisture sensor by using
    point calibration. 5.2. Soil-specific calibration Soil-specific calibration is
    a type of calibration for soil moisture sensors that involves taking measurements
    at multiple points within a specific soil type. The goal of soil-specific calibration
    is to establish a calibration curve that is tailored to the unique characteristics
    of a particular soil type (Parvin and Degré, 2016). By taking measurements at
    different locations within the same soil type, a more accurate calibration curve
    can be established that accounts for any variability in soil moisture content
    that may exist within that soil type. To perform soil-specific calibration, a
    set of measurement points is chosen within the soil type of interest. The sensor
    is then placed at each measurement point and a moisture measurement is taken.
    This process is repeated for multiple moisture levels to establish a calibration
    curve that relates the sensor''s output to the moisture content of the soil (Cosh
    et al., 2005). Fig. 6 shows the accuracy of soil moisture sensors under soil-specific
    calibration by using linear and nonlinear calibration approaches across laboratory
    and field measurement conditions. In section 5.1, it was discussed that the overall
    accuracy of point calibration for soil moisture sensors is less than ± 0.022 m3m−3.
    But the studies conducted by Kukal et al., (2019) and Dong et al., (2020) also
    reported good accuracy values for soil moisture sensors under soil-specific calibration.
    However, the accuracy varied depending on the sensor type and measurement conditions.
    For example, the TDR sensor reported by Kukal et al. (2019) achieved a high accuracy
    value of ± 0.025 m3m−3 in the field, while Ojo et al. (2015) had a lower accuracy
    value of ± 0.188 m3m−3 in the field. Ojo et al. (2015) used the Hydra Probe sensor
    with the manufacturer''s default soil-specific calibration for clay soil and found
    lower accuracy. However, by using a soil-specific calibration developed for the
    soil in the study area, the accuracy improved to ± 0.025 m3m−3, and by using field
    calibration, it became ± 0.026 m3m−3. Similar observations were reported by Zawilski
    et al. (2023), who suggested that laboratory calibration for clay soil is necessary
    to ensure accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (70KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Comparison of soil moisture sensor accuracy in soil-specific
    calibration. In contrast, Cosh et al., (2005) revealed that soil-specific calibration
    did not improve the accuracy of the sensor when compared with field-specific calibration,
    but other statistics, such as bias were greatly improved. Ojo et al. (2015) suggested
    that the effectiveness of soil-specific calibration depends on the soil textural
    class. Soil-specific calibration produced the best results for clay soil, but
    it showed little improvement over the calibration for low-reactive, coarse-textured
    soils. Similarly, Singh et al., (2021) found that soil-specific calibrations were
    limited to specific soil textural classes and failed to reduce the overall error
    in soil moisture measurements at regional scale. Therefore, the choice of calibration
    method should consider soil texture and other measurement conditions, such as
    sensor type and field vs. laboratory calibration, to achieve the best possible
    accuracy. 5.3. Field-specific calibration The goal of field-specific calibration
    is to capture the soil moisture variability that may exist within the field of
    measurement. By taking multiple measurements at different locations and wetness
    conditions within the area of interest, a more accurate calibration curve can
    be established that accounts for any variation in soil moisture content that may
    exist due to factors such as topography or vegetation. In field-specific calibration,
    the bulk density is not determined based on soil type but rather on the specific
    area of interest. This means that the bulk density is calculated as an average
    value over the entire area, regardless of the soil type (Cosh et al., 2005). Therefore,
    in field-specific calibration, the focus is on the specific area being studied,
    rather than on the soil type. Cosh et al. (2005) conducted a detailed analysis
    of the effectiveness of field-specific calibration for soil moisture sensors and
    found that, while there was a minor improvement in accuracy with field-specific
    calibration, there were significant improvements in bias and a reduction in errors
    and outliers compared to generalized calibration. However, the study also highlights
    several limitations of using field-specific calibration for impedance probes with
    low frequency of operation. Firstly, the improvement in root mean square error
    (RMSE) with field-specific calibration may not always be significant (Zawilski
    et al., 2023), as shown in Fig. 7. Secondly, the calibration may still have limitations
    at very low and very high soil moisture contents (Mittelbach et al., 2011). Thirdly,
    there may be an inherent bias in the measurement of high soil moisture contents
    (Mittelbach et al., 2012). In contrast, Ojo et al. (2015) conducted a study that
    suggests that field-specific calibration provides the highest accuracy for low-reactive,
    coarse-textured soils as compared to generalized calibration. Similar findings
    were reported by (Kim et al., 2020). However, this finding may not apply to all
    soil types or environmental conditions (Zawilski et al., 2023). Download : Download

    soil moisture sensor accuracy in field-specific calibration. Overall, it is important
    to consider both the advantages and limitations of field-specific calibration
    when evaluating the validity of the data collected by soil moisture sensors. While
    there may be some improvements in accuracy, bias reduction, and error reduction
    with field-specific calibration, the effectiveness of this approach may be limited
    in certain soil types and moisture content ranges. 5.4. Generalized calibration
    General calibration involves calibrating the sensor using intensive measurements
    from multiple sites, fields, and soil types across a large region. This approach
    aims to establish a calibration curve that can be used across a broad range of
    soil, vegetation, topographic, and environmental conditions within the area of
    interest. Developing general calibration is challenging since these conditions
    can vary significantly over a large region or watershed. However, for regional
    or watershed-scale applications, generalized calibration is advantageous over
    other calibrations of being more straightforward, less time-consuming, and practicable
    (Singh et al., 2021). Fig. 8 shows the accuracies reported in different studies
    by various researchers across the world. The RMSE values range from ± 0.022 m3m−3
    to ± 0.1 m3m−3, with some sensors having better accuracy in the laboratory than
    in the field. The best-performing sensor in the field is the TDR sensor, with
    an RMSE of ± 0.027 m3m−3. The EC5 sensor was evaluated by several researchers,
    with reported RMSE values ranging from ± 0.032 m3m−3 to ± 0.1 m3m−3. The Hydra
    Probe sensor was also evaluated by several researchers, with reported RMSE values
    ranging from ± 0.026 m3m−3 to ± 0.059 m3m−3. The Theta Probe was evaluated by
    several researchers, with reported RMSE values ranging from ± 0.022 m3m−3 to ±
    0.065 m3m−3. The lower accuracies observed in soil were higher variations in the
    soil texture observed and Ojo et al. (2015) reported that the general equation
    performs better in low-reactive, coarse-textured soils. Download : Download high-res

    sensor accuracy in general calibration. Based on the information provided in Table
    2 and the cited studies, it appears that general calibrations for soil moisture
    sensors can be a viable alternative to field-specific or soil-specific calibrations.
    For example, the study conducted by Vaz et al (2013), utilized the factory-supplied
    calibration equation in nine different soils, and average accuracy of the CS616
    observed is 0.128 m3m-3 which also support the previous research (Mittelbach et
    al., 2012; S.R. Evett et al., 2011). This accuracy is improved to ± 0.041 m-3m-3
    with an enhanced calibration, highlighting the need for improving factory-supplied
    calibrations (Udawatta et al., 2011). However, the accuracy of general calibrations
    depends on the calibration approach used. The linear and nonlinear calibration
    approaches have different effects on the accuracy of the sensors as shown in Fig.
    8. Table 2. Accuracies of various soil moisture sensors by using linear and nonlinear
    calibration approaches for point, field, soil-specific, and generalized calibrations.

    for soil moisture sensors and have found that nonlinear general calibrations can
    result in higher accuracy. For example, Vaz et al. (2013) evaluated both linear
    and nonlinear general calibrations for the 10HS and Theta Probe sensors in laboratory
    settings. They reported higher accuracy with the nonlinear general calibration
    for the 10HS sensor, with an RMSE of ± 0.073 m3m−3 for the linear general calibration
    and ± 0.029 m3m−3 for the nonlinear general calibration. Similarly, for the Theta
    Probe sensor, they reported an RMSE of ± 0.04 m3m−3 for the linear general calibration
    and ± 0.029 m3m−3 for the nonlinear general calibration. Kargas and Kerkides,
    (2008) also evaluated both linear and nonlinear calibrations for the Theta Probe
    sensor in the field, reporting an RMSE of ± 0.065 m3m−3 for the linear calibration
    and ± 0.054 m3m−3 for the nonlinear calibration. These findings suggest that the
    calibration approach used for soil moisture sensors can play an important role
    in achieving high accuracy with general calibrations. Therefore, it is important
    to carefully consider the calibration approach when using general calibrations
    for soil moisture sensors and to evaluate the accuracy of the sensors under different
    calibration approaches to ensure that the best approach is used. In summary, point
    calibration is the simplest and most straightforward method, while soil field-specific
    calibration and general calibration are more complex but lead to more accurate
    measurements in specific conditions or over a broader range of soil conditions.
    The choice of calibration method will depend on the application and the level
    of accuracy required. 6. Calibration methods for dielectric soil moisture sensors
    Dielectric soil moisture sensors encompass various principles such as capacitance,
    TDR, and TLO or FDR as mentioned in section 3.1. As observed in Table 1, current
    trends in soil moisture sensing predominantly rely on the relative soil dielectric
    permittivity for estimating VWC. The calibration process entails establishing
    a relationship between the measured relative dielectric permittivity and known
    volumetric water content through soil samples. Therefore, the primary focus is
    centred on dielectric-based calibration. Generally, soil moisture sensor calibration
    methods can be classified as laboratory calibration and field calibrations (Burns
    et al., 2014, Ojo et al., 2015). Field calibration requires obtaining gravimetric
    samples from the field being studied and then comparing them with the corresponding
    dielectric sensor readings obtained from the same location (Cosh et al., 2005,
    Dhakal et al., 2019, Stangl et al., 2009, Singh et al., 2021), while laboratory-based
    calibration involves adjusting the sensor readings with gravimetric sampling in
    a controlled environment (Adla et al., 2020). However, the choice of calibration
    method depends on various factors, such as the type of sensor, soil type, accuracy
    requirement, cost and time involvement, and the intended use of the measurements
    (Burns et al., 2014). In fact, each of these methods has its limitations and advantages.
    During field calibration, practically it is challenging to collect the gravimetric
    samples with very wet conditions and also for very dry conditions, specifically
    when the VWC falls within the range of 0 to 8 %. In these arid conditions, obtaining
    accurate gravimetric samples and corresponding sensor readings can be exceptionally
    difficult due to the limited availability of moisture. In very wet conditions,
    it is difficult to get sensor reading for dry soil condition. In such challenging
    circumstances, we found that laboratory calibration becomes a viable and pragmatic
    solution. By conducting laboratory calibration for the dry range, we can ensure
    the accuracy and reliability of the sensor calibration process (Stangl et al.,
    2009). 6.1. Laboratory calibration method There are two methods used for laboratory
    calibration of soil moisture sensors, wet-up and dry-down, which have been described
    by various authors in the literature. In the wet-up method, as described by Young
    et al. (1997), the soil sample is first weighed and then water is added at a known
    rate until the soil reaches saturation. The outputs from an inserted sensor in
    the soil column are recorded at regular intervals as the soil wets. In contrast,
    the dry-down method, as described by Bosch (2004), involves starting with a saturated
    soil sample and allowing it to dry out naturally while the sensor output is continuously
    recorded. To carry out laboratory calibration of soil moisture sensors, Burns
    et al. (2014) and Holzman et al. (2017) suggested a standard procedure as shown
    in Fig. 9. This procedure involves packing an oven-dried soil sample of known
    volume into a glass beaker, ensuring that the density of the soil sample is as
    similar as possible to the soil density in the field. The sensor probe is then
    inserted vertically into the soil column without touching the bottom or side wall
    of the beaker. The sensor is connected to a data logger and the output is recorded
    at 15-minute intervals. In addition, the weight of the soil sample is continuously
    observed and recorded by using weighing balance with data logger. It is advisable
    to use a data logger instead of relying solely on a traditional weighing balance
    to ensure accurate weighing of soil samples. This recommendation is based on the
    potential interference caused by the presence of a fan, which can occasionally
    disrupt the normal functioning of the weighing balance and result in inaccurate
    measurements. Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Configuration of the laboratory calibration experiment. The true
    VWC is calculated as Ojo et al.(2015): (7) where, is soil bulk density (ratio
    of the mass of dry soil to total volume of moist soil), WTi is the total weight
    (wet soil + probe), Wp is sensor probe weight, and WD is the dry weight of soil
    sample. For wet-up calibration, the distilled water is added to the oven-dried
    soil sample at a controlled rate. The controlled rate is determined to be suitable
    when the water is able to infiltrate without ponding into the soil sample (Champagne
    et al., 2010, Quinones et al., 2003). This process is continued until the soil
    is saturated or the output becomes almost constant. For dry-down calibration (Ojo
    et al., 2015), the saturated soil column was allowed to dry with a soil moisture
    sensor. At the same time, measure the change in weight of the soil column over
    time (Bosch, 2004, Huang et al., 2004). A small fan or dehumidifier must use to
    promote the evaporation. The procedure is considered complete when the evaporation
    becomes negligible or the change in weight of the soil column becomes negligible
    (Burns et al., 2014). It is important to note that for soil moisture sensor calibration,
    it is recommended to calibrate across a full range of soil water content conditions,
    from oven dry to saturation (Cosh et al., 2005). This is because incorporating
    a larger range of soil moisture conditions into sensor development can improve
    the transferability of the general calibration equation to different soils and
    environments (Rowlandson et al., 2018). The calibration equation is typically
    developed for these data using true volumetric water content (as truth) regressed
    with dielectric permittivity or voltage measurements from soil moisture sensor
    (Adla et al., 2020, Cobos and Chambers, 2010, Cosh et al., 2005). Research by
    Burns et al. (2014) suggests that the dry-down method is statistically more accurate
    than the wet-up method (Halley, 2016), particularly for soils with higher clay
    content. This is due to the fact that the dry-down method accounts for the natural
    variations in soil moisture content, providing more precise measurements (Rüdiger
    et al., 2010). However, it is important to note that the wet-up method can still
    be effective in certain soil types and should not be disregarded (Loiskandl et
    al., 2010, Seyfried et al., 2005). The laboratory-based soil moisture sensor calibration
    process is generally considered to be a more controlled and accurate method for
    calibrating soil moisture sensors, especially for sensors that are buried in the
    soil (Bell et al., 2013, Cosh et al., 2016) or used in a single location for a
    longer time. By following standardized procedures, researchers can obtain reliable
    calibration data, which can then be used to convert sensor output into soil moisture
    content. It is worth noting that although laboratory-based calibration is important,
    it is not always practical or feasible in the field (Colliander et al., 2017).
    In-situ calibration methods, such as comparing sensor data to manual soil moisture
    measurements, is useful alternatives when field-based measurements are required.
    6.2. Field calibration method Field calibration of a dielectric soil moisture
    sensor is a crucial step in ensuring accurate and reliable measurements in real-world
    applications. To perform a field calibration, it is important to select a field
    that represents the variability in soil water content and soil structure that
    the sensor will encounter in actual use (Caldwell et al., 2018). To calibrate
    the sensor, it is necessary to compare its output, which includes raw output data
    (voltage, and dielectric permittivity), with the gravimetric volumetric water
    content. Fig. 10 emphasizes the technique used for soil sampling for in situ or
    field calibration. The technique of collecting three soil samples from each field
    and averaging the results has been suggested as a potential solution to address
    the issue of sensor-to-sensor variability during field calibration of soil moisture
    sensors. The importance of this approach has been highlighted by several previous
    studies, including Cobos and Chambers, 2010, Cosh et al., 2016, Rowlandson et
    al., 2013 and Seyfried et al. (2005). Download : Download high-res image (619KB)

    method, where the sampling design at each sampling location is shown as a schematic
    diagram. Three-point measurements at a typical sampling location forming a triangle
    are for capturing spatial variability. A view of the gravimetric sample collection
    corresponding to Theta Probe measurement in the rice field is presented through
    photographs. This is a modified figure of Singh et al. (2021). The determination
    of gravimetric soil moisture content is achieved through the use of the oven dry
    method, (Gardner, 2018). The known volume of soil core sampler is required to
    collect the samples from the field. Then by using the dry bulk density (dry mass
    of soil / volume of soil sample) the gravimetric moisture content is converted
    to the soil VWC. Once the VWC is known, the sensor''s output is compared to this
    value. The relationship between the relative dielectric permittivity (εr) and
    VWC is established by using either linear or nonlinear equations. These equations
    can be used to develop a calibration curve that relates the dielectric permittivity
    of a soil to its corresponding VWC. Field calibration methods include in situ
    techniques such as neutron probes and gravimetric sampling. These methods measure
    the soil moisture content and provide a reference for calibrating the sensor (Leib
    et al., 2003). It allows for more accurate measurement of soil moisture, as it
    takes into account the real-world conditions that the sensor will encounter in
    the field (Chandler et al., 2004, Ojo et al., 2015, Singh et al., 2018, Stangl
    et al., 2009) including variations in soil type, temperature, salinity, soil structure
    (Caldwell et al., 2018, Geesing et al., 2004) and even unfrozen or frozen soil
    condition (Amankwah et al., 2022). However, field calibration can be challenging,
    time-consuming, and expensive, especially in remote or difficult-to-access areas
    (Caldwell et al., 2018, Cosh et al., 2005, Stangl et al., 2009). This can limit
    the use of dielectric-based sensors in some applications, particularly in areas
    where access is restricted. Furthermore, the calibration process can be influenced
    by various factors, such as changes in the soil structure over time or the presence
    of other materials in the soil, which can affect the accuracy of the readings.
    Though dielectric sensors have numerous advantages over other methods for measuring
    soil moisture, their practical application can be limited by the challenges associated
    with field calibration. Nonetheless, ongoing research is focused on improving
    the accuracy and reliability of these sensors, which may lead to increased use
    in various applications. In summary, while the field calibration of dielectric-based
    sensors can be challenging, it remains an essential aspect of ensuring the accuracy
    of soil moisture measurements in real-world conditions. 7. Linear and nonlinear
    approach for calibration of soil moisture sensor In the context of a dielectric
    soil moisture sensor, calibration refers to the process of establishing a statistical
    model/relationship between the measured dielectric permittivity of the soil and
    its corresponding moisture content. This relationship allows for a nearly accurate
    measurement of soil moisture content based on the dielectric properties of the
    soil. The approach of calibration used depends on the nature of the relationship
    between the dielectric permittivity and the moisture content, which can be linear
    or nonlinear. A linear calibration assumes a directly proportional relationship
    between the measured refractive index (which is square root of dielectric permittivity)
    and the soil moisture content, while a nonlinear calibration takes into account
    any deviations from linearity in this relationship. We examined previous research,
    including studies by Rowlandson et al., 2013, Vaz et al., 2013, Ojo et al., 2015,
    and Singh et al. (2021), which employed these two calibration approaches. The
    analysis revealed interesting insights and depicted in Table 2 and Fig. 11. For
    the generalized calibration of the Hydra probe sensor, Rowlandson et al. found
    similar root mean square error (RMSE) values for both linear and nonlinear calibration
    approaches indicating no significant improvement with either method. However,
    Vaz et al. (2013) reported similar observations in a generalized calibration setting.
    In contrast, Ojo et al. (2015) and Singh et al. (2021) reported improvements in
    RMSE when transitioning from linear to nonlinear calibration. Notably, all these
    studies consistently demonstrated improved RMSE values when employing nonlinear
    calibration for soil-specific calibration. Download : Download high-res image

    sensor accuracy using linear and nonlinear calibration approaches. These observations
    collectively suggest that the choice between linear and nonlinear calibration
    methods depends on the specific context and goals of the soil moisture sensor
    calibration. These insights have motivated to incorporate these approaches into
    a review, with the aim of providing valuable guidance to researchers and citizen
    scientists alike, enabling them to grasp the nuanced implications of these calibration
    methods in the context of point, soil-specific, and field-specific calibrations.
    7.1. Linear approach A widely used method for calibrating a dielectric soil moisture
    sensor that uses dielectric measurement involves establishing a linear relation
    between the sensor''s output and the gravimetric method based soil VSM. (Kelleners
    and Verma, 2010, Kim et al., 2020, Logsdon et al., 2010, Seyfried et al., 2005,
    Singh et al., 2021). The general form of this linear relationship is: (8) where
    εr (relative dielectric permittivity) and V (raw voltage) are the sensor outputs,
    and A and B are the calibration coefficients calculated empirically. According
    to Fig. 11, the linear approach results highest accuracy for the point scale calibration,
    with a median accuracy of ± 0.012 m3m−3. This suggests that linear calibration
    is highly effective for calibrating sensors at a specific point location (i.e.,
    fixed type soil moisture measurement for continuous measurements). The field-specific
    calibration has a median accuracy of ± 0.025 m3m−3, which lower than the point
    specific calibration, but still below the required accuracy of ± 0.04 m3m−3 for
    the satellite soil moisture product validations. The soil-specific calibration
    has a median accuracy of ± 0.031 m3m−3, indicating that calibration accuracy decreases
    when attempting to calibrate sensors across different soil types. The generalized
    calibration, typically developed for large-scale field studies, has demonstrated
    the lowest accuracy with a median accuracy of ± 0.048 m3m−3. The potential reason
    for this lowest accuracy of generalized calibration is the inclusion of diverse
    soil textural classes and field conditions across a large region, introducing
    potential nonlinear relationships that cannot be adequately captured through linear
    regression. This implies that linear calibration may not be the most effective
    method for calibrating sensor, particularly in the context of large-scale field
    studies. 7.2. Nonlinear approach Nonlinear equations are used to calibrate a dielectric
    soil moisture sensor, particularly when the relationship between the sensor''s
    output and soil moisture content is nonlinear (Bosch, 2004). Some examples of
    nonlinear equations that can be used for calibration include power equations,
    exponential equations, and second-order quadratic equations. The second-order
    quadratic equation is widely used as well as for the soil-specific calibration
    for both TDR and capacitance techniques. Studies conducted by Seyfried et al.,
    2005, Topp et al., 1980, Vaz et al., 2013 are using the second-order quadratic
    equation to calibrate the dielectric-based soil moisture sensors in the following
    format: (9) where, A, B, C, and D are calibration constants and εr is the relative
    dielectric permittivity. Fig. 11 shows the median accuracy for nonlinear calibration
    using different types of calibration approaches, i.e., point-specific, field-specific,
    soil-specific, and generalized. Similar to the linear approach, the nonlinear
    calibration approach for the dielectric soil moisture sensor also yielded the
    highest accuracy for point-scale calibrations and the lowest accuracy for generalized
    calibrations. However, as shown in Fig. 11, it is evident that the nonlinear approach
    consistently outperforms the linear approach in calibrating dielectric sensors
    across all calibration types, from point to generalized. The median accuracy for
    point-specific nonlinear calibration is ± 0.004 m3m−3, which indicates that this
    approach provides the highest accuracy for point-specific calibration. For field-specific
    calibration, the median accuracy for nonlinear calibration is ± 0.0085 m3m−3.
    The median accuracy for soil-specific nonlinear calibration is ± 0.028 m3m−3,
    which is higher than that for field-specific nonlinear calibration. The general
    nonlinear calibration approach has a median accuracy of ± 0.045 m3m−3, which is
    the lowest accuracy among the linear calibration approaches. From the data depicted
    in Table 2, we can observe that for developing the generalized calibrations, the
    nonlinear calibration approach has higher median accuracies compared to the linear
    calibration approach. However, it is also important to note that the difference
    in accuracy between the two approaches varies depending on the calibration type.
    For example, in the case of point-specific calibration, the nonlinear approach
    has a much better median accuracy compared to the linear approach, while in field-specific
    calibration, the difference is relatively smaller. It may not be practical or
    suitable to use specific (point or field or soil) calibration for large-scale
    study areas such as watersheds or agricultural areas. Over a large region, the
    soil type, salinity, and temperature might be different, and these factors are
    responsible for the determination of soil dielectric properties (Chen and Or,
    2006, Jacobsen and Schjønning, 1993, Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018). This implies
    that different soil types may have unique and complex interactions among their
    various components, resulting in different electric properties (Persson et al.,
    2001, Singh et al., 2021). This complexity is further compounded by the fact that
    previous studies have shown that the relationship between soil moisture content
    and the dielectric permittivity of soil can be affected by soil bulk density and
    porosity (Malicki et al., 1996). The complex dielectric response of soil makes
    it difficult to accurately describe the relationship between the dielectric permittivity
    and soil moisture content using linear regression methods alone (Persson et al.,
    2001, Persson and Bertacchi Uvo, 2003). To overcome this challenge, nonlinear
    models are often used to calibrate this relationship. However, these traditional
    nonlinear methods may struggle to capture the complex relationships between variables,
    which has led to the adoption of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs are machine
    learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of biological neural
    networks in the brain. ANNs are capable of learning complex relationships between
    input and output data and can be used to model nonlinear relationships and interactions
    between multiple input variables (Puri et al., 2016, Shanmuganathan, 2016). ANNs
    can account for interactions between multiple variables, including soil type,
    temperature, and organic matter content, which may affect the dielectric properties
    of soil. Therefore, ANNs are increasingly being used to model the relationship
    between soil properties and dielectric measurements. It has several advantages
    over traditional linear regression methods. One of the main benefits of ANNs is
    their ability to account for the effects of multiple soil properties on dielectric
    measurements, such as soil texture, temperature, and salinity, which can result
    in more accurate estimates of soil water content under a wider range of soil conditions
    (Namdar-Khojasteh et al., 2010, Singh et al., 2021). The calibration of the TDR
    soil moisture sensor by Zanetti et al. (2015) using ANNs achieved high accuracy,
    as evidenced by the low root mean square error (RMSE) values and high R2 values.
    Singh et al. (2021) compared a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to linear regression-based
    calibrations for estimating soil water content. The BNN-based approach outperformed
    the linear regression-based calibration, with a RMSE of less than ± 0.04 m3m−3.
    Singh et al. (2021) also suggested that the inclusion of soil physical properties
    as input into the BNN model further improved the calibration performance, yielding
    even lower RMSE value. Overall, ANNs have shown promise in accurately modeling
    the complex relationship between soil properties and dielectric measurements,
    providing a powerful tool for soil water content estimation (Arsoy et al., 2013,
    JingFeng et al., 2010, Persson et al., 2002). However, it is important to note
    that the accuracy of ANN models depends heavily on the quality and quantity of
    input data, as well as appropriate training and validation techniques (Köksal
    et al., 2011). However, one limitation of ANNs is that they require a large amount
    of data for training and validation (Shahid et al., 2019), and the results can
    be difficult to interpret in terms of the physical processes governing the relationship
    between the dielectric permittivity and soil water content (Singh et al., 2021).
    Overall, the use of ANNs for calibration is a rapidly evolving field, and the
    development of more advanced models, integration of additional data sources, and
    the application of more efficient training algorithms can further improve the
    accuracy of soil water content estimation. 8. Conclusions Soil moisture measurement
    plays a vital role in both agriculture and hydrology research, and the utilization
    of soil moisture sensors provides an efficient method of real-time measurements
    across the large study areas. Nonetheless, the calibration of these sensors is
    of paramount importance to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the obtained
    measurements. Researchers must aim to calibrate the sensors comprehensively, encompassing
    the entire spectrum of soil moisture conditions while accounting for variations
    in soil texture and different levels of soil wetness. This review aims to guide
    researchers in the selection of the most appropriate strategy for achieving precise
    soil moisture measurements. Prior to initiating the calibration process for the
    soil moisture sensor, it is essential to understand its working principles. Subsequently,
    assess factors influencing its accuracy, such as soil type, temperature, and salinity,
    in accordance with the sensor''s specifications. Additionally, consider cost implications
    during the calibration process. To align with the study''s specific requirements,
    carefully select the appropriate calibration strategies across various spatial
    domains, ranging from point-scale to regional-scale. Tailor the calibration methods
    and approaches to accommodate the prevailing environmental and soil, ensuring
    alignment with the necessary accuracy standards. In laboratory calibration, two
    primary methods are employed: wet-up and dry-down, with dry-down being more accurate
    for soils with higher clay content. While field calibration stands out as the
    optimal method, it demands a considerable investment of time and a collection
    of representative soil samples over a large area. Various calibration options
    are available, including soil-specific, field-specific, and generalized calibrations,
    among which point-specific calibration being the most accurate. Opting the field-specific
    calibration brings notable advantages, such as enhanced accuracy, reduced bias,
    and minimized overall errors. It is essential to acknowledge that developing a
    generalized calibration can be a time-saving and resource-efficient approach,
    especially when conducting extensive field measurements over a large region. Nevertheless,
    it is important to note that the accuracy of generalized calibrations for dielectric
    sensors is observed to be lower compared to point-specific and field-specific
    calibrations. Nonlinear calibration approach for dielectric sensor may yield higher
    accuracy compared to linear approaches, underscoring the importance of assessing
    sensor accuracy under different calibration approaches for optimal application.
    While a generalized calibration method proves practical and time-efficient for
    large-scale study areas, its accuracy may fall short in regions with diverse soil
    types, salinity variations, and temperature changes. Nonlinear calibrations, particularly
    those developed using ANNs, show promise in addressing the influences of multiple
    soil properties on dielectric measurements, as recently shown by Singh et al.
    (2021). This results in more accurate estimates of soil water content across a
    wider range of soil conditions. However, additional studies are needed to comprehensively
    evaluate the effectiveness of this approach across diverse soil types. In conclusion,
    the field of soil moisture sensing continues to evolve, and researchers should
    strike a balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness, considering variations
    in soil type, temperature, and salinity. The accurate calibration of soil moisture
    sensors across a full range of soil moisture conditions is crucial for reliable
    results. The selection of the most appropriate calibration method should be made
    based on the specific application, incorporating a thorough assessment of calibration
    accuracy to confirm the optimal approach. In this endeavor, the thoughtful application
    of the strategy outlined in Fig. 12 would be invaluable. Download : Download high-res

    multiple soil properties and exploring innovative approaches such as machine learning
    algorithms. Additionally, sustained efforts should be directed to evaluating the
    long-term stability and performance of these sensors, as well as establishing
    maintenance protocols to address any drift or changes in sensor accuracy. By continuously
    improving calibration methods and gaining deeper understanding of sensor performance,
    researchers can optimize the utility of soil moisture sensors and enhance their
    applicability across various fields. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    Measuring flow velocity in the field conditions plays a significant role in many
    scientific and industry applications, for example, in hydrological studies [1],
    sediment transport investigations [3], [4], [5], the determination of aquatic
    habitats [6], [7] in rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters, and flood warning
    systems [8]. Near-bed velocity estimates are key metrics in sediment transport
    and river habitat studies [9], [10]. Popular in situ field measurement devices
    for flow velocity are propeller velocity flowmeters, acoustic Doppler velocimeters
    (ADVs), and acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). In addition, there have
    been efforts to develop remote-sensing methods, from the use of radars for estimating
    surface velocities to satellite imagery for river discharge estimation [11], [12].
    However, the aforementioned methods have either good temporal resolution or good
    spatial resolution, not both. The acoustic measuring devices (ADV and ADCP) have
    a good temporal resolution of 50Hz , whereas the spatial resolution depends on
    the number of devices. Due to the high cost, in general, not many of these devices
    are used together, especially over long periods of time and in extreme environments
    where the chances of recovering the instruments go down. Satellite models, for
    example, Planet Labs satelite SkySat [13], [14], have good spatial resolution
    (about 0.5m ). However, the temporal resolution of SkySat is 4–5 days [13], [14].
    Further problems can arise when measuring near-seabed or near-surface velocity,
    as local wake features can affect the measurements near the bed and air entertainment,
    secondary currents, and velocity tip effect can influence near-surface measurements
    [15]. In addition, remote-sensing methods are restricted to estimating water surface
    velocity [16], [17], [18]. In [19], it is shown that to obtain reliable average
    velocities in a flow affected by natural turbulence and instrument noise, a sampling
    duration of 90 and 150s is found to be sufficient for ADV and ADCP, respectively.
    For long-term behavior and large-scale spectral analysis, when many sources of
    flow variability are present, a longer sampling duration is needed. This means
    that for reliable estimation of near-surface velocities, ADV and ADCP temporal
    resolution also decreases. Despite the challenges, for many applications, continuous
    instantaneous flow measurements are extremely important. Sediment motion depends
    on momentary flow features [20], flow type characterization [21], and feature
    detection in flows (e.g., ship detection [22]) and requires high temporal resolution,
    studying stresses on submerged structural elements benefit from long-term continuous
    monitoring [23]. Therefore, there is a need for cost-effective methods to provide
    continuous, reliable, and distributed data on the near-bed velocities. Motivated
    by the changing hydrological conditions imposed by the climate crisis and the
    need for near-bed continuous measurements, a method for in situ observations of
    flow velocity was proposed by Ristolainen et al. [24]. A bimodal flow sensing
    device using accelerometers was designed and used to automatically classify river
    hydromorphology [25], and new methods for near-bed velocity measurement were developed
    [26]. Unfortunately, this device, the original Hydromast, had several drawbacks:
    it had a limited flow velocity range, it could only estimate the average mean
    flow velocity, and it was not capable of real-time data output. The lower end
    of the measurement range was too high for many near-bed applications, allowing
    only measurements in constantly fast flows. Additionally, no measurements were
    possible in wave-driven coastal applications, with regularly changing flow direction
    and only local storage was possible, allowing data processing and output only
    after the recovery of the devices. To address the described limitations, a novel
    design of the Hydromast based on a Hall effect sensor has been proposed and a
    cloud-based communication setup has been designed, granting near real-time (latency
    couple of seconds) data transfer and observations by the user. The upgraded device,
    from now on referred to as the Hydromast, uses magnetic field sensing at the base
    to instantaneously detect the exact tilt and direction of the sensing element.
    This allows simpler and faster estimation of flow velocity and additionally allows
    us to measure the direction of the flow. Changing the length of the sensing element
    allows for varying the velocity measurement range according to the application.
    Moreover, the new design allows for instantaneous flow estimates and opens up
    a new application range of unsteady flow measurements in rapidly changing environments.
    The device has been validated in various flow fields together with a baseline
    measurement for determining the behavior, robustness, and durability in real-life
    environments and demonstrating possible applications. This leads to an accurate,
    robust, and cost-efficient way to measure continuous near-bed current velocity.
    The organization of this work is as follows. Section II introduces the working
    principle, device design, and upgrades. Section III describes the calibration
    methods and results. Section IV provides the description and results of the field
    validations in both steady and unsteady flows. Sections V and VI discuss the results
    and performance of the device presented in the article and bring out the potential
    applications, strengths, and weaknesses of continuous instantaneous velocity estimation
    with the Hydromast. SECTION II. Hydromast Design and Working Principle The Hydromast
    is inspired by the neuromast, which is the major unit of functionality of the
    biological lateral line. A neuromast, being a mechanoreceptive organ of fish,
    is responsible for the sensing of mechanical changes in the surrounding flow field
    [2]. The Hydromast consists of a rigid mast that is fixed to the base with a flexible
    membrane, resembling an upscaled version of a neuromast. The bulk flow velocity
    over the mast generates vortex-induced vibrations (VIVs) of the mast which dominate
    over the random forcing due to turbulent flow conditions. A. Hydromast Design
    In the previous Hydromast designs by [24] and [26], the mast motion was recorded
    with a micromechanical inertial measuring unit (IMU). Our upgraded Hydromast design
    uses a 3-D Hall effect sensor (TLV493D-A1B6, Infineon Technologies AG) to track
    the mast movement. The Hall effect sensor, located in the Hydromast base, detects
    the strength of the magnetic field from a 5×5 mm neodymium cylindrical magnet
    installed at the base of the mast inside the flexible membrane. A main benefit
    of implementing magnetic field sensing is the instantaneous position estimation
    of the mast for instantaneous tilt angle and direction measurements. Also, the
    contactless sensing of magnetic fields improves the robustness of the device,
    as no cables are connected to and affect the vibrating mast. This also simplifies
    and reduces the cost of manufacturing. Similar to the previous design, the Hydromast
    can be equipped with an external IMU (MinIMU-9, Pololu Corporation) to detect
    the installation angle and device base movements in unsupervised installations
    onto sea bead. The device consists of a CNC-machined polyoxymethylene (POM) base,
    a flexible membrane, and a mast. The mast is a hollow polycarbonate (PC) tube,
    closed at both ends and mounted to a flexible silicon membrane (Elite Double 22,
    Zhermak SpA). The mast has air inside that makes it positively buoyant and a higher
    natural frequency f N compared to the water-filled mast. An air-filled mast is
    more sensitive to the flow and is therefore the preferred setup, as described
    later. The mast is covered with a 0.06m m thin layer of copper to minimize biofouling
    during longer deployment periods. The standard diameter of the mast used in this
    work is D = 15m m , but the dimensions can easily be altered for specific applications.
    The length of the mast L can be varied depending on the needed measurement range.
    The base housing incorporates PCBs of the microcontroller (Adafruit Feather with
    Atmel ATSAMD21 Cortex M0 processor), power, serial communication, and pressure
    sensor. An absolute pressure sensor records the water height (86-030A-R, TE Connectivity)
    with the pressure port integrated into the POM casing (with a range of 0–2 bar).
    The Hydromast can be connected directly over an RS485 serial connection to a PC
    or to a communication module with a raw data sampling rate of 50Hz . The Hydromast
    power consumption is approximately 0.15W (at 5V supply voltage). The cost of the
    Hydromast components is about 500 euro at the time of writing this article. The
    design of the Hydromast is shown in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1. Hydromast overview. (a)

    All B. Working Principle The Hydromast measures the mast location in the x -,
    y -, and z -direction using magnetic field, with Hall sensor outputs X , Y , and
    Z (in mT) accordingly. The coordinate system of the mast is shown in Fig. 1(b).

    reading is observed to be linearly correlated to the tilt angle θ of the device,
    whereas the components X and Y correlate to the mast location in the xy -plane
    and indicate the direction of the flow, noted as ϕ ¯ . Two different methods of
    flow velocity estimation can be introduced: 1) velocity estimate V f based on
    the dominant frequencies f d of the mast vibration (time-averaged estimate) and
    2) velocity estimate V θ based on the tilt θ of the mast (instantaneous estimate).
    Fluid-body forces govern the interactions between the mast due to VIV. Each Hydromast
    has its own natural frequency f N that is the frequency the mast oscillates with
    when disturbed and no forcing (i.e., flow) is present. When a cylindrical rod
    is put in a cross-flow, it generates vortices with a vortex shedding frequency
    f 0 . The first velocity estimation method of the Hydromast is based on the vibrations
    of the elastically supported rigid mast as a VIV resonator. In [24], the design
    of the device was tuned so that the lightly damped cylinder would oscillate with
    frequency f as close as possible to the vortex shedding frequency f 0 . It was
    shown that the time-averaged velocity can be estimated using the mean frequency
    spectral amplitude after taking the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the mast vibrations
    (for more details refer to [26]). When the cylinder vortex shedding frequency
    is close to the natural frequency f 0 ≈ f N , an important lock-in phenomenon
    occurs: f 0 / f N =1 . In such cases, the shedding becomes controlled by the natural
    frequency, even if small fluctuations in the flow velocity occur. This and other
    resonance points of a lightly damped cylinder are related to the bulk flow by
    reduced velocity V r =V/( f N D) , where V is the velocity of the bulk flow and
    D the diameter of the cylinder [27]. For frequency-based velocity estimate V f
    , a relation based on the Strouhal number can be introduced, St= f 0 D/V . For
    the Hydromast, the relation between dominant frequency f d ( M XYZ ) and flow
    speed can be written as follows: V f = D St f d + C 0 (2) View Source where C
    0 is a constant taking into account the end-effects (of the mast tip) and other
    artifacts of the specific device setup. For a stationary smooth circular cylinder
    for Reynolds numbers ranging from 103 to 105, the Strouhal number of vortex shedding
    is St≈0.2 [28]. Using St=0.2 reduces (2) to V f =(D/0.2) f d + C 0 , where only
    C 0 needs to be empirically determined. In [26], a 100-mm-long neutrally buoyant
    mast was used, which provided a working range from 0.5 to 1.4m/s . One of the
    goals of this study was to extend the working range of the Hydromast, especially
    to decrease the lower limit. This is done by choosing the mast with a correct
    natural frequency, based on the needed measurement range. Response to the cross-flow
    of a lightly damped circular cylinder is thoroughly described in [27]. If a cylinder
    is free to vibrate in any direction perpendicular to its axis, many modes of vortex
    shedding can occur. The most important excitation occurs from resonance when vibration
    frequency f becomes equal to natural vortex frequency f N , where the vibration
    amplitude drastically increases and lock-in at the high amplitude vibrations is
    observed. This response mode starts around f/ f N ≈1 and can at most last down
    to f/ f N =1/3 , in the range of reduced velocity of 5< V r <15 , as schematically
    shown in Fig. 2. This is also the range where the Hydromast vibrations occur and
    flow velocity can thus be determined, defining the measurement range for the Hydromast.
    Minimum and maximum velocities are found as follows: V f min=5D f N (3) View Source
    and V f max=15D f N (4) View Source where f N is the natural frequency in water.
    Fig. 2. Schematic response of lightly damped cylinder in crossflow (adapted from
    [27]). Show All For the second velocity estimate, V θ , the exact position of
    the mast in time is determined using the Hall effect sensor outputs. This allows
    measuring tilt angle θ , nearly instantaneous flow speed V θ as a function of
    θ , and flow direction ϕ ¯ . The tilt angle is assumed to be in a linear correlation
    with the Hall sensor measurements and can be calculated as θ= p 1 M XYZ + p 2
    , where p 1 and p 2 are empirically detected calibration constants. Mast tilt
    angle θ is linearly dependent on the magnitude of the magnetic field and therefore
    velocity can simply be correlated to M XYZ as follows: V θ = C 1 M XYZ + C 2 (5)
    View Source where constants C 1 and C 2 are found through calibration. Magnitude
    itself is used here, instead of θ to avoid introducing unnecessary extra uncertainty,
    as θ itself is also determined using calibration fit. It is important to note
    that this instantaneous velocity measurement based on mast tilt V θ is independent
    of the frequency-based measurement V f and can, therefore, be used as a separate
    measurement quantity. The flow direction ϕ ¯ can be found directly using Hall
    effect sensor outputs X and Y as instantaneous mast direction ϕ=atan2(X,−Y) which
    represents the mast location. To find the flow direction, an average over several
    vibrations must be calculated, taking the median value over some time, denoted
    with ϕ ¯ . In addition to flow measurements, the Hydromast can also be used to
    measure the water level changes. The device is equipped with a pressure sensor
    enabling continuous measurement of the water level above. C. Communications In
    addition to modifying the sensing methods and hardware, the Hydromast now incorporates
    communication capabilities, enabling near real-time flow monitoring and device
    failure detection [30], [31]. These enhancements have expanded the range of potential
    applications for the device. To achieve this, a sensor hub based on Raspberry
    Pi 3 is utilized (we have also tested Beaglebone, and it is possible to use another
    ARM-based single-board computer). Fig. 3 shows the overview of the communication
    framework. The sensor hub stores data locally and transmits it to Amazon Cloud
    IoT Core using the MQTT protocol. In addition, the sensor hub can receive configuration
    updates from MQTT, specifically the connected mast types and calibration constants
    (see Section III). Infrastructure as code (IaC), specifically AWS cloud development
    kit (CDK), is employed for configuring and managing AWS services, which allows
    consistent configurations and stronger security. The source code for both self-developed
    components and IaC is maintained in GIT repositories. Python 3.9 and ReactJS are
    used for programming the self-developed components, including the web interface.
    Fig. 3. Communication framework overview. Show All The sensor hubs operate on
    self-developed applications in a Docker container running on BalenaOS, and their
    management is facilitated through BalenaCloud servers. For communication with
    the Amazon Cloud, various options are available, including the use of a GSM network,
    LoRaWAN radio connection, and Ethernet communication. The proposed networking
    framework makes the Hydromast deployment both secure and scalable but also efficiently
    manageable from the sensors fleet’s point of view. SECTION III. Calibration and
    Characterization To demonstrate the behavior and characteristics of the device,
    characterization was first performed in the lab, after which the field tests were
    done to calibrate the device. A. Natural Frequencies and Measurement Range For
    simple measurement range estimation, the mast’s natural frequency dependence on
    the length was characterized. Natural frequencies in water and air for masts with
    varying lengths and mass were measured. The relation between L and f N in water
    was represented by a power fit f N ∼ L a , where a is a constant, whereas the
    ratio of natural frequencies was found to be f Nair / f Nwater ≈1.4 . The natural
    frequencies and corresponding sensor measurement limits V f min and V f max are
    shown in Table I. Using these estimated ranges, the mast length can be chosen
    based on the measurement range needed in each specific application. For an extended
    measurement range, a setup with multiple Hydromasts can also be used, so that
    depending on the flow velocity, data from the correct device is acquired. It was
    chosen to continue with a positively buoyant mast due to its higher natural frequencies
    and faster response to the flow changes, to better capture unsteady flow phenomena.
    It must be noted that the tension restraint force to counteract buoyancy is larger
    for longer masts (due to larger volume) which can also change the performance
    characteristics. TABLE I Characteristics of Hydromasts Based on Mast Length For
    validation purposes, two masts were chosen: HM300 with L=300 mm and HM200 with
    L=200 mm length, both highlighted in Table I. These two masts together cover a
    range from V=0.1 to 0.7 m/s being sufficient for many applications and they also
    have a wide enough range overlap to make comparisons. B. Tilt Angle Calibration
    The tilt angle θ was expected to be linearly correlated to the Hall sensor’s output
    magnitude M XYZ . A table-top calibration was performed, to determine the calibration
    coefficients. The mast was tilted at 11 different angles from 0 ∘ <θ< 30 ∘ in
    eight different directions with 45° increments. The mast tilt was recorded using
    a Go-Pro camera and the tilt angle was calculated from the image. The angle showed
    a very good linear correlation with the output magnitude M XYZ , as shown in Fig.
    4. The calibration constants were found to be p 1 =1.2 and p 2 =1.13 , with a
    coefficient of determination R 2 of 0.98. Fig. 4. Hydromast tilt angle calibration.
    Output magnitude M XYZ for varying tilt angle θ with the linear fit. Measurements
    shown for eight different directions from ϕ=0 to ϕ=315 . Show All C. In-Flow Velocity
    Calibration The Hydromast velocity calibrations need to be determined in real
    flow conditions, where the turbulence levels, velocity profile, and setup are
    similar to the planned field applications. The Hydromasts were first tested in
    a small lab-scale flow channel. However, as the channel was too small for these
    devices and flow conditions were significantly different from real flow, this
    proved to be too unreliable and inaccurate for calibration purposes. Therefore,
    all calibration characterization was performed in a natural river flow. The calibrations
    for flow velocity were conducted in Keila River (latitude 59.394537 N, longitude
    24.294915 E; closest address Posti 1, Keila-Joa, 76 701 Harjumaa, Estonia) with
    the average water level of 102c m measured at Keila river hydrological station
    [32]. The aim was to calibrate the Hydromast against ADV measurements (Vectrino
    Profiler, Nortek, Norway) in real-world conditions. ADV was chosen as a reference
    because it is a commercially available standard device for this type of flow measurement.
    An overview of the calibration setup is shown in Fig. 5. One Hydromast was deployed
    together with an ADV for reference measurements. Samples with a duration of 60
    s were taken at 47 locations for HM300 and 29 locations for HM200. The Hydromast
    and ADV measurements were synchronized by using the sync signal from the ADV to
    trigger the recording of the Hydromast data logger (based on a Raspberry Pi 3,
    Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom). Fig. 5. Setup for the in-flow
    velocity calibration in a river. (a) Side view and (b) front view with the ADV
    and Hydromast (HM300) placement. (c) Assembled setup in the field. Show All For
    all calibration and steady flow experiments, the Hydromast data acquisition rate
    was 50Hz . When calculating V f , no preprocessing of the data was done, the average
    velocity estimate was based on the frequency spectrum of the raw data throughout
    the sample. For calibration, 60s long samples were first recorded and by looking
    at the convergence, it was determined that at least a 20s sample is needed for
    an accurate dominant frequency estimate. Based on this, the calibration and validation
    sample length was chosen to be 30s . Similarly, the tilt-based velocity estimates,
    V θ , were first done based on raw data. As the interest lay in the time-averaged
    velocities, an average V θ was calculated throughout the sample using V θ ~ =median(
    V θ ) . In the calibration as well as steady flow validation experiments, the
    ADV data acquisition rate was 25Hz and the ADV data processing was kept minimal.
    All steady flow experiments were done in real conditions and close to the surface.
    Hence, to reduce the noise in the averages due to different natural and device-caused
    phenomena (more details about ADV noise sources can be found in [29]), the median
    ADV velocity was also calculated throughout the 30s sample. Fig. 6(a) shows the
    calibration data for HM300 and HM200 together with the calibration curves for
    the dominant frequency-based velocity estimate V f . It can be seen that a linear
    fit with constant slope D/St and calibration constant C 0 is a good approximation
    and describes well the relation between flow velocity and mast vibration, with
    R 2 =0.87 for HM300 and R 2 =0.96 for HM200. For calibration, all data was used,
    where a clear energy peak in the frequency spectrum could be determined. For HM300,
    peaks were detected for velocities from 0.15 to 0.50 m/s, and for HM200 the range
    was from 0.27 to 0.70 m/s. These ranges agree well with the theoretical estimates
    from Table I, according to which HM300 should work from 0.13 to 0.39 m/s and HM200
    from 0.23 to 0.69 m/s. These calibration results agree well with the analysis
    described in Section II-B and support the theoretical assumptions. This calibration
    shows that dominant frequency can be used for flow velocity estimation and also,
    if needed, several devices with different ranges can be used to extend the measurement
    range. Fig. 6. Velocity calibrations of 200- and 300-mm masts. (a) Dominant frequency-based
    velocity V f calibration. (b) Tilt-based velocity V θ calibration. Calibration
    fit shown as a solid line, theoretical velocity limits V f  min and V f  max are
    shown as a dotted line. Show All Another method of determining velocity is using
    the tilt angle θ . Calibration data and linear fits for this method with both
    Hydromasts are shown in Fig. 6(b). Here, all calibration points are shown (averaged
    over 30 s) and it can be seen that both HM300 and HM200 have a linear dependence
    on the magnitude M XYZ , with R 2 =0.96 for HM300 and R 2 =0.96 for HM200. The
    lowest speeds, at which the velocity can be measured, are 0.15 and 0.22 m/s for
    HM300 and HM200, respectively, being similar to the lowest limit where V f can
    be used. HM200 has a higher slope, making it more sensitive to velocity changes,
    whereas HM300 has a slightly lower sensitivity. The tension restraint force to
    counteract buoyancy is almost double for the HM300 mast compared to HM200 and
    this seems to make the longer mast HM300 less sensitive to tilt due to flow velocity.
    This lower sensitivity constitutes a close to five times bigger measurement range
    for the HM300, with a new range spanning from 0.15 m/s up to nearly 1 m/s. This
    is a large increase in the range of the velocity measurement for HM300 compared
    to the working range for V f (which was up to 0.39 m/s), expanding the applicability
    of the Hydromast significantly. Hence, the tilt provides an accurate estimate
    of flow velocity with the extra benefit of having a wider measurement range compared
    to the frequency-based estimate for HM300. It must be noted that the membrane
    of each Hydromast is currently hand-made and, therefore, the tilt calibration
    can also be slightly affected by the membrane properties. Therefore, sometimes,
    it can be useful to check with V f the validity of the V θ calibration if devices
    with new membranes are used. To have independent measurements with the Hydromast,
    it is important for the device to detect when the measurements are in the working
    range and recognize and remove outputs when the Hydromast is out of range providing
    unreliable data. For V f , this “out-of-range” criterion is defined by setting
    a minimum limit for spectral amplitude level at a dominant frequency so that only
    distinct high energy peaks are detected. For the Hydromast analysis, two dominant
    frequency peaks are detected in the spectrum (due to the eight-shaped movement
    of the mast) and the second one, at a higher frequency, representing the cross-flow
    vibrations, is chosen to be the estimate. This criterion depends on the length
    of the Hydromast and is determined based on the calibration data. For tilt angle-based
    estimate V θ the “out-of-range” criterion is simply the minimum and maximum values
    for the magnitude M XYZ , also determined based on the calibration results. SECTION
    IV. Validation The validation of the Hydromast velocity estimations was performed
    in three stages. First, validation was performed in steady flow conditions in
    a river, with many 30s measurements. In the second stage, two devices were installed
    for a long period in steady flow in a river, to show long-term data and validate
    communication capabilities. This flow is steady in the short term but has variations
    over a longer time. Finally, the validation was performed in unsteady flow conditions
    on the coastline to demonstrate and validate the capability of the Hydromast to
    measure unsteady flows. A. Steady Flow, Short-Term Tests The short-term validation
    tests were performed on the same site as used for calibration but at different
    flow conditions. Measurements were taken in many locations in the river to show
    the performance of the device with the same setup at many different flow speeds.
    Measurement points were chosen to take into account the working ranges of the
    Hydromasts and steady flow conditions. A setup with two Hydromasts, HM300 and
    HM200, together with the ADV (Vectrino Profiler) was assembled as shown in Fig.
    7. The validation was performed in Keila River on the same location as the calibration
    experiments described in Section III, with a higher water level (water level of
    112 cm measured at Keila water level station [32]) which allowed finding locations
    with a wide range of flow velocities. A total of 139 samples were collected over
    a range of velocities from 0.01 to 1.05 m/s. Fig. 7. Setup for steady flow validation
    tests in a river. (a) Side view and (b) front view with the ADV and Hydromast
    (HM300 and HM200) placement. (c) Assembled setup in the field. Show All The results
    of the velocity estimations based on the mast vibrations are shown in Fig. 8(a)
    and (b) for HM300 and HM200, respectively. ADV measurement serves as our reference
    velocity. It must be noted that also these measurements have uncertainty and to
    visualize that, the ADV measurements are shown with standard deviation (SD) (shaded
    in gray), which can be considered as the uncertainty of the reference measurement.
    Points, which according to ADV have high turbulence intensity (TI) levels, above
    40%, are indicated with pink in the figures. Fig. 8. Steady flow short-term validation
    data for frequency-based velocity estimate V f . (a) 300-mm mast and (b) 200-mm
    mast. Filled symbols denote the data in range and empty symbols out of range.
    SD ranges from ADV measurements are shaded in gray. The blue box indicates the
    theoretical measurement range. Show All Comparison of V f from the longer HM300
    with ADV is shown in Fig. 8(a). Hydromast data agrees well with the reference
    ADV, having root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.065m/s and all velocities detected
    lay within the estimated measurement range, between V f min and V f max , indicated
    as a shaded box in the figure. In this case, the majority of the data detected
    lies within the theoretical measurement range, supporting the theoretical model.
    The used criteria of minimum energy level at dominant frequency works well for
    peak detection, only showing data that is within the theoretical range. Turbulent
    measurements have a slightly higher variation but overall there is also a good
    agreement to the reference measurement, showing that no significant change in
    data quality is introduced. In Fig. 8(b), the Hydromast HM200 data is shown for
    V f . The measurements agree well with the ADV within the estimated measurement
    range. Above 0.6 m/s, dominant frequencies are still detected but seem to drift
    away from the reference value. This change is probably due to a mode shift in
    vibration occurring near V r =15 . It was seen that above this value also tilt
    does not change anymore, the vibration is somewhat altered and does not represent
    velocity changes well, even though peaks in the energy spectrum are still present.
    As there was no good indicator found in the spectra to filter the “out-of-range”
    data, V θ could be used as an indicator of the velocity range so that if V θ is
    out of its measurement range, no output of V f is provided. Points with this criterion
    applied are indicated in Fig. 8(b) as empty symbols. For all the data, the RMSE
    value is 0.113m/s , whereas the data with V θ -based criteria (filled symbols)
    has RMSE 0.03m/s . Alternatively, an empirical calibration fit could be used on
    the data, which follows the higher-end frequencies better and accounts for that
    mode change. But with this approach, there is the downside that each membrane
    needs an extended calibration in similar flow conditions as the application. Tilt-based
    velocities from HM300 are shown in Fig. 9(a). Below 0.15m/s , which is the lower
    theoretical measurement limit, the measurements have a constant value and are
    not usable (empty symbols indicate “out-of-range” data). There is an agreement
    between ADV and Hydromast from 0.15m/s up to even 1.0m/s , with RMSE of 0.047m/s
    excluding turbulent and out of range points (RMSE is 0.093m/s including all points).
    The measurement range is higher than the one achieved in calibration but seems
    that the lower sensitivity to flow velocity (as discussed above in Section III)
    allows a much wider measurement range. This demonstrates that the HM300 can be
    used on its own for a wide range of velocity measurements from 0.1 to 1.0m/s ,
    compared to V f measurement range being only one-third of it. Only some of the
    high turbulence data at higher velocities is not following the trend, therefore
    care needs to be taken at very turbulent conditions at high flow speeds (higher
    than V f range). Fig. 9. Steady flow short-term validation data for tilt-based
    velocity estimate V θ (a) 300-mm mast and (b) 200-mm mast. Filled symbols denote
    the data in range and empty symbols out of range. SD ranges from ADV measurements
    are shaded in gray. The blue box indicates the theoretical measurement range.
    Show All Fig. 9(b) shows results for tilt-based V θ for HM200. At low velocities,
    the “out-of-range” data is again constant as for the other mast (hollow symbols).
    Above that, there is an excellent agreement between ADV and Hydromast measurements
    between 0.3m/s and 0.7m/s , where in-range data is marked with filled symbols
    and having RMSE of 0.03m/s . Above that, the HM200 has reached its maximum tilt
    angle and does not capture flow velocities above 0.7m/s . Out-of-range data based
    on magnitude limits is shown with empty symbols and it can be seen that this criterion
    works well for these velocities, filtering out data that does not represent correct
    velocities. For HM200, the working range of V θ is the same as the theoretical
    range of V f in Table I. Overall, both velocity estimates agree well with the
    reference measurements. Some of the highly turbulent data do not follow general
    trends, but there seems not to be any systematic impact. In high turbulence conditions
    and high speeds, the data has lower accuracy and could overestimate the flow speed,
    whereas at lower speeds high TI does not seem to affect the results. A set of
    measurements were also performed to evaluate the flow direction. For direction,
    no calibration is needed, as the direction ϕ ¯ can be calculated directly from
    the Hall sensor output. For this, the full experimental setup was rotated by 45°
    increments, and measurements from Hydromast and ADV were compared. This was done
    with both devices, at several flow speeds, to test the sensitivity at slow, medium,
    and high velocities. The measured angles compared with the ADV reference are shown
    in Fig. 10. Both Hydromasts show a very good direction estimate, having RMSE of
    3.46 circ . The variation is bigger in places where also ADV had higher RMSE,
    showing that there was higher variability in flow, resulting in less reliable
    results. Fig. 10. Flow direction ϕ ¯ validation data. The direction measurements
    were done in varying flow conditions slow (up to 0.22 m/s), medium (up to 0.61
    m/s), and fast (up to 0.85 m/s). Show All B. Steady Flow, Long-Term Tests A long-term
    river test was performed to verify the Hydromast durability and performance, as
    well as demonstrate the near real-time flow monitoring. Two devices were deployed,
    in the same configuration as shown in Fig. 7. Validation measurements were taken
    with an ADV (Vectrino Profiler, Nortek AS, Norway) every second day over a two-week
    testing period. The validation test was carried out in Vääna river (latitude:
    59.292888 N, longitude 24.739287 E; closest address Otto tee, Lokuti, 75 514 Harjumaa,
    Estonia). In this experimental setup, the devices were streaming data online with
    the framework described in Section II-C. The two Hydromasts were connected to
    a Raspberry Pi 3 (Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom) microcomputer
    running Balena OS, which was battery and solar panel-powered over the whole testing
    period. The live data stream monitoring over the GSM network allowed us to evaluate
    the Hydromast performance as well as detect faults in the measurements. This allowed
    near real-time monitoring (about 3 s latency) of river flow velocity, water level,
    and also direction. The average velocities throughout the two-week tests for both
    HM200 and HM300 are shown in Fig. 11(a). The frequency-based velocity V f was
    estimated for 30-s intervals and averaged over 30-min periods. The tilt-based
    V θ has been calculated as instantaneous velocity and averaged over 30-min periods.
    These tests were run during spring entering into the dry season, hence, the river
    water flow velocity decreases over time. Both V θ and V f show a steady decrease
    in flow velocity from 0.37 to 0.2 m/s and agree well with the ADV reference measurements
    taken. For tilt-based V θ from HM300, higher variations in speed are captured
    compared to V f . For higher speeds during the first days, V θ seems to overestimate
    compared to the reference velocities, but both measurements are within the ADV
    SD range. After the 4th of April, when speeds are lower, the agreement with ADV
    reference measurements becomes very good for both of the velocity estimates. Fig.
    11. Steady flow long-term validation data in Vääna river. Results averaged over
    30 min. (a) Frequency and tilt-based velocity estimates. (b) Flow direction ϕ
    . (c) Water level height. Show All As for HM200, V θ and V f measure continuously
    during the first days and agree very well with each other and with reference ADV
    measurements. After 4th April 2023 flow velocity started to fall below the measurement
    range of the HM200 and it does not give an accurate estimate anymore. For V θ
    , M XYZ goes below the minimum limit defined earlier (data marked as light gray)
    and for V f , fewer high-energy peaks are detected. In addition, flow direction
    was estimated for the same experiments, and the results are shown together with
    the ADV direction in Fig. 11(b). As there was no specific device orientation reference
    taken at the test site, a comparison with ADV was made using the first measurement
    point. Based on that, a constant offset of 5 circ was removed from the Hydromast
    data. In Fig. 11(c), the water level height estimates using the Hydromast are
    shown. Tallinn-Harku weather station data [33] was used as the atmospheric pressure
    reference and manual measurements were taken for comparison during ADV measurements.
    Both Hydromasts behave similarly well and agree with the measurement points, all
    estimates varying within the 10-cm range. HM200 does not follow the trend during
    the last two days and this is due to a failure of the pressure sensor, which was
    determined after the tests. C. Unsteady Flow Several tests were conducted in the
    sea, near the coast, to validate the behavior of the Hydromast in unsteady waves
    with varying flow direction and magnitude. Measurements were done for 10-min time
    periods, to allow long enough datasets for spectral analysis with an acquisition
    rate of 50 Hz. A commercial ADV (Vector, Nortek AS, Norway) was used as the reference
    measurement device, with an acquisition rate of 8 Hz. Two Hydromasts, HM200 and
    HM300, together with the ADV probe in between were installed on a solid frame
    and immersed in the sea on a sandy flat surface, at about 0.9-m depth. The experimental
    setup of this test is shown in Fig. 12. Fig. 12. Setup for unsteady flow validation
    tests in the sea. (a) Side view and (b) front view with the ADV and Hydromast
    placement. (c) Assembled setup in the field. Show All To validate the unsteady
    velocity estimations, measurements were taken simultaneously for the two Hydromasts
    and ADV. The experiments were done on two days: on 4th May 2023 in Pikakari beach
    (lat: 59°28’26.2”N long: 24°43’27.4”E) and on 18th May 2023 at Vääna beach (lat:59°25’29.0”N
    long: 24°20’19.1”E). Locations and days were chosen to test devices at different
    flow conditions. For both, the Hydromast and the ADV, the first velocity estimations
    were done on raw data. The resulting velocity estimations were then passed through
    a low-pass filter with cutoff frequency 2Hz for consistency and better comparison.
    On the 4th of May, the conditions were very calm, the maximum velocity reached
    was 0.3 m/s. These velocities were below the HM200 measurement range, and therefore
    only HM300 data is analyzed and shown. Fig. 13 shows 5 min of the measurements
    of ADV and HM300. It can be seen that the Hydromast shows similar behavior in
    velocity magnitude as the reference ADV. It can clearly be seen that HM300 follows
    nicely the same trend as the reference measurement for higher flow speeds, demonstrating
    the capability of the Hydromast to estimate instantaneous flow velocities in unsteady
    flow. Fig. 13. Unsteady flow tilt-based velocity validation test Pikakari beach,
    4 May 2023, 300-mm mast. Show All The unsteady measurements on 18th May 2023 are
    shown in Fig. 14(a) and (b), for HM300 and HM200, respectively. In this case,
    the velocity was within the measurement range for both devices. HM300 shows a
    very good correlation throughout the data, following all the ADV peaks closely,
    especially well seen at the zoom-in. HM200 in Fig. 14(b) shows agreement with
    ADV at higher speeds but is cutting off the lower velocities, as it is not sensitive
    enough at low speeds. At speeds above the minimum theoretical range, a very good
    correlation with the reference measurement can be observed. The root-mean-square
    deviation from ADV data was 0.095m/s for HM200 and 0.101m/s for HM300. Fig. 14.
    Unsteady flow validation tests, Vääna beach, 18th May 2023. (a) Tilt-based velocity,
    300-mm mast. (b) Tilt-based velocity, 200-mm mast. (c) Direction ϕ , 200- and
    300-mm mast. Show All In addition, both HM200 and HM300 were used to estimate
    the flow directions during the 18th May experiments when the flow speed was high
    enough to work with both masts. A short 1-min segment of the directions is shown
    in Fig. 14(c). The direction varies a lot as the flow near the coast has short
    waves due to wind and swell. Direction estimations from both devices show very
    good agreement when compared to the ADV, having an equally fast reaction to the
    change of direction. SECTION V. Discussion The characterization and validation
    of the Hydromast with the Hall effect sensor have been performed. Both velocity
    estimates, the frequency-based velocity V f and the tilt-based V θ perform well
    in measuring flow velocities in various setups. For V f , the functional dependency
    as well as the working range agree well with the described theoretical framework.
    Furthermore, the longer mast HM300 resolves well lower velocities and can be easily
    used as an independent measurement. For the shorter mast HM200, the velocity range
    is wider, but an extra range criteria based on V θ needs to be used to detect
    the measurement range and allow accurate velocity estimates. However, HM200 measurements
    are more robust, whereas overlap for HM300 is relatively small for V f and V θ
    . When calculating average flow speeds over longer periods of time using HM200,
    care needs to be taken to interpret the low-velocity data. Around the lower limit
    of the measurement range frequency-based estimations only occur for higher velocities
    for HM200 and not for lower, which can lead to biased results. One option would
    be using an estimate from tilt as an indicator if V f is reliable, similar to
    what was suggested for upper velocities in the short validation tests. Furthermore,
    a minimum number of samples required for the average can be implemented. As for
    the tilt-based V θ , for HM300, the measurement range is three times larger than
    for V f , allowing the device to be used in applications with high velocity variations.
    For HM200, the range is comparable with V f , giving independent and reliable
    velocity estimates. Using V θ , instantaneous velocities in changing flow conditions
    can be measured, allowing measurements in areas where flow direction is constantly
    changing, like with the waves on the coast. Here again, HM300 seems to perform
    better, capturing lower velocities than HM200 and both sensors seem to capture
    higher velocities. In unsteady flow, the ADV velocity and the Hydromast velocity
    showed a good correlation. However, the measurements were taken in not ideal conditions
    for the ADV, namely the experiments were done in shallow water (i.e., ADV was
    both close to the bottom and near the surface). For more robust unsteady flow
    characterization, additional work is needed to accurately describe the Hydromast
    reaction time for instantaneous measurements. Direction estimate and water column
    height measurements were done against reference measurements in different flows.
    The estimates agreed between devices as well as with the references show that
    they are reliable extra measurements that can be taken during testing. In steady
    river flow, there was very little variation and the results just show the stability
    of the direction measurement in time, which agrees with ADV estimates within 5°.
    The Hydromast has the capability of near real-time data monitoring when a sensor
    hub can be mounted above water. This is useful for long-term measurements and
    is also helpful for fault detection. Based on the validation data, the overall
    uncertainties of the measurements were estimated for the 95% confidence level,
    reported in Table II. The same estimates for ADV have also been shown for comparison.
    As both velocity estimates have their own pros and cons, it could be considered
    to use the two independent velocity estimates in parallel and combine them for
    higher accuracy. Alternatively, for higher accuracy, calibrations can be performed
    before the actual tests in similar flow conditions to capture the specific behavior.
    High turbulence levels would provide rapid changes in velocity output and that
    could be an indicator that caution needs to be taken in data interpretation. TABLE
    II Uncertainty Estimates (95% Confidence Level) The Hydromast measurements are
    independent of the water quality and surface reflections, allowing it to be used
    also in locations, where acoustic methods fail. In the future, more reliable pressure
    sensors should be used to avoid drifting and provide more reliable water level
    height data. Additional research could be done on fault detection and unwanted
    debris detection. Also, finding a way to estimate TI from the Hydromast output
    would be a useful feature, to indicate high turbulence conditions. The compact
    design and affordable price of the Hydromast (roughly 1/10th of a commercial ADV)
    coupled with its versatile communication capabilities, make it suitable for a
    wide range of applications in shallow water environments. Its low cost enables
    distributed sensing in various applications, including improving safety in harbors
    by monitoring currents, detecting ship traffic along coastlines, and evaluating
    bed load for sediment transportation studies. Furthermore, the distributed sensing
    capability allows for the application of these devices in the aquaculture industry,
    as well as in the field of renewable energy, for site monitoring and site evaluation.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion In this article, the Hall effect sensor-based low-cost
    flow monitoring device Hydromast has been introduced. The device was characterized
    and validated against a commercial ADV and shown to perform well in various flows,
    with flow speeds from 0.15 to 1 m/s. With this new device, average and instantaneous
    flow speed along with flow direction and water depth can be measured, allowing
    the devices to be used in both steady and fluctuating flow conditions. Cloud communication
    functionalities were developed so that monitoring can be done online, allowing
    long-term testing with live outputs and data analysis, as well as allowing fault
    detection. With low cost and high reliability in near-bed flow estimations, the
    described device can be used in various flow conditions for flow velocity and
    direction estimation, both short- and long-term flow monitoring, as a single device
    or in a larger grid with near real-time data output to the user. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    samplingOmicron 1. Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
    2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
    and the resulting pandemic. Once infected, up to two-thirds of individuals release
    the virus via the gastrointestinal tract in a process known as viral shedding
    (Chan et al., 2021; Lo et al., 2020; Y. Zhang et al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 embedded
    in feces can later be quantified downstream in wastewater using analytical methods
    which typically target specific regions (e.g., N1, N2) of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
    gene in the extracted, purified RNA sample (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
    2021; Zhang et al., 2022). This also applies to other targets of interest, such
    as pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) found in foods containing peppers, that has
    been used as an endogenous wastewater indicator of fecal material to normalize
    SARS-CoV-2 (Corchis-Scott et al., 2021; D''Aoust et al., 2021; Dhiyebi et al.,
    2023; Kitajima et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2021a; Symonds et al., 2018). Shedding
    of fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in feces has enabled wastewater-based surveillance
    (WBS) to be applied to monitor populations of interest around the globe (Akingbola
    et al., 2022; Corchis-Scott et al., 2021; Gibas et al., 2021; Godinez et al.,
    2022; Jain et al., 2022; Scott et al., 2021b). SARS-CoV-2 WBS programs are now
    well-established and have demonstrated the ability to accurately forecast key
    COVID-19 public health metrics which has increased acceptance and adoption by
    public health administrators and confidence in the approach by the general population
    (Cheng et al., 2023; Hrudey et al., 2022). As the utility of wastewater surveillance
    became realized, practitioners began to apply these surveillance principles to
    address institutional challenges in facilities with high population density. Prisons,
    long-term care homes, dormitories and other congregate living settings became
    a focus for applying wastewater surveillance programs with the potential to act
    as an early warning system for localized outbreaks (Akingbola et al., 2022; Betancourt
    et al., 2021; Hrudey et al., 2022). Although widespread clinical testing served
    as a primary approach for many institutions, this option proved to be challenging
    and costly in the face of supply chain issues (Ouslander and Grabowski, 2020;
    Peccia et al., 2020). WBS offered an adaptive, scalable, and sensitive solution
    to monitor spatial and temporal trends in community viral burden (Bivins et al.,
    2022b; Colosi et al., 2021; Corchis-Scott et al., 2021). The potential for WBS
    to act as a leading indicator of disease prevalence also drew interest from a
    variety of public health stakeholders, particularly when clinical testing efforts
    were limited or unavailable entirely (Bibby et al., 2021; Fahrenfeld et al., 2022).
    Sampling upstream from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), especially at building-scale,
    introduces a series of unique challenges including high temporal variation due
    to pulse-inputs into the sewage system. Human behaviour within the sewer catchment
    drives wastewater flow, volume and timing. Toilet flushes, water appliance usage
    and showering directly influence the temporal variability of wastewater. Several
    studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater can fluctuate
    by orders of magnitude over a short period of time, which demonstrates the importance
    of sampling design to optimize the potential capture of the viral signal (Anderson-Coughlin
    et al., 2022; Betancourt et al., 2021; Welling et al., 2022). Use of discrete
    sampling methods, such as grab and composite samplers, may miss significant sewer
    inputs if they occur in the intervals between sample collection (George et al.,
    2022; Habtewold et al., 2022; Schang et al., 2021; West et al., 2023). An additional
    consideration is the lack of security and electricity required to operate automatic
    sampling units at some sites. Autosamplers are also often too costly for localized
    surveillance programs, especially if multiple units are required (Karthikeyan
    et al., 2021; Schang et al., 2021; Wright et al., 2022). As an alternative, passive
    sampling has been increasingly employed in upstream wastewater sampling to address
    these limitations (Acer et al., 2022; Bivins et al., 2022a; Hayes et al., 2021;
    Li et al., 2022a). Passive sampling is a monitoring technique that uses sampling
    media to passively accumulate analytes of interest over time (Górecki and Namieśnik,
    2002). The sampling medium remains immersed in the environment for the entire
    sampling period, which makes it less likely to miss significant fecal shedding
    events (Schang et al., 2021). Several studies have documented superior performance
    by passive samplers in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 when compared with composite
    and grab samples, especially at lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater
    (Liu et al., 2022; Rafiee et al., 2021; Schang et al., 2021). Additionally, passive
    samplers have advantages for a diverse array of applications because they are
    affordable, simple to produce and use, do not require electricity and can be easily
    concealed (Habtewold et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022; Schang et al., 2021). The
    University of Waterloo is home to Canada''s fourth largest post-secondary housing
    operation with over 5600 beds catering primarily to undergraduate students. Like
    many other institutions, concerns over the effectiveness of existing clinical
    tools to monitor pandemic status in the residences led to considerable uncertainty
    around managing the reopening of the campus while minimizing the risk to the community.
    Therefore, in the summer of 2021 a pilot upstream wastewater surveillance program
    for SARS-CoV-2 was deployed on campus residence buildings. The goal of the project
    was to determine if passive sampling could be used as an effective tool to inform
    localized public health action and decision-making. The design of the surveillance
    program prioritized maximal surveillance coverage of the campus residences, efficient
    use of resources and optimization of actionability of the data. Twenty-four-hour
    passive samples were collected three times per week from late August 2021 to April
    2022 using cotton medical gauze as a sampling medium. Results were rapidly reported
    within 12 h of sample collection to a campus committee responsible for implementing
    public health interventions. The program was adapted as needed as knowledge of
    the wastewater system progressed, the pandemic trajectory changed, and public
    health requirements shifted. This trigger-based approach surveillance program
    is among the first to report on the use of passive sampling in a university setting.
    Efforts to maximize surveillance coverage and minimize resource usage are critical
    to informing future surveillance programs as funding and resource availability
    are both spatially and temporally variable. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. University
    background The University of Waterloo (Waterloo, ON, Canada) is a public research
    university in Canada with an annual enrolment of ∼42,000 students, 90 % of which
    are undergraduate students (University of Waterloo, 2022). The University operates
    12 residences buildings across a ∼400 ha campus, collectively housing over 5600
    students when at maximum capacity. Residence halls are categorized by two designations:
    (1) traditional-style residences which are characterized by washroom facilities
    shared by up to 25 individuals, and (2) apartment-style residences wherein three
    to four students share a private bathroom and kitchen. Residence operations closed
    as a result of the pandemic in March 2020 with the exception of some international
    students who remained on campus due to travel restrictions. The reopening of campus
    housing to the broader student community was scheduled for September 2021 at the
    onset of this study. Students were required to have at least one dose of a Health
    Canada approved COVID-19 vaccine by move-in day and to receive their second dose
    no later than November 1, 2021. Public health protocols were established for residents
    including active screening during move-in, mandatory mask wearing in public spaces,
    take-out only at cafeterias and foot-traffic decals. Gauze was used as the collection
    substrate in the passive samplers for the routine surveillance. Experiments conducted
    with passive torpedo samplers in the campus sewer demonstrated that although both
    gauze and electronegative membranes could capture a SARS-CoV-2 signal, significantly
    more solids and total RNA were collected on the gauze (Supplemental Information
    – Section 1.0). The gauze more consistently detected the SARS-CoV-2 and at higher
    total copy numbers. 2.2. Passive sampler design and use The passive samplers were
    housed in torpedo-shaped vessels (15 × 3 × 3 cm) developed by Schang et al. (2021)
    that were 3D printed by WaterPuris Inc. (Kitchener, ON, Canada) using clear, durable
    V2 resin (Formlabs, Somerville, MA, USA). Modifications were made to the original
    print file to increase the thickness of the sampler walls to minimize in-situ
    warping. A fishing leader line was fed through the sampler and secured on the
    interior with a standard safety pin. The vessels were loaded with a loosely folded
    2.76 × 2.76 cm sterile cotton gauze pad (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON) then
    secured with a lid to create the sampling apparatus (Supplemental Information
    – Fig. S6). The exterior end of the fishing leader line was tied to a 45.3 kg
    test saltwater fishing line (Goture Co., San Francisco, CA, USA) which was affixed
    to a heavy-duty neodymium magnet hook with swiveling carabiner. The magnetic hook
    was then affixed to the interior of the utility hole rim to maintain the sampler
    in position. Samplers were typically deployed between 8 and 10 a.m. and remained
    in place for 24 h. Upon collection, samples were transferred on ice to the laboratory
    for processing. Samplers were cleaned with a 10 % bleach solution before redeployment
    to avoid cross-day contamination. 2.3. RNA concentration and extraction In a sterile
    biological safety cabinet, each sample was transferred to an individual 50 mL
    sterile polypropylene centrifuge tube (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) containing 15 mL
    of Dulbecco''s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga,
    ON) with added 0.01 % v/v polysorbate-20 (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON).
    The tubes were placed on a 16-tube vertical tube rotator (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga,
    ON) and spun at 40 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, then placed on a digital vortex mixer
    (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON) at 2000 rpm for 30 s to release trapped solids.
    Gauze was then removed from the tubes using a pair of sterile forceps and squeezed
    on the interior wall of the centrifuge tube to ensure the original 15 mL DPBS/polysorbate-20
    volume was retained. The sampling material was then discarded, and the remaining
    solution was centrifuged at 12,000 RCF for 30 min at 4 °C with no brake. Following
    centrifugation, the supernatant was carefully discarded using a pipette. A 140–150
    mg sample of the generated pellet was sterilely placed into a 2 mL glass-style
    bead beating tube provided in the QIAGEN® RNeasy Power Microbiome® RNA extraction
    kit (QIAGEN®, Germany, No. 26000–50). Each tube then received 100 μL of TRIzol
    reagent (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON) and 650 μL of PM1 (a kit-based reagent,
    QIAGEN®) mixed with beta 2-mercaptoethanol (Fischer Scientific, MA, USA) in a
    99:1 ratio. The remainder of the extraction was performed in adherence to the
    manufacture''s protocol using the QIAGEN® Qiacube® (QIAGEN®, Germany, Serial No.:
    02278). A Bead Ruptor 12 Bead Mill Homogenizer (Fischer Scientific, MA, USA) was
    used for 5 min at 3.55 m/s to homogenize the samples. Following extraction, the
    resulting purified RNA was eluted into a 100 μL suspension of RNAse-free water.
    An extraction blank (whole-process control) was included with each batch of samples
    to screen for contamination. Additionally, samples and extraction blanks were
    analyzed for total RNA content by measuring a one μL subsample of the RNA elution
    using the NanoDrop One spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Mississauga,
    Ontario). 2.4. Analytical methods Extracted RNA underwent 1-step reverse transcriptase
    quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 (N1, N2 gene targets)
    and PMMoV. Detailed assay information can be found in the Supplemental Information
    (Sections 2 and 3). In Fall 2021 N1 and PMMoV were quantified in a duplexed assay.
    All assays were then run on either the CFX96 Touch or the CDX Opus Real-Time PCR
    systems using CFX Maestro Software for CFX Real-Time PCR Instruments (Bio-Rad
    Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Based on experiments conducted in our lab and
    regional reports of an N1 dropout in late 2021 (Miller et al., 2021; Wang et al.,
    2022; Wollschläger et al., 2021), N2 was measured in all samples during Winter
    2022 in a simplex assay to draw comparisons between the two targets. To evaluate
    the presence of inhibition, when possible, samples were plated in 1× and 10× dilution
    and compared using the corrected concentration of PMMoV on the sampler. The actual
    PMMoV concentration is measured in the undiluted sample and the theoretical or
    expected PMMoV concentration is derived from the 10× dilution. Samples were considered
    inhibited if the ratio of theoretical to actual PMMoV concentrations exceeded
    two. Inhibition ratios were used to assign confidence to negative samples and
    assist in interpreting results. An undiluted sample negative for SARS-Cov-2 which
    had no evidence of inhibition would be less likely to produce a false negative
    result compared to an inhibited sample. Diluted an inhibited sample may reduce
    inhibitory effects enough to allow a SARS-CoV-2 detection to be made, mitigating
    the false negative interpretation. To define a positive sample, a one GC/reaction
    threshold was used as the absolute minimum concentration for a RT-qPCR detection
    to occur. Given that both the RNA elution and pellet were subsampled, the sampler
    detection limit was determined in order to identify the minimum number of GCs
    required to make a positive detection. This is assuming that there are no viral
    losses during the extraction process and that the resulting pellet and RNA elution
    were homogenous. The sampler detection limit was calculated using the following
    formula: (1) Individual PCR wells were categorized based on the amplified SARS-CoV-2
    concentration. A sample was considered positive if at least two of three PCR wells
    amplified above the sampler detection limit, or if all three wells produced a
    Cq value regardless of concentration. For samples where two or less wells amplified
    SARS-Cov-2 below the sampler detection limit, these were classified as ‘trace’
    detections. 2.5. Two-tiered sampling network A thorough survey of wastewater infrastructure
    identified surveillance sites that were organized into a two-tiered network (Fig.
    1) which maintained 85 % surveillance coverage of the on-campus residence population.
    Site information including upstream occupancy data is presented in the Supplemental
    Information (Table S5). A decision-making framework (Fig. 2) was developed to
    create thresholds for determining when building-scale (upstream) sampling would
    be triggered. If a sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2, both the upstream and building-cluster
    (downstream) sites were sampled the subsequent sampling day to isolate the probable
    source of the signal. Both tiers of the surveillance network were sampled until
    they each produced non-detections for three consecutive sampling days. Download

    passive samplers were deployed three times per week between August 2021 and April
    2022. Surveillance period 1 (Fall 2021) began on August 18, 2021, and ceased on
    December 17, 2021. Following the holiday break, surveillance period 2 (Winter
    2022) began on January 7, 2022, and ceased on April 29, 2022, following the final
    exam period. 2.7. Municipal wastewater sampling Influent from the City of Waterloo
    WWTP located approximately 4 km northeast of the University campus was sampled
    as part of a larger WBS program. Samples collected using a 24-h composite sampler
    were processed in accordance with the methods described in Cheng et al., 2023.
    Briefly, polyethylene glycol (4 g) and NaCl (0.9 g) were added to a 40 mL influent
    sample that was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1.5 h after settling overnight. The
    pellet was analyzed using the same kit-based extraction method and quantified
    with similar RT-qPCR methods as described above (Cheng et al., 2023). 2.8. Clinical
    case data Anonymized case data for each residence building was provided by the
    University of Waterloo Department of Housing after the project had concluded and
    was completely independent of wastewater surveillance collection. Clinical case
    data was collected solely based on students self-reporting illness as there was
    no mandatory clinical testing on the campus. Clinical cases therefore include
    only individuals who volunteered that they had tested positive (PCR test or rapid
    antigen test) and reported results to the University. It is possible that some
    students may not have reported illness to the University Housing unit. To identify
    relationships between known clinical cases and passive sampler data, three assumed
    shedding periods were applied to the clinical dataset to account for fecal shedding
    variability. Cases were counted for each shedding period from the date of symptom
    onset (if known), or the day the student reported the illness to the University.
    In Fall 2021, in accordance with the Public Health guidelines at the time, students
    who were symptomatic or had tested positive were moved to an isolation facility
    outside of the surveillance catchment for a 10-day period. These cases were included
    in the tracker on the day the student was moved to isolation, as well as the day
    of return, and any additional days counted in the assumed shedding period. In
    Winter 2022, Public Health guidelines shifted to a five-day isolation period.
    During this time most students were ordered to “Stay-In-Place” to self-isolate
    in their assigned residence accommodations, contrary to moving to a dedicated
    isolation space as was done in Fall 2021. In these cases, students were included
    in the tracker for the entire assumed shedding period as they were still contributing
    to the wastewater signal. Individual cases were counted for an assumed 5-day,
    10-day and 21-day shedding period and compared with SARS-CoV-2 concentrations
    on passive samplers. In a separate analysis to account for the decay of detectable
    virus in stool over the course of infection, cases were assigned a contribution
    factor (CF) for each day in the shedding period based on an exponential decay
    formula (Eq. (1)). The formula aims to capture the theoretical decrease in fecal
    shedding load where a represents the initial contribution strength (100 %), r
    is the assumed decay factor of either 25 %, 50 % or 75 %, and x is the elapsed
    time in days. This analysis was performed under an assumed 10 and 21-day shedding
    period. (2) 2.9. Data analysis Standard curve slope and y-intercepts from RT-qPCR
    were used to quantify viral targets using the instrument''s recorded Cq value.
    Logarithmic transformation of wastewater data collected at both the WWTP and on
    campus fit a normal distribution, allowing for use of parametric tests. Correlation
    analysis was performed using the Pearson''s product method or Spearman''s rank
    method depending on data normality. A Wilcoxan rank-sum test was used to identify
    differences in median N1 and N2 concentrations within samples. A Pearson Chi-square
    test was used to compare detection frequencies between residence style types.
    To draw comparisons between target analyte concentrations in different residence
    style types, a one-way ANOVA was used. Concordance metrics were calculated using
    conventional formulas. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS
    Statistics 29 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and visualizations were generated
    using Microsoft Excel Version 16 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). 2.10. Response
    plan and reporting The research team provided results to the Department of Housing
    and University Safety Office within 12 h of sample collection in Fall 2021 with
    reporting three days per week. In Winter 2022 reporting was performed once per
    week given the project scope changes subsequently discussed. The research team
    and campus partners met weekly throughout the surveillance project to discuss
    results and response plans. In the event of a positive detection campus partners
    utilized several adaptive response strategies for targeted communities including
    direct email notification and public messaging. The research team and campus stakeholders
    hosted a public information session on the WBS program and worked jointly to develop
    and update an online dashboard relaying the status of wastewater surveillance
    in each residence complex. Clinical reporting and case management was managed
    and tracked internally by Department of Housing staff throughout the project and
    performed independently of the WBS program. A project timeline including university
    COVID-19 policies is presented in the Supplemental Information (Fig. S7). 3. Results
    and discussion To address an institutional public health need, a wastewater network
    was strategically sampled to gain building-scale information on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.
    Motivated by the ability for WBS to detect asymptomatic cases, University decision-makers
    sought to follow up positive wastewater detections with targeted public health
    action to minimize risk to students and staff. The surveillance program was initially
    designed to end on November 1, 2021, coinciding with the double vaccination deadline
    for students living on-campus. However, results over the Fall 2021 semester would
    extend the surveillance program an additional six months. During this time, passive
    samplers were evaluated for their performance characteristics, concordance with
    known clinical cases and relation to the prevalence of COVID-19 in the broader
    community. 3.1. Passive sampler performance and inhibition Solids captured by
    passive samplers generated a mean wet pellet weight of 0.670 ± 0.265 g with a
    minimum and maximum capture of 0.115 g and 2.178 g respectively, indicating that
    cotton gauze was able to collect a range of solid masses. Similarly, the elution
    extracts yielded a mean total RNA concentration of 973.6 ± 421.6 ng/μL with concentrations
    ranging between 76.3 and 3063.4 ng/μL. The mean pellet mass from samples collected
    in the two weeks prior to student move in were much lower compared to the remainder
    of the semester, likely attributed to the low wastewater flow observed during
    that period. Only 3 % of the passive samplers in this study exhibited ragging,
    a term used to describe partial or full blockage of the sampling unit through
    the collection of in-situ debris. This is similar to Schang et al. (2021), who
    reported the ragging rate on their torpedo-style housing units to be <10 % (Schang
    et al., 2021). Despite this finding, all samples tested positive for PMMoV indicating
    the presence of fecal matter in every sample. Gauze captured a mean PMMoV concentration
    of 6.79 ± 0.376 log10 gene copies (GC)/sampler across sampling sites. Mean PMMoV
    concentrations on passive samplers between downstream sites were not significantly
    different (One-way ANOVA, F = 1.979, d.f. = 4, 418, P = 0.097; Supplemental Information
    Fig. S8) despite known upstream population differences. Additionally, while there
    was a significant relationship between log-transformed wet pellet mass and PMMoV
    GC/sampler, the relationship was weaker than expected (Pearson-product moment
    correlation, r = 0.422, N = 575, P < 0.001). Using the PMMoV concentrations derived
    from the diluted samples did not improve strength of the relationship, which indicated
    that inhibition of PMMoV was not a significant factor. Together these results
    suggest that the amount of PMMoV captured and retained by the passive sampler
    is not reflective of upstream population differences. While the normalization
    of SARS-CoV-2 targets by PMMoV has been used successfully in on-campus surveillance
    programs using discrete sampling methods (Lee et al., 2023; Scott et al., 2021a)
    results of the study reported here suggest PMMoV may not be a suitable normalization
    target for SARS-CoV-2 when using gauze as a sampling medium. This conclusion is
    supported by Habtewold et al. (2022) who did not observe the linear accumulation
    of PMMoV in gauze samplers, and Li et al. (2022) who reported saturation of the
    material in 8 h, followed by viral losses. It is possible that normalization by
    PMMoV could be used in gauze-based applications for exposure durations under 24
    h, but further work is needed to characterize the equilibrium kinetics of the
    material in-situ. Although other normalizing metrics were considered for use in
    this study (including flush counts, electricity and water usage), this information
    was either unavailable or not feasible to collect during the rapid deployment
    of the current surveillance program. For these reasons subsequent data analyses
    were only performed on un-normalized SARS-CoV-2 data only. In Fall 2021 there
    were reports of a potential dropout of the N1 target caused by mutations in the
    SARS-CoV-2 N-gene (Miller et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Wollschläger et al.,
    2021). To safeguard against diagnostic evasion, N2 was quantified in simplex along
    with the N1/PMMoV duplex reaction in Winter 2022. Retrospective analysis using
    a Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated a statistically significant difference between
    the median N1 and N2 signals in Winter 2022 (Wilcoxan signed rank test, Z = 10.848,
    P < 0.001) with a mean N1:N2 ratio of 0.714. However, the correlation coefficient
    between the log-transformed N1 and N2 measurements (Supplemental Information –
    Fig. S10) was 0.969 (Pearson''s method, r = 0.969, N = 277, P < 0.01). While the
    N1 dropout observed at the onset of the Omicron wave (Miller et al., 2021; Wang
    et al., 2022; Wollschläger et al., 2021) might have caused part of this divergence,
    slight differences or bias in the assays cannot be ruled out. However, both N1
    and N2 behaved similarly and were capable of tracking temporal trends in SARS-CoV-2
    signal. The N1 duplexed assay was also able to detect all clinical cases known
    to the University in Fall 2021, assigning additional confidence to surveillance
    efforts during this period. Samples collected in the two weeks preceding student
    move in did not indicate any presence of inhibition. However, persistent inhibition
    was observed after student move in at all sites, possibly reflective of the detergents,
    cleaners and other chemicals input to the wastewater system (Supplementary Information
    - Fig. S11). In Fall 2021, 90 of 203 (44.3 %) tested samples were deemed inhibited
    which was of concern for the purposes of detecting low SARS-CoV-2 concentrations
    in wastewater. Reducing sample inhibition was a top priority for public health
    officials who sought to follow up positive detections with building-specific action
    and who relied on negative results to confirm the existing public health measures
    in place. Therefore, a methodological change was made to target a smaller pellet
    subsample mass to prevent overloading of the extraction column. This change was
    made on September 27, 2021, which generally reduced the severity of inhibition
    in passive samples. In Fall 2021 there were two diluted samples that made a positive
    detection despite the same undiluted sample testing negative. These findings demonstrate
    the importance of assessing and mitigating inhibition even when the surveillance
    program is driven by qualitative passive sampling results. While this diagnostic
    evasion of SARS-CoV-2 is a concern, these two detections did not lead to the identification
    of any new cases and no subsequent positive detections were made in the days that
    followed. In Winter 2022, 87 of 288 (30.2 %) tested samples demonstrated some
    degree of inhibition with no apparent temporal or spatial trends. Given the magnitude
    of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations measured in Winter 2022 and inhibition estimates
    derived by PMMoV concentrations on passive samplers, there was significantly less
    concern regarding the diagnostic evasion of N-gene targets during this surveillance
    period. 3.2. Surveillance in Fall 2021 – low COVID-19 prevalence A total of 291
    samples were collected over 52 sampling days in Fall 2021. Of these samples, 12
    (4.1 %) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, an additional 8 (2.8 %) detected trace
    levels of SARS-CoV-2 but most samples (93.1 %) tested negative for SARS-CoV-2
    (Fig. 3). The total number of samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 was variable across
    sites and ranged from zero to four. The first two positive SARS-CoV-2 detection
    of Fall 2021 (Fig. 3 – Branches B, E) were made within the two weeks prior to
    student move in and were followed by negative results on subsequent sampling dates,
    indicating the presence of at least one transient non-student case in each surveillance
    catchment. Following student move in over the week of September 6, other positive
    and trace-level detections translated to eight separate triggers of upstream sampling.
    Four of the eight upstream sampling triggers were succeeded by non-detections
    at both the upstream and downstream sites. A positive downstream detection followed
    by non-detections at all surveillance sites indicated to public health decision-makers
    that the infected individual was no longer in the community and transmission risk
    was reduced. In two other instances, upstream sampling sites were able to refine
    the probable origin of the positive signal to a small building subunit within
    the sewershed. In both examples, upstream sampling was able to refine the origin
    of the signal from a population of 1550 students to just 292 (Fig. 3 – Branch
    C). This enabled highly targeted public health intervention by means of notification,
    increasing student risk awareness and communicating best practices such as frequent
    hand washing and encouraging the use of face masks. Had invasive clinical testing
    been a component of the University''s response to a positive wastewater detection,
    spatial refinement would minimize the number of clinical tests needed to identify
    the infected person(s) and consequently improving the ability to isolate individual(s)
    and optimize efficiency. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download :

    the site was not included in the surveillance program for that respective period
    of time. Samples that were lost during collection or that could not be retrieved
    due to weather constraints contain an ‘x’. The remaining two upstream sampling
    events were linked to a clinical COVID-19 case known to the University. On November
    3, 2021, the downstream site D0 produced 1.79 × 104 N1 genomic copies (GC)/sampler
    – the maximum detection observed in Fall 2021 (Fig. 4). The detection triggered
    upstream sampling the following sampling day where the upstream site tested negative
    for SARS-CoV-2, and the downstream site continued to test positive, though substantially
    reduced in signal (∼79 % reduction from November 3 – November 5). This combination
    of results prompted response action in two candidate residence buildings. Retrospective
    analysis of the clinical dataset revealed that a single student began experiencing
    symptoms on November 4 and reported a positive PCR test to the University on November
    5. The following day the student was moved to an isolation space outside the surveillance
    catchment. This timeline indicates that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewater
    24 h in advance of the individual becoming symptomatic, two days before clinical
    test confirmation, and three days before the student was moved into a quarantine
    facility (Fig. 4). This single case was detected at a sampling site collecting
    wastewater from nearly 1300 individuals, indicating a high degree of methodological
    sensitivity. Download : Download high-res image (100KB) Download : Download full-size

    by circles where positive detections are filled in red and non-detections are
    empty. The associated upstream site is produced only non-detections in the sampling
    period and are denoted by X marks. All non-detections were assigned a value of
    one (1) for graphical purposes. The green and red shaded areas signify when the
    student was living in their original accommodation and when they were moved a
    quarantine facility respectively. This example demonstrates the efficacy of the
    tiered approach in achieving an actionable degree of spatial surveillance while
    maximizing resource and personnel use. It also adds to mounting evidence that
    WBS has the potential to provide early detection and outbreak notification at
    the building-scale, especially in this setting where a comprehensive clinical
    testing program was not in place (Bibby et al., 2021; Corchis-Scott et al., 2021).
    However, it also highlights the challenges that convalescent cases within the
    surveillance catchment can pose to data interpretation. Upon the students return
    to their original accommodation following the 10-day isolation period, positive
    detections continued to be made until November 19. Fecal shedding duration of
    SARS-CoV-2 can be variable between individuals (Cevik et al., 2021; Xiao et al.,
    2020), with prolonged shedding periods confounding interpretation and reporting
    efforts (Cavany et al., 2022; Colosi et al., 2021; Corchis-Scott et al., 2021;
    Sellers et al., 2022). In the absence of mandatory clinical testing, there is
    no way to know whether the same individual contributed to the later positive detections
    or not. One interesting point of note, however, is that the quantification of
    SARS-CoV-2 on the passive sampler during the initial detection period closely
    mirrored what is known about viral shedding in clinical settings. While extended
    periods of fecal shedding have been documented, viral shedding tends to peak within
    five to six days of infection followed by a rapid decline (Cavany et al., 2022;
    Cevik et al., 2021; Natarajan et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2021). This suggests
    that passive samplers might be sensitive enough to capture the fecal shedding
    variability of a single individual while simultaneously monitoring a much larger
    community. Under the assumption that all detections made at D-0 in November were
    from the same person, this places the individuals fecal shedding duration at approximately
    16 days which is close to the previously estimated mean fecal shedding duration
    of 17.2 days (Cevik et al., 2021). Due to the episodic nature of positive detections
    across sites throughout Fall 2021 and the low COVID-19 prevalence in the community,
    isolating the origin of these signals worked as intended. While positive detections
    were informative for public health decision-makers, the widespread non-detections
    observed across campus in Fall 2021 validated the efficacy of existing public
    health measures in place. 3.3. Surveillance in Winter 2022 – high COVID-19 prevalence
    The arrival and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in Ontario
    demanded major scope changes to the surveillance project. While Omicron has a
    comparable period of communicability compared to other SARS-CoV-2 Variants of
    Concern (VOC), it has been shown to be significantly more transmissible (Public
    Health Ontario, 2023). This was reflected in the rapid increase in the numbers
    of clinical case and hospitalizations in Ontario that occurred in January 2021
    (Cheng et al., 2023). Because few students were on campus during the Holiday Break,
    sampling was not conducted during this period. Although only a portion of the
    students returned during the first two weeks in January 2022 all sites tested
    positive for SARS-CoV-2, some up to 10-fold greater than the strongest detection
    made in the Fall 2021. Given that upstream sampling no longer provided useful
    information on the probable origin of a positive signal, the two-tiered approach
    was no longer needed. Instead, only downstream sites were included in surveillance
    in an attempt to identify changes in the SARS-CoV-2 signal to inform the easing
    (or further implementation) of public health restrictions. In Winter 2022, there
    were a total of 295 samples were collected (Fig. 5). In contrast to the previous
    surveillance period, 42 sampling days produced just 10 (3.4 %) samples that were
    negative for SARS-CoV-2, 6 (2.0 %) detected trace-levels of SARS-CoV-2, and 278
    (94.2 %) samples tested positive. Similar to other WBS programs on university
    campuses (Jain et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023), all downstream sites at the University
    closely followed trends measured downstream at the municipal WWTP (Fig. 5). Download

    y-axis. Municipal wastewater data (Panel WWTP) is presented as the log-transformed
    N-GC/mL of wastewater with the red line representing the one-week moving average.
    The holiday break is denoted in each panel where there were no on-campus sampling
    activities from December 18, 2021 – January 6, 2022. 3.4. Detections at traditional
    and apartment-style residence buildings Several on-campus WBS programs have prioritized
    traditional-style residence buildings that shared bathroom and dining facilities
    on the assumption that they would pose a greater transmission risk to residents
    and consequently result in a greater detection frequency compared to apartment-style
    residence buildings (Anderson-Coughlin et al., 2022; Kotay et al., 2022; Scott
    et al., 2021b). In this study there was no statistical difference between the
    detection frequencies of traditional and apartment-style residence buildings,
    X2, (1, N = 312, P = 0.721). To compare the overall SARS-CoV-2 burden between
    residence styles a one-way ANOVA was performed of the data from the sites measuring
    the two residence styles. Traditional-style residences had a significantly higher
    mean SARS-CoV-2 load compared to apartment-style residences for both log-transformed
    N1 (One-way ANOVA, F = 6.630, d.f. = 1, 158, P = 0.011) and N2 (One-way ANOVA,
    F = 4.285, d.f. = 1, 152, P = 0.040) data. Boxplots are presented in the Supplemental
    Information (Fig. S12). While it is possible that traditional-style residences
    carry a greater COVID-19 burden, this result might also be attributed to other
    intrinsic factors unique to apartment-style residence buildings. For example,
    apartment-style residences on the campus had a lower population density compared
    to traditional-style buildings and access to ensuite appliances such as dishwashers
    and washing machines which introduce additional greywater into the sewage system
    (Anderson-Coughlin et al., 2022). The additional greywater could accumulate more
    inhibitors and cause an increased dilution effect, thereby reducing SARS-CoV-2
    concentration on passive samplers at these sites. Nonetheless, these results suggest
    that residence style may not need to be a key consideration for WBS site selection.
    3.5. Passive sampling concordance with epidemiological data Unlike Fall 2021,
    interpretation of the wastewater signal in Winter 2022 was challenging given that
    most students were required to stay in place for self-isolation. As observed at
    site D0 in the Fall of 2021 and as other studies have reported, the presence of
    convalescent cases within the sewershed can confound the interpretation of wastewater
    data (Cavany et al., 2022; Colosi et al., 2021; Corchis-Scott et al., 2021; Sellers
    et al., 2022). There was strong concordance between same-day clinical case reports
    and detections in wastewater (Table 1; sensitivity = 98.2 %) meaning the method
    was able to detect all but one clinical case known to the University. This single
    case was reported on the last day of surveillance in Fall 2021. It is possible
    that this student moved out or did not use the restroom facilities within their
    assigned accommodation during the sampling window, or that they did not shed a
    detectable amount of the virus. The method also demonstrated strong predictive
    power in accurately identifying the absence of clinical cases upstream (Table
    2; negative predictive value (NPV) = 99.6 %). A large number of positive wastewater
    detections were made in the absence of a clinical case being reported, producing
    a positive predictive value (PPV) of 16.7 % which is less than other upstream
    sampling programs have reported (Bivins et al., 2022b; Welling et al., 2022).
    However, this result is not surprising given the limitations of the clinical dataset.
    The absence of mandatory clinical testing and voluntary reporting resulted in
    a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the methodological positive predictive
    ability. Other studies which paired wastewater surveillance with comprehensive
    clinical testing programs observed significantly higher PPVs (Bivins et al., 2022b;
    Welling et al., 2022). Given these limitations and that college-aged students
    have a significantly higher proportion of asymptomatic cases compared to older
    cohorts (Schmitz et al., 2021), widespread diagnostic evasion was anticipated.
    One study which administered over 700 clinical tests on a university campus found
    that nearly 80 % of all cases were asymptomatic (Schmitz et al., 2021). This is
    likely reflected to some degree in the discordance between wastewater testing
    and the clinical dataset. As previously mentioned, the indiscriminate nature of
    WBS does not allow for distinction between new COVID-19 cases and convalescent
    cases within the sewershed, particularly when sick individuals reside in the same
    building as the rest of the population under surveillance. Despite asymptomatic
    and unreported cases reducing the same-day PPV, the true value of the surveillance
    program was realized in these detections where discordance was followed up by
    targeted public health intervention. This is the case for >83 % of all positive
    samples which had no known clinical cases associated. Table 1. Comparison of same-day

    0.521 21-day 50 % 0.498 0.485 21-day 75 % 0.483 0.466 Recognizing the variability
    of fecal viral shedding, a 5-day, 10-day and 21-day shedding period were applied
    to clinical cases to identify any significant relationships with passive sampling
    data. The five and ten-day shedding periods were selected since they represent
    the required isolation periods for Fall 2021 and Winter 2022 respectively, as
    recommended by the provincial government at the time. A 21-day shedding period
    was also evaluated to account for the possibility of a longer shedding period
    and is similar to the 17-day mean shedding period reported by Cevik et al., 2021.
    Initially, cases were counted for the entire shedding period. Clinical case counts
    could not be normalized by transformation, therefore, the Spearman''s rank method
    was used to identify significant correlations between case counts and log-transformed
    SARS-CoV-2 concentrations on passive samplers (Table 2). The 10-day assumed shedding
    period produced the strongest correlation with both N1 and N2 followed by the
    5-day and 21-day shedding periods (Table 2). However, this approach fails to capture
    the exponential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the stool of infected
    patients following peak shedding which occurs approximately five days after infection
    (Cavany et al., 2022; Cevik et al., 2021; Natarajan et al., 2022; Zhang et al.,
    2021). Since nearly all individuals in our dataset were symptomatic, it was assumed
    that peak shedding occurred on the day illness was reported. Of the different
    conditions tested, an assumed 21-day shedding and a decay rate constant of 25
    % produced the strongest correlation for both log-transformed N1 and N2 concentrations
    (Table 2). Within the two tested shedding periods, correlation coefficients decreased
    as the decay rate constant increased. However, applying contribution factors (CFs)
    to clinical cases to account for signal decay over the shedding period did not
    improve correlation strength overall compared to whole case counts. This is likely
    a consequence of unreported cases in the sewershed contributing to the wastewater
    signal during periods when the decay analysis tracks the decline in known cases.
    Therefore, this analysis might be best suited to monitoring applications where
    more is known about the clinical dynamics of the population under surveillance.
    A better understanding of decay rates in SARS-CoV-2 fecal shedding might assist
    practitioners with the interpretation of wastewater data, particularly when convalescent
    cases are present in the sewershed and confound results. 3.6. Relationship between
    campus passive sampling and regional (quantitative) wastewater surveillance To
    compare the SARS-CoV-2 burden on campus to the broader community, comparisons
    were made between log-transformed passive sampling data and SARS-CoV-2 concentrations
    in wastewater collected at the municipal WWTP. Logarithmic transformation produced
    an approximately normal distribution for WWTP data and for campus sampling data
    (Supplemental Information – Figs. S13 and S10 respectively). There was no significant
    relationship between passive sampler and WWTP N1 concentrations in Fall 2021 due
    to the large number of non-detections for SARS-CoV-2 measured on campus and the
    comparatively low viral prevalence in the community (Pearson product-moment correlation,
    r = 0.204, N = 8, P = 0.629). Alternatively, the persistent positive detections
    on campus in Winter 2022 made for a more suitable comparison. All downstream sampling
    sites on campus measured two distinct peaks in SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in Winter
    2022 – the first peak immediately following the return from the holiday break,
    and the second occurring towards the end of March where clinical cases reported
    to the University were at their maxima. These peaks closely coincide with the
    peaks observed in municipal wastewater samples collected at the City of Waterloo
    WWTP and were also observed in WBS programs at other universities during the same
    time period (Jain et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023). Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations
    on passive samplers and in wastewater produced a weak, positive correlation for
    both N-gene targets (Table 3). While these measurements were not paired, similar
    linear relationships between passive and discrete sampling methods have been previously
    reported using a variety of sampling materials (Bivins et al., 2022a; Habtewold
    et al., 2022; Schang et al., 2021). Table 3. Pearson correlation coefficients
    between log-transformed on campus passive sampling data and log-transformed SARS-CoV-2
    concentrations in wastewater measured at the WWTP during Winter 2022. All correlations
    are significant at the P < 0.001 level. Empty Cell Campus Passive Samplers N1
    N2 Municipal WWTP N1 0.397 0.372 N2 0.403 0.386 These results suggest that drawing
    comparisons between building-scale and community-scale WBS might be dependent
    on disease-prevalence within the sewershed. This was largely due to the episodic
    nature of positive detections on campus in Fall 2021 which produced significant
    discordance with the WWTP dataset. Additionally, near-source sampling is known
    to produce significant day-to-day variation in SARS-CoV-2 levels due to variable
    flow regimes, fecal shedding dynamics and other factors which mediate viral input
    into the sewage system (Bivins and Bibby, 2021; Corchis-Scott et al., 2021; Rondeau
    et al., 2023). Downstream at the WWTP where wastewater is drawn from a larger
    catchment, wastewater composition may be less prone to temporal density variability.
    Alternatively, when disease prevalence in the community is comparatively high
    and detectable at both sampling scales, the results demonstrate that building-scale
    sampling may be redundant. SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in municipal wastewater closely
    resembled that of the campus through time, indicating that the municipal surveillance
    program might have been a suitable surrogate for the overall incidence of disease
    within on campus residence buildings. It is also important to recall that many
    students at the University who do not live in residence are living in the surrounding
    area serviced by municipal WWTP. The interaction between the University population
    and the wider community, and therefore transmission of COVID-19, may have contributed
    to this similarity in results. Nonetheless, there were several campus samples
    in Winter 2022 that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 which validated known clinical
    information and provided useful spatial data for public health officials. These
    periods of lower disease prevalence would have otherwise not been detected had
    surveillance only been performed at the WWTP. The correlation coefficients presented
    in Table 3 also support mounting evidence that passive sampling has the potential
    to generate semi-quantitative data (Bivins et al., 2022b; Habtewold et al., 2022;
    Hayes et al., 2021). Despite several studies demonstrating a limited capacity
    for gauze to act as a passive sampling medium for SARS-CoV-2 (Habtewold et al.,
    2022; Li et al., 2022), the results demonstrate the material''s efficacy over
    a 24-h sampling period both in terms of epidemiological concordance and quantitative
    potential. However, it is still unclear what portion of this sampling window is
    most reflective of the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations observed on the passive samplers.
    This is largely due to the poorly characterized uptake and retention kinetics
    of the material and the site-specific characteristics known to govern these dynamics
    (Bivins et al., 2022b). As previously discussed, standard cotton gauze likely
    becomes saturated with PMMoV within 8 h of sampler deployment (Habtewold et al.,
    2022; Li et al., 2022b), however the saturation capacity (equilibrium) and breakthrough
    point for SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been determined. This is largely due to confounded
    results by the accumulation of inhibitors and the inability to characterize potential
    viral exchanges and losses when samplers are deployed in-situ (Habtewold et al.,
    2022; Li et al., 2022b). Other investigations have highlighted the utility of
    electronegative membrane filters in passive sampling for SARS-CoV-2, citing linear
    uptake of multiple genetic targets of interest in excess of 24 h (Habtewold et
    al., 2022; Li et al., 2022b). Such a material would provide the benefit of time-integrated
    sampling which can be used to make inferences about the population under surveillance
    and improve confidence in the sampling window. As the demand for WBS programs
    for SARS-CoV-2 begin to wind down, research should continue to characterize the
    equilibria kinetics of these materials to better interpret passive sampling data
    in future applications. 4. Conclusions This investigation demonstrated the ability
    for passive sampling to act as a critical public health surveillance tool to support
    institution-level decision-making. The two-tiered sampling network proved extremely
    useful in minimizing time and resource usage without compromising the number of
    individuals under surveillance. It also enabled same-day analysis and reporting
    which was critical for stakeholders involved in the public health response. Most
    importantly, the tiered model was effective in isolating the origin of positive
    SARS-CoV-2 signals when COVID-19 prevalence in the campus community was low. This
    enabled decision makers to implement targeted communication-based public health
    measures that would have significantly reduced clinical testing needs had a mandatory
    program been in place. While the approach to WBS must remain site and context-specific,
    the results demonstrates that a tiered design may be most useful in resource-limited
    settings and especially when clinical testing is not available. The early detection
    potential of passive sampling was also realized in Fall 2021 when a single pre-symptomatic
    case was detected, leading to the prompt isolation of the student to prevent transmission.
    In Winter 2022 when COVID-19 burden was high, the tiered approach needed to be
    modified to maximize data actionability and temporally monitor trends in SARS-CoV-2.
    This provided decision-makers with an additional layer of evidence to support
    the public health restrictions. Beyond building-scale applications, passive sampling
    trends on campus in Winter 2022 closely mirrored regional pandemic dynamics and
    was significantly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the local municipal
    wastewater treatment plant. Wastewater surveillance filled a critical gap in the
    return to campus as an independent, holistic means to track the emergence of SARS-CoV-2
    on the University campus. The WBS program was also insulated from many of the
    biases involved in clinical testing including test-seeking behaviours, student
    participation, and changes in test eligibility. Applying this research advances
    our knowledge in the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater
    and validates the ability of passive sampling data to produce actionable data
    related to human health. Further advancing these methodologies can be applied
    to detect a variety of genetic targets and will be an essential component to pandemic
    and healthcare preparedness in the future. Funding sources This research was supported

  description: Water management plays an essential role in creating intelligent and
    sustainable cities. Low flow in the pipeline due to pipe leakage lets germs and
    viruses from the environment into the drinking water system. The major cause of
    avoidable diseases is water contamination in pipes. The pipeline needs a better
    web-based water monitoring system to keep drinking water from getting contaminated.
    Hence, this paper proposed a webserver-based pipeline water monitoring system.
    The IoT platform uses a webserver to monitor water quality in real-time. IoT collects
    and tracks data wirelessly. It improved lifestyle control, especially smart-device
    communication. This paper aims to develop a system to alert authorities, enhance
    web-based water monitoring systems, and detect water quality and pipe flow using
    sensors. Flow, pH, temperature, and turbidity sensors are used in this project.
    pH, temperature, and turbidity sensor ranges meet WHO guidelines. Data prints
    on LCD and webserver. The parameters will be graphs, and it will continuously
    output ten pieces of data. Arduino to NodeMCU data transmission takes about seven
    milliseconds. If water quality is low, the buzzer and red LED will activate. Green
    LED lights up if the water is good. This proposed project may be employed in a
    variety of industries. Explored are the larger implications of Smart Water Quality
    Monitoring Systems on urban sustainability, noting their potential to enhance
    public health, ensure equitable water distribution and conserve scarce water resources.
    Furthermore, IoT-based solutions hold great promise in revolutionising water management
    practices as part of sustainable smart cities development strategies.

    into the drinking water system. The major cause of avoidable diseases is water
    contamination in pipes. The pipeline needs a better web-based water monitoring
    system to keep drinking water from getting contaminated. Hence, this paper proposed
    a webserver-based pipeline water monitoring system. The IoT platform uses a webserver
    to monitor water quality in real-time. IoT collects and tracks data wirelessly.
    It improved lifestyle control, especially smart-device communication. This paper
    aims to develop a system to alert authorities, enhance web-based water monitoring
    systems, and detect water quality and pipe flow using sensors. Flow, pH, temperature,
    and turbidity sensors are used in this project. pH, temperature, and turbidity
    sensor ranges meet WHO guidelines. Data prints on LCD and webserver. The parameters
    will be graphs, and it will continuously output ten pieces of data. Arduino to
    NodeMCU data transmission takes about seven milliseconds. If water quality is
    low, the buzzer and red LED will activate. Green LED lights up if the water is
    good. This proposed project may be employed in a variety of industries. Explored
    are the larger implications of Smart Water Quality Monitoring Systems on urban
    sustainability, noting their potential to enhance public health, ensure equitable
    water distribution and conserve scarce water resources. Furthermore, IoT-based
    solutions hold great promise in revolutionising water management practices as
    part of sustainable smart cities development strategies. Keywords Drinking water

    Contamination of water in pipes is a major issue all around the world. On a worldwide
    basis, at least two billion people use face-contaminated drinking water. Individuals
    are exposed to preventable health risks as a result of inadequately maintained
    water and sanitation systems [1]. Numerous consumers complain about the odor and
    flavor of drinking water, regardless of the fact that an unpleasant odor or taste
    does not often signify dangerous water. Many naturally occurring or purposeful
    errors taint raw water, generating odor concerns in water treatment systems [2].
    The author of [3] highlighted that water contamination has become a huge problem
    that threatens people''s daily lives as industry and agriculture have grown; the
    degree of contamination has been so high, particularly in developing countries,
    that it has created a severe risk to public and ecosystem health in some locations.
    According to the Water Environment Partnership in Asia (WEPA), the Water Quality
    Index (WQI) of drinking water in Malaysia ranges from 51.9 to 76.5 [4]. Water
    surveillance serves as an early warning method for catastrophe management [5].
    The author [6] stated that if a proper warning system is not in place, the corrective
    steps may be delayed. As a result, operators may take inappropriate actions. Traditional
    water contamination monitoring techniques have significant limitations, including
    high labor and material costs, limited sampling, and long analysis [7]. To ensure
    that drinking water does not get contaminated, the pipeline requires a better
    web-based water monitoring system. Water contamination monitoring can assist in
    ensuring a consistent supply of clean drinking water. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    is used in most current water contamination monitoring systems because it can
    do real-time analysis and inform authorities through SMS, and cloud storage. The
    requirement of a real-time response and monitoring system should be evaluated
    on a case-by-case basis by water utilities and management areas depending on the
    needs of each water treatment company and ecological agency. The water industry
    employs the online monitoring system as early noticing notification systems at
    all phases such as intake protection, water treatment, and distribution systems
    [8]. A wireless data communication system is flexible and easy to move, while
    a hard-wired system takes a lot of time and money to set up and maintain [9].
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has greatly simplified and streamlined the controllability
    of a person''s lifestyle, especially in terms of communication methods between
    smart gadgets [10]. Pipeline water monitoring systems have been the focus of several
    studies since this is a contemporary concern. The author [6] proposed a deep learning-based
    output that aids a water quality alert system for reverse osmosis facilities.
    The sensors that are used in this project are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS),
    oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), and electric conductivity (EC). The sensors
    (pH, TDS, ORP, and EC) are wired to the Arduino, which serves as the main controller.
    This primary controller accepts the sensor signals and transfers them to the computer
    for analysis. The LCD is used to show the sensor data that has been collected.
    This project is extremely costly, and the system''s setup is quite difficult.
    LSTM-CNN types may not be able to reliably forecast grades when analyzing water
    based on quality discrepancies unless the water quality base is correctly separated
    into classes. Author [11] introduced a WSN based on the design of the rural drinking
    water source monitoring system. This project uses a solar panel as a source of
    power supply, a keypad that can control the LCD, and an SD card for backup purposes.
    Water quality monitoring, soil monitoring node, node, routing node, and gateway
    server are the five aspects of the system. The gateway acts as a command-and-control
    center for monitoring water quality and the pH of soil. It consists of a processor
    module, a sensor module, a GPRS module, a power supply module, and a solar charging
    module. The cost of this project is expensive, and it is not suitable for unpracticed
    users to use. The solar panel is unsuitable for this project because it must be
    positioned outside of the manhole, which implies that if it is installed on top
    of the manhole, it will be walked on by others. In [12] presented real-time water
    quality monitoring using the Internet of Things in SCADA. The system includes
    three parts: a sensor unit with several types of sensors, a transmitting unit
    with an Arduino Uno microcontroller for data processing, and a receiving unit
    with a GSM modem for Internet connectivity. The web server then shows the data
    and status of water contamination. SCADA may control the GSM module to deliver
    data to the monitoring center. Data is simultaneously delivered to mobile phones,
    allowing for speedy decisions. The sensor data will also show on the water treatment
    plant''s LCD panel. The absence of a pH sensor, which is critical for measuring
    water quality, is a flaw in this system. It simply has a temperature sensor and
    a color sensor, so it can''t tell exactly how acidic or alkaline the water is.
    Feature [13] is about an IoT-based water quality monitoring system. The results
    may be viewed in the Blynk app, which is available for both Android and iOS. The
    author installed the Blynk app in its Android version for this project. When the
    system powers up, DC power is delivered to the kit, Arduino, and WIFI. The parameters''
    findings are shown on the LCD panel. The software included with the hotspot gives
    the accurate figure displayed on the kit''s LCD display. Therefore, when the kit
    is placed in a waterbody with WIFI, the user may check its real-time value on
    their Android phone from anywhere at any time. App features such as maps need
    a purchase before they can be accessed in the Blynk app. The previous research
    [14] suggested real-time monitoring and contamination detection in the drinking
    water distribution system. Turbidity, Oxidation Reduction Potential, Temperature,
    Electrical Conductivity, and pH, which are the five aspects to examine, have been
    chosen to be monitored. The author designed a specialized PIC-based microsystem
    for each of the parameters. With the onboard LEDs switched off and the RF Xbee
    transceiver module giving water quality data every five seconds, the total power
    consumption of the core measurement sensor node is around 50 mA at 5 V operational
    voltage. The software platform provides real-time measurement charts of monitored
    parameters, real-time water quality evaluation, and sensor calibration instructions
    via a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Using Pachube scripts, the user may set
    different thresholds for sending notifications by SMS or email. WSN is only suitable
    for low-speed communication and cannot be used for high-speed communication. In
    the previous research, there were several downsides, including the fact that it
    takes time to train new employees to operate the system and that some of the proposed
    projects are rather costly. This paper will talk about the details of Webserver''s
    design, which helps to track the quality of water in real-time. This system can
    monitor different things about water by using a different type of sensors. Sensor
    data is sent wirelessly to a web server through Wi-Fi. The purpose of employing
    a webserver is to link several devices and sensors across a particular network
    and obtain real-time data from the sensor so that the data can be reconstructed,
    assessed, and used to offer pertinent information. The objectives of this research
    are to make a system for monitoring contamination that can use a buzzer to notify
    laborers and to enhance a web-based system for monitoring water. In addition,
    this study suggested using a pH sensor, a temperature sensor, a turbidity sensor,
    and a flow sensor to detect contaminated water and water flow in a pipeline. The
    interface is composed of a microcontroller. In this project, a webserver acts
    as the Internet of Things platform. The parameters will be printed as a line graph
    by the web server. Checking water quality at a workplace when users are not there
    is possible thanks to this feature. Additional web server functions are free of
    charge. This system is simple to use and reasonably priced. 2 Materials and Methods
    The design of this project has been split into two parts: the layout of the water
    monitoring system and the web server architecture. The whole system is controlled
    by Arduino Mega and NodeMCU. The software used by this system is an HTML-coded
    webserver. The project''s specifics are shown below. 2.1 The Layout of the Water
    Monitoring System The block diagram of this system is illustrated in Fig. 1. The
    Arduino Mega and the NodeMCU are the microcontrollers used in this system. NodeMCU
    was implemented as a Wi-Fi client station linked to a local access point AP (server).
    This system is equipped with four sensors: a flow sensor, a pH sensor, a temperature
    sensor, and a turbidity sensor. They will assess the water quality in the pipeline.
    The data about the parameters will be shown on the LCD and on the IoT platform,
    which is a Webserver where the user can check the quality of the water. On the
    webserver, the parameter data will be shown in the form of a line graph. Fig.
    1 The suggested system is depicted as a block diagram Full size image Figure 2
    illustrates the circuit design for this system. The Arduino Mega requires 5 V,
    the NodeMCU requires 3.3 V and 5 V, and the water pump requires 12 V. A 20.3–22
    V power source is required for the entire system. This system is started with
    water being pumped from the water tank into the pipeline. The Arduino Mega is
    connected to four sensors, two LEDs, LCD, a buzzer, and NodeMCU. The flow sensor
    determines if there is any leakage in the pipeline. If there is a leak in the
    pipeline, it is extremely harmful because germs or contaminants from the environment
    can quickly enter the water. Low and negative pressure events have the potential
    to result in contaminant intrusion [15]. The pH sensor measures the pH value of
    the water, and the turbidity sensor analyzes the water''s transparency. Drinking
    very acidic or alkaline water, as well as murky or opaque water, is risky because
    it may contain toxic compounds. The temperature sensor determines the water temperature.
    If the water temperature is too low, it signifies the water in the pipeline has
    frozen. Because it takes time to defrost the water in the pipeline, this will
    result in unannounced water cutbacks. When the water temperature is too high,
    the pipe will burst. This is because the pressure within and outside the pipeline
    differs. Fig. 2 Circuit diagram of water monitoring system Full size image The
    LEDs are used as indicators. Whenever the readings go outside of the threshold,
    a red LED and a buzzer is activated. An illuminated green LED signifies that the
    current readings are within the predetermined ranges. The data from the sensor
    will be processed by the Arduino Mega and automatically transmitted to NodeMCU.
    When the Wi-Fi module NodeMCU gets the data, it sends it over Wi-Fi to the IoT
    platform. The output of the sensor may be viewed on the webserver as well as on
    an LCD. The two white LEDs are used to illuminate the pipe so the turbidity sensor
    can determine the water''s clarity. 2.2 Webserver Architecture HyperText Markup
    Language (HTML) code is used to create the webserver, while the Arduino Mega and
    NodeMCU are programmed in C. The Arduino IDE and Microsoft Visual Studio code
    are used jointly to merge and upload to NodeMCU. For programming the Arduino Mega
    and NodeMCU, the Arduino IDE is utilized, while Microsoft Visual Studio is used
    to create the webserver. Figure 3 presents an overview of the coding flowchart.
    Fig. 3 NodeMCU’s and webserver’s flow chart Full size image The Arduino Mega and
    the NodeMCU are linked to one another; the Arduino Mega is responsible for gathering
    the data from each sensor and sending it to the NodeMCU, while the NodeMCU is
    responsible for receiving the data from the Arduino Mega. When the NodeMCU board
    is powered up, it automatically connects to the Wi-Fi network that was registered
    using the Service Set Identifier (SSID) and password. If the NodeMCU is not connected
    to Wi-Fi, the Arduino IDE''s serial monitor will display dots (.); this will repeat
    until the NodeMCU is connected to Wi-Fi. The IP address of the webserver will
    be printed once NodeMCU connects to the Wi-Fi network. When the user connects
    to the web server, the HTML folder will be fetched and integrated with the NodeMCU
    code file. Each sensor''s data is saved on the NodeMCU. The server will get the
    information from NodeMCU and post it to the web server. The data is displayed
    in the form of a line graph, and it will show ten pieces of data at once and will
    continue to update, which means that the initial data will be replaced with the
    new data from the sensor. The serial monitor will report “Client Connect” if the
    user is still browsing the web server. The NodeMCU''s data will be downloaded
    by the webserver and updated as needed. When the user disconnects from the webserver,
    the webserver''s program will stop, but the Arduino Mega and NodeMCU will continue
    to transmit and receive data. Figures 4a–c depict the source code of the webserver.
    The programming for the graph will use ten arrays for each sensor and the time
    to draw ten data points at the same time for each sensor on the web server. The
    array assignment coding is seen in Fig. 4a. Figure 4b code is used to allocate
    graph variables on the webserver. It has given the variable a name; the variable''s
    name in this coding is “data3.” The x-axis of the coding is represented by the
    letter x, while the y-axis is represented by the letter y. The x-axis of the graph
    represents time, while the y-axis represents sensor data. This project utilizes
    a scatter plot as its graph. A variable element is used to provide a title to
    a graph, and it is also given a name, “layout.” The “b” that appears in the front
    and back of the title''s name indicates bold lettering. As seen in Fig. 4c, “Plotly,
    newPlot (‘myDiv’, data, layout)” is used to plot the graph on the webserver. Fig.
    4 The coding of the system: a assign ten data points to be printed, b add variables
    to each axis and the title of each graph, and c code to plot the graph Full size
    image 3 Results and Discussions This part will focus on gathering water quality
    data for one week and displaying the findings on a webserver and LCD. The effectiveness
    of the water grid system''s flow contamination monitoring was confirmed by an
    evaluation of the system. The quality of water samples was monitored for one week
    and graphed. The water quality index was used to compare the water quality, as
    indicated in Table 1. Safe drinking water should have a pH range of 6.5–8.5, a
    temperature range of 7–44 °C, and a turbidity range of 0 to 5 NTU. Figures 5,
    6, 7 and 8 show the LCD and webserver findings. Flow sensor, pH sensor, temperature
    sensor, and turbidity sensor readings will be shown. This section will concentrate
    on the water quality in various states. The flow rate indication of the LCD and
    webserver is visualized in Fig. 5a–d. The flow rate in this system is stated in
    liters per second. Table 1 Range of water quality [6, 14] Full size table Fig.
    5 Flow rate displayed on LCD and webserver: a and b low flow rate; c and d normal
    flow rate Full size image In terms of water flow rate, the LCD will only print
    two labels: “low flow rate” or “normal flow rate.” Low flow rates are anything
    less than 0.5 L per second. A fracture in the pipe or a shortage of water in the
    water tank might be the reason for the low flow rate. The problem in this circumstance
    was a lack of water in the water tank. Figure 5a, b show that the flow rate is
    low. This project''s usual flow rate is roughly 0.5 L per second, which is shown
    in Figs. 5c, d. Figure 6a–f shows the pH value shown on the LCD and the webserver.
    Under a pH situation, the LCD will only show three words: acidic high, water is
    safe, and alkaline high. These two images show how acidic the water was: Fig.
    6a, b. This is because the water had been contaminated with rotten milk. Fig.
    6 The pH value is shown on both the Webserver and the LCD: a and b high acidic;
    c and d safe drinking water; e and f high alkaline Full size image Water with
    a pH of less than 7 is considered acidic, however, if the pH of the water is about
    6.5, the LCD will not display “Acidic High.” This is because the pH range of safe
    water is between 6.5 and 8.5. Figure 6c, d show the pH value of the water, which
    is about 7.21, which is deemed safe water because it is within the range. If the
    pH of water is more than 8.5, the water is extremely alkaline. Figure 6e, f show
    the results of high alkalinity. This is due to its combination with a very alkaline
    chemical. The temperature of the water can be seen on the LCD as well as the webserver
    is shown in Fig. 7a–d. With this system, the temperature is measured in Celsius.
    The LCD will only print three phrases when it comes to temperature: low temperature,
    normal temperature, and high temperature. When the water temperature falls below
    seven degrees Celsius, the LCD will show “Temp low.” The temperature of water
    in Figs. 7a, b is 28.62 °C, which is considered a normal temperature. The normal
    temperature of the water is seven to forty-four degrees Celsius. It is regarded
    as a high temperature if the water temperature is greater than forty-four degrees
    Celsius. The water temperature is 45.38 °C, as shown in Fig. 7c, d. This is because
    hot water was added to the tap water. Fig. 7 Water temperature indicated on LCD
    and webserver: a and b normal temperature; c and d high temperature Full size
    image Figure 8a–d depicts the turbidity of water as viewed on the LCD and webserver.
    This method measures turbidity in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). The LCD
    simply displays two terms about turbidity: “water very clear” and “water dirty.”
    Turbidity levels in clear water should range from zero to five NTU. If the water
    turbidity is between zero and five NTU, the LCD will display “water very clear.”
    Figure 8a, b indicate that the turbidity of the water is zero NTU, indicating
    that it is exceptionally clean and safe to use. If the turbidity of the water
    exceeds five NTU, it is considered hazardous to use and unclean. The LCD will
    display the phrase “water dirty.” Figure 8c, d demonstrate that the turbidity
    of the water is fifty-one NTU. This is related to the reasons that the water was
    blended with chocolate milk. Fig. 8 Transparency of water illustrated in both
    LCD and webserver: a and b clear water; c and d dirty water Full size image The
    graph on the webserver will show ten pieces of data at once and it will continually
    update. That is to say, the initial data will be replaced with the sensor''s updated
    data. Every one to two milliseconds, the data on the web server will be updated.
    The data transfer time from Arduino to NodeMCU is expected to be around seven
    milliseconds, and the webserver will be updated every four to five seconds with
    fresh data from Arduino. The pH, temperature, and turbidity of the tap water were
    measured for one week, and the findings of Fig. 9a–c reveal that the water in
    Malaysia is safe to consume. Over the course of one week, the pH of the tap water
    fluctuated between larger than 6.5 pH and less than 7.2 pH, as shown in Fig. 9a.
    Figure 9b illustrates that the temperature of water in Malaysia is normally around
    29 °C, but on May 17th, 2022, it was somewhat colder than the previous days, at
    around 28 °C. This occurred as a result of the rain that fell on that day. The
    turbidity of the water was between 0 and 1 NTU in Fig. 9c, implying that it was
    quite clear. Fig. 9 Water quality for one week: a pH, b temperature and c turbidity
    Full size image The proposed system''s final product is shown in Fig. 10a–d. The
    sensors are inserted in the pipeline so that it can detect the quality of the
    water as it flows through it. White LEDs are also inserted in the pipeline; they
    are utilized as a lighting system for the pipeline, allowing the turbidity sensor
    to precisely evaluate the water quality. The buzzer, LCD, red LED, and green LED
    are all mounted on the box''s lid so that the user can see the indicator lights
    and read the parameter values on the LCD. The circuit is housed in a box to keep
    water and other contaminants out of it. Fig. 10 a and b Final circuit setup; c
    and d prototype of water flow contamination in water grid system Full size image
    4 Conclusions Water is essential for human life. Contaminated water can cause
    various avoidable diseases or even cause the death of a young child. A dependable
    monitoring system is critical for the safety of drinking water in pipelines. This
    study describes a real-time water monitoring system that makes use of an IoT system.
    Incorporating a webserver into this system allows the user to check the water
    quality in the pipeline even when they are not physically there. Multiple sensors
    are used and connected to a microcontroller, the Arduino Mega. The Arduino Mega
    is connected to the NodeMCU and it transfers data to the Webserver in real-time.
    The system was successfully designed, constructed, and tested; the sensors and
    Arduino Mega have shown the system''s durability. The implementation of this system
    allows for the reduction of the number of employees on-site, the reduction of
    the frequency of unscheduled water cuts, the improvement of the efficacy of checking
    water quality in the pipeline, and the notification of authorities when the water
    is in an abnormal state. This proposed project is applicable to several industries,
    such as the water, medical, chemical, personal protective equipment (PPE), and
    food and drink (F&D) industries. References World Health Organization: WHO, “Drinking-water,”

  description: Adopting and developing sustainable precision irrigation systems allows
    for improving productivity, reducing water and energy losses in agricultural fields.
    This paper deals with the development and real-time implementation of a smart
    precision irrigation system (SPIS). The proposed system combines two irrigation
    approaches, processed by a feedback fuzzy logic (FL) controller, and long-range
    data transmission and monitoring via the LoRa protocol. The combined approaches
    not only enhance overall performance but also address several limitations commonly
    associated with existing approaches. The proposed system uses the collected data
    from the sensors unit to provide the optimal irrigation decision and communicates
    it with the operator (farmer) via a developed IoT platform. Data from soil moisture,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, and rainfall sensors are processed through
    the FL controller to adjust the irrigation times. The inputs and outputs are fuzzified
    by trapezoidal and triangular membership functions. Mamdani's fuzzy inference
    is used to control the system through a set of linguistic control rules for a
    more accurate decision for each scenario. The field experimentation of the developed
    SPIS in the eastern region of Morocco shows high efficiency and reliability by
    saving water and energy compared to traditional irrigation control. The proposed
    system, with remote data monitoring, promotes better management of irrigation,
    water, and energy consumption, and it is suitable to be mounted with any type
    of irrigation installation in the field, without extensive modifications.

    saving 1. Introduction Agriculture is considered a key issue of national development
    due to the important economic, social, and territorial stakes of this sector (Knox
    et al., 2012). In Morocco, agriculture is the first contributor to the gross domestic
    product (GDP) with a variation of 11 % to 18 %, which is mainly influenced by
    climatic conditions. Moreover, Moroccan agriculture employs nearly half of the
    active population and provides 23 % of the nation''s exports1. In 2022–2023, water
    scarcity in Morocco is considered a major concern as water reserves have been
    reduced by 59 %, which exposes them to spatial and temporal irregularity issues.
    Fig. 1 (a) shows the rainfall deficit percentage and Fig. 1 (b) shows the drought
    index of January 2023 in Moroccan regions2. Given the enormous evolution of irrigated
    agricultural areas that consume huge amounts of water, the unpredictability of
    rainfall may lead to increasing and deepening the problem of water availability
    and the failure to meet the irrigation needs of crops, resulting in rising drought
    areas and a decline in agricultural productivity. One of the factors contributing
    to this is the use of permanent alimentation solenoids to activate irrigation
    systems and low performance irrigation approaches (Avşar et al., 2018, Le et al.,
    2020). These solenoids require a continuous power supply, leading to increased
    energy demands. The reliance on such solenoids is prevalent in various agricultural
    processes, including irrigation systems, crop harvesting machinery, and automated
    greenhouse controls. The constant power requirements of these solenoids contribute
    significantly to the overall energy consumption in the agricultural sector, further
    straining the already limited resources. Addressing this issue and exploring alternative
    energy-efficient solutions could mitigate the environmental impact and reduce
    the sector''s overall energy consumption. Download : Download high-res image (466KB)

    (%), (b) The drought index of January 2023 of Morocco. For the agricultural areas
    of eastern Morocco, irrigation water and energy losses are generally caused by
    two factors: the first factor is the manual control of the pump and valves in
    the pressurised irrigation system. According to Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020,
    Xie et al., 2022, the inefficiency of these irrigation systems extends beyond
    Morocco and has been observed in other regions as well. The studies highlight
    that these traditional irrigation systems, which rely on manual pump activation,
    contribute to significant losses in irrigation water and energy. These findings
    suggest that the low efficiency of such systems is not limited to a specific geographical
    area but is a widespread issue that affects multiple agricultural regions (Kumar
    et al., 2023). In those cases, farmers use their prior knowledge of crop response,
    or by observing leaf stress, to determine the duration of irrigation. This technique
    cannot be relied upon since it does not reflect the actual water needs of the
    plants, which are related to the growth stage and weather conditions (Jaafar et
    al., 2021). On the other hand, the second factor is the losses due to the process
    in which irrigation water is released into the atmosphere as vapor, caused mainly
    by the high temperature and solar irradiance rates. This factor can be solved
    by using drip irrigation methods, but it is also necessary to adopt advanced control
    techniques. The development and design of smart precision irrigation systems and
    mechanisms with the use of IoT technologies for the visualization and monitoring
    of different parameters of agriculture and irrigation is the key solution to managing
    irrigation water resources efficiently and sustainably by delivering the exact
    amount of water required by the crop (Capraro Fuentes et al., 2018). In addition,
    optimizing the energy supplied to operate the various actuators (Qaisar et al.,
    2021, Mellit et al., 2021). Irrigation systems are classified into two categories
    according to their control, open-loop and closed-loop control systems. Open-loop
    control, also called no-feedback control, is a type of controller that generates
    decisions based on the current state, i.e., it has no feedback to determine if
    the assessed input has achieved the desired objective, in our case satisfying
    the crop''s water needs with precision while considering climatic-soil conditions
    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). Therefore, an open-loop irrigation system cannot
    be reliably used to deal with the challenges of precision irrigation. Programmable
    irrigation controller, also called irrigation timers are among the systems based
    on this control technique. The scheduling of the period and duration of the irrigation
    remains constant without knowing the real needs of irrigation in the crop. Closed-loop
    control systems are the most efficient and robust in terms of decision support
    and allow for precision irrigation (Bwambale et al., 2022). The action depends
    on the output provided by the system; the input varies according to the output,
    which produces a more accurate decision. The feedback loop also allows for automatic
    adjustments to be made in real time, which improve the accuracy, stability and
    performance of irrigation decisions. Sensor units are used to provide this feedback
    to the processing unit. According to agriculture experts and scientific research,
    three approaches are distinguished (Abioye et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). The
    first approach is based on the measurement of soil moisture, which indicates the
    amounts of water consumed and absorbed by the crop during a period, and then decides
    on the scheduling of future irrigation times by setting a percentage of soil moisture,
    so the irrigation system works until it reaches the set value of moisture (Soulis
    et al., 2015). An intelligent urban irrigation system is discussed in (Mason et
    al., 2019) aiming at decreasing water use without reducing crop yield. The system
    includes a wireless soil moisture sensor network and controllable valves and tested
    in nine climatic regions of the contiguous United States. Tomatoes are chosen
    due to their sensitivity to water stress. The second approach is to control irrigation
    according to the evolution of the meteorological conditions (Kool et al., 2014).
    The measurement of environmental variables in real time such as: air temperature
    and humidity, solar irradiance and wind speed allows estimating the reference
    evapotranspiration level (ET0) (Chiew et al., 1995), which indicates the water
    losses suffered by the plant and the soil (J. Doorenbos et al., 1976). Weather
    stations or IoT-based sensor networks are used to provide such information. In
    (González-Briones et al., 2018), a monitoring system able to collect various data
    on its environment, by sensing temperature, solar irradiance, pH, humidity, and
    wind speed is presented. The objective of this research is to build virtual organizations
    of agents based on several master and slave nodes that are connected to ensure
    data exchange from sensors while monitoring the crops. The development of a platform
    (IoT) with a fibrous capillary irrigation system based on the climatic demand
    estimated by the weather condition was reported by (Abd Rahman et al., 2019).
    The experiment has been conducted using a Choy sum plant as a test crop in a greenhouse.
    Demand tracking, management of the irrigation system, and the use of weather information
    allowed for near real-time estimation of the crop''s water requirements, which
    also allowed the monitoring of the progress of water consumption by the plants.
    The last approach is the survey of the plant evolution parameters, such crop water
    stress index (CWSI), which determine the water needs of the plant, through the
    measurement of canopy temperature. Most irrigation systems are based on simple
    control techniques and algorithms (Davis, and Dukes, 2010; Singh et al., 2023),
    containing a single input or a threshold value to be set by the operator to decide
    on starting or ending the irrigation. The reliability and efficiency of those
    controls’ techniques are limited and unable to reliably schedule irrigation since
    precision irrigation involves the evaluation and processing of multiple inputs.
    Fuzzy logic (FL) is one of the intelligent control techniques that allow to manipulation
    of multiple input variables while taking account of the output action. So, it
    is more suitable for non-linear systems due to its flexibility in data processing
    and it is very effective for decision-making problems that require precision (Zadeh,
    1999). The operation of fuzzy logic has been thoroughly tested in a diverse and
    challenging field (Yahyaoui et al., 2017). It is structured with three main modules,
    a fuzzification module, an inference engine, and a defuzzification module. Mamdani
    and Sugeno are the two popular approaches in FL (Omomule et al., 2020, Shafaei
    et al., 2017), each with its own distinct characteristics. The key difference
    lies in how they handle the fuzzy rule’s consequences. In Mamdani-FL, the output
    membership function is a fuzzy set representing the degree of membership of the
    output variable. This allows for linguistic descriptions, where the output can
    be interpreted in terms of linguistic terms (Pourjavad et al., 2019). On the other
    hand, Sugeno-FL employs a more mathematical approach, where the output is represented
    as a crisp value or a mathematical function of the input variables. This enables
    precise numerical calculations and facilitates mathematical modelling. The advantage
    of the Mamdani-FL lies in its ability to incorporate linguistic rules and provide
    interpretable outputs. By using linguistic terms, the system''s behaviour becomes
    more understandable and intuitive to humans, making it suitable for applications
    where transparency and explainability are crucial. It allows experts to easily
    define rules using their domain knowledge and linguistic terms, making it a powerful
    tool in decision-making processes (Hamam et al., 2008). Additionally, Mamdani-FL
    supports a wide range of inference methods and can handle complex and nonlinear
    systems effectively. While Sugeno-FL has its own advantages, such as its computational
    efficiency and ability to handle mathematical modelling, the interpretability
    and linguistic-based nature of Mamdani-FL make it a preferred choice in agriculture
    applications (Urbieta Parrazales et al., 2021). A FL-based irrigation controller
    is designed and integrated into a field in India, to perform multi-criteria decision-making,
    this allows to select of the most efficient and adequate irrigation sub-system
    (Yilmaz and Harmancioglu et al., 2010). Another application of FL has been reported
    in (Krishnan et al., 2020). The objective is to automatically control the irrigation
    through the measurement of soil moisture to decide the necessary flow for irrigation.
    Six fuzzy rules have been implemented. DC motor is activated in cases where the
    soil moisture value is between medium and very low values, otherwise the contrary.
    The modelling and simulation of a fuzzy irrigation system have been presented
    in (Mushtaq et al., 2016). The approach is based on the calculation of ET by a
    fuzzy inference system. The input variables are temperature, humidity, wind, and
    solar radiation. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy system
    in accurately determining and compensating the water loss due to ET. Another work
    (Kurniawan et al., 2017) presented the combination of a prediction algorithm and
    fuzzy control. The combination of fertilization and irrigation precisely to reduces
    the amount of irrigation water and the waste of chemical fertilizers. This results
    in further saving and reducing production costs and improving agricultural efficiency.
    In our previous work (Benzaouia et al., 2021) we developed an intelligent irrigation
    system based on FL controller for the automatic watering of agricultural areas
    (Oriental Morocco). The simulation results proved that the irrigation system allows
    to keep the soil moisture measurements higher than the value specified by the
    user and eliminates the under-irrigation risk. In the presented research works,
    the utilization of FL is primarily focused on simple applications. These applications
    involve employing fuzzy sets and membership functions to handle vague or uncertain
    data and make decisions based on fuzzy reasoning. Moreover, a noteworthy aspect
    of these works is the use of minimal control rules, implying that the number of
    rules employed in the fuzzy logic systems is kept to a minimum. In the realm of
    modern field management, it is crucial not only to adopt advanced control systems
    but also to incorporate communication IoT protocols to enable seamless data transmission
    and enhanced control. The integration of IoT offers numerous benefits, including
    real-time data acquisition, remote monitoring, and improved decision-making capabilities.
    Various communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and others,
    can be utilized to establish reliable connections in field management applications.
    Table 1 provides a summary of these technologies and their application for irrigation
    monitoring, outlining their respective ranges and power consumption. The common
    characteristic among these technologies is their low data transmission range.
    However, in the case of large agricultural areas, it becomes necessary to employ
    technologies that can cover vast distances with improved sending capabilities
    which makes them very limited. LoRa technology stands out as one of the promising
    solutions that has proven its effectiveness in various industrial applications
    (Kaur et al., 2022), additionally, in fields such as telemedicine (Ayat et al.,
    2023). It offers several advantages for IoT applications, its long-range capability
    allows for communication over large distances, while its low power consumption
    ensures minimizing energy consumption. The cost-effectiveness of LoRa, coupled
    with its scalability and secure communication features, also makes it suitable
    for large-scale deployments. The flexibility of LoRa enables its use in diverse
    environments, and its open standard promotes interoperability. Table 1. IoT technologies

    smart precision irrigation system with a combined weather-soil approach is proposed
    and designed, to efficiently schedule the irrigation of apple trees in fields
    located in the eastern region of Morocco. Soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar irradiance, and rainfall are the inputs of the FL controller. They are sensed
    through different sensors, and subsequently transmitted to apply the well-designed
    fuzzy rules for irrigation control, while the output is the duration and timing
    of irrigation which depends on the crop requirements in the field. This allows
    for optimizing the soil water content, enhancing plant health and product quality.
    The system also includes a long-range LoRa communication module for wireless transmission
    and a developed IoT platform for visualization and monitoring to enhance the mentioned
    drawbacks of discussed IoT techniques in irrigation. The techno-economic study
    between the proposed system in the literature and the one available on the commercial
    market, proved the reliability of the proposed SPIS to manage the irrigation process
    in a precise and intelligent manner with low-cost installation. This is the first
    research study reported on the design of an intelligent precision irrigation system
    adapted to the eastern climate of Morocco. The main contributions of the paper
    can be summarized as follows: • The design of an automated intelligent irrigation
    controller based on FL inference that evolves in real-time the weather-soil monitoring
    approach to decide the optimal irrigation time and impulse solenoid-valve opening.
    The system is highly efficient and tested in an agricultural field under real
    scenarios. • The development of a real-time visualization and monitoring IoT platform
    for irrigation and field data such as system status, soil moisture, air humidity,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, irrigation time, energy, water consumption,
    etc. • Provide a reliable and efficient irrigation system at a low cost. The article

    irrigation system. Section 3 describes the operating steps of the system. Section
    4 discusses the software and hardware implementation. The experimental performance
    evaluation and the techno-economic study are given in Section 5. Conclusion and
    future improvement are reported in the last Section 6. 2. Design and control of
    the proposed irrigation system The structure of the proposed smart precision irrigation
    system based on an effective strategy that combines both weather and soil approaches
    is given in Fig. 2. It consists of five essential sub-systems: (1) the sensors
    unit, (2) the controller unit, (3) the irrigation unit, (4) the IoT communication
    unit, and finally (5) the power unit. A detailed description of the methodology
    of the development of these subsystems is given in the following sections. Download

    The structure of the smart precision irrigation system. 2.1. Location and specification
    of the study field An agricultural field situated around the eastern region of
    Morocco has been selected to carry out the experimentation of the developed irrigation
    system (See Fig. 3). The location and global positioning are a latitude of 34.811835
    and a longitude of −1.967141 (34°48′42.6″N 1°58′01.7″W). Download : Download high-res

    the field of experimentation. The field is divided into three areas (A), (B) and
    (C). The focus is only on the A and B zones, the irrigation system in the first
    zone (A) is controlled by the proposed smart precision irrigation system and the
    second zone (B) temporised controller is used. Note that the area A and B are
    about 1300 m2 for each and contain about 140 apple trees, with an irrigated surface
    approximately 100 m2. The experiment region exhibits a unique semi-arid climate
    influenced by its geographical location and topography. Situated in the eastern
    part of the country, this region experiences distinct climatic conditions that
    have significant implications for agriculture and socio-economic activities. The
    climate can be classified as Mediterranean with semi-arid characteristics. It
    is characterized by hot and dry summers with limited rainfall and mild, wet winters.
    The region is known for its high temperatures during the summer months, often
    exceeding 40 °C (104°F). Additionally, the area experiences high ET rates due
    to the combination of high temperatures and limited rainfall, resulting in the
    loss of water from both the soil and vegetation. Precipitation is moderate, with
    most rainfall occurring between October and April. However, there is considerable
    variability in precipitation patterns, leading to occasional drought conditions.
    The unique semi-arid climate of the region plays a crucial role in shaping agricultural
    practices, water resource management, and overall livelihoods in the area. 2.2.
    Sensors unit The sensors unit consists of specific field sensors for soil moisture
    measurement, and climatic sensors for measuring ambient temperature, relative
    air humidity, solar irradiance, and rainfall. All the used sensors are calibrated
    to prevent any drift that could be generated during their operation. 2.2.1. Soil
    moisture sensing Soil moisture information is extremely important for the control
    and scheduling of irrigation periods. It allows to identify the characteristics
    of diffusion or storage of water in a defined soil, which is usually influenced
    by its composition and texture (sandy, clayey and silty soil). There are two main
    techniques for determining soil moisture, the direct method and the indirect method.
    The direct method, known as gravimetric, consists of drying a soil sample and
    then determining the weight of the water contained in the sample. This method
    is not adapted to real-time applications and remains expensive. Indirect methods
    consist in measuring the electrical conductivity or the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil and then converted to volumetric soil water content. For this application,
    a UM-MS-10 sensor is selected. This sensor is dedicated to precision irrigation
    applications while offering very accurate measurements, and a high sensitivity
    to amounts of water applied to the soil with a low error range (about ± 2 % and
    ± 4 % for a water content between 0 and 53 % and 53–100 % respectively), in addition
    to the possibility of calibration for specific soils. Determining the number of
    soil moisture sensors is based on several factors, including the size and nature
    of the area being monitored, the type of crops, the depth of the root zone, the
    soil properties, and the way that the area is exposed to weather variations. In
    our research focused on apple trees, a case study to examine soil moisture levels
    in zone A has been conducted firstly. Multiple sensors have been strategically
    placed at different locations within the zone to capture comprehensive data. The
    analysis revealed consistently low measurement errors, attributable to the soil''s
    homogeneity and absence of geographical irregularities. Consequently, a single
    sensor has been selected and positioned at a depth of 0.3 m. This depth is justified
    based on the relevant findings reported in our previous research (Benzaouia et
    al., 2021). To ensure the generalizability of our results across the entire field,
    further investigations are planned. These subsequent examinations will involve
    subdividing the field into smaller zones, allowing for the optimization of sensor
    placement, and determining the minimum number of sensors required for accurate
    soil moisture assessments. This approach enhances the scientific rigor of the
    study and provides valuable insights into the spatial variability of soil moisture.
    2.2.2. Ambient temperature sensing As temperatures increase toward limit values,
    the plants'' ET rates increase and the water balance of the soil decreases, therefore
    the scheduling of irrigation according to temperature variations is also crucial.
    The DHT-11 sensor is a reliable sensor for measuring ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, requiring no external calibration, and able to measure temperatures
    from −40 to + 125 °C with an accuracy of ± 0.5 °C and relative humidity ranges
    from 0 to 100 % with an accuracy of ± 2 %. 2.2.3. Solar irradiance sensing Solar
    irradiance is a source of energy that comes from a thermal process, which also
    contributes to the evaporation process. So, it is important to schedule irrigation
    during a period of minimal solar irradiance. Several devices are available to
    measure and quantify the intensity of solar irradiance, including pyrometer, LDR,
    photoristor and others. However, most of them are expensive and usually require
    an adapter to exploit the collected data. For economic and technical reasons,
    a BH1750 sensor has been selected to estimate solar irradiance intensity. It allows
    a measurement range from 1 lx to 100.000 lx, with an error of ± 3 % for low and
    high ranges, additionally to its robustness against IR radiation (Very small effect
    of IR radiation). 2.2.4. Rainfall sensing To save the water and energy consumption
    of the proposed irrigation system in the agricultural field in case of precipitation,
    a rain sensor or rain switch is integrated, allowing the detection of rainfall.
    Hence, if the feedback received from the sensor indicates the availability of
    high rates of rainfall, the system is turned off and the irrigation periods are
    rescheduled by referring to fuzzy logic rules. 2.3. Controller unit The controller
    is held responsible for intelligent data processing for irrigation scheduling,
    and the generation of the output control signal, namely the duration, time, and
    period of irrigation unit opening and activation which is decided by FL programmed
    and implemented in ATmega2560 microcontroller. In addition, this unit is responsible
    for receiving and transmitting time-series data from the sensor’s unit to the
    developed visualization and monitoring platform. 2.3.1. Mathematical modeling
    The proposed FL controller is composed of three key components, namely the fuzzification
    module, the inference engine, and the defuzzification module, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. The system operates by developing a universe of discourse ( ) that entails
    a membership function and defining an interval of ( ) represented by . In this
    context, is characterized as a membership function that comprises a set of ordered
    pairs of elements and the probability that e belongs to ( ), as described by Pazouki
    et al., 2021. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Flow-chart of FL inference-based irrigation controller. The system
    requires three input parameters, namely soil moisture (SM), temperature (T), and
    solar irradiance (SR). Each of these parameters comprises three membership functions
    that are identified by a fuzzy subset of ( ). Specifically, variable represents
    soil moisture, variable represents temperature, and variable represents solar
    irradiance. The degree to which a given value of belongs to variables , , and
    is expressed by the membership functions , and . Equations (2), (3) respectively
    provide the fuzzy intersection and union set for the three variables. The purpose
    of the fuzzification step is to transform a digital input obtained from a sensor
    into a linguistic variable by means of membership functions. A membership function
    can be defined as a function that specifies the degree of membership of a numerical
    input to a linguistic variable. In this context, the membership function employed
    regulates a variety of parameters, including fluctuations in soil moisture, temperature,
    and solar irradiance. The proposed irrigation system commonly employs triangular
    and trapezoidal membership functions to make appropriate decisions. Equations
    (4), (5) depict the triangular and trapezoidal shapes, respectively, for a three-value
    fuzzification system. Fig. 5 illustrates the membership functions for both the
    inputs and outputs of the FL controller. (2) (3) (4) (5) Download : Download high-res
    image (340KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Inputs and output membership
    functions. The fuzzy inference process involves the interpretation of input values
    gathered from sensors, which are then utilized to determine output values based
    on sets of rules. To accomplish this, a set of if-then rules has been formulated
    to operate with the membership functions of each input. The literature describes
    two types of fuzzy inference systems that can be implemented: Mamdani type and
    Sugano type. The Mamdani type has been selected for the proposed irrigation system
    because it is well-suited for expert system applications. In each given scenario,
    the output of the controller is represented by the irrigation duration, time and
    periods which varies in accordance with the fuzzy rules grouped in Table 2, Table
    3, and Table 4. Table 2. Rules of the output (duration of irrigation in min) for
    dry soil. Temperature (°C) Solar irradiance (%) Dark Medium Light Cold Very Long

    Zero In the process of implementing an intelligent irrigation strategy, defuzzification
    serves as the final step. After fuzzification, the rules are applied to generate
    a fuzzy output which is subsequently transformed into a scalar quantity. The selection
    of the centroid defuzzification method has been based on its precision in producing
    reliable outputs. Equation (6) expresses the defuzzified output ( ). (6) 2.3.2.
    Simulation and validation of proposed system A preliminary simulation of the irrigation
    system has been carried out using the FL toolbox available in the Matlab/Simulink
    environment in order to build the fuzzy rules for each irrigation scenario and
    verify the system responses. The fuzzy rules are based on Mamdani''s “if-then”
    conditions. The 3D graphical representation of the temperature and soil moisture
    variables as a function of the irrigation time is given in Fig. 6. It is clear
    that the system allows the irrigation process with variable duration according
    to the parameters of the plants, the soil, and the weather conditions. Download

    3D Fuzzy logic graph of rules. 2.4. Irrigation unit The irrigation unit is composed
    of an impulse solenoid and diaphragm valve, distribution pipes, and emitters.
    The solenoid is controlled through the output signal provided by the controller
    unit. The opening time and duration can be adjusted according to the decision
    of the FL controller and vary depending on the conditions affecting the irrigation.
    The efficiency of the system is considered. For this purpose, a flow meter is
    located next to the valve to measure the water consumption in the distribution
    line. Moreover, the overall energy consumed during the operation under the adopted
    irrigation strategy is calculated from the installed voltage and current sensors.
    The obtained values are used to calculate the energy consumed per time unit. 2.5.
    LoRa based IoT communication unit In order to closely monitor the status of the
    irrigation system and to visualize the evolution of the parameters related to
    precision irrigation to fulfil the customer''s display requirements, ten parameters
    are displayed in a developed platform (See Fig. 7). This platform allows to follow
    in real-time the evolution of each parameter as well as the implementation of
    alerts (e-mail, telegram, and SMS) in case of failure (problems at the level of
    the sensors, condition on the irrigation parameters), moreover the transversal
    communication between the hardware and software part. The main page that is displayed
    contains an indication of the status of the system (on/off), the air temperature,
    the soil moisture, the soil temperature, the electrical conductivity, and the
    salinity. The irrigation duration provided by the FL controller, the evolution
    of the solar irradiance (the parameter is displayed as a percentage just to simplify
    the display) during each day is also displayed, and finally, the water flow rate
    distributed to the plant for each irrigation decision. An example of visualization

    frameworks, and a hardware environment containing boards with microcontrollers
    for processing as well as different communication shields for sending and receiving
    data, Fig. 9 represents the conception of each environment. Django is chosen given
    the multiple advantages that it presents, namely the robust development language
    Python, the ability to run with any client-side infrastructure, return data in
    any format namely HTML, RSS, JSON, XML, and provides robust security features
    that avoid common security errors (Srivastava et al., 2021). MySQL database is
    chosen as a manager owing to its many advantages in terms of rapidity, and ability
    to perform various operations using interfaces written in C, C++, Python, Java
    and PHP (Rao et al., 2014). The configuration of the manager is done at the Django
    framework level. Download : Download high-res image (247KB) Download : Download

    communication between the HTTP client and the platform is done through an API,
    which allows to interface and translate the requests received by the HTTP client
    to the server and return a response to the clients (when the Rest-API has what
    it needs, it sends back a response to the clients, typically be in JSON or XML
    format) (Ong et al., 2015). ATmega2560 programming is based on the Processing
    IDE and programmed with Arduino IDE software. The code is called a sketch and
    the assembly of several for functionalities are called libraries, which simplifies
    the user''s programming tasks by hiding the code in the libraries as a “black
    box”. The ATmega2560 can be programmed within the limits of 256 Kb of Flash memory
    with a clock rate of 16 MHz, moreover in this application of the smart precision
    irrigation system, it is autonomously working without being connected to an interface
    (computer) for control exchange. 2.6. Power unit The power consumption of the
    controller and sensor units, which represent a node in the proposed SPIS, is presented
    in Table 5. Specifically, the sensor unit consumes approximately 1.3 mA. Current
    investigations are being conducted to test the effectiveness of using small batteries
    to power this node. Based on initial estimations, two batteries of 6600 mAh associated
    in parallel could potentially provide a supply duration of around 1 year. This
    allows for reliable data collection with long-range capabilities and the ability
    to record hourly data. Table 5. Current consumption of the proposed system. Sensor

    the primary goal is to gather precise and comprehensive data. To achieve this,
    an integrated system that relies on a PV panel for power supply coupled with batteries.
    3. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system The operating steps of the
    proposed system are shown in Fig. 10. In the first step, the precipitation status
    is checked, if the sensor indicates that availability, the system is turned off,
    otherwise the system proceeds to the next step of sensing the values received
    by the sensor unit hourly (ambient temperature, solar irradiation and soil moisture).
    The time and duration of irrigation is given after applying the appropriately
    designed fuzzy rules by reasoning according to the information from these sensors.

    Fig. 10. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system. In this study, the
    information generated by the soil moisture sensor indicates the requirement for
    irrigation. According to the expert of agriculture, the optimal threshold of soil
    moisture for apple tree’s is 30 %. Therefore, the measurement of this variable
    is taken into account in this study. For each situation and variation of the input
    variables of the FL controller, the result is determined by the rules summarized
    in tables 2,3 and 4. Some real scenarios examples are given as follow: • If the
    soil is wet, i.e. exceeds 30 %, and regardless of the values of solar irradiance
    and ambient temperature, the irrigation decision is given by a duration equal
    to zero. • If the soil moisture equals 30 %, and regardless the value of all input
    variables, the system remains turned off, with a null irrigation duration decision.
    • If the soil contains an average soil moisture value, with an average temperature
    and solar irradiance, then the irrigation duration is set to very short duration.
    • If the soil is dry with a high temperature and a minimum solar irradiance, the
    duration is set to zero, since the high temperatures generate an increase in evaporation
    and water loses. In the area where the experiment is conducted, the process of
    water aspiration through the soil has been estimated at 60 min. This duration
    is based on experimental measurements for a well-known soil constitution. The
    system is programmed to restart the same sequences, which justifies the frequency
    of sending data to the platform. 4. Software and hardware implementation The FL
    controller has been implemented in real-time through a code in C language adapted
    with ATmega2560 microcontroller, the structure of the code is given as follows:
    firstly, a declaration of the libraries to be used, namely that of the FL, the
    sensors used, the actuators (relay) that is used to control the impulse solenoid
    and the display. After acquiring the data, the processing by fuzzy controllers
    begins. The fuzzy logic code is devised in three parts, first is the design of
    the membership functions by using equations (4), (5) on each of the three inputs
    (soil moisture, ambient temperature, and solar irradiance) and defining the variation
    ranges. Secondly the design of the fuzzy rules, in our case 27 rules are implemented.
    The last part is the defuzzification, which consists in assigning the results
    to the output in the form of linguistic variable to be exploited afterwards. The
    output being the duration and the time of irrigation, this value is converted
    into control signal form to activate the relay that enables to activate the electro
    valve and pump to start the irrigation process. The controller is programmed to
    repeat the same sequences every hour, the program performs and schedule automatically
    the duration and times of irrigation periods without any human intervention. The
    communication between the control unit (ATmega2560), the sensors unit, the irrigation
    unit and the IoT platform is realized via the ESP32 development board by sending
    instructions. The SPIS prototype is shown in Fig. 11, and the irrigation unit
    is shown in Fig. 12. The control unit, which provides decisions, and the sensor
    unit are assembled in a case with an IP67 degree of protection. After receiving
    the decision from the FL controller, an electric control signal is sent back to
    the solenoid. It should be noted that the solenoid is impulse driven, i.e., for
    switching on and off states, it is sufficient to send only one impulse for micro-seconds.
    The operation of the solenoid according to the time decided by the proposed fuzzy
    controller, operates on the internal membrane of the valve. The component list
    used in its conception is summarized in Table 6. Download : Download high-res

    in the agricultural area (A), are presented in Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16, Fig.
    17. The experimentation has been conducted over ten days of two different seasons,
    the summer of 2022 and the winter of 2023, this allowed to obtain an overview
    of the behaviour of the system as well as to perform a test under different meteorological
    variations in order to approve the efficiency of the adopted soil-weather approach.

    data for the summer period from 05/09/2022 to 14/09/2022 are presented in Fig.
    14 (a) The data are sensed hourly and consist of temperature (T) and solar irradiance
    (G) measurements. The highest and lowest temperatures are 37.72 °C and 15.32 °C
    respectively. The solar irradiance values vary from 0 to 1000 W/m2, indicating
    the intensity of solar radiation received during each hour. It can be observed
    that lower solar irradiance values occur during the night-time hours, indicating
    the absence of sunlight. As the day progresses, the solar irradiance values increase,
    reaching their peak at 1000 W/m2. The temperature fluctuations correlate with
    the solar irradiance values, as higher solar irradiance leads to higher temperatures.
    The collected data from the sensor unit of the SPIS have been cross validated
    with the measurements obtained from a trusted meteorological station. These validations
    have confirmed the accuracy of the collected data, with minimal margin of error.
    During the 10-day performance evaluation, it can be observed that the FL controller
    effectively avoids operating the system during periods of high temperatures and
    intense solar radiation, as depicted in Fig. 14 (b) and Fig. 14 (c) and decides
    on short durations when input variables are medium. This strategy significantly
    contributes to the reduction of ET losses throughout the day. Additionally, by
    referring to the well-designed fuzzy rules, the FL controller selects the appropriate
    timing and duration for system operation. Consequently, the actual soil moisture
    closely tracks the desired value of 30 % with smooth oscillations (See Fig. 14
    (d)), in contrast to traditional single input- single output (SISO) feedback systems
    that often result in low irrigation performance. This performance evaluation over
    the 10-day period demonstrates the effectiveness and improved performance of the
    FL in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels while minimizing water loss. An
    extensive performance analysis has been conducted on two specific days of summer
    period (13 and 14 September), to understand the overall operation of the SPIS
    (See Fig. 15). September 13th (13/09/2022) represents the operational conditions
    of the system that persist throughout the 10-day experimental period in September
    (summer). By observing the system''s performance on this day, valuable insights
    can be gained regarding its sustained operation throughout the experiment. In
    addition, September 14th (14/09/2022) has been chosen due to the presence of precipitation.
    This provides an opportunity to assess the system''s performance under the same
    conditions (high weather parameters variation), but with the added factor of precipitation.
    Analysing its behaviour on a day with precipitation allows for an evaluation of
    the system''s ability to cope with such weather conditions. Throughout the selected
    two-days observation period, it is evident that the FL-based irrigation system
    allowed for considerable irrigation durations during periods of minimal variation
    in meteorological conditions as seen in point A (See Fig. 15). However, it effectively
    avoided irrigation during high-temperature and solar radiation conditions, as
    observed in point B. Consequently, the system reprograms the irrigation decision
    until conditions reached minimal or intermediate values. These decisions have
    been automatically made by the system based on fuzzy rules summarized in Table
    2, Table 3 of section 2.3. Given the high hourly ET rate during the observed period
    in point B, it was apparent that the amount of water applied during irrigation
    would be lost to the air without benefiting the crops. This finding aligns with
    expert recommendations on irrigation practices. In the case of point C, where
    soil moisture is about 24 % and the solar irradiance variable is at a minimum
    value (G = 17 w/m2) while the temperature in a medium value (T = 29 °C), the irrigation
    duration is decided as medium. This approach effectively minimized losses in terms
    of ET. A similar decision was observed in point F, where G = 330 w/m2 and T =
    24 °C. The system consistently made the decision to withhold irrigation when soil
    moisture reached the pre-defined value set by the farmer. This is being observed
    in multiple points during the experimental days, particularly at points D. Additionally,
    the system maintained the same decision (null duration of irrigation) in the presence
    of precipitation, as observed in points E. The average applied amount of water
    for the first day was 529,6L, over the irrigated area which is approximately 100
    m2. It follows that the proposed FL-irrigation control system provides appropriate
    duration to the irrigation unit of the field to apply an average of 5.29L/day/m2,
    that is, 5.29 mm/day. This is similar to the daily estimated ET value using the
    Penman-Monteith FAO model, which is about 5.31 mm/day (according to data collected
    from the sensor unit). Similarly for the second day, the system permit applying
    an average of 471,4L/day/m2, while the ET value is about 4,73 mm/day. The proposed
    irrigation-based soil-weather approaches have been verified under summer period,
    the FL controller avoids applying water during periods when there are significant
    variations in weather conditions (See Fig. 16), this avoids the loss of water
    through evaporation processes, while keeping the plants in a better condition,
    i.e., no stress. In addition, as noted, the duration of irrigation varies depending
    on the conditions measured by the sensors, namely, soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar radiation, air humidity and rainfall. 5.2. Inter period Likewise, the obtained
    results during the winter period over 10 days (From 11/01/2023 to 20/01/2023)
    show that the irrigation system is operating in efficient mode and compensates
    the quantities of water required by the plants while considering the values of
    solar irradiance and temperature which are practically small and average during
    this period. A daily average of 1.98 mm/day, has been applied to the soil, which
    permits maintaining a soil moisture close to the predefined value of soil moisture
    30 % defined by the user (See Fig. 17). During this period, the system considers
    the presence of rainfall rates, to minimize the over-irrigation that influence
    the plants. The evolution of soil moisture is shown in Fig. 17 (d). It is remarkable
    that this variable reaches maximums of about 48 % since the precipitation rate
    are important. The duration and period of irrigation are always optimized during
    the variations of solar irradiance and temperature (See Fig. 17 (b) and Fig. 17
    (c)). The system avoids applying water to the plants during the night period,
    this is justified by the minimal ET rate during this period, and low irradiance
    and temperatures values therefore the irrigation durations are at mid-days. In
    summary, the aforementioned results indicate that the proposed irrigation system
    based on the soil-weather approach and fuzzy concept effectively compensates water
    losses in semi-arid regions where the experiment has been conducted, ensuring
    optimal hydration for well-watered and actively growing crops. The SPIS also has
    the capability to adjust water requirements according to weather conditions that
    influence the irrigation process, thereby facilitating improved irrigation management.
    Achieving a forecast of irrigation duration for several days would entail the
    creation of suitable artificial intelligence algorithms, such as artificial neural
    networks (ANN), long term short memory (LSTM), and support vector machines (SVM)
    which can be trained using extensive data collected through the SPIS. At present,
    our team is actively engaged in the development of these algorithms, as well as
    expanding the system to cover larger agricultural areas. 5.3. Water and energy
    consumption analysis The energy and water consumption at the level of the “irrigation
    unit” in the ‘A’ and ‘B’ areas of the experiment field have been carried out.
    It should be noted that the ''A'' area is furnished with drip irrigation pipes,
    along with the proposed SPIS and an impulse solenoid valve, and ‘B’ area is equipped
    only with a manual drip irrigation based commercial timer to preset the applied
    water flow and period which are performed according to the knowledge and visualisation
    of the water-stress on the leaves by the farmer. It is noted also that the ‘B’
    area contains a classical solenoid, which require a significant current to maintain
    the On state compared to the adopted impulse solenoid. During the summer period,
    the farmer refers to a commercial timer to regulate a fixed water flow rate of
    approximately 11 mm/day for ‘B’ area. This estimation was based solely on the
    observation of climatic conditions, neglecting the influence of irrigation quantities
    on plant growth and soil moisture dynamics. Conversely, the proposed irrigation
    system demonstrated its efficacy in area ‘A’ through the evaluation of climatic
    and soil variables. It effectively delivered a precise water supply while maintaining
    soil moisture levels near the optimal range for apple trees. By incorporating
    these variables, the proposed irrigation system proficiently optimized the water
    supply for apple trees, resulting in a notable water-saving of nearly 61 % (±2%)
    over a 10-day period. The farmer consciously decided to apply an average of 110
    mm of water, whereas the SPIS determined a more optimal irrigation amount of 51.6
    mm, equivalent to an approximate daily application rate of 5.16 mm/day. This demonstration
    underscores the system''s efficiency and significance in precise irrigation management,
    ensuring the health and optimal growth of plants. Similarly, the power consumption
    in area ‘B’ stands at approximately 620Wh. Nevertheless, by optimizing water usage
    levels using the proposed SPIS-based FL decision and impulse solenoids, a remarkable
    reduction of approximately 46 % in overall power consumption has been achieved.
    6. Conclusion In this paper, a feedback FL control and combined soil-weather approach
    were presented, to foster water conservation and better irrigation scheduling
    and management in the eastern agriculture fields of Morocco. The fuzzy controller,
    developed based on Mamdani fuzzification using trapezoidal and triangular membership
    functions, effectively determined the duration of irrigation for crops. This utilization
    of FL control played a crucial role in maintaining soil moisture levels above
    pre-defined thresholds, exhibiting slight oscillations to prevent excessive run-off,
    thus conserving water and energy resources. To facilitate real-time performance
    monitoring and the creation of a comprehensive database, LoRa protocol has been
    utilised to communicate with a developed IoT platform. This enabled data to be
    collected on key environmental and climatic variables, as well as precise information
    on irrigation duration and soil proprieties. Presently, this is significantly
    contributing to data analysis and enhancing system performance. Implementing the
    system is straightforward, and its economic viability. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Aquatic animal viruses are considered to be transmitted via environmental
    water between fish farms. This study aimed to understand the actual transmission
    risk of red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) through environmental water among fish
    farms. An environmental DNA (eDNA) method using iron-based flocculation coupled
    with large-pore filtration was used to monitor RSIV DNA copies in seawater from
    fish farms and from an experimental infection model. RSIV dispersion in seawater
    from a net pen where the disease outbreak occurred was visualized by the inverse
    distance weighting method using multiple-sampling data sets from a fish farm.
    The analysis demonstrated that the center of the net pen had a high viral load,
    and RSIV seemed to be quickly diluted by the tidal current. To evaluate the transmission
    risk of RSIV in environmental water, the red sea bream Pagrus major (approximately
    10 g) was exposed to RSIV-contained seawater (103, 104, 105, 106, and 107 copies/L)
    for 3 days, which mimicked field exposure. A probit analysis of the challenge
    test indicated that the inferred infection rates of seawater containing 105.9
    copies/L and 103.1 copies/L of RSIV were 50% and 0.0001%, respectively. In the
    surveillance for 3 years at 10 fixed points (n = 306), there were only seven samples
    in which the viral load exceeded 104 copies/L in seawater. These results suggest
    that the transmission of RSIV among fish farms via seawater is highly associated
    with the distance between the net pens, and the environmental water is not always
    an infection source for the transmission of RSIV between fish farms. IMPORTANCE
    Our surveillance of viral loads for red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) by monitoring
    environmental DNA in fish farms suggested that the viral loads in the seawater
    were low, except for the net pens where RSIV outbreaks occurred. Furthermore,
    our experimental infection model indicated that the infection risk of RSIV-contained
    seawater with less than 103 copies/L was extremely low. The limited risk of environmental
    water for transmission of RSIV gives an insight that RSIV could be partly transmitted
    between fish farms due to the movement of equipment and/or humans from the fish
    farm where the disease outbreaks. Since our data suggest that seawater can function
    as a potential wall to reduce the transmission of RSIV, biosecurity management,
    such as disinfection of equipment associated with fish farms could be effective,

    Aquatic animal viruses are considered to be transmitted via environmental water
    between fish farms. This study aimed to understand the actual transmission risk
    of red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) through environmental water among fish farms.
    An environmental DNA (eDNA) method using iron-based flocculation coupled with
    large-pore filtration was used to monitor RSIV DNA copies in seawater from fish
    farms and from an experimental infection model. RSIV dispersion in seawater from
    a net pen where the disease outbreak occurred was visualized by the inverse distance
    weighting method using multiple-sampling data sets from a fish farm. The analysis
    demonstrated that the center of the net pen had a high viral load, and RSIV seemed
    to be quickly diluted by the tidal current. To evaluate the transmission risk
    of RSIV in environmental water, the red sea bream Pagrus major (approximately
    10 g) was exposed to RSIV-contained seawater (103, 104, 105, 106, and 107 copies/L)
    for 3 days, which mimicked field exposure. A probit analysis of the challenge
    test indicated that the inferred infection rates of seawater containing 105.9
    copies/L and 103.1 copies/L of RSIV were 50% and 0.0001%, respectively. In the
    surveillance for 3 years at 10 fixed points (n = 306), there were only seven samples
    in which the viral load exceeded 104 copies/L in seawater. These results suggest
    that the transmission of RSIV among fish farms via seawater is highly associated
    with the distance between the net pens, and the environmental water is not always
    an infection source for the transmission of RSIV between fish farms. IMPORTANCE
    Our surveillance of viral loads for red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) by monitoring
    environmental DNA in fish farms suggested that the viral loads in the seawater
    were low, except for the net pens where RSIV outbreaks occurred. Furthermore,
    our experimental infection model indicated that the infection risk of RSIV-contained
    seawater with less than 103 copies/L was extremely low. The limited risk of environmental
    water for transmission of RSIV gives an insight that RSIV could be partly transmitted
    between fish farms due to the movement of equipment and/or humans from the fish
    farm where the disease outbreaks. Since our data suggest that seawater can function
    as a potential wall to reduce the transmission of RSIV, biosecurity management,
    such as disinfection of equipment associated with fish farms could be effective,
    even in the semi-open system aquaculture that the environmental water can be freely
    transferred, to reduce the risk of RSIV outbreaks. INTRODUCTION Red sea bream
    iridovirus (RSIV) is a double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the genus Megalocytivirus,
    within the family Iridoviridae (1). The viral particles with a diameter of 160–180
    nm have an envelope-like structure around the icosahedral virion capsid, and their
    genome size is approximately 110 kbp (2, 3). In the genus Megalocytivirus, two
    species, infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) and scale drop disease
    virus (SDDV), are described by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
    (ICTV) (4). RSIV is a type of ISKNV species that causes mass mortality in cultured
    fish, with the formation of numerous enlarged cells from which the genus name
    is derived. RSIV is the first megalocytivirus (MCV) reported to cause mass mortality
    in cultured fish. The first case was reported in cultured red sea bream (Pagrus
    major) in Japan in 1990 (5). Since then, viral infection has spread quickly in
    Japan and has routinely occurred in the summer season in more than 30 mariculture
    fish species (6, 7). After that, similar MCVs of ISKNV species inducing the enlarged
    cells in the infected cultured fish have been identified in several Asian countries:
    ISKNV reported from mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) in China (8, 9), rock bream
    iridovirus reported from barred knifejaw (Oplegnathus fasciatus) in Korea (10,
    11), and turbot reddish body iridovirus reported from turbot (Scophthalmus maximus)
    in China (12, 13). The geographical distribution of MCVs has spread to European
    countries and the Americas since the 2010s in both food fish (14, 15) and ornamental
    fish (16, 17). Owing to its significant impact on the aquaculture industry, MCV
    infection is listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal
    Health as an infection with RSIV (18). Formalin-inactivated vaccines are commercially
    available for the management of RSIV outbreaks in fish farms (19, 20), and an
    RSIV-resistant strain of red sea bream has been developed (21). However, fish
    farmers do not vaccinate when the vaccine cost is not acceptable compared to the
    market value of cultured fish. Resistance breeding is not applicable to all RSIV-susceptible
    species or to wild-caught juveniles in aquaculture. Therefore, appropriate biosecurity
    management, such as disinfection procedures, could be important in fish farms,
    as well as vaccination and resistant breeding for integrated pest management of
    RSIV. On the other hand, RSIV is considered to be horizontally transmitted through
    environmental water between animals, as immersion challenges have been demonstrated
    (22). The disinfection procedure might not be effective in transmitting RSIV in
    a semi-open system culture for marine fish because rearing water (i.e., environmental
    water) can be freely transferred between net pens. However, the actual transmission
    risk of RSIV through the environmental water between net pens or fish farms has
    never been evaluated. Hence, monitoring the appearance or density of RSIV in the
    aquatic environment surrounding fish farms is important for understanding the
    RSIV epidemic in fish farms, followed by the implementation of appropriate biosecurity
    management against RSIV. Environmental DNA (eDNA) and nucleic acids extracted
    from environmental samples (water, soil, feces, etc.) have been used extensively
    since the 2000s, with numerous applications such as metagenomics, species detection,
    biomass estimation, and monitoring of aquatic animal pathogens (23 – 27). In our
    previous study (28), we developed an RSIV monitoring method in seawater using
    an eDNA technique based on iron-based flocculation coupled with large-pore-size
    filtration (29). In the present study, using the eDNA method, the transmission
    risk of RSIV in the environmental water was investigated by field sampling in
    fish farms for 3 years and an experimental challenge test against red sea bream.
    Based on the sequential data, the actual transmission risk of RSIV in the environmental
    seawater is discussed in terms of among net pens or fish farms. RESULTS Seasonal
    dynamics of RSIV in the seawater around aquaculture environments Seasonal monitoring
    of RSIV load in seawater was performed in three culture areas (A, B, and C) using
    the eDNA method (Fig. 1). A total of 306 seawater samples were analyzed over 3
    years between May 2019 and May 2022. During the sampling periods, the total numbers
    of diagnosed cases of RSIV infection in areas (A, B, and C) were 240, 47, and
    89 cases, respectively. The seasonal dynamics of the viral load in seawater are
    shown in Fig. 2. The limit of detection for RSIV in seawater using the eDNA method
    is 102.0 copies/L seawater as shown by our previous study (28). RSIV in seawater
    was detected after the confirmation of the RSIV outbreak in the area by a diagnosis
    laboratory for fish diseases managed by a local authority (Fig. 2). The maximum
    viral load was 105.0 copies/L of seawater, which was recorded in area A in September
    2020 during the RSIV outbreak at the fish farm where the seawater was collected.
    RSIV was often detected in seawater during the summer season but disappeared in
    the winter season (Fig. 2). Indeed, the detection ratio of RSIV from the seawater
    between July and October when the water temperature exceeded 24°C (33.6%, n =
    128) was significantly higher than that (6.1%, n = 180) between November and June
    (Fisher’s exact test, P value <0.01). RSIV was most frequently detected in 2021
    in all sampling areas because of epidemics caused by the introduction of RSIV-infected
    cultured juveniles. On the other hand, the water depth at each sampling points
    was not associated with the prevalence or viral load of RSIV. The distribution
    of viral loads in seawater is summarized in Table 1. The RSIV genome was detected
    in 54 seawater samples (17.5%) during the 3 years of monitoring. Only seven samples
    (2.3%) had viral loads exceeding 104.0 copies/L. Fig 1 Fig 1 Sampling points of

    RSIV outbreak Two sets of multiple-sampling data sets were obtained from another
    fish farm during the outbreak of RSIV. The environmental conditions differed between
    12 July 2021 and 16 July 2021 (Table 2). The dispersion of RSIV in seawater was
    visualized using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method with eDNA data from
    30 sampling points on a fish farm (Fig. 3). IDW is an interpolation technique
    to estimate values at unmeasured locations based on the values of nearby measured
    points, which can then be used for visualizing data using contour maps or heatmaps
    (30). The heatmap images shown in Fig. 4 show the inferred RSIV dispersions in
    seawater at 3 m depth by IDW interpolation between the sampling points. The heatmap
    image indicates that the viral load in seawater on 12 July 2021 (Fig. 4A) was
    visually higher than that on 16 July 2021 (Fig. 4B). The mean copy number of the
    sampling points on 12 July 2021 (103.4±0.4 copies/L) was significantly higher
    than that on 16 July 2021 (102.9±0.4 copies/L; student’s t-test, P value <0.01).
    There was a hot spot (104.2 copies/L) near the net pens rearing 1- or 2-year-old
    red sea bream (Fig. 4A, arrowhead), which disappeared 4 days later (Fig. 4B).
    Fig. 4C and D show enlarged images of net pens where seawater sampling was performed
    at the center and at each edge. On 12 July 2021, RSIV was most abundant at the
    center of net pen 1 and dispersed toward the right side of the image, probably
    because of a tidal current toward the right side (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the virus
    dispersion image seemed to be distorted in net pens 2 and 3, which lacked seawater
    samples from the center (Fig. 4C). On 16 July 2021, the viral load at the center
    of net pen 1 was similar to that at the edges of the net pen, suggesting that
    RSIV was not shed abundantly from the diseased fish in the net pen (Fig. 4D).

    dots indicate each sampling point. Dotted squares represent netting pens on fish
    farms. In net pen 1, water samples were collected from the center and at each

    edge. The red-filled square shows the analyzed area of the virus dispersion. Fig

    points were interpolated by the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method using
    the gstat package (31). The IDW method can estimate values at unmeasured locations

    data by a heatmap (30). (A) and (B) show the heatmap images of the interpolation

    risk of RSIV in seawater, red sea bream were exposed via rearing in seawater containing
    RSIV ranging between 103 and 107 copies/L for three continuous days, which mimics
    the field exposure of RSIV based on the monitoring data in the aquaculture environment
    (Fig. S1). The stock of the virus solution supplied to the upper tank was replaced
    with fresh virus solution daily to ensure the infectious viral titer of RSIV as
    the infection source. The viral load in the rearing seawater measured by the eDNA
    method indicated that the fish were exposed to the intended concentration of RSIV
    for 3 days (Fig. 5A; Table 3). RSIV did not disappear in the experimental groups
    with 106 and 107 copies/L after stopping the virus supply, indicating that some
    RSIV-infected fish shed the virus (Fig. 5A). All fish were analyzed 6 days post-exposure
    to avoid superinfection from infected fish to naïve fish within the tank based
    on our previous study that viral load in the fish tank was exceeded 105 copies/L
    at 14 days post-immersion challenge (28). Indeed, the viral loads in rearing seawater
    of all experimental groups were less than 104 copies/L after stopping the supply
    of RSIV in this study (Fig. 5A). Although there was one dead fish each in the
    103 copies/L and negative control groups, no dead fish were observed in the other
    tanks during the experiment. The infection rate and viral load of infected fish
    in each experimental group are shown in Fig. 5B. The infection rates of the 105,
    106, and 107 copies/L groups were 10%, 55%, and 100%, respectively, whereas no
    RSIV was detected in the negative control and 103 and 104 copies/L groups. The
    mean RSIV genome number in infected fish increased as the exposed viral load increased.
    The binomial data of infected and non-infected fish in each group were analyzed
    using a probit regression model (Fig. 6). Using the probit model, the infection
    rate was inferred using the viral load in seawater as an explanatory variable
    (Table 4). The infection rate was assumed to be an infection risk for red sea
    bream when fish were exposed to the viral load via seawater for 3 days. Thus,
    the infection risk of seawater containing RSIV ranged between 103.0 and 104.0
    copies/L, and the mode of the viral load in field monitoring (Table 1) was estimated
    to be less than 0.1%. Furthermore, seawater containing RSIV at 103.0 copies/L
    or lower was not found to be a high-risk infection source because the inferred
    infection risk was less than 0.0001%. Fig 5 Fig 5 Results of experimental infection
    that mimics field exposure of RSIV. Seawater containing RSIV ranging between 103
    and 107 copies/L was continuously flowed into fish-kept tanks at 1 L/min for 3
    days as virus exposure. Then, the fish were reared with the sand-filtrated seawater
    without virus for 3 days followed by inspection of fish using a real-time PCR
    assay targeting RSIV. (A) Viral load of rearing water during experimental infection.

    of RSIV in seawater in an aquaculture environment and estimated the infection
    risk of seawater containing RSIV based on the viral loads observed in field samples.
    Few reports have investigated the viral load of rearing water in fish farms, not
    only for RSIV, but also for other fish viruses. The maximum viral loads recorded
    in RSIV and salmonid alphavirus in fish farms were 106.58 and 105.34 copies/L
    seawater, respectively (32, 33). However, there has been no research on aquatic
    animal pathogens that evaluates the infection risk of rearing water by experimental
    infection based on the viral load detected in the aquaculture environment. Although
    the immersion challenge mimics the natural route for fish viruses better than
    injection, the viral dose and exposure time in previous reports were too high
    and too short, respectively, to evaluate the actual infection risk (22, 28). In
    the present study, we selected viral loads ranging between 103 and 107 copies/L,
    based on the seasonal monitoring. Furthermore, the data from multiple sampling
    in a fish farm suggested that the viral load in the seawater changed over several
    days, possibly due to environmental factors such as water temperature and tide
    current (Fig. 4); hence, fish were exposed to RSIV for 3 days during the experimental
    infection, assuming that the same viral load does not continue for more than 3
    days. The infection rate obtained by the experimental infection was reasonable.
    Although RSIV-infected fish die within 20 days in an immersion setting (22, 28),
    actual outbreaks in fish farms are prolonged for more than 40 days (20, 32), indicating
    that RSIV is gradually transmitted between animals within a net pen. The difference
    between experimental trials and the transmission situation in the field can be
    well explained by the inferred infection rate that did not reach 50% when the
    viral load in seawater was between 104.1 and 105.9 copies/L (Table 4), which was
    often observed in the net pens with RSIV outbreak (Fig. 2 and 4) (32). Seasonal
    monitoring of RSIV using the eDNA method indicated that the viral load in seawater
    outside net pens in the aquaculture environment was not very high. The viral loads
    of the RSIV-detected samples were mostly 103 copies/L or lower, although the samples
    were derived from various situations in terms of geographical locations, water
    temperatures, water depth, and the frequency of RSIV epidemics. In contrast, images
    of the RSIV dispersion suggested that viruses shed from RSIV-infected fish were
    easily diluted and dispersed in seawater (Fig. 4C). Seawater samples for seasonal
    monitoring were collected from the edges of the net pens, where the viral load
    was lower than that at the center. Furthermore, the sampling points did not always
    confirm the RSIV outbreak, even when RSIV was detected from the eDNA, indicating
    that the detected RSIV genome could be derived from other net pens causing the
    disease. Therefore, the low viral load in seawater observed in this study seems
    reasonable. In fact, the range of the RSIV genome number in seawater between 102
    and 105 copies/L recorded in this study was similar to the RSIV dynamics in seawater
    at a fish farm during an RSIV outbreak in other areas (32). The eDNA method, based
    on iron-based flocculation coupled with large-pore-size filtration (28, 29), was
    a useful tool for determining the viral load in seawater samples. Iron flocculation
    has been used to concentrate various aquatic animal viruses, including piscine
    nodavirus (34), tilapia lake virus (35), white spot syndrome virus (36), and viral
    hemorrhagic septicemia virus (37). As shown by various applications, this method
    allows us to use different but similar viruses with known copy numbers as internal
    controls, which significantly help in obtaining more accurate viral loads in seawater.
    In the present study, koi herpesvirus (KHV) was used as an internal control as
    previously described (32). Using multiplex real-time PCR targeting RSIV and KHV
    in this study reduced the labor and cost of inspection and increased the reliability
    of the results by normalizing the copy number of RSIV DNA using the recovery rate
    of KHV. Indeed, the RSIV dispersion from the net pen was reasonably visualized
    by considering the tidal current if appropriate sampling points were selected
    (Fig. 4C). Reasonable visualization of RSIV in seawater is supported by the robust
    inspection procedure of the eDNA method using an internal control. We could determine
    the shedding of RSIV from apparently healthy but RSIV-infected fish using eDNA,
    despite non-lethal sampling. In this study, a high viral load was observed at
    a sampling point near the net pen where 1- or 2-year-old red sea bream were reared
    (Fig. 4A). This fish could be a source of infection for the outbreak of RSIV in
    juveniles, as shown in a previous study (32). The application of eDNA-based detection
    of aquatic animal pathogens has been studied for early disease detection (26,
    27, 33) or border control (38, 39). The present study also suggests that the eDNA
    method is an attractive non-lethal tool for the detection of RSIV-infected fish
    or hotspots of infection on fish farms. The virus-detected result from the eDNA
    only indicated the presence of RSIV-shedding fish near the sampling point (assumed
    to be less than 100 m) and was not representative of the aquaculture environment,
    such as the entire bay area. eDNA has been used to estimate species or biomass
    in sampled areas (23, 24) and is a tool that can predict waterborne disease outbreaks
    in aquatic animals (26, 33, 40, 41). We also expected to be able to detect signs
    of an RSIV outbreak in a fish farming area using the eDNA method. However, RSIV
    could not be detected in the seawater before the confirmation of the disease outbreak
    by the diagnosis laboratory for fish diseases (Fig. 1). The image of the RSIV
    dispersion indicated that the viral load in the seawater was not identical after
    4 days, even in the same fish farm (Fig. 4). In our previous study, increase of
    RSIV load in eDNA has been observed along with rising water temperature during
    the disease outbreak in a fish farm (32). We need to note the significance of
    eDNA data, which could be affected by environmental factors such as water temperature
    and tidal current, according to the purpose of the research. Virus distribution
    and dispersion in the aquaculture environment were successfully visualized using
    a combination of the eDNA method and IDW interpolation. This study, which has
    never been attempted in fish pathogens, revealed the actual dynamics of RSIV from
    a net pen during an RSIV outbreak. However, several limitations of the IDW interpolation
    were observed. First, the multiple sampling for the analysis required considerable
    time and labor, as it took approximately 2 h to complete at the 30 sampling points
    in this study. A longer sampling time is not desirable because environmental factors
    such as tidal currents can change between the first and last sampling points.
    Second, the number of sampling points was not sufficient to understand the detailed
    movement of the RSIV, as several distorted images were observed, such as net pens
    2 and 3 (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, although there were hidden hot spots derived from
    asymptomatic RSIV-infected fish, we could only determine whether the sampling
    plan was appropriate after completing the analysis (Fig. 4A). In the infectious
    hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), finite-volume
    ocean circulation and particle-tracking models have been applied to simulate virus
    dispersion via seawater among fish farms (42). The model simulation could be a
    feasible approach for understanding virus dispersion in fish farms. Seawater does
    not threaten the transmission of RSIV between fish farms and even works as a potential
    wall to reduce the transmission risk of RSIV. Most fish viruses are horizontally
    transmitted via environmental water between animals within a tank or net pen,
    as immersion or cohabitation challenges have been demonstrated in fish viruses,
    including KHV (43), infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (44), RSIV (22), IHNV
    (45), and piscine nodavirus (34). However, our research suggests that there is
    a completely different situation between fish farms within a certain physical
    distance. Based on the experimental infection and probit analyses, more than 50%
    of the RSIV-detected samples in the seasonal monitoring were not found to be an
    infection source of RSIV if the cutoff value was set to be 103.4 copies/L, for
    which the infection risk was estimated to be 0.001%. Indeed, neither a virus nor
    an outbreak was confirmed at sampling points B1–B3 in 2020, although the RSIV
    outbreak was confirmed in another fish farm in the area B, which was more than
    100 m from the sampling points. Considering the limited infection risk of RSIV-contained
    seawater, the transmission of RSIV between fish farms could be partly due to the
    movement of equipment and/or humans associated with fish farms. Therefore, disinfection
    is considered an important biosecurity management strategy to prevent the invasion
    of RSIV into fish farms, even in semi-open system cultures in which seawater can
    be freely transferred between fish farms. Although there have been some reports
    on the disinfection of MCVs (46, 47), further studies are required to establish
    appropriate biosecurity management for fish farms in semi-open systems. Concluding
    remarks The present study, using the eDNA method, demonstrated that the infection
    risk of seawater containing RSIV is highly associated with viral load, which is
    affected by the physical distance or tidal currents between fish farms. Viral
    loads of less than 103.4 copies/L, which are often detected in aquaculture environments,
    are not a significant source of infection for transmitting RSIV between fish farms.
    The limited risk of seawater suggests that the disinfection procedure, which has
    been considered less important in semi-open system cultures, could be essential
    for biosecurity management to prevent RSIV outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling
    for seasonal monitoring Three different cultured areas (A, B, and C) located in
    western Japan were selected for seasonal monitoring of RSIV using eDNA (Fig. 1).
    Sampling points A1–A4 from area A were net pens derived from a fish farm where
    red sea bream, white trevally Pseudocaranx dentex, and greater amberjack Seriola
    dumerili were cultured. The water depth at A1–A3 and A4 was approximately 20 m
    and 50 m, respectively. Sampling points B1–B3 from area B were net pens derived
    from a fish farm where juvenile red sea bream were cultured. Sampling points C1–C3
    from area C were net pens derived from three fish farms where the Japanese amberjack,
    Seriola quinqueradiata, was mainly cultured. The water depth at B1–B3 and C1–C3
    was approximately 15 m and 50 m, respectively. Information on RSIV outbreaks in
    each area, including other fish farms in the bay or peninsula area, was obtained
    from diagnostic records based on the confirmation of enlarged cells using a stamp
    smear of Giemsa stain (5) inspected by the diagnosis laboratory for fish diseases
    managed by Ainan town. Sampling was performed once a month from May 2019 to May
    2022, while the sampling frequency was reduced in the winter season between December
    and March when there was no RSIV outbreak. Our preliminary examination indicated
    that a depth of 3 m, where fish in a net pen are usually swimming, was able to
    detect the highest copy number of RSIV compared to the surface water at a depth
    of 1 m or 6 m (data not shown). Seawater was collected from the edge of the net
    pen at a depth of 3 m using a RIGO-B Transparent water sampler (RIGO Co., Ltd.,
    Tokyo, Japan). The sampled seawater was transferred to Fisheries Technology Institute,
    Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency at 4°C and subjected to the iron
    flocculation method (28) as described within 5 days after sampling. RSIV genome
    in seawater was stable for at least 1 week when the sampled seawater was kept
    at 4°C (data not shown). Sampling for visualization of virus dispersion Another
    fish farm located in Ehime prefecture in western Japan was selected for visualization
    of virus dispersion in seawater. On the fish farm, red sea bream from yearling
    to 2-year-old fish were reared, and an RSIV outbreak occurred in the yearling
    fish in July 2021. Seawater sampling was performed as described above on 12 July
    and 16 July 2021, at 30 sampling points (Fig. 3). In net pen 1, one sample was
    collected from the center and at each edge of the net pen. In net pens 2 and 3,
    samples were collected from each edge only because it was time-consuming to remove
    the bird netting covering all net pens. At several sampling points where the sampling
    boat could be anchored with net pens, the water temperature and tidal current
    (speed and direction) were measured at a depth of 3 m using a handheld 2-D EM
    current meter with a temperature and depth sensor AEM213-DA (JFE Advantech Co.,
    Ltd.). A laser range finder YARDAGE PRO 500 (Bushnell Co., Ltd. KS, USA) was used
    to record the locations of the sampling points based on the distance between the
    nets. Using distance information, the coordinates of the longitude and latitude
    of the sampling points were determined using an aerial map of the fish farm from
    Google Maps (https://www.google.co.jp/maps). eDNA samples from seawater The eDNA
    sample was extracted from 500 mL of seawater using the iron flocculation method
    coupled with direct DNA extraction from a virus-trapped filter (28, 32). This
    process was performed at room temperature between 22°C and 26°C. First, approximately
    103 copies in 50 µL of heat-inactivated KHV NRIA0301 isolate (48) were added to
    the seawater sample as an external standard virus for the internal control of
    eDNA before the iron flocculation process (32). The same volume of KHV in a 1.5-mL
    microtube was placed at room temperature during the iron flocculation process
    for each sampling batch as a control for copy number reduction during sample treatment.
    Then, 50 µL of FeCl3 solution (FeCl3∙6H2O 4.83 g in 100 mL distilled water) was
    added to the sample seawater so that the final iron concentration was 1 mg Fe/L.
    The seawater was gently stirred for 1 h using a magnetic stirrer to make the virus
    flocculate and filtered with a 0.8-µM pore size polycarbonate filter (Advantec
    Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) under reduced pressure. The flocculate-trapped filter and
    the external standard KHV were stored in 1.5 mL microtubes at −80°C until eDNA
    extraction. eDNA was extracted from the flocculate-trapped filter using the DNeasy
    Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN K.K., Tokyo, Japan), as described previously (32).
    Since the final DNA elution was performed with 0.2 mL of the elution buffer supplied
    with the kit, the prepared eDNA was concentrated at 2,500 magnification from the
    500 mL sample of seawater. Virus preparation The RSIV RS-17 isolate derived from
    diseased red sea bream was used (32). The virus was propagated using the SKF-9
    cell line (49), derived from spotted knifejaw (Oplegnathus punctatus) fry, maintained
    at 25°C with Hanks’ minimum essential medium (HMEM; GIBCO/Thermo Fisher Scientific
    K.K., Tokyo, Japan), and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic
    (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific), as described previously (3, 49). RSIV RS-17
    was inoculated onto SKF-9 cells seeded in a 75 cm2 cell culture flask (Corning,
    NY, USA) and incubated for 6 days at 25°C. The cell culture medium was then replaced
    with a fresh medium to increase the final virus production (3). The cell culture
    supernatant containing RSIV was collected at 17 days post-inoculation and was
    centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was used as the viral
    solution for the experimental infection. The infectious viral titer (50% tissue
    culture infectious dose: TCID50) of the virus solution was 106.8 TCID50/mL, which
    was determined as previously described (49). The RSIV genome number of the viral
    solution was determined to be 109.7 copies/mL by DNA extraction using the DNeasy
    Blood and Tissue Kit and real-time PCR, as described below. Experimental infection
    Experimental infection of red sea bream was performed following the Animal Research:
    Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Fish handling, husbandry,
    and sampling were conducted according to the policies of the Institutional Animal
    Care and Use Committee of the Fisheries Technology Institute and approved by the
    committee (IACUC-FTI no. 22009). Red sea bream (approximately 10 g) purchased
    from a commercial hatchery (A-MARINE KINDAI, Co., Ltd.) was used for experimental
    infection. They were reared in flowing sand-filtered seawater and fed commercial
    pellet food OTOHIME EP1 (Marubeni Nisshin Feed Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) daily
    during the experiment. A total of 120 fish were divided into six groups (i.e.,
    20 fish per group) and kept in 45 L tanks for 9 days from 24.4°C to 29°C for acclimation
    of fish. The experimental infection was performed at 28.7°C–29.1°C, which is a
    relatively high water temperature for red sea bream in order to evaluate a minimum
    viral load in seawater to establish virus infection under stressful conditions
    for fish. A schematic of the experimental infection mimicking the natural exposure
    of the virus to seawater is shown in Fig. S1. Fifteen liters of the virus preparation
    tank were set on the upper stream of each 45 L tank where 20 fish were kept. Sand-filtered
    seawater was introduced into the virus preparation tank at a flow rate of 1 L/min.
    The virus solutions (1012.7 copies/L) were diluted into 1010.7, 109.7, 108.7,
    107.7, and 106.7 copies/L with autoclaved Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline
    (NISSUI PHARMACEUTICAL Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). They were added to the virus
    preparation tanks at 0.5 mL/min using peristaltic pumps (Tokyo Garasu Kikai Co.,
    Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) such that the final concentrations of RSIV in each virus preparation
    tank were theoretically 107.4, 106.4, 105.4, 104.4, and 103.4 copies/L, respectively.
    Virus-contained seawater flowed into the fish-kept tank at 1 L/min for 3 days
    for virus exposure. The diluted viral solution was replaced daily with a fresh
    solution. After 3 days of exposure, the fish were reared in flowing sand-filtered
    seawater without the virus at 1 L/min for an additional 3 days. For the negative
    control, fish were reared in flowing sand-filtered seawater at 1 L/min for 6 days.
    To confirm the viral load in each fish tank, 500 mL of seawater was collected
    at 3 h and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days post-exposure (dpe), and eDNA was extracted
    as described above. All the fish were dissected to collect their spleens at 6
    dpe. Because one dead fish from the negative control group had no spleen due to
    cannibalism, the brain was collected for DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from
    approximately 20 mg of the tissue sample using the Maxwell 16 System DNA Purification
    Kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The RSIV genome number in the extracted
    eDNA or tissue DNA was determined using real-time PCR, as described below. Real-time
    PCR for eDNA The RSIV genome number in the eDNA samples extracted from seawater
    was determined using a multiplex real-time PCR assay targeting RSIV (49) and KHV
    (50). Real-time PCR was used to normalize the RSIV genome number based on the
    recovery rate of KHV, which was added to the seawater sample as an internal control.
    The primer/probe set for RSIV consisted of RSIV-MCP186F (5′-CGG CCA GGA GTT TAG
    TGT GAC T-3′), RSIV-MCP288R (5′-GCT GTT CTC CTT GCT GGA CG-3′), and a hydrolysis
    probe RSIV-MCP239P (5′-FAM-TGT GGC TGC GTG TTA AGA TCC CCT CCA-BHQ1-3′). The primer/probe
    set for KHV consisted of KHV-86f (5′-GAC GCC GGA GAC CTT GTG-3′), KHV-163r (5′-CGG
    GTT CTT ATT TTT GTC CTT GTT-3′), and the hydrolysis probe, KHV-109p (5′-Cy5- CTT
    CCT CTG CTC GGC GAG CAC G-BHQ2-3′). Each well contained 20 µL of reaction mixture
    consisting of 2 µL nucleic acid template and 10 µL KAPA PROBE FORCE qPCR Kit (Kapa
    Biosystems, Inc., Wilmington, MA, Japan), with a final concentration of 200 nM
    for each RSIV primer and probe, 100 nM for the KHV primers, and 50 nM for the
    KHV probe. A serial 10-fold dilution of the plasmid containing the target region
    was used to draw a standard curve for copy number calculations. The real-time
    PCR assay was performed using the LightCycler 96 Instrument (Roche Diagnostics
    K.K., Tokyo, Japan) or CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
    Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The amplification thermal profile consisted of one cycle
    of 98°C for 3 min and 45 cycles of denaturation and annealing, which were conducted
    at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 30 s. Fluorescence signals for FAM and Cy-5 were
    recorded in each cycle as RSIV and KHV, respectively. The samples were tested
    in duplicate. The recovery rate of KHV was calculated using the KHV genome number
    derived from eDNA samples per KHV DNA (approximately 103 copies), which was added
    to seawater as the external standard. Based on the recovery rate of KHV, the RSIV
    genome numbers were normalized and used for data analysis. Real-time PCR for fish
    sample The RSIV genome number derived from fish samples was determined by real-time
    PCR using the RSIV-MCP186F/RSIV-MCP288R primers and the RSIV-MCP239P probe, as
    described above. Twenty microliters of the reaction mixture consisted of 2 µL
    of the nucleic acid template and 10 µL of THUNDERBIRD Probe qPCR Mix (TOYOBO Co.,
    Ltd., Osaka, Japan), with a final concentration of 200 nM for each primer and
    probe. A serial 10-fold dilution of the plasmid containing the target region was
    used to draw a standard curve for copy number calculations. The real-time PCR
    assay was performed using LightCycler 96 Instrument (Roche Diagnostics). The amplification
    thermal profile consisted of one cycle of 95°C for 1 min and 45 cycles of denaturation
    and annealing, which were conducted at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 30 s. Samples
    were tested in duplicate. Data analysis RSIV dispersion in seawater was visualized
    by interpolation between sampling points by the IDW method (30) using the gstat
    package (31). Two data sets of viral loads in seawater linked with the coordinates
    of the sampling points on 12 and 16 July 2021 were used. The samples in which
    RSIV was not detected were treated as 102 copies/L, which is the limit of detection
    of the eDNA method, when interpolation of the sampling points was performed using
    the IDW method. The IDW analysis was performed on R version 4.2.1 using packages
    “sp,” “rgdal,” “raster,” “leaflet,” “mapview,” and “gstat.” The relationship between
    the viral load in seawater and the infection rate obtained by experimental infection
    was analyzed using a probit regression model. The mean RSIV genome number in the
    seawater samples from 1 to 3 dpe was used as the viral load in the seawater of
    each group. On the basis of the mean viral load in seawater and the binomial data
    of each fish (infection or non-infection), the probit analysis was performed on
    R version 4.2.1 using “glm” function. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported

  description: In order to make the crops grow under the condition of appropriate
    water content and realize the precision irrigation of farmland, an intelligent
    irrigation system based on LoRa communication technology was designed in this
    paper. The system mainly includes crop information acquisition unit, LoRa wireless
    communication unit, intelligent decision unit and irrigation output module. The
    system adopts MSP430 processor and WH -101- L LoRa module to realize low power
    consumption and network terminal node design, transmits farmland crop information
    to cloud server through concentrator gateway, and builds cloud management decision
    software. The results of system application test show that the wireless crop awareness
    network using synchronous wake up technology has stable data transmission, the
    average packet loss rate is 0.3%, and has strong scalability. The system calculates
    irrigation amount and irrigation time by intelligent decision unit based on real-time
    crop information and database, and remotely controls the irrigation output module
    to accurately control the soil moisture content of crops in different growing
    periods. The mean square errors of water content obtained in blueberry and corn
    test fields are 1.80 and 4.83 respectively, both lower than the traditional irrigation
    method.

  description: Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) demonstrates an efficient tool
    to monitor and predict SARS-CoV-2 community distribution. Many countries across
    the world have adopted the technique, however, most of these studies were conducted
    for a short duration with a limited sampling size. In this study, long-term reliability
    and quantification of wastewater SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is reported via analyzing
    16,858 samples collected from 453 different locations across the United Arab Emirates
    (UAE) from May 2020 to June 2022. The collected composite samples were first incubated
    at 60 °C followed by filtration, concentration, and then RNA extraction using
    commercially available kits. The extracted RNA was then analyzed by one-step RT-qPCR
    and RT-ddPCR, and the data was compared to the reported clinical cases. The average
    positivity rate in the wastewater samples was found to be 60.61 % (8.41–96.77
    %), however, the positivity rate obtained from the RT-ddPCR was significantly
    higher than the RT-qPCR suggesting higher sensitivity of RT-ddPCR. Time-lagged
    correlation analysis indicated an increase in positive cases in the wastewater
    samples when the clinical positive cases declined suggesting that wastewater data
    are highly affected by the unreported asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and recovering
    individuals. The weekly SARS-CoV-2 viral count in the wastewater samples are positively
    correlated with the diagnosed new clinical cases throughout the studied period
    and the studied locations. Viral count in wastewater peaked approximately one
    to two weeks prior to the peaks appearing in active clinical cases indicating
    that wastewater viral concentrations are effective in predicting clinical cases.
    Overall, this study further confirms the long-term sensitivity and robust approach
    of WBE to detect trends in SARS-CoV-2 spread and helps contribute to pandemic
    management.

    Highlights • 16,858 wastewater samples from 453 locations in the UAE were tested.
    • Wastewater surveillance carried out for >26 months. • Wastewater SARS-CoV-2
    trend correlated with the clinical reports. • ddPCR is more effective than RT-qPCR
    in screening SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. • WBE is a sensitive and robust method
    to detect SARS-CoV-2 spread at an early stage. Abstract Wastewater-based epidemiology
    (WBE) demonstrates an efficient tool to monitor and predict SARS-CoV-2 community
    distribution. Many countries across the world have adopted the technique, however,
    most of these studies were conducted for a short duration with a limited sampling
    size. In this study, long-term reliability and quantification of wastewater SARS-CoV-2
    surveillance is reported via analyzing 16,858 samples collected from 453 different
    locations across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from May 2020 to June 2022. The
    collected composite samples were first incubated at 60 °C followed by filtration,
    concentration, and then RNA extraction using commercially available kits. The
    extracted RNA was then analyzed by one-step RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR, and the data
    was compared to the reported clinical cases. The average positivity rate in the
    wastewater samples was found to be 60.61 % (8.41–96.77 %), however, the positivity
    rate obtained from the RT-ddPCR was significantly higher than the RT-qPCR suggesting
    higher sensitivity of RT-ddPCR. Time-lagged correlation analysis indicated an
    increase in positive cases in the wastewater samples when the clinical positive
    cases declined suggesting that wastewater data are highly affected by the unreported
    asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and recovering individuals. The weekly SARS-CoV-2
    viral count in the wastewater samples are positively correlated with the diagnosed
    new clinical cases throughout the studied period and the studied locations. Viral
    count in wastewater peaked approximately one to two weeks prior to the peaks appearing
    in active clinical cases indicating that wastewater viral concentrations are effective
    in predicting clinical cases. Overall, this study further confirms the long-term
    sensitivity and robust approach of WBE to detect trends in SARS-CoV-2 spread and
    helps contribute to pandemic management. Graphical abstract Download : Download

    1. Introduction The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, caused
    by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first
    reported in Wuhan; the capital of Hubei Province in China at the end of December
    2019. On March 11th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global
    pandemic (WHO, 2020). As of Feb 4th 2023, there have been 672 million SARS-CoV-2
    infections and over 6.84 million confirmed deaths reported around the globe, with
    the real number of infections estimated to be much higher due to underreporting
    or inadequate reporting in some countries. Early detection and proper isolation
    of infected individuals from the healthy population is considered the most effective
    method to timely control viral transmission. Thus, large-scale clinical testing
    is essential to diagnose the state of the pandemic. Reverse transcriptase-quantitative
    polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered to be the most effective and
    accurate diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2. However, regular screening of millions
    in the population using RT-qPCR is highly challenging due to the delay between
    collecting samples and reporting results, resource-intensive processes, and limited
    clinical testing capacity in many places (Mercer and Salit, 2021). Moreover, individuals
    with asymptomatic infections and mild symptoms are less likely to get a diagnostic
    test and risk spreading the virus into a healthy population which can lead to
    a major outbreak. These limitations have prompted the development of alternative
    techniques to screen viral spread in the community (Foladori et al., 2020). Wastewater-based
    epidemiology (WBE) is considered a promising, real-time monitoring and cost-effective
    tool, that has successfully been used in screening various infectious agents (such
    as polio, hepatitis A and norovirus), as well as chemicals of interest including
    pharmaceuticals, and illicit drugs (Baz-Lomba et al., 2016; Brouwer et al., 2018;
    La Rosa et al., 2014; van Nuijs et al., 2011). WBE has been used in public health
    as a tool to understand the level of infection spread and to give early warning
    signals before a pandemic outbreak regardless of symptomatic or asymptomatic infections
    in the community (Baz-Lomba et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2018; Wölfel et al., 2020;
    Xiao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020b). Moreover, wastewater
    testing requires few samples to diagnose a wide population in larger demographical
    areas. Numerous studies on the detection of SARS-CoV-2''s RNA in wastewater were
    reported (Shah et al., 2022), the earliest of which came from the Netherlands
    (Medema et al., 2020), the USA (Sherchan et al., 2020), Australia (Ahmed et al.,
    2020), Italy (La Rosa et al., 2020) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Albastaki
    et al., 2021) (Hasan et al., 2021). However, many of these studies were mainly
    focused on establishing WBE as a proof of concept and the studies were conducted
    on a small sample size with limited time frame. A long-term detailed study was
    required to further validate the reliability of wastewater SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.
    UAE became the first Middle Eastern nation to report a COVID-19 case on January
    29th, 2020. The Ministry of Health and Prevention announced the first two COVID-19-related
    deaths on March 21st. As of February 4th 2023, UAE has reported >1.04 million
    SARS-CoV-2 infections and 2348 COVID-19 deaths. During the pandemic, several measures
    to control the spread of the virus were implemented by the UAE public health authorities,
    and these included face mask mandates, partial and full lockdowns, social distancing
    mandates, limitations on crowd gathering, mass clinical testing, and sanitization
    campaigns. SARS-CoV-2 WBE surveillance in UAE was first started at Khalifa University
    in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior and Abu Dhabi Department of Energy
    on May 10th, 2020 as a proof of concept, with initial findings and results from
    that study published online in October 2020 (Hasan et al., 2021). In this first
    study, we successfully demonstrated a method to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2
    in wastewater including influents and treated effluents collected from wastewater
    treatment plants (WWTPs), and sewer manholes across the country. We reported that
    SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in around 85 % of the untreated wastewater samples,
    with viral loads that ranged between 2.86E+02 and over 2.90E+04 viral genome copies/L.
    These results were in line with the clinically reported COVID-19 cases in the
    population (NECMA, 2022). Furthermore, we also showed in that study that effluents
    after water treatment were free of SARS-CoV-2, confirming the efficiency of the
    wastewater treatment method in eliminating the virus. In the current study, we
    report on the long-term reliability of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 through wastewater
    surveillance by analyzing data from 16,858 samples over 26 months (May 2020 to
    June 2022). To the best of our knowledge, this work covers the longest period
    and the largest sample size in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to date. The
    wastewater samples were collected from 453 different locations involving 50 WWTPs
    and pumping stations, approximately 150 schools from all Emirates, as well as
    various sewer manholes, catchment areas from specific buildings, hospitals, shopping
    malls, and other locations around the country. RT-qPCR and digital droplet PCR
    (ddPCR) methods were used for viral quantification. The results obtained from
    our wastewater sample analysis were correlated with the clinically reported cases
    in UAE. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Wastewater sites and sampling Municipal
    wastewater samples (400–500 mL) were collected from 453 locations around different
    Emirates of UAE (Fig. 1). The locations included WWTPs and the secondary sewer
    access points that are linked to them and located in residential building, schools,
    commercial establishments, and hospitals. A total of 16,858 wastewater samples
    were collected from 10th May 2020 to 30th June 2022. The sampling method and the
    sample preparation protocol were performed as previously described (Hasan et al.,
    2021). Briefly, autosamplers were used to collect composite wastewater samples
    at a fixed-time schedule (1 h) over a period of 24 h. Through the collection time
    the samples were preserved at 4-6 °C. The hourly collected samples were mixed
    thoroughly and about 400–500 mL sample was withdrawn to a sterile polypropylene
    (PP) plastic bottle and transported to the Water Intelligent Testing Laboratory
    (WITC) at Khalifa University (Abu Dhabi, UAE). To minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2
    transmission, the samples were thermally deactivated by immersing the bottles
    in a 60 °C water bath (WiseBath®, Witeg Labortechnik GmbH, Germany) for 60 min.
    After heat inactivation, the samples were allowed to reach room temperature prior
    to filtration and viral concentration. Download : Download high-res image (246KB)

    emirates by their size. 2.2. Wastewater sample filtration and RNA concentration
    Previously deactivated samples were filtered through Millipore Express® PLUS 0.22
    μm polyethersulfone (PES) 250 mL sterile vacuum bottle-top filters connected to
    WELCH 2546C-02A vacuum pump (Gardner Denver Thomas, Inc.). This initial filtration
    was conducted to separate sediments, large particles, and bacteria present in
    the wastewater samples. The viruses in the filtrate were then concentrated using
    Ultra-30 Amicon™ PP concentration/spin column (15 mL columns with 7.6 cm2 filtration
    area, Millipore Sigma™) with 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) (Hasan et
    al., 2021). A total of 50 mL filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of 250–400
    μL, the concentrated sample was then transferred to a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf
    tube for viral RNA extraction. 2.3. Viral RNA extraction and quantification Viral
    RNA was purified from the concentrated samples using ABIO pure Viral DNA/RNA Extraction
    kits (Alliance Bio Inc., Bothell, WA US, Cat#M561VT50) according to the manufacturer''s
    instructions. Internal extraction control RNA provided with the RT-qPCR kit was
    added to the samples before the RNA extraction in order to verify the successful
    extraction in case of a negative SARS-CoV-2 result. RNA was eluted in a final
    volume of 40 μL of elution buffer. The viral load in the samples delivered during
    the period between May 2020 and January 2021 was determined by RT-qPCR using the
    GENESIG COVID-19 kit (Primerdesign Ltd., UK, Cat#Z-Path-2019-nCoV) following the
    manufacturer''s protocol. The assay targets the RdRP gene. All samples were tested
    in triplicate and the average quantities were reported. A no-template negative
    control was included in all RT-qPCR assays. Ct values of positive control dilutions
    were plotted against known concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 positive control to
    generate standard curves for each run and curves were accepted when R2 values
    were > 0.98. Samples received between February 2021 and June 2022 were analyzed
    by ddPCR (Bio-Rad, CA, US) using the SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR kit (N1 and N2 genes) (Bio-Rad,
    Cat#12013743). A positive control was provided and consisted of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic
    RNA spiked into a sample-like matrix. Positive standards were extracted following
    the same method as wastewater samples. The PCR reactions were prepared and performed
    following the manufacturer''s instructions and 9.9 μL of the extracted sample
    was used as a template. A no-template negative control was included in all ddPCR
    assays. Droplets were generated using the Bio-Rad QX200 Automated Droplet Generator
    and read in Bio-Rad QX200 Droplet Reader. Resulting data was analyzed using QuantaSoft
    Analysis Pro v1.0 Software to determine the quantitative presence of SARS-Cov-2
    target genes. The number of accepted droplets was 10,000 on average and samples
    with a droplet number below 8000 were repeated. The RT-qPCR kit used in this assay
    is intended for the testing of clinical swabs. However, the results obtained in
    this work and in previous studies have shown that clinical RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2
    testing kits can successfully detect the virus in wastewater samples [25–28].
    Viral loads (copies/L) were normalized with reference to the flow rate of the
    collection point (m3/day). 2.4. Comparison between RT-qPCR and ddPCR To compare
    the sensitivities of RT-qPCR and ddPCR in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater,
    a positive wastewater sample as determined by ddPCR (402.9 and 326.3 copies/μL
    of extracted sample for N1 and N2, respectively) was serially diluted seven times
    and run in triplicate using both methods. The obtained copy number for RdRP (RT-qPCR),
    and N1/N2 genes (ddPCR) were plotted in function of the percentage of the initial
    sample in the PCR reaction. The differences in amplification efficiencies between
    RT-qPCR and ddPCR was further assessed by comparing the measured RNA copies for
    RdRP, and averaged copies for N1 and N2 genes in 20 random wastewater samples.
    2.5. Statistical analysis Paired t-test was used to compare the copy numbers of
    RdRP, and average copy numbers for N1 and N2 genes in 20 random wastewater samples.
    Clinical case data from Feb 1st, 2020 to June 30th, 2022 was obtained from the
    National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority (NCEMA) (https://covid19.ncema.gov.ae/en).
    The positivity rates for clinical cases and the wastewater samples were calculated
    using Eqs. (1), (2); respectively: (1) (2) Kruskal Wallis test followed by Dunn''s
    Multiple Comparison post-hoc test were performed to compare the viral loads (genome
    copies/L) in all wastewater samples collected from different Emirates. Pearson''s
    correlation and linear regression analyses were performed to determine the correlation
    between wastewater positivity rates and the clinical samples'' positivity rates.
    To explore temporal correlation effects between the positivity rate in clinical
    samples and wastewater, time-lagged correlation coefficients were calculated for
    up to 21 days (7 days'' increment). Linear regression analysis was performed for
    targets N1 and N2 concentrations comparison. N1 and N2 concentrations were averaged
    and normalized by flow rate for each sample and the viral loads were summed by
    week for each STP. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess differences in quantified
    weekly viral loads (log10 transformed) between outbreak and outbreak-free periods
    in different Emirates. Outbreak-free period was defined by dates when the number
    of weekly new cases was less or equal to the first quartile of the confirmed weekly
    cases thorough the whole study period (2135 cases), while outbreak period was
    defined by dates when the number of weekly cases was more or equal to the third
    quartile (10,825). Spearman''s rank correlation coefficients were used to determine
    the relationship between the averaged wastewater N1 and N2 concentrations for
    a given week and the associated COVID-19 cases, average weekly active cases, total
    recovered cases and total deaths for the same period. The cross-correlation coefficients
    were determined for a lag time of 7, 14 and 21 days. Statistical analyses were
    conducted using Microsoft Excel and OriginPro 2020b (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton,
    MA, USA). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in wastewater
    and clinical samples SARS-CoV-2 virus surveillance in wastewater was adopted by
    many countries soon after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. These studies
    investigated the presence of viral RNA in wastewater as a tool to monitor the
    spread of the virus in different geographic locations. In UAE, the SARS-CoV-2
    wastewater surveillance program started on May 10th 2020 and continues to this
    day (i.e. February 2023). The daily testing of wastewater samples collected from
    different geographic locations presents a great opportunity to investigate the
    distribution of the virus over time and examine the long-term reliability of this
    method when compared to clinical testing. The numbers of samples collected from
    different Emirates are given in Table 1. Collection sites included WWTPs, sewer
    catchments and manholes located near shopping malls, market places, schools, and
    individual buildings. Table 1. Number of locations and wastewater samples collected
    from each Emirate. Emirates Population # Locations # Samples received # Samples

    the largest emirate accounting for 87 % (Fig. 1) of the total country area and
    hence, the highest number of wastewater samples were collected from this region
    (14,950 samples). The remaining samples were collected from the other Emirates.
    The positivity rates of the tested wastewater samples varied between the different
    Emirates and were 59.46 % in AUD, 81.69 % in SHJ, 83.71 % in AJM, 93 % in UAQ,
    81.76 % in RAK, and 81.16 % in FUJ. AUD showed the lowest percentage of positive
    samples compared to other Emirates and had a lower viral abundance in positive
    samples (p < 0.0001) (Fig. S1). The quantified viral loads in other Emirates were
    comparable except for RAK that showed significantly lower counts compared to AJM
    (p = 0.004). The low positivity rate and viral counts in AUD can be explained
    by the higher number of samples received from this Emirate and the variation in
    the nature of the collection points. Samples received from other Emirates were
    mainly collected from WWTPs that serve larger communities and were therefore more
    likely to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Fig. 2 shows tested wastewater samples and
    the positive wastewater samples detected in each Emirate per month. Download :

    samples for each emirate is also shown. UAQ: Umm Al Quwain. The different locations
    showed different trends in the number of positive samples over time. However,
    no correlation between the positivity rates in clinical and wastewater samples
    was observed for any of the locations. The total number of clinical cases across
    the entire country was used to calculate the clinical positivity rate, which can
    explain the lack of correlation with wastewater positivity rates of specific regions.
    The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 in all tested wastewater samples was then compared
    to the data obtained in clinical samples between May 10th, 2020, and June 30th,
    2022. The average positivity rate in clinical samples was 0.71 % (0.02–2.29 %)
    and the number of weekly-performed tests varied widely (Fig. 3a). Four major peaks
    in the number of positive cases were observed between May 2020 and June 2022.
    The first peak was observed on the 22nd of October 2020 with 1578 cases reported.
    The highest peak occurred on February 3rd, 2021 and 3977 cases were reported at
    the time, and a third peak was recorded on June 26th, 2021 (2282 cases). A linear
    and considerable drop in the number of cases followed between July and November
    2021. The decrease in cases was associated with a decrease in the positivity rate
    while the number of conducted tests was comparable throughout this period suggesting
    a decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. A fourth peak was recorded on January 15th,
    2022 (3116 cases). This peak was associated with a higher number of conducted
    tests and a lower positivity rate compared to the first and second peaks. A considerable
    drop in the number of cases followed until May 2022. Download : Download high-res

    Major outbreak periods are indicated. As expected, the major COVID-19 outbreaks
    were observed soon after long public holidays, possibly due to large public gatherings,
    family gatherings, social activities, and traveling (Table S1). It is also worth
    noting that the decline in the number of cases between March and November 2021
    occurred during the active vaccination period. The overall pattern of the coronavirus
    pandemic according to the clinical data has been a series of COVID-19 waves. A
    similar pattern in the number of positive samples over time was observed in wastewater
    data (Fig. 3b) and the average positivity rate was 60.61 % (8.41–96.77 %). The
    correlation between the positivity rates in wastewater and clinical samples was
    investigated during the four recorded waves of cases (August 2020–January 2021,
    January 2021–May 2021, May 2021–December 2021, and December 2021–April 2022).
    The model was shifted ±21 days (in 7 day increments) and the time-lagged correlation
    coefficients were calculated (Fig. 4). We used the positivity rate in clinical
    samples as reference and determined the lag time of the positivity rate in wastewater
    in relation to the clinical data. A negative lag indicates that the clinical data
    preceded the wastewater positivity rate. The linear regression models for the
    different studied periods are shown in Fig. S2. During the first COVID-19 wave,
    the positivity rate in wastewater correlated negatively with the positivity rate
    of clinical samples at lag 0 (Fig. 4a). Out of the total 16,858 wastewater samples
    that were tested, 4350 samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR (May 2020 to January 2021)
    and the positivity rate was 29.5 %. Wastewater samples received in the following
    period (12,508 samples) were analyzed by ddPCR and 70 % of the samples showed
    a positive result. The negative correlation during the first wave was therefore
    possibly due to the reduced sensitivity of the RT-qPCR method compared to ddPCR
    for viral RNA quantification in wastewater. In addition, the number of clinical
    tests performed during the first wave was significantly smaller compared to later
    outbreaks which may have affected the correlation with wastewater positivity.
    The strong negative correlation was also measured during the second wave at lag
    0 (r(18) = −0.768, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4b). This indicates that the positivity rates
    in wastewater followed an inverse trend compared to clinical cases showing an
    increase in positive samples with time. One possible explanation is the important
    drop in the numbers of collected and tested wastewater samples throughout this
    wave which could have affected the positivity rates. Previous studies have also
    shown that stool sample remained positive between 1 and 33 days after the nasopharyngeal
    swab turned negative (Gupta et al., 2020). The long-term detection of SARS-CoV-2
    in stool samples compared to respiratory samples may explain the increase in positive
    wastewater samples after the decline in cases (Daou et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2020)
    and the observed correlation may be affected by previously confirmed and recovering
    COVID-19 cases. During the second wave, the highest number of cases in the country
    was reported following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants
    of concern (Alsafar et al., 2022). Earlier and later infections as well as new
    variant-dependent viral shedding dynamics may have considerably affected the results.
    This was further confirmed by the trend detected during the third (Fig. 4c) and
    fourth (Fig. 4d) waves of COVID-19 cases where the strongest positive correlations
    were observed at lag values of 0 (r(28) = 0.841, p < 0.0001 and r(22) = 0.504,
    p = 0.01 for the third and fourth waves, respectively) and − 7 (r(28) = 0.820,
    p < 0.0001 and r(22) = 0.496, p = 0.014 for the third and fourth waves; respectively).
    According to a systematic review of 95 studies involving 29,776,306 participants
    undergoing testing, 40.50 % of cases with confirmed COVID-19 are asymptomatic
    infections (Ma et al., 2021). In addition, individuals are more likely to perform
    a test after symptom onset, while viral shedding in faeces and sputum may have
    already begun. This further suggests that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic unreported
    cases may have contributed to the higher positivity rates in wastewater, especially
    after high vaccination rates were reached (>85 % in October 2021) and COVID-19
    restrictions were eased. A similar result was previously reported showing that
    while vaccination rates increased, new cases and hospitalizations decreased but
    wastewater viral loads increased (Nattino et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res

    ±21 days (by 7 days) to calculate the time-lagged correlation coefficients. The
    dashed lines represent the threshold for significant correlations. 3.2. Correlation
    between SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater and clinical data The relationship
    between the viral load detected in wastewater samples collected from major WWTPs
    and the number of new COVID-19 cases was measured. Previous studies have shown
    that ddPCR is more sensitive than RT-qPCR for analyzing both, clinical and wastewater
    samples; moreover, the ddPCR method significantly reduces the effect of inhibitors
    on the amplification and has greater repeatability compared to RT-qPCR (Graham
    et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022; Pavšič et al., 2016). ddPCR showed
    higher sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR in determining the viral count in a serially
    diluted sample (Fig. S3a). The detected copies of N1 and N2 genes by ddPCR were
    significantly higher than the detected copies of RdRP gene by RT-qPCR for all
    dilutions and only ddPCR successfully detected the presence of the virus in the
    1:1000 dilution reaction. Results of the paired t-test indicated that there is
    a significant large difference between RdRP copies/L wastewater detected by RT-qPCR
    (M = 1130.9, SD = 1196.6) and the averaged concentration of N1 and N2 copies/L
    wastewater detected by ddPCR (M = 3937.2, SD = 4232.4), t(19) = 3.7, p = 0.001
    for the 20 tested samples (Fig. S3b). In addition, RT-qPCR failed to detected
    the virus in two samples containing small titers (S14 and S19). The investigation
    included therefore eight major WWTPs from different locations across the country
    (one from each of FUJ, AJM, RAK, SHJ, UAQ and three from AUD) and all wastewater
    samples analyzed by ddPCR (2021 and 2022) due to the higher sensitivity of this
    method. The SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 targets measured by RT-ddPCR correlated well
    with each other for all measured WWTP locations (R2 = 0.980–0.992). N1 and N2
    concentrations were consequently averaged and normalized by flow rate for each
    sample and the viral loads were summed by week for each WWTP. A Mann-Whitney U
    test indicated that the detected weekly wastewater viral loads were significantly
    different between outbreak (weekly new cases ≥10,825) and outbreak-free periods
    (weekly new cases ≤2135) for all locations (Table 2) and the virus was significantly
    more abundant in the wastewater samples collected during outbreak periods compared
    to outbreak-free periods (Fig. 5). Similarly, peaks in SARS-CoV-2 count in wastewater
    collected from hospitals in Calgary (Canada) have been previously associated with
    increased incident cases and outbreak (Acosta et al., 2021). Table 2. Mann-Whitney

    FUJ: Fujairah. The quantified weekly viral loads varied considerably over time
    and different peaks were identified (Fig. 6). The major peaks occurred at similar
    time periods for all locations, however, the measured viral loads were different.
    Overall, viral abundance in wastewater followed a similar trend to the weekly
    diagnosed cases across the country. This was particularly visible during the third
    and fourth COVID-19 waves. SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed the highest values in the numbers
    of genome copies per week during January 2022 (6.41E+11–1.84E+13 genome copies/WWTP/week)
    and June 2022 (5.77E+11–1.48E+13 copies/WWTP/week). In January 2022, a major peak
    in confirmed COVID-19 cases was also reported (3116 cases on January 15th, 2022)
    and a steady increase in the number of new daily cases was observed in June 2022.
    Interestingly, viral count in wastewater peaked approximately one to two weeks
    prior to reporting a peak in confirmed new daily cases. This was clearly visible
    in January and June 2022 suggesting that a peak in wastewater viral concentrations
    can reveal in advance a peak in clinical infections. A similar trend was previously
    reported during the initial rise of cases in Halifax, Canada and in Massachusetts
    (Huang et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022). A nine-week wastewater study of ten wastewater
    facilities in Utah (USA) also found significant correlation between SARS-CoV-2
    RNA in wastewater and weekly new cases, however, the increase in cases was found
    to occur concurrently or precede the increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater
    (Weidhaas et al., 2021). Another study investigating the presence of SARS-CoV-2
    in wastewater collected from New York (USA) found that a 1 log10 change in the
    number of N1 genome copies per day corresponded to a 0.6 log10 change in the number
    of new COVID-19 cases per day providing an evidence of the positive correlation
    between SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and laboratory-confirmed cases (Hoar et al., 2022).

    viral loads for each location and the diagnosed new cases are presented in Table
    3. The weekly SARS-CoV-2 viral count in wastewater samples positively correlated
    with the number of diagnosed new cases throughout the studied period and for all
    six emirates. Although significant, the positive correlation in the case of samples
    collected from Abu Dhabi was weaker compared to other locations. This can be explained
    by the implemented strict COVID-19 policies in Abu Dhabi, including distant learning,
    border rules and isolation upon arrival from overseas (Table S1). Table 3. The

    in at the major outbreak periods, only wastewater samples collected from Fujairah
    positively correlated with new cases during the second COVID-19 wave (January
    2021–May 2021). On the other hand, a positive correlation was detected during
    the third and fourth COVID-19 waves for all locations. The strongest correlation
    was obtained between the viral load in wastewater samples collected from Abu Dhabi
    and the number of cases during the third wave (r(25) = 0.902, p < 0.0001). Interestingly,
    cases during this wave peaked on June 26th following the implementation of Al
    Hosn green pass (June 15th, 2021) that required a negative PCR test to enter public
    places. The implementation of this rule has led to increased testing in Abu Dhabi
    and therefore increased detection of positive cases in this Emirate, especially
    asymptomatic cases, which can explain the observed strong correlation during that
    period. The results obtained support the theory that WBE is a powerful tool to
    monitor the rate of incidence of COVID-19 infections in the community. Similar
    positive correlations between SAR-CoV-2 RNA copies in wastewater and COVID-19
    cases have been reported in many countries including Mexico, USA, Argentina, and
    Canada (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2021; D''Aoust et al., 2021; Giraud-Billoud et
    al., 2021). However, unlike previous short-term studies, the extended testing
    overtime in the current study gave us the opportunity to detect trends in the
    presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater that are indicative of changes in the spread
    of the virus in the community, such as the emergence of new variants or the effectiveness
    of control measures. This was particularly noticed in the results obtained in
    samples collected from Abu Dhabi in which implemented control measures were strict
    and well documented in time. The sum of the weekly viral load from the eight investigated
    WWTPs also correlated with total confirmed cases per week and the strongest correlation
    was observed during the third wave. The average weekly active cases (r(72) = 0.435,
    p = 0.0001) and the total recovered cases per week (r(72) = 0.242, p = 0.037)
    showed a positive correlation with the summed viral load while no correlation
    was observed with total weekly deaths (r(72) = 0.151, p = 0.2) (Fig. S4). The
    cross-correlation between the viral load in wastewater and the clinical data variables
    during the fourth COVID-19 wave was then determined by shifting the models by
    7, 14 and 21 days (Fig. 7). We used the viral count in wastewater as reference
    and determined the lag time of clinical data (new cases, recovered cases, average
    active cases, and total deaths) in relation to viral concentration in wastewater.
    A negative lag indicates that wastewater concentrations preceded clinical events.
    The results showed that increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater occurred
    concurrently with the increase of total new cases (r(16) = 0.736, p = 0.002) and
    total deaths (r(16) = 0.689, p = 0.003), and preceded by 7 days total weekly recovered
    cases (r(16) = 0.504, p = 0.04) and the average active cases (r(16) = 0.542, p
    = 0.027). It was previously shown that SARS-CoV-2 positivity in wastewater can
    precede spikes in active COVID-19 cases by 7 days (Toledo et al., 2022). Another
    paper also found an association between the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater
    and 14-day incidence rates with active infection (Lastra et al., 2022). Clinical
    data, and particularly confirmed new cases can be prone to systematic bias due
    to limited clinical testing capacity and a time delay between sample collection
    and reporting. This in turn highly influence the observed time-dependent correlation
    with SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. Average weekly active cases on the
    other hand reflects better the prevalence of the disease by reducing the reporting
    delay effect and including cases at different stages of the infection and who
    might be contributing equally to the detected load in wastewater. The observed
    lagged-correlation between wastewater viral count and average active cases is
    therefore an indicator that wastewater is predictive of COVID-19 prevalence in
    a community. The strong correlation with the reported COVID-19 deaths at lag 0
    and lag −7 further indicates that the infection dynamics and severity can also
    be mirrored and predicted by WBE. This relationship was previously established
    in a study conducted in Greece showing that RNA load in raw wastewater collected
    from a major WWTP is a primary predictor of new COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations,
    and ICU admissions by 5, 8, and 9 days, respectively (Galani et al., 2022). A
    similar predictive pattern was observed in Austria where viral loads in sewage
    preceded Covid-19 hospitalisation occupancy by 14.8–17.7 and 8.6–11.6 days for
    ICU and non-ICU, respectively (Schenk et al., 2023). Download : Download high-res

    Wastewater analysis of large number of samples (16,858 samples) over 26 months
    across 453 locations in UAE suggested that WBE can be implemented successfully
    to monitor at all levels from individual buildings to WWTPs and serve as an important
    tool in monitoring COVID-19 in UAE. This long-term study provided a larger sample
    size as compared to previous short-term studies, which allowed for better statistical
    analysis, reduced variability, and more accurate results. It also allowed for
    the detection of trends in the prevalence of the virus over time and that were
    driven by vaccination rates, variants emergence and implemented control measures.
    Long-term WBE further showed to be an effective way to capture asymptomatic cases
    of COVID-19, which are cases where individuals shed the virus in wastewater but
    are not diagnosed as official cases. Asymptomatic cases can be missed in short-term
    studies, which may only capture individuals who are showing symptoms at the time
    of the study. Our results also validated the higher sensitivity of RT-ddPCR technique
    than the regular RT-qPCR in detecting and quantifying the viral loads in wastewater
    samples. Furthermore, the study indicated that the WBE is successful in the identification
    of more asymptomatic cases than the clinical tests, which could help in the tracking
    the virus spread trend in specific clusters and sectors. The results confirm the
    use of WBE as an early warning tool in predicting the upcoming outbreak, moreover,
    the wastewater analysis can be used as a cost-effective alternative to high-frequency
    diagnostic testing. Additionally, this results validation and confirmation of
    WBE in the longer-term monitoring and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. CRediT authorship

    1.1. Ecological Contamination with Glyphosate According to the United Nations
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the world’s population will attain ∼9.7
    billion by 2050, corresponding to a 32% projected growth. (1) A recent meta-analysis
    of projected global food demand revealed that the total global food demand should
    increase by 35% to 56% between 2010 and 2050. (2) The food shortage threat belongs
    to global agriculture’s most harmful socio-economic and environmental challenges.
    (3) Aside from the COVID-19 pandemic, (4) increases in temperature and atmospheric
    CO2 concentration, the environmental pollution of agrochemicals arising from ill-considered
    farming and insufficient fertilizer delivery systems has become a civilization
    problem. (5) 2020-Forecasted global agrochemical annual use was 120 million tons
    for nitrogen-based fertilizers, 50 million tons for phosphate-based fertilizers,
    and over 2.6 million tons for pesticides. (6,7) In recent decades, the nutrient-use
    efficiency (NUE) has dropped significantly, i.e., over 50% of the N, 85% of the
    P are not assimilated by crops, (8,9) and less than 10% of the applied pesticides
    reach their targets. (5) If not handled, these usages were estimated to increase
    by 50–90% by 2050. (5,10) The first global initiative to solve agriculture’s challenges
    began with the Third Agricultural (Green) Revolution in the 1950s and 1960s. (11)
    This technology transfer involved (i) high-throughput cultivation of high-yielding
    varieties of cereal seeds, (ii) improvement of the NUE by spatiotemporal biofertilization
    and microbial biodiversity, and (iii) reduction of the reactive nitrogen species
    use and nitrogen oxide emission. In the 1970s, it was followed by the Gene Revolution,
    (12) based on the extensive use of genetically engineered (GE) herbicide-resistant
    crops, especially glyphosate (GLP)-resistant plants, which resulted in yield increases,
    tillage reduction, and enhanced the high technology-based weed management. (13)
    Yet, despite several advantages of lowering greenhouse gas emission, (14) the
    large-scale misuse of GLP-based herbicides (GBHs) and GLP-resistant crops and
    GLP-resistant weed-originated single mode-of-action herbicides has caused environmental
    pollution with GLP, herbicide resistance, superweeds, and pests generation, as
    well as consuming GE organisms and GBH-contaminated products, which have consequently
    re-empowered the expensive tillage. (13,15) These outcomes have boosted the international
    debate on the policy controlling or forbidding GBH exploitation and, on the other
    hand, developing sensors for GLP contaminants that emerged in the environment
    over the last 50 years. (16) Emerging malnourishment, inappropriate weed management,
    and critically imbalanced and anthropogenically altered P-cycle have been recognized
    by the U.S. National Science Foundation as some of the most crucial challenges
    of modern and future agriculture and ecology, which require advances both in proper
    fertilizing and devising portable and sensitive tools of chemical analysis in
    agriculture and ecology. (3,17,18) 1.2. Smart Materials in Precision Agriculture
    The latest advancements in agriculture and ecology originated with precision agriculture
    (PA). According to the International Society of Precision Agriculture (ISPAg)
    (https://www.ispag.org), (19) PA is “a management strategy that gathers, processes,
    and analyzes temporal, spatial, and individual data and combines them with other
    information to support management decisions according to estimated variability
    for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and
    sustainability of agricultural production.” PA’s most crucial challenge is reducing
    herbicide resistance in weed management. In 2021, the herbicide market value accounted
    for ∼30 billion USD and was forecasted to reach ∼40 billion USD by 2027 (https://www.imarcgroup.com/herbicides-market).
    Expectedly, herbicide-resistant weed management (HRWM) shall comprise almost half
    of the modern agricultural activities, including tillage, crop and herbicide diversity,
    and growing GE herbicide-resistant plants. (20) The increase in the NUE and crop
    productions will be achieved by applying artificial intelligence (AI)-excelled
    devices and smart materials (SMs), (21) including engineered nanomaterials (ENMs)
    and biomaterials, (22) and plant wearable (PW) sensors, actuators, and soft robotics.
    (23) These PA HRWM nanobiotechnological tools enable direct, spatiotemporally
    targeted, and dose-dependent delivery as well as rapid, ultrasensitive, and selective
    determination of herbicides. SMs are well-defined, self-sensing, self-healing,
    and stimuli-responsive materials that change their properties and act according
    to their surroundings or external stimuli, including microorganisms, chemical
    compounds, heat, pH, temperature, electromagnetic field, light, humidity, ultrasounds,
    pressure, and mechanical factors. (21) The SMs are mostly based on electroactive,
    piezoelectric, shape memory, and biocompatible polymers. They are integrated with
    electronic devices implanted or installed in the site of interest. (21,23) Moreover,
    these devices, e.g., lab-on-chips (LOCs), microrobots, or smartphone-assisted
    nanosensors, exploit incorporated computational algorithms that allow for acquiring,
    processing, and analyzing vast amounts of data in real-time, thus providing a
    model simulation of spatial and seasonal distribution as well as risk assessment
    of agrochemicals. (3,17,18,24) Regarding PA-dedicated SM sensors, there is a need
    for advanced inexpensive, highly efficient, multifunctional, and flexible consumer-
    and operator-friendly tools that can determine analytes, including toxins, pests,
    herbicides, and microbes in nonlaboratory settings, hardly accessible locations,
    and diverse agroecosystems. (25,26) Conventional multimodal chemosensors utilize
    immunochemical receptors, targeted to toxic fertilizers and pesticide residuals,
    and electrochemical and/or optical transducers. However, because of the environmental
    systems’ complexity, vulnerabilities, and uncertainties, these conventional sensors
    will hopefully be upgraded or replaced with smart sensors equipped with computational
    devices. (27) In AI PA smart sensors, these conventional sensors are assembled
    or virtually connected with computational devices that convey the machine learning
    (ML), deep learning (DL), artificial neural networks, nanoinformatics, and translational
    bioinformatics algorithms to integrate, compute, process, analyze, and interpret
    the massive amounts of spatiotemporal data. (17,3,18) Hence, PA SM sensors, based
    on smartphones, soft robotics, robotic-automated vehicles, and drones, provide
    rapid, mobile, and high-throughput analysis. Moreover, they afford high-quality,
    decision-making outcomes for herbicide misuse control and sustained and profitable
    agricultural production and weed management. (3,17,18,28,29) For instance, DL-enhanced
    computing methods enable the analysis of high-resolution spectral images of herbicide-sprayed
    plants mapped by scanning transmission X-ray microscopy or X-ray fluorescence
    spectroscopy. (30,31) Data science-excelled and PA-targeted SM sensors can generally
    analyze short- or long-term weather conditions, soil properties, plant diseases,
    pests, microbial communities, and industrial pollution. (3,17,18) Smart sensors
    and sensor networks must sense and sustain optimal conditions for plant cultivation,
    including moisture, temperature, pH, nutrients, and agrochemicals. (3) Environment-friendly
    AI PA targets the dynamic and complex nature of the local agroecosystem by synergistic
    application of theoretical prediction models and experimental stimuli-responsive
    delivery-detection tools. If attached or administrated to the soil, plant, or
    crops, the AI PA sensor can capture, digitize, and process images, as well as
    detect, monitor, respond, and regulate physicochemical stimuli and atmospheric
    conditions in an information-supported decision-making manner. (18) Since pests
    cause 34% of crop loss globally, controlling and increasing crop yields is essential.
    (32) By predicting the ecosystem components’ behavior, PA provides a real-time
    response to weather conditions, nutrient cycling, crop growth, plant phenotyping,
    disease diagnosis, weed infestation, insect damage, and food production, as well
    as emerging contamination with these agents. These data are then correlated to
    the site-targeted delivery, uptake, detection, retention, performance, interaction,
    and transformation of nanomaterial-based agrochemicals in plants. 1.3. Artificial
    Intelligence-Excelled SM Sensors AI PA technologies have excelled in using self-powered
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), weed patches, and PW sensors for remote and in
    situ monitoring. (3,23) They involve nanosensors and nanomaterial-based delivery
    systems, PWs, and nanorobots that leverage online databases and algorithms of
    cheminformatics and translational bioinformatics. (3,18) As a result, they enable
    spatiotemporal management of crops and livestock, low-cost in situ nutrient-sensing,
    precise agrochemical/fertilizer placement, and soil and plant tissue testing.
    By constantly measuring vegetative indices and evapotranspiration rates, AI PA
    helps control various and diverse plant growth conditions, nitrogen uptake, and
    secretion of nitrogen into the rhizosphere. Before applying these sensors, one
    must overcome potential environmental pollution and mechanical breakdown risks.
    The plant-implantable or PW sensors should be constructed from biocompatible,
    mechanically resistant, nanotechnology-excelled materials, thus allowing well-defined
    interaction with microbiomes and metabolites exudated by plant leaves and roots.
    (33−35) Although these sensors can be biotransformed or biodegraded in the phyllosphere,
    they are vulnerable to mechanical destruction, because of sudden weather changes.
    It is crucial to understand the (sensor material)-plant interactions, off-target
    performance, and long-term toxicity and persistence of the nanomaterial in the
    plant vascular structure and organelles, especially since the nanomaterials may
    penetrate the phloem and xylem, thus changing the fluid composition and flow rate.
    (18) Finally, because of large-scale demands, energy storage costs must be well-considered.
    The efficient use of smart sensors requires efficient handling of enormous amounts
    of digitized output images and biophysical and physiological comprehension to
    solve real problems of scheduling sowing and controlling pesticide usage, as well
    as tracking and predicting crop growth and quality. (36,37) Most advanced AI PA
    technologies propose intelligent self-powered WSNs and PW. (3,23) Characterized
    by low-power demand, long-duration processing, and near-field communication (NFC),
    WSNs are coarsely distributed and interconnected sensors, typically exploited
    for environmental in situ and real-time monitoring. The WSNs, equipped with fully
    rechargeable batteries or battery-free solar energy harvesting systems for power
    supply, are easily controlled and power-supplied by smartphones, provided the
    distance from the source is less than several meters. However, they have limitations,
    including reduced light in the shaded, bushy, and foliaged places or prolonged
    signal transmission resulting from far distances from the aboveground microstrip
    antenna to the underground sensor. (38,39) A similar technology underlies the
    modus operandi of PWs, i.e., the electronic devices implanted into the plant tissue
    for tracking and transmitting physiological parameters. Being an example of nanobionics,
    the PWs enable precise and continuous in-site or remote sensing of microclimate
    and tissue microenvironment changes, thus informing about the plant health and
    agrochemical performance. (40) An outstanding recent review presents the state
    of the art of the nano biotechnologically excelled PW sensors. (23) The present
    review focuses on developing analytical methods using conventional and SM-based
    sensors for GLP determination in water, food, crop, and soil samples. Expectedly,
    conventional sensors will soon be replaced by SM-based sensors. Examples of these
    sensors, including smartphone-integrated sensors, are briefly introduced and discussed
    herein. 2. Environmental and Human Toxicity of Glyphosate ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To 2.1. Glyphosate Structure and Properties Glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine
    (GLP), is a widely used broad-spectrum, nonselective, and postemergent herbicide
    for crop desiccation. (41) Since the approval for agricultural use by U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) in 1974 and the authorization in the EU in 2002, GLP-based
    surfactants (GLP-SH) and GBHs have been commercialized as Roundup and RangerPro
    in over 140 countries, covering 350 million hectares of crops, with an annual
    turnover of 11 billion USD worldwide. (42,43) According to the FAO, GBHs’ global
    market constitutes 18% of the total pesticide active ingredients (ActIs) and 92%
    of herbicide ActIs, with a global annual revenue accounting for 11 billion USD.
    (43) As a powerful tool of modern crop management, prior-harvesting large-scale
    GBH interventions, called “green burndowns,” are expected to meet the growing
    demands for food and crops production, which are projected to increase to 100–110%
    by 2050. (41,44) 2.2. The Weed-Killing Activity of Glyphosate GLP reversibly inhibits
    the 5-enolpyruvynyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS, EC 2.5.1.19) involved
    in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants (45) and some microorganisms.
    (46−49) Roundup Ready crops are GLP-tolerant because they are genetically modified
    to carry the CP4 EPSPS gene derived from Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4, a naturally
    GLP-resistant rhizosphere bacteria. (46) Moreover, the harmful efficacy of GLP
    against plant development strongly depends on the daily and circadian rhythms
    of the plant cells, (42) and plants die within 4–20 days after crop spraying.
    (50) This chronotherapeutic responsiveness of plants to GLP brings hope for optimized
    crop protection and safe food production security. GBHs are commonly used in agriculture,
    industry, forestry, and weed management. From 1974 to 2014, the GBHs’ use increased
    100-fold. However, the current regulations for the safety standards of GBH handling
    still rely on the studies performed in the late 1980s. Although the ∼90% growth
    of all GE seeds produced by Monsanto in 1996 is considered safe, (51) and despite
    extensive research conducted in human biomonitoring, hazard assessments, epidemiological
    studies including occupationally exposed workers, pregnant women, and their offspring,
    and evaluation and standardization, the GBH safety to humans and the environment
    is still questioned. (52) The major issues concern the environmental pollution
    that affects crops, soil, surface and groundwaters, sediment, and the spreading
    through wind and erosion, thus threatening wildlife and human occupational activities
    on farmlands and GBH factories. (53−56) Various strategies for mitigating the
    global persistence and hazardous exposure to have been developed, as reviewed
    elsewhere. (54) 2.3. Human Toxicity of Glyphosate The EPA-established daily chronic
    reference dose of GLP is 1.7 mg/kg of body weight, with a nonobservable adverse
    effect level of 50 mg/kg per day dose. (43,57) Average urinary GLP levels for
    occupational exposure and nonoccupational exposure range from 0.26 to 73.5 μg/L
    and 0.13–7.6 μg/L, respectively. (58) As an organophosphate (OP), GLP efficiently
    transmits orally, dermally, conjunctively, gastrointestinally, and via respiratory
    routes. (56) According to the EFSA, GLP has low acute toxicity owing to the absence
    of the EPSP-metabolic pathway in vertebrates and the rapid degradation of GLP
    in mammals (half-life time of ∼5–10 h). (57,58) However, occupational poisonings
    have become a global medical issue because of environmental pollution. (59) Regarding
    genetic modification of GLP-tolerant crops, it is crucial to delineate the potential
    genotoxicity of the transgenic plants (60−63) from the chemical toxicity of commercial
    GBH coformulants, including GLP isopropylamine (GLP-IPA) salt, polyoxyethyleneamine
    (POEA), and ppb traces of heavy metals, including chromium, cobalt, lead, or nickel
    (64,65) and GLP metabolites, e.g., (aminomethyl) phosphonic acid (AMPA) and glufosinate.
    (65) Because of the exquisitely disturbing impact of GBH surfactants on plant
    cell membranes, (66) these are regarded as the most harmful GBH ingredients, demonstrated
    as more toxic than GLP alone in mammal cells. (67−69) For example, a study on
    aquatic microorganisms (bacteria, microalgae, protozoa, and crustaceans) revealed
    the highest toxicity for POEA and GBH, whereas the only effect of GLP resulted
    from its acidity. (70) Analogically, commercial GLP-SHs occurred more toxic than
    GLP-IPA in short-term acute toxicity trials (24 and 48 h). (71) Moreover, in rats,
    12-week exposure to GBH caused significant increases in kidney biomarkers, oxidative
    stress markers, and membrane-bound enzymes, indicating the accumulation of GLP
    residues in the kidneys, while GLP alone caused no nephrotoxicity. (72) Concerning
    human toxicity, ingesting substantial GLP-SH volumes (100–500 mL) is associated
    with a human death rate up to 29.3%, depending on patients’ characteristics, such
    as age and intent of exposure. (73,74) The uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation
    and POEA- or (heavy metals)-induced cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary harms are
    major lethal causes. (74−76) According to a survey of medical reports of 107 patients,
    the ingestion of GLP-SH caused hypotension (47%), deterioration (38.6%), respiratory
    failure (30%), acute kidney injury (17.1%), and arrhythmia (10%). Interestingly,
    these complications depend on the volume of GLP-SH ingested and not the type of
    surfactant ingredient of the GBH. (77) Emergency treatment of those intoxications
    comprises gastric lavage followed by hemodiafiltration and direct hemoperfusion,
    enabling the removal of GLP-IPA (228 Da) and surfactants (over 500 Da), respectively.
    (78) Intensive care is required in severe GLP-SH intoxication, including dehydration,
    oliguria, paralytic ileus, hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema,
    hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. (79,78) 3. Sensors and Separation Systems
    for GLP Determination ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Nowadays, SM sensors are robustly
    applied to solve the most challenging environmental, socio-economic, and biomedical
    issues. Those involve rapid response to climate changes, real-time water, food,
    soil, and air quality monitoring, biotic and abiotic stress factors, nutrient
    recycling, sustained crop growth, biofuel production, point-of-care (POC) devices
    fabrication, and defense against bioterrorism. (22,80) Receptor items of the modern
    SM sensors are emerging-field-deployable chemo- and biosensors and synthetic biology
    tools capable of detecting pathogenic pollution in various ecosystems and industrial
    environments. They involve molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), aptamers, viruses,
    prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, and individual plants or insects that are able
    to sense single molecules or cells of emerging contaminants at pico- and femtomolar
    concentrations. Single-molecule/cell-based nanosensors allow determining agrochemical
    toxins as well as soil, plant, and insect-associated microbial communities. As
    such, they have become a powerful PA tool to track the impact of herbicides, pesticides,
    and insecticides on crop-associated microbiomes and ecosystems. (81,82) Restricted
    concentrations of GLP in drinking water and food are 0.7 mg/L and 0.1–310 ppm,
    respectively. (83) Various nanomaterial-based sensors for GLP have recently been
    prepared for detecting, adsorbing, and degrading GLP in real samples (Table 1).
    Conducting, semiconducting, and nonconducting polymers were prepared. (84) For
    example, polyaniline-zeolite (PANI/ZSM-5 and PANI-FeZSM-5) composite-based adsorbents
    of efficient GLP adsorption capacity were prepared by oxidative polymerization.
    (85,86) Polydopamine (PDA) was used to synthesize BiVO4/PDA-g-C3N4 photocatalyst
    sheets for exploiting dopamine self-polymerization, ultrasonic dispersion, and
    self-assembling. Under visible light irradiation, the BiVO4/PDAg-C3N4 photocatalysts
    degraded GLP more actively than the control composites prepared without PD. (87)
    Fluorescent porous N-benzyl (carbazole derivative)-based polymer GLP detectors
    were synthesized in a one-step polymerization. The polymers of tunable pore sizes
    emitted bright cyan, blue, and green light upon ultraviolet (UV)-light excitation.
    GLP and other pesticides quenched the fluorescence of polymers according to the
    Stern–Volmer kinetics, thus demonstrating pesticide-specific recognition and determination.
    (88) An intriguing report on a proteinoid polymer composite-based sensor for GLP
    was presented. (89) The proteinoid polymer nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by
    thermal step-growth polymerization of natural and unnatural amino acids in the
    presence of various agrochemicals. The agrochemicals interacted with the hollow
    NPs by encapsulation, integrating with the crude shell, or bound covalently/physically
    to the NP surface. Once hydrophobized and fluorescently labeled, the NPs were
    taken up by the plant and accumulated in the plant’s vascular system. This example
    shows the agrochemical-specific applications of these NPs to agriculture. (89)
    Moreover, MIP-based GLP sensors of different properties and sensing parameters
    have been prepared. (90−103) The current Review discusses several examples of
    these sensors (Table 2). Table 1. Analytical Techniques for GLP Determination

    Various methods have been used to determine or extract traces of GLP and AMPA
    from liquids, solids, and plants (Table 1). Multimethod approaches, including
    chromatography, (104−112) adsorption-extraction systems, (90,92,93,97,101) optical,
    (88,103,113−128) electrochemical, (54,91,94−96,100,102,129−144) and scanning-probe
    techniques, (145) immunochemistry, (146−150) and microfluidic LOCs (98,99,151−153)
    exploit modern GLP-sensitive materials to detect and analyze, as well as to extract
    and degrade, GLP traces. Hybrid nanomaterials used in these approaches include
    enzymes (AChE, ESPS), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- or antibody-based aptamers,
    immune-magnetic conjugates, MIPs, and inorganic materials. Moreover, we herein
    discuss recent reports concerning the GLP determination by AI-excelled smartphone-integrated
    sensors, (154−158) and an automated vegetable analyzer for targeted GLP delivery.
    (159) 3.1. Chromatography and Adsorptive-Extracting Systems for GLP Chromatographic
    techniques are traditional tools for determining pesticides in liquids, foods,
    and clinical and environmental samples. They enable the pretreatment, separation,
    detection, or degradation of pesticides among other contaminants (micropollutants)
    of emerging concern, including endocrine-disrupting chemicals, plasticizers, artificial
    sweeteners, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pyrethroid insecticides,
    and halogenated or organophosphorus retardants. (160−162) For example, an intelligent
    postacquisition sample validation following mixed-mode solid-phase extraction
    (SPE) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass
    spectrometry (UPLC-Q-ToF-HRMS/MS) was employed for wide-scope target screening
    of 2316 emerging pollutants in wastewater samples collected from the Wastewater
    Treatment Plant of Athens. Upon validation of the method, it was employed to detect
    and quantify the influent and effluent wastewater connect of 398 selected contaminants
    of pesticides, opiates, and opioids, stimulants and sympathotomimetics, cannabinoids
    barbiturates, benzodiazepins, tranquilizers, analgesics, antibiotics, steroids,
    and industrial chemicals. This method allowed for determining the contents as
    low as 0.3 ng/L (perfluoroundecanoic acid), 0.4 ng/L (acetochlor, N-2,4-dimethylphenylformamide),
    and 0.5 ng/L (haloperidol, perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid). (163) Moreover, HRMS-based
    suspect screening integrated with national monitoring data was recently applied
    in aquatic toxicology by investigating the presence of 16 not-well-explored pesticides
    and 242 pesticide transformation products in Swedish agricultural areas and streams.
    The study confirmed the occurrence of 11 transformation products and 12 tentatively
    identified ones. (164) Furthermore, gas chromatography coupled to electron ionization
    mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) was employed to determine levels of OP ethers in air
    and soil samples. (165) Chromatographic analysis of hazardous agrochemicals usually
    involves two steps. First, the analyte is pretreated with optically active or
    polystyrene-coated magnetic NPs and then separated using GC or high-performance
    liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a UV spectroscopic, fluorescent (FLD),
    or mass spectrometric (MS) detector. Most advanced adsorptive/separating chromatographic
    systems include nanotechnologically excellent adsorptive systems, engaging MIPs
    or silica NPs (SiNPs) of various porosity, developed surface area, and sorbing
    properties. Moreover, they are often modified with ionic liquids, silanes, amines,
    enzymes (AChE, carboxylesterases, laccases, or OP hydrolases), fluorescent, electrochemiluminescent,
    or surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) labels and magnetic beads. Finally,
    these systems are prepared as beads, wires, and sheets to improve their sensitivity,
    stability, amenability to modifications, and “on-site” applicability. (166,167)
    Novel chromatographic techniques applied to GLP determination involve GC or HPLC
    coupled with UV spectroscopic, (106) FLD, or electrospray ionization mass spectrometric
    (ESI-MS) detectors, (104) often using fluorescent (111) or carbon isotope (δ 13C)
    label probes. (107) The HPLC-FLD and -(ESI-MS) determined GLP fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl
    (FMOC) derivatives in maize in the 0.1–0.4 mg/kg range with the 79–86% efficacy
    of extraction recovery and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.4 ng/mL. (104)
    Similar FMOC-based HPLC methods determined GLP in soil (109) and seawater (110)
    with 0.01 mg/kg and 0.6 μg/mL LOD, respectively. With a different method, an HPLC
    precolumn was derivatized with 3,6-dimethoxy-9-phenyl-9H-carbazole-1-sulfonyl
    chloride (DPPC-Cl) to determine GLP in soybean with the LOD of 0.02 ng/mL and
    the extraction recovery exceeding 95%. (111) The LC coupled to isotope-ratio MS
    (LC–IRMS) enabled the GLP determination in 21 commercial herbicide samples, revealing
    δ 13C values between −24 ‰ and −34 ‰ in the submicrogram concentration range.
    (107) With porous (graphitized carbon absorbent)-based chromatography coupled
    to a three-quadrupole MS detector, the 6 ng/mL LOD of GLP in aqueous solutions
    was attained. (105) In a similar study, with an HPLC coupled with an inductively
    coupled plasma (ICP-MS) detector or a diode array detector (DAD), GLP was determined
    with the LOD of 8.2 and 300 μg/L, respectively. (108) Chromatographic analysis
    was employed for the GLP determination in real-life water samples from 10 agricultural
    provinces of China during various meteorological conditions. (112) Specifically,
    UPLC-MS-MS was employed to provide the risk assessment and spatioseasonal distribution
    of GLP, AMPA, and glufosinate in China’s groundwater and surface water samples,
    from 2017 to 2018. GLP was determined with the LOD of 0.05 μg/L in the linear
    dynamic concentration range (LDCR) of 0.1–200 μg/L. Combined with the model simulations
    for potential leaching to water bodies, these quantitative results allowed us
    to establish that the spray drift deposition, runoff, and erosion are the main
    drivers of the aquatic GLP exposure from crop neighborhood, especially in summer
    and autumn seasons. Inevitable progress will be made to address well-known limitations
    of GLP-targeted separating systems. Modern separation techniques, including capillary
    electrophoresis, GC, or LC, provide relatively low sensitivity (nanomolar) compared
    with optical, electrochemical, or immunochemical techniques that offer the detection
    of subnanomolar concentrations. Additionally, the blocky construction of modern
    systems disallows them for in-field use. Expectedly, the selectivity of future
    systems will be improved using tools of nanoinformatics, providing models and
    structures of analyte-receptor complexes of higher affinities. Finally, coupling
    these systems, based on aptamers, ionic liquids, NPs, and MIPs, with MS or FLD
    detectors, followed by their integration into the mobile microfluidic devices,
    shall enhance both sensitivity and applicability. (168) 3.1.1. MIP-Based Chromatography
    of GLP Various chromatographic methods developed to remove or degrade GLP traces
    from environmental, biological, or grocery samples exploited the adsorptive-extracting
    properties of porous MIPs. (169) The maximum adsorption capacity of GLP-selective
    MIPs, formulated via free radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylamide (AA) and
    ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), was evaluated as high as 3.37 mg/g (90)
    (Figure 1G and 1H). A series of dual-templated methacrylic acid MAA-MIPs, imprinted
    with herbicides, including GLP, were fabricated by precipitation polymerization
    for water treatment. Efficiency, expressed by binding factors (BFs), KMIP/KNIP,
    where K is the partition coefficient, of chosen GLP-selective MAA-MIPs in tap
    water for GLP solution, ranged between 2.12 and 2.55. (92) Moreover, based on
    1-allyl-2-thiourea (ATU), GLP-detecting MIP cartridges were prepared to assess
    the (UPLC-MS-MS)-mediated GLP recovery from mineral and underground waters. The
    herbicides were totally retained from these real matrices, spiked with 0.5 μg/L
    GLP. (97) The selective sorptive extraction of GLP from river water and soil samples,
    with mean recoveries ranging from 90.6 to 97.3%, was demonstrated for ATU- and
    2-dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEM)-based MIPs, prepared by UV light-activated
    FRP (93) (Figure 1A-1F). Eventually, in a recent study, positively charged (quaternary
    ammonium cation)-MIP quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors were constructed
    for the (electrostatic interaction)-mediated binding of GLP from river waters.

    shall unite traditional multimodal separation and detection techniques, including
    thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or immunochromatography, with microfluidics and
    AI tools. Recent studies indicate the ultrasensitive on-site determination of
    toxins and pesticides in real samples using smartphone-coopted. Personal low-cost
    AI tools offer high-resolution photoimaging, portability, and instant online data
    availability that can be immediately shared. For example, an open-source smartphone-imaging
    app was developed to excel TLC screening and quantify pharmaceuticals. (170) In
    another study, smartphone-based dual-channel immunochromatographic test strips
    labeled with polymer carbon QDs were fabricated for on-site simultaneous biomonitoring
    of cypermethrin, a pyrethroid pesticide, and its metabolite, 3-phenoxybenzoic
    acid, determined with LODs of 0.35 and 0.04 ng/mL, respectively. (171) Expectedly,
    similar tools will soon be commercially available for GLP, as has already been
    demonstrated for other pesticides. 3.2. Optical Sensors for GLP Recently, a series
    of optical strategies have been developed for pesticide sensing. Those include
    photonic, photoluminescent, photoelectric, electrochemiluminescent, and colorimetric
    methods. Over the past five years, carbon dot (CD)-based optical sensors equipped
    with aptamers, antibodies, enzymes, gold and silver nanoclusters (AuNCs and AgNCs),
    and nanoparticles (AuNPs and AgNPs), and MIPs as recognition units have been used
    as herbicide-derived signal indicators, catalysts, coreactants, and electrode
    surface modifiers. (169,172) Moreover, novel carbon-based SERS biosensors with
    similarly excellent sensing properties were fabricated. They primarily include
    0D carbon quantum dots (QDs), 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), 2D graphene, graphene
    oxide (GO), 3D carbon nanomaterials, and core–shell nanostructures. The SERS sensors
    were devised for selective and quantitative in situ analysis of agrochemicals
    by exploiting so-called localized “hotspots” produced during the application.
    (173) QD-based chemosensors were used for the highly sensitive and selective detection
    of pesticide poisons in the clinical and forensic toxicological analysis of gaseous,
    anionic, phenolic, metallic, drug, and pesticide specimens. A breakthrough has
    been made by continuously applying whispering gallery modes (WGMs) to biosensing.
    (174−176) Miniaturized size and excellent lasing properties of WGM-based microlasers,
    called resonators, were exploited in constructing label-free aptasensors (177)
    and applied to detect single molecules, particles, cells, and molecular electrostatic
    changes at biointerfaces and barcode-type tagging and tracking. (178−180) Furthermore,
    remarkable advances have been made in developing electrochemiluminescent (ECL)
    and photoelectrochemical sensors to analyze food quality. In most recent works,
    nanomaterial-based ECL luminophores have been synthesized and incorporated into
    immunoassay-, aptasensor-, and microfluidic systems for low-cost ultrasensitive
    determination of heavy metals, illegal additives, microbes, and pesticide contaminants
    in complex matrices. (181) Food safety issues can be effectively solved by using
    brand-new photoelectrochemical biosensors. These devices, equipped with photoactive
    nanomaterial-based recognition units, quantitatively determine mycotoxins, antibiotics,
    and pesticides with high sensitivity at a significantly low signal-to-noise ratio.
    (182) Modern optical methods of GLP sensing mainly exploit SERS, interferometry,
    chemiluminescence, colorimetry, fluorescence, and Förster resonance energy transfer
    (FRET). A SERS-based method, which exploits organometallic osmium carbonyl cluster-conjugated
    AuNPs, was used for AChE-mediated GLP determination with the LOD below 0.1 ppb
    (118) (Figure 2D–2H). Figure 2 Figure 2. Optical sensors for GLP. (A) Scheme of
    a (glass slide)-adhered ESPS-based interferometric biochip (gray) specific for
    GLP (orange) deposited onto soft colloidal particles (SCPs), not shown. (B) Normalized

    2020 Elsevier. Regarding SERS sensors for GLP, an air-stable sensor was devised
    by using reduced GO (rGO)-wrapped dual-layer AgNPs on TiO2 NT arrays as a SERS
    substrate. This sensor’s adsorption capacity and SERS enhancement were excellent
    thanks to the tremendous electromagnetic field and chemical enhancement generated
    by localized SPR excitation of the dense dual-layer AgNPs uniformly deposited
    onto the TiO2 NTs and to facilitation of the charge transfer between the extensive
    π–π conjugations in the rGO. Because the GLP molecule does not have a specific
    chemical group, it is hardly detectable using a conventional SERS method. In the
    discussed study, GLP was determined by the enhanced adsorption area of the nanocomposite.
    That enabled GLP determination in environmental samples of waters and soils in
    the LDCR of 0.005–50 mg/L with the LOD of 3 μg/L, i.e., lower than the limit specified
    by the U.S. EPA and the European Union. (120) Two UV–vis colorimetric sensors
    for GLP were devised by linking 3-chloro-4-methylpyridine with 4-(dimethylamino)
    benzaldehyde or 4-(dimethylamino) cinnamaldehyde in a one-step synthesis, resulting
    in 4-(2-(3-chloropyridin-4-yl) vinyl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (BP-Cl) or 4-(3-chloropyridin-4-yl)
    buta-1,3-dien-1-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (CP-Cl), respectively. In the GLP reaction
    with these sensing compounds, the N atom of GLP interacted with the Cl atom on
    the pyridine ring, resulting in highly sensitive and selective naked-eye detection
    of GLP, observed as color changes ranging from colorless to yellow (BP-Cl) and
    from yellow to orange (CP-Cl). In a naked-eye analysis, GLP was determined in
    tap water and potato samples with the LOD of 15 and 10 μM for BP-Cl and CP-Cl,
    respectively, whereas using UV–vis spectrophotometry, these LODs were of 0.847
    and 1.23 μM, respectively, in the LDCR of 1–40 μM. (121) GLP was determined by
    using interferometry and chemiluminescence. Picomolar traces of GLP were detected
    using an EPSP-decorated interferometric sensor with GLP-attached poly(ethylene
    glycol) (PEG)-based soft colloidal probes (117) (Figure 2A,B). In a chemiluminescent-assisted
    method of GLP determination, the LOD of 46 ng/mL was reached using poly(vinyl
    chloride) (PVC)-MIP microbeads prepared by FRP of acrylamide and subsequent conjugation
    with PVC. (103) Fluorescent sensors rely on the analyte-induced triggering or
    quenching of the receptor’s fluorescence, called the “ON/OFF strategy.” In this
    strategy, pesticides, including GLP, act as either direct or indirect quenchers
    or triggers of fluorescence. In the direct approach, GLP binding by the receptor
    modifies its electronic structure and fluorescent properties, thus enabling direct
    optical sensing and determination of the GLP content. In contrast, in the indirect
    approach, GLP interacts with the molecular trigger/quencher to subsequently turn
    on/off the receptor. Recent studies on GLP-based fluorescence modulation demonstrate
    examples of both approaches. GLP-induced fluorescence was directly quenched using
    carbazole-based porous polyaminals (88) (Figure 2C). Moreover, various hybrid
    fluorescent-magnetic immunosensors were fabricated to detect GLP in liquids. For
    example, water-in-oil microemulsion-based Co–V/SiO2 NPs, doped with rhodamine,
    enabled immunoassaying GLP-dsDNA double target/probe core–shell NPs with the LOD
    of 0.35 nM. (116) Likewise, a magnetic-assisted oligonucleotide aptamer probe
    labeled with 6-carboxy-fluorescein was used for GLP sensing with the LOD of 88.8
    ng/L. (115) Finally, recently devised FRET-based sensors for GLP explored GLP-induced
    turn-on fluorescence following the aggregation of positively charged cysteamine-AuNPs
    and negatively charged CdTe QDs capped with thioglycolic acid. This FRET assay
    utilized GLP detection in apples with a 9.8 ng/kg LOD. (114) In another study,
    the fluorescent carbon QD probe operating in the AND logic gate was successfully
    quenched by GLP, resulting in the GLP determination with the LOD of 0.6 μM. (119)
    Finally, the GLP-induced FRET switching in a self-assembled nanosensing system,
    formulated from p-tert-butylcalix [4] arene-grafted ruthenium(II) bipyridine-doped
    SiNPs, was used for GLP determination with the LOD of 0.791 μM. (113) The indirect-modulation
    fluorescence sensor mainly relies on the chelating properties of GLP, provided
    by its phosphonate and carboxyl groups, as well as the monoprotonated secondary
    amine nitrogen atom. A Cu2+-modulated DNA-templated AgNCs was used to determine
    GLP by GLP reaction with the Cu2+, a primary quencher. Upon chelation, the DNA
    AgNCs fluorescence was recovered, which enabled the stoichiometric determination
    of GLP in real samples in the LDCR of 15–100 μg/L and with the LOD of 5 μg/L.
    (122) A similar approach was exploited in fluorescent and colorimetric sensing
    of Cu2+ and GLP by the (o-phenylenediamine)-SiNPs FRET interaction. The Cu2+ oxidation
    of o-phenyaldiamine disabled the fluorescence of SiNPs by FRET. Hence, by chelating
    Cu2+, GLP served as a secondary quencher by hindering the FRET donor’s oxidation
    and restoring the FRET acceptor’s emission. This approach allowed determining
    GLP in the LDCR of 0.15 to 1.5 μg/L with the LOD of 0.003 μg/mL. (123) Consistently,
    the concept of the Cu2+-GLP system was used in a fluorescent 4-butyl-3-thiosemicarbazide-labeled
    CDs-based sensor. Cu2+-quenched fluorescence of the sensor was recovered by the
    GLP addition in a dose-dependent manner, which enabled GLP determination in real
    samples with the LOD of 0.27 μM. (124) Likewise, a Cu2+-modulated 4-dihydroxyanthraquinone-CD
    nanosensor enabled for ultrasensitive sensing of GLP in vegetable samples with
    the LDCR of 50 to 1300 ng/mL and the LOD of 0.8 ng/mL. (125) Moreover, GLP was
    rapidly determined in real samples of agri-food products (tea, soybean, wheat,
    cucumber) using (rhodamine B)-embedded amino-functionalized iron-based MOFs bonded
    with Cu2+ via Lewis interactions that resulted in fluorescence quenching. The
    addition of GLP resulted in Cu2+ chelation via hydrogen bonding, thus turning
    on the fluorescence of the nanosensor. That allowed for the GLP determination
    with the LOD of 0.18 μM in the 0.6–45 μM LDCR. (126) Similarly, a hierarchical,
    highly porous fluorescent nanocomposite, UiO-67/Ce-PC, consisting of UiO-67 NPs
    grown on Ce-MOF-derived porous carbon, was devised to determine GLP in soybean,
    wheat, and corn. A large specific surface area and abundant metal active sites
    that alleviated the diffusion barrier and enhanced the GLP preenrichment ensured
    the determination. Additionally, the competitive coordination effect between GLP’s
    phosphonate groups and metalloorganic ligands (hydroxyl groups) attenuated the
    ligand-to-metal charge transfer between metallic nodes and organic struts, thus
    providing a dose-dependent fluorescence recovery upon GLP detection. The plot
    of the fluorescence enhancement response of UiO-67/Ce-PC toward GLP was linear
    in the range of 0.02–30 μg/mL with the LOD of 0.0062 μg/mL. (127) An optical/temperature
    nanozyme platform, fabricated from nitrogen-doped CDs anchored onto Zr-based ferrocene
    MOF nanosheets, was devised for the sensitive and portable determination of GLP.
    The nanozyme mimicked peroxidase activity, i.e., oxidation of colorless 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
    into a blue product in the presence of H2O2, which GLP readily suppressed. That
    enabled a trisignal response of fluorescence enhancement, absorbance, and temperature
    decrease. These features were exploited to construct a portable mini-photothermal
    device capable of colorimetric and fluorescent GLP determination in the 0.039–3.19
    μg/mL LDCR with the LOD of 0.0131 μg/mL and the 0.0088–3.98 μg/mL LDCR with the
    LOD of 0.0015 μg/mL, respectively. (128) Because of the analyte-triggered AChE
    inhibition, the optical sensors for GLP, based on the single molecule “turn on/off”
    on-site sensing mode, belong to the most sensitive and selective. Future optical
    technologies, compatible with smartphone-assisted kits and LOCs, include paper-,
    liquid-, and gel-based sensors. Double-signal fluorescence, phosphorescence, chemiluminescence,
    lateral flow immunoassay, or enzymatic fiber-optic biosensing are envisioned as
    the most promising operation strategies, enabling the in-field red-green-blue
    (RGB)-determination of GLP. Most recent advancements in optical sensors involve
    metasurface-based devices. Metasurfaces are 2D composite micro- or nanomaterials
    of the subwavelength thickness and desired geometry, allowing for adjusting the
    material’s refractive index of the material to positive, near-zero, or negative
    values (so-called negative refraction). Moreover, the nonlinear metasurface can
    transform the infrared signal into the visible signal, which the human eye or
    smartphone CCD can visualize. (183) These exquisite features allow for devising
    a surface-enhanced infrared absorption-operating sensor for passive trapping and
    detecting glucose and proline with the LOD of ∼1 pg. (184) In this context, the
    LODs of the devices discussed in the present review are comparable or one order
    of magnitude lower. Besides, devising optical sensors for agricultural use shall
    necessitate integrating ultrasensitive (of the order of ∼fM) devices with smartphones
    or portable meters, similar to commercial smart Raman spectroscopic alcohol meters.
    3.3. Electrochemical Sensors for GLP The contemporary electrochemical sensors
    provide a portable, simple, and sensitive determination of herbicides and pesticides
    in real water, food, and soil samples. (185,186) Recently fabricated multimodal
    sensing devices contain aptamers, enzymes, graphene, CNTs, polymers, viruses,
    and cells as recognition units integrated with optical, piezoelectric, and microgravimetric
    transducers. (187,188) The GLP concentration is mainly measured using amperometry,
    cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), nonfaradic electrochemical
    impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and electrochemical surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
    spectroscopy. Among other OP pesticides, including glufosinate and AMPA, GLP was
    determined amperometrically using a three-electrode sensor fabricated by (UV laser)-inscribing
    of OP-selective Cu NPs on a polyimide film. For GLP determination in natural water
    samples, the sensor exhibited the LOD of 3.42 μM, whereas for glufosinate and
    AMPA, the LOD was 7.28 and 17.78 μM, respectively. Moreover, the sensor prevailed
    in pesticide selectivity in the presence of ion and organic interferences in natural
    water. (138) Recently, a very sensitive, highly conducting sensor for GLP was
    constructed based on Cu-benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate-loaded 2D Ti3C2Tx nanosheets
    deposited on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). This nanocomposite was fabricated
    upon in situ copper component growth on chemically etching nanosheets that were
    subsequently dispersed and vacuum-dried on the GCE. Because of the Cu ions’ high
    affinity to GLP, the sensor sensitivity was excellent, resulting in the exquisitely
    low LOD of 26 fM and a broad LDCR of 100 fM to 1 μM. (139) Carbon-based electrochemical
    sensors have recently become a powerful tool for tracing metabolism. The significant
    advantage of these materials is the enhancement of the electrochemical sensing
    performance by enlarging an active surface area. For example, a probe-free screen-printed
    carbon electrode (SPCE) was used for direct GLP sensing in tap water with micromolar
    sensitivity. (131) An ECL horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-based sensor, formulated
    on a sulfonate polymer matrix, was used for the GLP determination with the LOD
    of 1.7 μg/L. (132) In a recent study, a simple and accurate (pencil graphite electrode)-supported
    sensor containing an HRP enzyme, immobilized on a multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs)-doped
    polysulfone membrane, was devised to detect GLP in the river and drinking water
    samples. This highly selective sensor was readily applied to the in-field determination
    of GLP, showing reproducible and repeatable CV and amperometric readouts in the
    LDCR of 0.1–10 mg/L and the LOD of 0.025 mg/L. (140) Moreover, functionalized
    single-walled CNT (SWCNT)-based nanomaterials were used in electrochemical GLP
    sensing by providing transducing layers for water-gated transistor-based sensors.
    In particular, GLP was selectively determined with a sensor composed of networks
    of semiconducting, monochiral (6,5) SWCNTs featured with polyfluorene-bipyridine
    copolymer and a Cu2+-selective membrane. The functionality of this semiconducting
    sensor relied on the n-doping resulting from Cu2+ complexation by bipyridine.
    Adding GLP suppressed this complexation by competitive chelation of Cu2+, thus
    enabling the stoichiometric quantification of the herbicide analyte at nanomolar
    concentrations. (137) Likewise, GLP was selectively determined using an amperometric
    sensor containing glycine oxidase, a flavoenzyme, immobilized on a platinum-decorated
    laser-induced graphene scaffold. Exquisite electronic and solid properties, including
    the LDCR of 10–260 μM and the LOD of 3.03 μM, allowed for selective determination
    of GLP with only minimal interference of common herbicides and insecticides, including
    atrazine, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, dicamba, parathion-methyl, paraoxon-methyl,
    malathion, chlorpyrifos, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid. In the
    future, the sensor may enable food mapping and determining GLP in complex river
    waters and crop residue fluids. (136) GLP was sensed by using electrochemical
    immunoassays. Recently, a label-free, portable, selective, and highly sensitive
    (LOD of 0.1 ng/mL in the LDCR of 0.1–72 ng/mL) sensor was devised to determine
    GLP in human urine. (141) Its electrochemical platform consisted of a portable
    printed-circuit circular board with gold working and reference electrodes enabling
    nonfaradic EIS measurements. Its immunoassay-based platform included a monolayer
    of dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), a thiol-based cross-linking monomer modified
    with a GLP antibody, and a coated gold electrode. The selectivity was assessed
    using typical herbicide interferences, including malathion, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid,
    and chlorpyrifos. (141) Likewise, GLP and chlorpyrifos were determined in low-
    and high-fat food matrices using a two-plex, portable electrochemical-immunoassay
    nonfaradic ESI-based sensor. Both sides of this sensor were functionalized with
    the respective antibody. In low fat, the sensor determined GLP and chlorpyrifos
    with a 1-ng/mL LOD in the 0.3–243 ng/mL GLP/chlorpyrifos LDCR, whereas in high
    fat, the LOD was 1 ng/mL in the LDCR of 1–243 ng/mL. (142) GLP was sensed with
    the LOD of 0.11 nM using sophisticated ECL sensors based on HRP-assisted in situ
    generations of ZnS QDs on ordered mesoporous carbon substrates. (133) A bioconjugate
    of urease-AuNPs and an agarose-guar gum-entrapped biocomposite membrane was devised
    to detect the enzyme-inhibiting activity of GLP, enabling the determination of
    this herbicide in ppm traces. (134) Similarly, GLP was determined with a sensitivity
    of 0.01 ppm (10 ng/mL) in fruits and vegetables using a field-deployable electrochemical
    immunosensor based on a polymer-metalized interdigitated two-electrode system,
    functionalized with a commercial GLP-antibody, and equipped with a portable reader
    and a machine-learning binary classifier (130) (Figure 3). Likewise, an SPCE immunosensor,
    enabling the GLP determination with the 5 ng/L LOD, was fabricated using anti-GLP-IgG-modified
    magnetic beads and an HRP-conjugated-GLP tracer. (129) Moreover, an electrodeposited
    monocrystalline silicon-PANI-HRP conjugate was constructed to evaluate an immunoassay
    for GLP sensing with the LOD of 5.44 μg/L. (135) Continuously, a series of GLP-imprinted
    polymer-based electrochemical sensors was fabricated. Electropolymerized GLP-imprinted
    p-aminothiophenol metallorganic framework (MOF) films formed on AuNP surfaces
    determined GLP with a 0.8 pg/L LOQ. (91) The LOD of 1 pM was determined using
    gravimetric-electrochemical GLP-selective polypyrrole (PPy) MIP films. (95) Similar
    sensing efficacy (0.27 ng/mL) was demonstrated for an (Au-electrode)-deposited
    PPy-MIP sensor for GLP. (102) Furthermore, in a recent study, a gold chip/electrode
    coated with a self-assembled monolayer of 11-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl) undecane-1-thiol,
    and PPy-MIPs, was exploited to determine GLP using CV, EIS, and electrochemical
    SPR analyses. Values of the dissociation constant, Kd, and free Gibbs energy change,
    ΔG0, accompanying the interaction of GLP with MIP-PPy were determined as Kd =
    38.18 (±2) × 10–5 and ΔG0 = −19.51 (±0.2) kJ/mol. (143) In a similar study, a
    graphite SPCE modified with a dual-MIP coated on an amino-mesoporous SiNPs-PtNPs
    core was used for DPV determination of paraquat and GLP. The herbicide-selective
    MIPs were fabricated by using a 3D-surface imprinting strategy that increased
    the conductivity and monodispersity of the sensor. A dual-MIP was fabricated by
    3D-printing on the surface of mesoporous SiPtNPs, using acrylic acid and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone
    as functional monomers, and N,N′-(1,2-dihydroxyethylene) bis(acrylamide) (DHEBA)
    as the cross-linking monomer. The sensors allowed for simultaneous determination
    of both herbicides, paraquat, and GLP, in water samples in the LDCR of 0.025–500
    μM and with the LOD of 3.1 nM and 4 nM, respectively. (144) Figure 3 Figure 3.

    transition incorporation was performed to incorporate GLP and graphene QD labels
    into mesoporous organosilica MIPs. The GLP-induced quenching-mediated detection
    enabled GLP quantification at a subnanomolar level (0.017 ppb, 17 pg/mL). (94)
    GLP was determined with the 0.35 ng/L LOD using a pencil graphite electrode dip-coated
    with AuNPs, then modified with the fabrication of glyphosate-glufosinate double-template
    MIP using atom transfer radical polymerization in the presence of templates and
    MWCNTs. (96) Finally, GLP was ultrasensitively (the LOD of 92 ng/mL) determined
    by DPV using a composite of urchin-like AuNPs, Prussian Blue, and PPy-based GLP-MIPs,
    deposited by electropolymerization on the indium–tin oxide electrode. (100) Electrochemical
    sensors for GLP are advantageous because of their excellent reproducibility and
    accuracy as well as high selectivity and sensitivity with a linear output among
    others. However, these features may deteriorate over time, as extended exposure
    to the target analyte usually shortens or limits the sensor lifetime, especially
    at variable temperatures. Once incorporated into the smart sensor, this device
    would require temperature compensation, which exploits the battery energy losses.
    Regarding sensitivity enhancement, biomimetic chemistry tools will measure the
    subfemtomolar GLP concentrations. Expectedly, the AChE-based nanozymes, containing
    MOFs and transient metal complexes, will be used to construct future sensors for
    GLP. In conclusion, although only a few examples of GLP-sensitive electrochemical
    smartphone-assisted sensors of subnanomolar LOD have so far been demonstrated,
    fabricating such tools is highly expected in the near future. For example, an
    (yttrium ferrite garnet)-embedded (graphitic carbon nitride)-based electrochemical
    POC sensor, integrated with a smartphone, was recently reported to determine pesticide
    mesotrione in food with the LOD of 0.95 nM. (189) 3.4. (Atomic Force Microscopy)-Based
    Sensors for GLP Despite extreme usefulness, robustness, and sensitivity, atomic
    force microscopy (AFM) has hardly been used as a sensing tool. The main reasons
    included dimensions and the complicated curvature of the AFM tips. Recently, tip
    functionalization with various species has been optimized so that AFM has become
    an efficient technique for quantitatively determining chemicals, including herbicides
    and pesticides. Recently, atomic force spectroscopy, an AFM-derived technique,
    has been exploited to analyze imazaquin, metsulfuron-methyl, and atrazine samples
    using tips functionalized with the acetolactate synthase and antiatrazine antibody.
    This tip functionalization increased markedly (over 130, 140, and 175%, respectively)
    the adhesion force between the functionalized tips and the herbicides, distinguishing
    nonspecific and specific interactions between the tip-located biomolecules and
    the herbicides quantitatively. (190) Regarding AFM-assisted GLP determination,
    a peroxidase-based AFM nanobiosensor was devised to evaluate GLP content in 0.01
    to 10 mg/mL in zucchini extracts. This biosensor for GLP modus operandi relied
    on detecting GLP-induced changes in surface tension caused by GLP adsorption,
    followed by a conformational change in the peroxidase structure. The LOD was as
    low as 0.0238 mg/L. (145) Low sensitivity, long scanning time, limited spatial
    resolution, and tip damage, i.e., significant drawbacks of AFM sensors, are expected
    to be addressed in the future. The construction of tuning-fork-balanced tips shall
    enable chiplike probing of biological and soft material samples. Applying tip-synchronized
    time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy will also allow for monitoring charge
    generation, transfer, and recombination, which is crucial for ultrasensitive enzymatic
    GLP determination in real samples. 3.5. Immunoassays and Immunosensors for GLP
    Immunosensors are (affinity-ligand)-based sensing tools exploiting immunochemical
    antibody–antigen interactions. These interactions are quantified by transducers
    with immobilized antibodies. Over decades, the use of immunosensors, both labeled
    and nonlabeled, has become highly trending, as they comprise (single molecule)-operating
    sensing tools for food safety control, healthcare, and environmental monitoring.
    (191) Usually, forming an immunocomplex with an analyte generates electrochemical,
    photochemical, and piezoelectric changes, contributing to multimodal and sensitive
    detection. (192) Herbicides and pesticides belong to typical immunosensor analytes,
    as they are easily complexed by peptides and enzymes immobilized on the transducer
    surface. The affinity-based reactions resemble physiological and biochemical reactions
    because these analytes act as natural ligands. (193) Besides, using MIPs, well-known
    as “plastic antibodies,” “semisynthetic enzymes,” and “artificial receptors,”
    (194) enables low-cost pesticide residue determination in foods, feeds, medicines,
    and environmental samples. (195) Various immunosensors have been constructed for
    GLP sensing. These include antibody- and aptamer-based immuno-assisted electrochemical
    and optical sensors. (54) Most recent examples report conventional immunochemical
    methods for GLP determination using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
    which provides submicromolar LODs in liquids and animal feeds. (147,150) The ELISA
    combination with an online SPE, followed by HPLC–MS analysis, enabled the GLP
    determination with the subnanomolar LOD. (148) Advanced immunoassays utilize an
    immobilized GLP-ovalbumin conjugate and avian IgY antibodies for sensing ppb traces
    of GLP (149) or an AuNP oligonucleotide-based biobarcode immuno-(polymerase chain
    reaction) (PCR) system with the LOD of 4.5 pg/g (146) (Figure 4). Figure 4 Figure

    from ref (146). Copyright 2021 Elsevier. Although contemporary immunosensors for
    GLP provide ultrasensitive determination, future trends promise the construction
    of sensors of higher standards. Because of the high production cost of contemporary
    biologically derived antibodies and enzymes, future immunosensors will be constructed
    from single atom/molecule or peptoid/enzyme mimetic catalysts containing single
    noble metal NCs or MOF nanozymes as recognition units. Since immunodetection of
    various environmentally emerging pesticide residuals can be executed with extremely
    low LODs (<pM), (196) it is expected that the application of AI-excelled tools
    shall upgrade these values. As it was extensively summarized elsewhere, (197)
    several smartphone-assisted immunosensors were so far devised for determining
    various biomedically or environmentally relevant analytes, including small molecules,
    macromolecules, viruses, and bacteria. 3.6. Microfluidic Lab-on-Chips for GLP
    In recent decades, enormous progress has been made in devising microfluidic-assisted
    conventional and smart sensors. Technological progress enables microfabricating
    and miniaturizing microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) (198) and
    devising smartphone-coopted sensors operating in a microfluidic mode. (199) In
    a traditional design, μPADs are constructed from conventional dipstick or lateral-flow
    setups. Once coupled with electrochemical immunosensors and LOCs, these eco-friendly
    devices have become onsite quantitative and semiqualitative equipment for POC
    medical diagnostics, food safety control, and environmental purity inspection.
    Particularly, microfluidic-assisted analytical devices enable direct, low-cost,
    sensitive, and real-time screening of chemical hazards or pathogens, including
    metal ions, nitrates and nitrites, phenols, pesticides and herbicides, and bacteria.
    (200−203) Thanks to an impressive advance in biotechnological sciences, sophisticated
    living-cell-based microfluidic-handled biosensors have also been devised. They
    are mainly inspired by conventional in vitro bioassays, including the bacterial
    luminescence toxicity screen and the algal toxicity test by imaging pulse amplitude
    modulated fluorometry, which was demonstrated useful for pesticide determination
    in environmental samples. (204) In the most advanced approach, algae-based biosensors
    sensitively, sustainably, and multiplexed analyzed agro-environmental samples.
    In these biosensors, whole algal cells and their photosynthetic complexes were
    used as miniaturized transducers to construct biomicrofluidic devices. (205) Modern
    microfluidic-handled LOC sensors combine different methods, e.g., electrophoresis-coupled
    disposable microchips with laser-induced fluorescence detection for the rapid
    on-site interference-free determination of GLP residues in agricultural products,
    with the LOD of 0.34 μg/L and 84% recovery. (152,153) (Direct injection)-UPLC
    with triple quadrupole MS was optimized to determine GLP traces in environmental
    waters with the LOD range of 0.05–0.09 μg/L and 76.3% recovery. (151) Moreover,
    Mn-ZnS QD-embedded MIP, combined with a 3D-μPAD sensor, was fabricated for colorimetric-catalytic
    determination of GLP. Selective recognition of GLP by the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
    (PNIPAM)- and N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBA)-based MIPs, formulated by thermally
    induced FRP, enabled selective GLP determination in whole grain samples with 0.002
    μg/mL LOD (98) (Figure 5A-C). Finally, an electrochemical LOC-assisted commercial
    MIP-based sensor for GLP was devised. It enabled rapid, online, and real-time
    determination of GLP in tap water with the LOD of 247 nM (99) (Figure 5D-H). Figure
    5 Figure 5. Multimodal microfluidic devices for GLP determination. (A) Colorimetric

    future GLP-selective microfluidic-assisted sensors involve increasing sensitivity
    and integrating these sensors with AI tools including smartphones and mobile meters.
    These sensors will enable on-site ultrasensitive determination of GLP in foods,
    industrial waters, and biological fluids. Based on an ELISA assessment, such a
    tool has already been devised for on-site quantifying ppb (μg/kg) levels of aflatoxin
    B1 in moldy corn. The immunoassay sensor was 3D-printed on a plastic chip attachable
    to a smartphone. (206) Similar sensitivity was achieved for various pesticides
    using a portable, smartphone-adaptable origami μPAD-based potentiostat. Relying
    on the pesticide-inhibited activity of the enzyme immobilized on the sensor’s
    transducing item allowed for chronoamperometric monitoring of paraoxon, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
    acid, and atrazine at a ppb level in river water samples. (207) 3.7. Smart Sensors
    and Plant Wearables for GLP The necessity of developing the PW pest-, insect-,
    fungi-, and herbicide-specific sensing and delivery systems is crucial because
    of the off-target toxicity of these biocides. Among heavy metals, antibiotics
    and other drugs, food-derived growth factors, and industrial hydrocarbon wastes,
    these biocides are the most toxic environmental pollutants and hazards to human
    health. (3) Because of various leakage from the target zone to the rhizosphere,
    waters, and air, relatively high half-time biocides destabilize the trophic chain’s
    matter cycle and endanger ecosystem safety. (208−210) Thus, enormous progress
    has been made in AI-enhanced mobile or PW biocide-selective sensors. (3,18) Miniaturized
    smart sensors, incorporated, e.g., in smartphones, PWs, and POCs or field-deployable
    devices, are equipped with nanophotonic antennas and dielectric metasurfaces that
    enable few-molecule sensitivity by confining incident light into intense hotspots
    of the electromagnetic fields, thus delivering strongly enhanced light-matter
    interactions. (211) Regarding GLP sensing, an in-smartphone-incorporated mobile
    lab-in-a-syringe platform was designed for the rapid, visual, quantitative determination
    of organophosphorus pesticides via dual-mode colorimetry and fluorescence measurements.
    The platform was based on (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide)-coated NPs conjugated
    with a silica pad modified with red- and green-emission QDs. In the sensing reaction,
    thiocholine, the product of AChE-mediated hydrolysis of thioacetylcholine, induced
    the aggregation of NPs, thus giving rise to the color change. During the on-site
    GLP determination, the pesticide-caused enzymatic AChE inhibition changed the
    platform’s colorimetric and fluorescence properties, thus providing the signal
    output in the LDCR of 0 to 10 μM with the LOD of 2.81 nM (154) (Figure 6). A similar
    study developed a smartphone-dedicated kit test for selective GLP determination
    based on the Cu(II)-pyrocatechol violet complex. The kit sensed 20 μM GLP in tap
    water by the “naked eye” test, quantifying GLP with the LOD of 2.66 μM. (155)
    Moreover, a novel enzyme-free visual ratiometric fluorescence paper sensor for
    GLP was devised by assembling blue CDs and AuNCs and incorporating them into a
    portable smartphone platform. GLP sensing relied on the quick (2 s) GLP-induced
    quenching of CD fluorescence originating from CD-GLP complex formation. The sensor
    allowed instant GLP determination in real samples with the exquisite LOD of 4.19
    nM in the broad LDCR of 0–190 nM. (156) Furthermore, in a similar study, a diverse
    (thiocholine-AuNPs)-based colorimetric smartphone-assisted sensor was devised
    to detect eight pesticides, including GLP, thiram, imidacloprid, tribenuron methyl,
    nicosulfuron, thiofensulfuron methyl, dichlorprop, and fenoprop. The modus operandi
    of the sensors relied on the pesticide-induced inhibition of AChE-mediated hydrolysis
    of the Au–S covalent bond in the thiocholine-AuNPs complex. This bond cleavage
    resulted in the RGB-valued color change associated with the alteration of the
    SPR properties of AuNPs. All pesticides were determined in real samples of fruits,
    vegetables, and traditional Chinese herbs, with the LOD below 0.15 μM, thus satisfying
    the established specification of the U.S. EPA, noted as ∼3.91 μM, and demonstrating
    the sensor’s applicability. (157) Finally, a smartphone-integrated triple-mode
    SERS/fluorimetric/colorimetric sensor for GLP was devised based on flowerlike
    Zn MOFs and the HRP activity-mimicking H(2) L ligand. Unique properties of this
    ligand, including the enzymatic catalysis and Cu2+-sensitive fluorescence, were
    used to detect GLP in a florescence-quenching manner based on the Cu2+ chelation
    by GLP. This inhibiting interaction decreased both the catalytic activity of the
    H(2) L ligand and the optical and plasmonic properties of the nanocomposite, thus
    allowing for quantitative fluorescent/colorimetric/SERS determination of GLP with
    the LOD of 0.738 (0–0.12 μM LDCR), 2.26 nM (0–220 nM LDCR), and 0.186 nM (0.5–12
    nM LDCR), respectively. Moreover, the sensor was integrated with a portable (test
    strips)-smartphone sensing platform dedicated to POC testing GLP in food samples.

    2021 American Chemical Society. The extremely high technological advancement of
    the presented pioneer examples of selective and sensitive SM-based sensors sets
    the direction of action in analytical chemistry. Expectedly, the multimodal smartphone-based
    sensors will equip the agronomic and POC laboratories, providing automated, computerized,
    and high-throughput toxin determination, despite the relatively high production
    and maintenance costs. In the near future, smartphone-augmented sensors will be
    commonly used as components of nanobionic PW sensors. For example, PWs based on
    thin nanofilm electronics, such as SWCNTs field-effect transistors, can now detect
    dimethyl methylphosphonate, a volatile nerve agent, at the ppm level. (212) Moreover,
    the flexible, stretchable, and adhesive PW sensor, fabricated by direct writing
    of chitosan-based inks, was active toward plant mechanical injury-responsive healing
    and sensed the intoxication with methyl parathion and nitrites. (213) 3.8. Robotic
    Devices for GLP Delivery The GLP-resistant weeds’ evolution in the farmlands forced
    scientists and farmers to develop novel GLP-free technologies for modern weed
    management. (13,15) Among the development of transgenic crops displaying resistance
    to auxinic herbicides and herbicides displaying inhibitory activity against acetolactate
    synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase or bioherbicides,
    and sprayable herbicidal ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) agents, the nonbiochemical
    solutions have been considered as well. (13,214) Aside from SM AI-enhanced sensors,
    these innovations involve soft terrestrial robotics that will give rise to robotic
    weeding in the nearest future. (13) In 2022, the global agricultural robots market,
    including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), drones, automated harvesting system
    drones, and driverless tractors, was estimated to be worth 5.9 million USD and
    is anticipated to reach a forecast value of 30.5 million USD by 2032 (https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/agriculture-robotics-market,
    access on 21.05.2023). Regarding GLP-oriented systems, a robot-based herbicide
    delivery system is a more advanced system for in-row weed control purposes. The
    robot was tailored to facilitate systematic and site-specific delivery of GLP
    and iodosulfuron droplets to four different weed species in a drop-on-demand manner
    without affecting carrot crops. The droplets were selectively sprayed on the leaves
    of the detected weeds within the plant row. Iodosulfuron, a sulfonylurea-based
    herbicidal inhibitor of acetolactate synthase, was used as an additive herbicide
    to control the species that GLP insufficiently controls. In indoor pot trials,
    amounts of 7.6 μg of GLP and 0.15 μg of iodosulfuron per droplet per plant were
    delivered, whereas in a field trial with the robot system involved, this amount
    was 5.3 μg of GLP per droplet. Moreover, the GLP amount was 10 times lower than
    GLP amount used in conventional crop spraying. (159) In these in-field trials,
    the presented three-wheeled robot GLP delivery system displayed promising properties,
    including relatively low cost, maintainability, maneuverability, stability, and
    robustness, when compared to other commercial agricultural robots. (215,216) (Figure
    7). However, it would be required to perform quantitative environmental impact
    assessments using a comparative life cycle assessment of intra- and inter-row
    weeding management to claim its superior usefulness. (217) Furthermore, worth
    mentioning the costs of devising and exploiting robotic GLP sensors/delivery systems,
    including costs of navigation hardware, machine vision technologies, and power
    consumption, (216) are usually higher than those of conventional broadcast GLP
    analytical techniques, which must be considered when designing experiments or
    applying to industry. Not disregarding these cost limitations, in the long term,
    such robotic-based delivery systems may become a promising alternative for dosing
    a well-defined and strictly controlled amount of pesticides to the crops, thus
    reducing the risk of environmental contamination. Figure 7 Figure 7. Robots used
    for in-row weed control, in-field detection, and site-targeted delivery of herbicides.
    Adapted with permission from ref (159). Copyright 2018 Elsevier. Robotics has
    become fundamental for constructing remote sensors (RSs) for GLP. They have been
    devised and implemented to monitor the agricultural and environmental quality
    of soil, crops, and water status. In particular, these tools have been applied
    to solve major issues of long-term herbicide-resistant weed management (HRWM).
    (36,37) In the first step of modern HRWM, remote sensing is commonly implemented
    to detect and identify infested crops, followed by site-specific herbicide treatment
    of the weeds, mostly in their germination stage. (218) Besides, RSs can be used
    for the man-free determination of herbicide-sprayed weeds and crops to eradicate
    the former or improve the latter’s growth using variable-rate technology (VRT).
    (219−224) 4. Future Prospective ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Environment-protective
    farming (also called organic farming) is a goal of sustainable agriculture. (225)
    Agriculture sustainability prevents soil degradation based on economic productivity,
    future crop yield maintenance, limited usage of agrochemicals, and eco-friendly
    integrated pest management and weed control. It ensures the health of the soil,
    air, water, livestock, animal, and humans. (226) Concerning the latter, AI-excelled
    PA is expected to provide tools that enable rapid, mobile, and man-free delivery
    or detect harmful agrochemicals or biomaterials such as fertilizers and biocides.
    The AI technology aims to handle weed infestations because of their devastating
    role in crop cultivation by competing for water, nutrients, light, agricultural
    space, and air gases and by secreting potentially toxic exudates. (227,228) Because
    weeds share the same zone and spread among crops, it is incredibly challenging
    to exterminate them without harming the crops. Besides, spectral images of herbicide-sprayed
    weeds and crops in early developmental stages are similar, which impedes proper
    visualization, recognition, and site-specific eradication. (229−231) Nevertheless,
    AI-enhanced site-specific weed management, including weed patch mapping, will
    be possible. (20,232) It shall allow for the application of nanoformulated herbicides
    in geospatially determined, stimuli-responsive, and dose-dependent manners, thus
    inhibiting weeds’ seed germination and decreasing weed biomass. (218,233) Furthermore,
    tackling weed infestations can be addressed by UAV-handling of farmlands stricken
    with drought, air pollution, or heat caused by local climate changes that have
    been more frequent in the last ten years compared to previous decades. (234) The
    limitation of the GBHs and agrochemical use was the founding myth of environment-protective
    farming, ecology, and weed science. (225) Recent years’ technological advancement
    has displaced a previously in-force “many little hammers” approach based on the
    extensive labor and equipment-consuming field works. (235) Nowadays, AI PA has
    been dominated by “digital farming,” providing the tool for intelligent and site-specific
    monitoring and improving crop protection. For instance, the controlled use of
    GBHs in recent years was associated with no-tillage agricultural systems, thus
    reducing their inevitable deficiencies, including soil degradation and high expenses.
    Thus, the current ban on GLP and GBH shall force farmers to return to conventional
    tillage systems as an effective weed management strategy for keeping crop-weed
    balance. So far, a series of no-tillage and no-GBH strategies have been developed
    to reduce the over-reliance on a few single modes of action herbicides, competitiveness
    in weeds, and dependency on herbicides, while enhancing the strategies of crop
    diversification, harvest weed seed control, and precision agriculture approaches,
    including RNAi technology, gene editing, robotics, and in-site or remote sensing.
    (235) Expectedly, future devising of safe-by-design sensors for herbicides will
    mainly exploit AI tools of nanoinformatics, (236−239) ML, (240−243) and DL. (18,244−247)
    Nanoinformatics-enhanced drug/sensor devising uses predictive risk assessment
    frameworks, including integrated approaches to testing and assessment for the
    in silico prediction, design, and optimization of the parameters of nanomaterials
    used as sensing components or delivery systems according to their agricultural
    destination. (18,248) These parameters refer to structure and functionality as
    well as biocompatibility, stability, biodistribution, and transgenerational phytotoxicity
    of the material, thus providing prediction and translation of the long-term responses
    of the agroecosystem to current conditions, including efficient high or low doses
    of the agrochemical efficiently. This strategy is particularly promising because
    current experimental studies on nanomaterial toxicity require short-term exposures
    to relatively high doses of the agrochemical. (18) Particularly, nanoinformatics
    models combine chemo- and bioinformatics tools with omics databases and in vitro,
    ex vivo, in vivo, and clinical data of the active agents and target or nontarget
    species, allowing for the de novo design of ActI or nanomaterials. (237) The integrated
    web repositories and database were originally created using the data of eight
    model plant species, i.e., Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum,
    Sorghum bicolor, Vitis vinifera, Solanum tuberosum, Medicago truncatula, and Glycine
    max. They enabled the founding of interspecies and intermolecular interaction
    networks such as Plant Omics Center, Plant Secretome, and Subcellular Proteome
    KnowledgeBase. Associated with analogic databases concerning microbiota, agrochemicals
    (PEST-CHEMGRIDS, Pesticide Properties Database, Pesticide Target Interaction Database,
    PubChem), hydroclimatic indicators, and socioeconomic and anthropogenic inputs,
    these nanoinformatics tools facilitate comprehensive and predictive determination
    of molecules, species, and plant diseases at every possible level. (37,249−251)
    Regarding the nanoinformatics-based GLP sensing, the site-targeted performance
    of the future smart sensor shall be applied to the GLP-sprayed areas to determine
    GLP in the chemical environment of natural species. The ML and DL methods have
    already been applied to crop sensing and phenotyping at all scales, including
    lands, fields, canopies, and leaves. (240−243) Thus, presumably, these powerful
    computing tools, incorporated in the future smart sensors, will be easily harnessed
    to predict tripartite (e.g., “agrochemical-soil-plant,” “pathogen-treatment-plant”)
    interactions under variable climate conditions. (18,244−247) The DL-enhanced algorithms
    will process the object and spectral data regarding the images’ numbers, types,
    sizes, and resolutions by grouping proximal pixels (of a few millimeters or centimeters)
    with homogeneous spectral value, combining them spectrally, topologically, and
    contextually. (252) Upon spatiotemporal evaluation of the vegetation indices,
    including temperature, biomass, moisture, weed infestation, and nitrogen balance
    index (chlorophyll-to-polyphenol ratio) of these objects, the smart sensors shall
    identify the nature of the stress and apply proper fertilizers, agrochemicals,
    and irrigation waters in a site-specific manner using VRT-based equipment. (253)
    In effect, the computational tool-excelled smart sensors will acquire and process
    massive amounts of data on “what,” “how,” “where,” and “when” the human intervention
    should be applied to address the most pressing needs, thus reducing the consumption
    of herbicides, such as GLP, to an absolute minimum. (244−247) Author Information

    study, the world’s population will reach 9.8 billion people by 2050. This rise
    in population demands nearly 70% increase in current food production rate. Agriculture
    is the world’s most important industry, contributing significantly to social stability
    and economic progress.[1] The transition from traditional agriculture (also known
    as Agriculture 1.0) to intelligent agriculture (IA) (also known as Agriculture
    4.0) is the only alternative to meet the growing demand efficiently.[2] IA is
    a new approach that uses the current information and communication technologies
    in conjunction with conventional farming practices to improve the quality and
    quantity of agricultural products.[3] The IA helps in intelligent decision making
    and provides various personalized services through different key technologies
    including, Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cloud computing,
    and artificial intelligence.[4] In a typical IA ecosystem, several data acquisition
    technologies, such as IoT devices and actuators are deployed to collect both field
    and crop growth information. In addition, UAVs are used to gather data from IoT
    devices and, in certain cases, they may collect data directly from particular
    flying zones (FZ). The data acquired are forwarded to cloud servers (CSs) for
    the purpose of addressing complex agricultural issues, such as yield prediction,
    water feed calculation, and so on, assisting farmers and other stakeholders in
    making smart decisions that increase agricultural production and quality.[5] However,
    the distributed nature of IA entities (including IoT devices, UAVs, and CSs),
    and the usage of insecure wireless communication open various challenges related
    to data sharing, monitoring, storage, and further makes the entire IA ecosystem
    vulnerable to various potential attacks including impersonation, replay, man-in-the-middle,
    data poisoning, brute-force, physical smart devices, and UAVs capture attacks.[6]
    In the literature, several key management mechanisms, blockchain- and SC-based
    authentication strategies for enhancing security of IoT-enabled IA have been put
    forth. For instance, works presented in Bera et al.[7] Vangala et al.[8] Rahman
    et al.,[9] and Vangala et al.[10] were mainly based on user authentication/authorization
    and session key management. However, all abovementioned solution used blockchain
    as a distributed storage mechanism to store entire agricultural transactions.
    Unfortunately, blockchain becomes inefficient when complete transaction are offloaded
    to the distributed ledger but works better with data hashes.[11] Furthermore,
    we believe that all of the abovementioned authorization and authentication techniques
    are insufficient for addressing security issues in IoT-enabled IA networks since
    they only ensure that data transmission is secure but do not guarantee or check
    the type of data (attack or normal) before it is added to blockchain.[12],[13]
    Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we exploit deep learning and SC
    to propose a new IoT-enabled IA framework for enabling secure data sharing among
    its various entities. Specifically, first we develop new authentication and key
    management scheme to ensure secure data transmission in IoT-enabled IA. The encrypted
    transactions are then used by the CS to analyze and further detect intrusions
    by a novel deep learning architecture. The latter is a novel architecture that
    is designed using a contractive sparse autoencoder (CSAE), gated recurrent unit
    (GRU) networks, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and softmax classifier for attack
    detection. In CS, the SC-based proof of authority (PoA-Aura) consensus mechanism
    is executed on legitimate transactions that verifies and adds the formed blocks
    into interplanetary file system (IPFS) by a peer-to-peer (P2P) CSs network. The
    returned crypographic hash if further stored on blockchain. System Models We introduce
    a network model in this part, followed by a threat model, both of which were used
    in the design of the proposed framework. Network Model The network model of the
    proposed framework is illustrated in Figure 1. In this model, we have mainly eight
    entities, trusted authority (TA), IoT device (IoT D ), UAV, intrusion detection
    system (IDS), CS, IPFS, SC, and blockchain network (BN). In IoT-enabled IA, the
    TA is responsible to register IoT D , UAV, and CS prior to their deployment. Initially,
    the authentication and key management phase includes mutual authentication and
    key agreement between two IoT D , between IoT D and its associated UAV, and between
    UAV and CS using the established session keys. This phase ensures secure communication
    among the participating entities. Once the communications starts, the IoT D placed
    in each FZ has the capability to extract crop readings from its zone. Each FZ
    is associated with a UAV that collects the readings from Io T D . These data or
    transactions include the status of standing crops, quantity of chemicals used
    as pesticides at various locations, and so on. These transactions are forwarded
    to CS , where the proposed IDS checks and marks the transaction as normal and
    abnormal based on the behavior. The valid transaction are then used by each CS
    for mining using SC. Specifically, each CS mines and stores the valid transactions
    into IPFS, keeping the returned transaction hash into the global BN . Figure 1.
    Network model of proposed framework. Show All The IPFS hashes of the verified
    transactions are packed into the current block by each miner, who also creates
    the merkle root and block hash while calculating the subsequent block. If C S
    A calculates a block hash that satisfies the difficulty, it will be broadcast
    to miners C S B , C S C , and C S D , and so on. After receiving the block, miners
    C S B , C S C , and C S D must check the transactions and block hash. The majority
    of transactions received by miners C S B , C S C , and C S D throughout the mining
    process are similar to those received by miner C S A . They only alter a small
    number of transactions in their transaction pool because of network transmission
    delays. As a consequence, the vast majority of IPFS hashes for transactions in
    the new block match those in miner C S B , C S C , and C S D ’s personal transaction
    pool. If the local transaction pools of miners C S B , C S C , and C S D include
    the IPFS hash of a transaction in a block delivered by miner C S A , then the
    transaction has already been confirmed by these miners and does not require downloading
    from IPFS. The IPFS network must be accessed using the proper IPFS hashes in order
    to receive the data for the remaining transactions. The authenticity of the block
    and the transactions would then be verified. The BN could then be updated with
    the new block. Threat Model The “Dolev-Yao” threat model, often known as the DY
    model, is the first one we employ in this article.[14] This theory states that
    an adversary designated as A has the ability to not only intercept, alter, or
    delete communication messages between any two participants, but also to introduce
    harmful messages into the channel. (TA) stands for trusted authority, which is
    meant to be a totally trustworthy organization. Io T D and UAV are regarded as
    untrusted entities, although CS are regarded as semitrusted. The Canetti and Krawczyk
    adversary model (also known as CK-adversary), which is another threat model, is
    also used.[15] An attacker A in this scenario has the ability to hijack the session
    key/state on a live session between two network users, and steal confidential
    credentials. Proposed Framework Deep Learning Module In this section, a deep learning
    model is proposed that is used to detect intrusion in the IoT-enabled IA ecosystem.
    When dealing with large amounts of data in IoT-enabled IA, deep learning models
    surpass conventional statistical or machine learning techniques. This phenomenon
    has been discovered and validated in a number of research articles and publications.[1],[11]
    As a consequence, when compared to other statistical or machine learning methodologies,
    deep learning is a better option. This article introduces a novel deep learning
    architecture for developing a better IDS for IoT-enabled IA. In this approach,
    we have combined CSAE, GRU network, MLPs, and softmax classifier. Each of them
    are explained in the following. Contractive Sparse AutoEncoder Layer The autoencoder
    (AE) is a technique for unsupervised learning that consists of two components:
    the encoder and decoder. As seen here, the encoder uses a deterministic affine
    transformation matrix with nonlinearity to transform the input D T into a hidden
    representation Y T [4] Y T =F( Ł 1 D T + ß 1 ) (1) View Source where Lstrok; 1
    is the weight between the input D T , and the hidden representation Y T and ß
    1 denotes the bias. The Y T variable is used by the decoder to recreate the output
    D T ˆ D T ˆ = F ′ ( Ł 2 Y T + ß 2 ) (2) View Source where the weight of the hidden
    representations Y T , and D T ˆ is denoted by Ł 2 and bias is represented by ß
    2 . D T ˆ is the name given to the reconstruction of D T . The purpose of AE is
    to minimize the reconstruction error for a given training set, which is performed
    by decreasing the following cost function while learning the AE parameters Ł 1
    ˆ , Ł 2 ˆ , ß 1 ˆ , ß 2 ˆ : { Ł 1 ˆ , Ł 2 ˆ , ß 1 ˆ , ß 2 ˆ } = argmin Ł 1 , Ł
    2 , ß 1 , ß 2 { L AE (Ł,ß)} = argmin Ł 1 , Ł 2 , ß 1 , ß 2 { 1 2N ∑ T=1 N L( D
    T , D T ˆ ) + λ 2 ∑ r=1 2 ∥ D T ∥ 2 F }. (3) View Source The training sample and
    its reconstruction output are represented by D T and D T ˆ , respectively. N is
    the total number of training samples, and L( D T , D T ˆ ) represents the loss
    function. Using square error or cross entropy, this can be decreased. λ stands
    for regularization term, which aids model generalization. From the original dataset,
    the sparse autoencoder (SAE) attempts to learn sparse yet inherent features. The
    SAE loss function is stated as, and it is produced by adding a sparsity penalty
    term to the AE loss function[16] L SAE ( Ł 1 ˆ , Ł 2 ˆ , ß 1 ˆ , ß 2 ˆ )= L AE
    (Ł,ß)+η ∑ J=1 M KL(ϱ∥ ϱ ^ J ) (4) View Source where η determines the weight of
    the sparse penalty item To produce a fairly sparse representation, it is typical
    to use a small value, such as 0.05. Most nodes in the hidden layer are suppressed
    by SAE using the KL divergence. The following formula is used to determine the
    KL divergence: ∑ J=1 M KL(ϱ∥ ϱ ^ J )= ∑ J=1 M {(1−ϱ)log( 1−ϱ 1− ϱ ˆ )+ϱlog ϱ ϱ
    ˆ j }. (5) View Source The average activation value of all the training samples
    on the j th neuron in the hidden layer is ϱ ^ J , and the sparsity parameter is
    ϱ . As a result, we may write the SAE loss function as { Ł 1 ˆ , Ł 2 ˆ , ß 1 ˆ
    , ß 2 ˆ } = argmin Ł 1 , Ł 2 , ß 1 , ß 2 { L SAE (Ł,ß)} = argmin Ł 1 , Ł 2 , ß
    1 , ß 2 { 1 2N ∑ T=1 N L( D T , D T ˆ ) + λ 2 ∑ r=1 2 ∥ D T ∥ 2 F +η ∑ J=1 M KL(ϱ∥
    ϱ ^ J )}. (6) View Source Finally, the input data D T of the aforementioned cost
    function is given an explicit regularizer in the form of a Jacobian matrix J F
    ( D T ) . The model becomes less sensitive to modest changes in the input values
    as a result of this process. It simply instructs the neurons to ignore little
    data changes and respond only to larger, more meaningful ones. This “penalty”
    is only applied during the training of the model; therefore, it has no bearing
    when the network is employed. As a result, the cost function of the CSAE can be
    written as follows: { Ł 1 ˆ , Ł 2 ˆ , ß 1 ˆ , ß 2 ˆ } = argmin Ł 1 , Ł 2 , ß 1
    , ß 2 { L CSAE (Ł,ß)} = argmin Ł 1 , Ł 2 , ß 1 , ß 2 { 1 2N ∑ T=1 N L( D T , D
    T ˆ ) + λ 2 ∑ r=1 2 ∥ J F ( D T ) ∥ 2 F . +η ∑ J=1 M KL(ϱ∥ ϱ ^ J )} (7) View Source
    where ∥ J F ( D T ) ∥ 2 F represents the square of the Jacobian matrix’s Frobenius
    norm. For attack detection, the acquired features are fed into the following module,
    which combines GRU+MLP+softmax classifiers. GRU Network Layer The GRU network
    receives the low-dimensional feature vector from CSAE layer. The GRU can be single-layered
    or multilayered (stacked), depending on the hyperparameter optimization. The D
    T is the input for a given time step T , and the computations are R T =σ( D T
    Ł R + H T−1 Ł R + ß R ) Z T =σ( D T Ł Z + H T−1 Ł Z + ß Z ) C T =tanh( D T Ł C
    + H T−1 Ł C ⊙ R T + ß C ) H T = Z T ⊙ H T−1 +(1− Z T ⊙ C T ). (8) View Source
    The previous time-hidden step’s state is H T−1 , the reset gate is R T , the update
    gate is Z T , the weight parameters are Ł R and Ł Z , and the biases are ß R and
    ß Z . C T is the hidden candidate state, whereas H T is the new state. ReLU function
    is denoted by the letter ⊙ , which stands for Hadamard product. The output of
    a multilayered GRU network is the hidden state H T of the preceding layer, and
    there is no dropout between the layers. MLPs Layer The dense layer of MLP uses
    the output vector of the GRU layer H T to represent the output activation of its
    node in the following way: D 1 (α) D 2 (M) =f( Ł T 1 H T + ß 1 ) =f( Ł T 2 D 1
    (α)+ ß 2 ). (9) (10) View Source The weight matrix Ł 1 connects the output of
    the GRU layer with the first hidden layer, and the bias vector ß 1 is connected
    with that layer. where Ł 2 is the weight matrix linking the first and last hidden
    layers, and ß 2 is the bias associated with the weight matrices. Softmax Classifier
    Layer Finally, the softmax classifier is integrated with the proposed deep learning
    architecture to determine the likelihood that the projected type belongs to each
    category. We use (11) to compute it, where M is the previous layer’s output and
    softmax’s input, C is its dimension, and k is the probability of the projected
    type belonging to a certain class. Equation (12) is used to compute the loss function
    f( M k ) LOSS(y,M) = e M k ∑ C j=1 e M j ,k=1,…,C =− ∑ k=0 C y k log(f( M k ))).

    by the proposed SC-based authentication and key management module. Initialization
    Phase This phase explores, how TA chooses the parameters to register the entities
    of framework. The detailed process is discussed in the following. First, nonsingular
    elliptic curve is selected by the TA , i.e., E t (β , γ ) S 2 = T 3 + αT + γ (mod
    W n ), where W n is a large prime value and β , γ ∈ V ∗ = {1,2,3, … , W n } are
    the two points, i.e, infinity point and zero point ZO . Further, the TA chooses
    a base point BP ∈ E t (β , γ ) of order U as bigger as W n . Furthermore, TA chooses
    a cryptographic hash function (HF) (.) using SHA-512. In addition, TA chooses
    an identity I D T A , and picks a private key T A P R ∈ V ∗ and evaluates a public
    key T A P B = T A P R * BP . Finally, the TA preserve a private key ( T A P R
    ) secret and disseminates public parameters{( E t (β , γ ), BP , (HF)(.) , T A
    P B )}. Registration Phase This phase describes a registration process of each
    entities and shares the communication parameters. a)Io T D Registration: The TA
    registers an IoT nodes IoT D , where IoT D ={1,2, …, IoT D } Step-1: The TA chooses
    an unique identity I D I oT for registration of IoT devices. Further, TA evaluates
    a pseudoidentity PSI D I oT D = H( I D I oT D || C IoT PR || TST P I oT D ), where
    TST P I oT D is a registration time of IoT D and generates a certificate CR T
    I oT D =T A P R+ H( PSI D I oT D || C IoT PB || T A P B ) * C IoT PR mod ( W n
    ). Step-2: TA chooses a random number RN IoT D ∈ V ∗ , and evaluates a partial
    private key, i.e., PP R I oT D = H( T A P R || C IoT PR || RN IoT D ), and evaluates
    a public key P B I oT D = PP R I oT D * B for each IoT D and preserves registration
    information ( PSI D I oT D , PP R I oT D , CR T I oT D ) on board units OBU D
    of IoT devices IoT D . Finally, TA deletes a partial private key PP R I oT D and
    disseminates the public key P B I oT D for communication. b) UAV Registration:
    The TA registers a UAV UAV t , where UAV t ={1,2, …, UAV t }. Step-1: The TA chooses
    an unique identity I D U AV for registration of UAV. Further, TA evaluates a pseudoidentity
    PSI D U AV t H( I D U AV t || C UAV PR || TST P U AV t ), where TST P U AV t is
    a registration time UAV r and produces certificate CR T U AV t = T A P R + H(
    PSI D U AV t || C UAV PB || T A P B ) * C UAV PR mod ( W n ). Step-2: TA chooses
    a random number RN UAV t ∈ V ∗ , and evaluates a partial private key PP R U AV
    t = H( T A P R || C UAV PR || RN UAV t ), and evaluates a public key P B U AV
    t = PP R U AV t * B for each UAV t preserves a registration information ( PSI
    D U AV t , PP R U AV t , CR T U AV t ) on its borad unit OBU t of UAV UAV t .
    Finally, TA deletes partial private key PP R U AV t and disseminates a public
    key P B U AV t for communication. The detail of UAV, i.e., ( CR T U AV t , P B
    U AV t , PSI D U AV t , I D U AV t ) are disseminated to CS l . c) CS Registration:
    The TA register CS l , where CS l ={1,2, …, CS l }. Step-1: The TA chooses a unique
    identity I D C S for individual CS l registration. Next, TA it evaluates pseudo
    identity PSI D C S l H( I D C S l || C CS PR || TST P C S l ), where TST P C S
    l is a time of registration of cloud severs CS l and produces a certificate CR
    T C S l = T A P R + H( PSI D C S l || C CS PB || T A P B ) * C CS PR mod ( W n
    ). Step-2: A random number is chosen by TA, i.e., RN CS l ∈ V ∗ , and evaluates
    a partial private key, i.e., PP R C S l = H( T A P R || C CS PR || RN CS l ),
    and evaluates a public key P B C S l = PP R C S l * B for each CS l and preserves
    a registration information ( PSI D C S l , PP R C S l , CR T C S l ) on its borad
    unit OBU l of cloud CS l . Finally, TA deletes a partial private key PP R C S
    l and disseminates a public key P B C S l for communication. Key Agreement and
    Authentication Phase We have discussed various steps used in key agreement and
    authentication. i) IoT nodes to UAV Authentication Step-1: IoT D chooses an unique
    random number d r 1 ∈ Z q with valid timestamp TST P 1 and evalautes L 1 = h (
    PSI D I oT D || PP R I oT D || d r 1 || TST P 1 ). Further, IoT D encrypt the
    L 1 as L 2 = E P B U AV ( L 1 ). Furthermore, IoT D evaluates the L 3 = h( L 2
    || CR T I oT D || PSI D I oT D || PP R I oT D || TST P 1 ) and makes a request
    message M 1 ={ PSI D I oT D , PP R I oT D , TST P 1 , L 2 , L 3 } and transmit
    to UAV through open channel. Step-2: After receiving successful message M 1 timestamp
    gets validated TSTP ∗ 1 , using UAV | TSTP ∗ 1 – TST P 1 | < ΔT . After successful
    verification of timestamp, UAV checks certificates using CR T I oT D . B = P B
    T A + h( P B I oT D || P B T A ) if it matches successful then UAV receives PSI
    D I oT D respect to PP R I oT D from the database and evaluates L ∗ 3 = h ( L
    2 || PSI D I oT D || PP R I oT D || CR T I oT D ) to verify whether L ∗ 3 = L
    3 . If it matches successful then UAV uses decryption L 2 as L 1 = D PR UAV (
    L 2 ). Step-3: Further, UAV picks a unique random number UAV r 1 ∈ Z q and valid
    timestamp gets recorded TST P 2 and generates a temporary identity PP R I oT new
    D and evalautes UA V 1 = h( PSI D I oT D || PSI D U AV || UAV r 1 || TST P 2 )
    and uses encryption UA V 1 as UA V 2 = E P B I oT D (UA V 1 ). Next, UAV evaluates
    a session key SE S U AV = h( PP R I oT new D || L 1 || UA V 1 || TST P 1 || TST
    P 2 ), PP R I oT ∗ D = PP R I oT new D ⊕ h( PSI D U AV || PP R I oT D || TST P
    2 ), and UA V 3 =h( PP R I oT ∗ D || UA V 1 || CR T U AV || PSI D U AV || TST
    P 2 ) and creates reply message M 2 = { PP R I oT ∗ D , UA V 2 , UA V 2 , CR T
    U AV , PSI D U AV , TST P 2 } and transmit to IoT D through open channel. Step-4:
    After successful recieve of reply message ( M 2 ) timestamp gets validated TSTP
    ∗ 2 by IoT D whether | TSTP ∗ 2 – TST P 2 | < ΔT is denoting correct timestamp
    if it matches successful, then IoT D checks certificate by CR T U AV . B = P B
    T A + h( P B U AV || P B T A ). Further, IoT D uses decryption, the UA V 2 computes
    UA V 1 = D PR IoT D (UA V 2 ). Next, IoT D evaluates UAV ∗ 3 = h( PP R I oT ∗
    D || UA V 1 || CR T U AV || PSI D U AV || TST P 2 ) and verify, if UAV ∗ 3 = UA
    V 3 then IoT D evaluates PP R I oT new D = PP R I oT ∗ D ⊕ h( PSI D U AV || PP
    R I oT D || TST P 2 ) and evaluates a session key SE S I oT D = h( PP R I oT new
    D || L 1 || UA V 1 || TST P 1 || TST P 2 ) and disseminates to UAV . Further,
    IoT D chooses a valid timestamp TST P 3 and verify session key SES V I oT D by
    SES V I oT D = h( SE S I oT D || TST P 3 ) and makes changes to PP R I oT D and
    PP R I oT new D in the database. Furthermore, IoT D generates acknowledgment message
    M 3 ={ SES V I oT D , TST P 3 } and transmit to UAV through open channel. Step-5:
    After successfully receiving the acknowledgement message M 3 timestamp gets validated
    TSTP ∗ 3 , by UAV | TSTP ∗ 3 – TST P 3 | < ΔT is denoting correct timestamp. Next
    UAV checks SES V I oT D = h ( SES V U AV || TST P 3 ). After successful match,
    the UAV makes establishment of the session key SES V I oT D (= SES V U AV ) by
    IoT D . Finally, UAV makes changes with PP R I oT D and PP R I oT new D in database.
    ii) UAV to CS Authentication Step-1: UAV t chooses a unique random number d r
    1 ∈ Z q and valid timestamp TST P 1 and evalautes L 1 = h ( PSI D U AV t || PP
    R U AV t || d r 1 || TST P 1 ). Further, UAV t makes encryption L 1 as L 2 = E
    P B C S ( L 1 ). Furthermore, UAV t evaluates L 3 = h( L 2 || CR T U AV t || PSI
    D U AV t || PP R U AV t || TST P 1 ) and creates message request for access M
    1 ={ PSI D U AV t , PP R U AV t , TST P 1 , L 2 , L 3 } and transmit to CS through
    open channel. Algorithm 1. Proof-of-Authority (Aura Algorithm) for Block Verification

    V ← {b i.UAV | b i ∈ A i ∧ b i.step >= b.step } return ( |V| * 2 > | CS l | )
    31: end Function Step-2: After successfully receiving the message M 1 timestamp
    gets validated TSTP ∗ 1 by CS | TSTP ∗ 1 – TST P 1 | < ΔT . If timestamp validated
    successfully, then CS checks certificate by CR T U AV t . B = P B T A + h( P B
    U AV t || P B T A ) if it matches successfully, then CS receives PSI D U AV t
    with respect to PP R U AV t from the database and evaluate L ∗ 3 = h ( L 2 ||
    PSI D U AV t || PP R U AV t || CR T U AV t ) to verify whether L ∗ 3 = L 3 . If
    it matches successfully, then CS uses decryption L 2 as L 1 = D PR CS ( L 2 ).
    Step-3: Further, CS picks a unique random number CS r 1 ∈ Z q and valid timestamp
    TST P 2 and generates temporary identity PP R U AV new t and evaluates C S 1 =
    h( PSI D U AV t || PSI D C S || CS r 1 || TST P 2 ) and uses encryption C S 1
    as C S 2 = E P B U AV t (C S 1 ). Furthermore, CS generates a session key SE S
    C S = h( PP R U AV new t || L 1 || C S 1 || TST P 1 || TST P 2 ), PP R U AV ∗
    t = PP R U AV new t ⊕ h( PSI D C S || PP R U AV t || TST P 2 ), and C S 3 = h(
    PP R U AV ∗ t || C S 1 || CR T C S || PSI D C S || TST P 2 ) and generates reply
    message M 2 = { PP R U AV ∗ t , C S 2 , C S 2 , CR T C S , PSI D C S , TST P 2
    } and transmit to UAV t through open channel. Step-4: After successfully receiving
    the reply message ( M 2 ) from CS, timestamp gets validated TSTP ∗ 2 by UAV t
    , i.e., | TSTP ∗ 2 – TST P 2 | < ΔT is denoting valid timestamp or invalid timestamp.
    If matches successfully, then UAV t checks for certificate using CR T C S . B
    = P B T A + h( P B C S || P B T A ). Further, UAV t uses decryption C S 2 to C
    S 1 = D PR UAV t (C S 2 ). Furthermore, UAV t evaluates CS ∗ 3 = h( PP R U AV
    ∗ t || C S 1 || CR T C S || PSI D C S || TST P 2 ) and verify CS ∗ 3 = C S 3 then
    UAV t evaluates PP R U AV new t = PP R U AV ∗ t ⊕ h( PSI D C S || PP R U AV t
    || TST P 2 ) and generates a session key SE S U AV t = h( PP R U AV new t || L
    1 || C S 1 || TST P 1 || TST P 2 ) and disseminates to CS . Furthermore, UAV t
    chooses valid timestamp TST P 3 and verify session key SES V U AV t by SES V U
    AV t = h( SE S U AV t || TST P 3 ) and makes changes with PP R U AV t and PP R
    U AV new t in the database. Finally, UAV t generates an acknowledgment message
    M 3 ={ SES V U AV t , TST P 3 } and transmit to CS through open channel. Step-5:
    After successfully receiving the acknowledgment message M 3 timestamp gets validated
    TSTP ∗ 3 by CS , i.e.; | TSTP ∗ 3 – TST P 3 | < ΔT is denoting valid timestamp
    or invalid timestamp. Further, CS checks SES V U AV t = h ( SES V C S || TST P
    3 ). If it is valid, then CS makes the establishment of session key SES V U AV
    t (= SES V C S ) to UAV t . Finally, CS makes changes PP R U AV t and PP R U AV
    new t in the database. Consensus Phase In this phase, the block verification and
    creation in the P2P network is discussed. IoT devices are authorized to create
    transactions in the network after a successful session verification, and after
    successful verification of transactions using consensus mechanism a block is created
    by the miners ( CS ) and added into the network. The block C i consists of two
    parameters, such as local blockchain of peer, i.e., A i and block pointer, i.e.,
    F i . The blocks are created after voting process, when more than 50% of voting
    is done by the peer nodes ( CS l ). The verification and block creations is illustrated
    in the Algorithm 1. Security Analysis This phase describes security analysis of
    the proposed model. It includes the formal verification to prevent various attacks.
    The detailed security analysis is summarized in the following. 1) Impersonation
    attack: An attacker can generate temporary identity IoT D , pseudoidentity PSI
    D I oT D , and partial private key PP R I oT D to perform operation as a legitimate
    user. Further, timestamp TST P I oT D can be generated for access permissions
    in the framework. However, session-based approach is applied to verify the unique
    identity of the devices IoT D . If all credential is matched then access permissions
    granted, else connections terminated immediately. Thus, this approach prevents
    from impersonation attack. 2) Insider attack: The attackers are privileged (can
    be insider) and can sniff all the credential, such as IoT device identification
    IoT D , pseudoidentity PSI D I oT D , and timestamp TST P I oT D . However, the
    access can only be permitted after session-based verification of the entities.
    Thus, the approach does not allow access without permissions and prevents from
    insider attack. 3) MITM and replay attack: The attacker may get the details of
    the IoT devices from insecure channel and communications, such as IoT D and timestamp
    TST P I oT D of registration. The attackers may send the details to the UAVs for
    making certain operations. However, the UAVs checks for the timestamp and verifies
    the session. However, it is difficult to compute all the credential at certain
    interval of time from id generation to session verification. Performing all the
    required evaluation at perfect time edge is difficult. Thus, the attacker cannot
    perform the MITM and replay attack. Performance Analysis The experiments were
    executed on a Tyrone PC with two 2.20 GHz Intel CPUs and 128 GB of RAM. The IDS
    was developed using the TensorFlow package Keras. The Ethereum Rinkeby network
    was used to create the SC module. The CSAE layer was trained for 10 epochs using
    two hidden layers containing (64,32) neurons, whereas GRU used two hidden layers
    with (64,32) neurons, MLP used two hidden layers with (16,8) and last layer has
    softmax classifier, Adam optimizer, ReLU activation, categorical cross-entropy
    as loss function, and 100 batch size for 10 epochs. The intrusion performance
    was evaluated using the CICIDS-2017 dataset, which contains 390,222 attack and
    2,035,505 normal instances.[17] We preprocessed both datasets using the techniques
    outlined in Kumar et al.’s[18] work with 70% training and 30% testing sets. This
    article employs a variety of performance metrics, such as, accuracy, detection
    rate, precision score, F1 score, and false alarm rate. However, to calculate these
    values, various parameters are used, such as, true positive ( α ), true negative
    ( γ ), false positive ( β ), and false negative ( δ ) determines correct classified
    attack instances, correct classified normal instances, normal observations classified
    as attack instances, and attack observations classified as normal instances, respectively;[1]
    Accuracy (AC): The percentage of all correctly identified regular and attack instances
    is determined by AC that is; AC= α+γ γ+δ+α+β . Detection rate (DR): The appropriate
    proportion of attacks identified is determined by DR or recall (RC) that is, DR=
    α δ+α . Precision (PR): PR is calculated by dividing the number of attack behaviors
    observed by the total number of observations classified as an attack, PR= α α+β
    . F1 Score: The weighted average of PR and DR/RC is determined by the F1 score,
    that is, F1=2∗ PR∗RC PR+RC . False alarm rate (FAR): FAR identifies cases of attack
    that were incorrectly identified, that is, FAR= β β+γ . Deep Learning Module Analysis
    The performance of DL approach is evaluated using a variety of assessment metrics.
    The proposed CSAE technique’s accuracy versus loss is depicted in Figure 2. Despite
    being employed to extract low-dimensional features, the CSAE method learned the
    dataset effectively, with a validation accuracy of 87.92% and a validation loss
    of 0.0546%. Table 1 shows the classwise performance of the proposed model. It
    is observed that the values for PR, DR, and F1 score is high, and FAR is close
    to 0%. We have also compared the DR of the proposed model with other baseline
    techniques in Table 2. It is seen that the proposed model outperformed these baselines
    for the majority of the vectors present in the dataset. Finally, as shown in Figure
    3, the overall performance of proposed model is compared with traditional approach.
    It is seen that the proposed model has achieved higher values and outperformed
    RF, DT, and NB. TABLE 1 Classwise performance analysis of proposed IDS TABLE 2

    All Conclusion In this article, we designed a DL and SC-assisted secure data sharing
    framework for IoT-based IA. Specifically, a novel DL module was designed that
    combined CSAE with GRU, MLPs, and softmax classifier to detect intrusion in the
    network. In SC module, first authentication, key management scheme was proposed.
    The, normal transactions received from DL-based IDS were mined by CS using SC-based
    PoA (aura algorithm) consensus technique. The validated transactions were added
    to the IPFS-based storage layer and returned cryptographic hash was stored on
    blockchain ledger. Experimental analysis of DL and SC module proves the effectiveness
    of the proposed framework. The future work includes the performance evaluation
    in terms of scalability and latency using different real-world datasets. Authors

  description: Improper disposal of municipal sewage sludge poses a significant threat
    to effective environmental protection. With the continuous advancement of artificial
    intelligence technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing detection
    technology is emerging as a promising research avenue to address this issue. However,
    the current state of real-Time detection technology is inadequate, hindering comprehensive
    and stable monitoring operation. Additionally, the rational use of network resources
    remains suboptimal. To address this challenge, this study proposes a resource
    optimisation technology for the current insufficient intelligent monitoring system
    of urban sewage sludge. By leveraging IoT and wireless technology, water meter
    data can be collected with minimal earth construction compared to traditional
    PLC collection. This is followed by utilising Faster R-CNN to plan the network
    transmission of sewage remote sensing information resources. Finally, the architecture
    collection module's scalability is enhanced by incorporating edge computing and
    reserving sensor ports to meet future plant expansion demands. The experiment
    demonstrates the significant potential of this technology in application and resource
    optimisation. In actual parameter tracking tests, the proposed method effectively
    monitors sewage sludge, providing policy guidance and measure optimisation for
    relevant authorities, ultimately contributing to pollution-free urban development.

  description: Background Schools are high-risk settings for infectious disease transmission.
    Wastewater monitoring for infectious diseases has been used to identify and mitigate
    outbreaks in many near-source settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, including
    universities and hospitals but less is known about the technology when applied
    for school health protection. This study aimed to implement a wastewater surveillance
    system to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other public health markers from wastewater in
    schools in England. Methods A total of 855 wastewater samples were collected from
    16 schools (10 primary, 5 secondary and 1 post-16 and further education) over
    10 months of school term time. Wastewater was analysed for SARS-CoV-2 genomic
    copies of N1 and E genes by RT-qPCR. A subset of wastewater samples was sent for
    genomic sequencing, enabling determination of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and emergence
    of variant(s) contributing to COVID-19 infections within schools. In total, >280
    microbial pathogens and >1200 AMR genes were screened using RT-qPCR and metagenomics
    to consider the utility of these additional targets to further inform on health
    threats within the schools. Results We report on wastewater-based surveillance
    for COVID-19 within English primary, secondary and further education schools over
    a full academic year (October 2020 to July 2021). The highest positivity rate
    (80.4%) was observed in the week commencing 30th November 2020 during the emergence
    of the Alpha variant, indicating most schools contained people who were shedding
    the virus. There was high SARS-CoV-2 amplicon concentration (up to 9.2x106 GC/L)
    detected over the summer term (8th June - 6th July 2021) during Delta variant
    prevalence. The summer increase of SARS-CoV-2 in school wastewater was reflected
    in age-specific clinical COVID-19 cases. Alpha variant and Delta variant were
    identified in the wastewater by sequencing of samples collected from December
    to March and June to July, respectively. Lead/lag analysis between SARS-CoV-2
    concentrations in school and WWTP data sets show a maximum correlation between
    the two-time series when school data are lagged by two weeks. Furthermore, wastewater
    sample enrichment coupled with metagenomic sequencing and rapid informatics enabled
    the detection of other clinically relevant viral and bacterial pathogens and AMR.
    Conclusions Passive wastewater monitoring surveillance in schools can identify
    cases of COVID-19. Samples can be sequenced to monitor for emerging and current
    variants of concern at the resolution of school catchments. Wastewater based monitoring
    for SARS-CoV-2 is a useful tool for SARS-CoV-2 passive surveillance and could
    be applied for case identification and containment, and mitigation in schools
    and other congregate settings with high risks of transmission. Wastewater monitoring
    enables public health authorities to develop targeted prevention and education
    programmes for hygiene measures within undertested communities across a broad
    range of use cases.

    Since the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in March 2020 [1], the potential
    for wastewater monitoring to support pandemic mitigation measures has received
    considerable international attention [2, 3]. Wastewater is an aggregate of domestic
    and industrial effluents and stormwater, containing a mix of faeces, urine, mucus,
    and vomit from the ‘upstream’ population, which can be interrogated for population
    health purposes [4]. Specifically, viruses, bacteria, fungi, protists, anthropogenic
    chemicals (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, detergents, fragrances etc.),
    and human metabolites are shed into a sewer network, offering the potential to
    support public health decision makers through their analysis over time and space.
    It has been extensively reported that SARS-CoV-2 can be recovered in various bodily
    fluids such as saliva [5], sputum [6, 7], faeces [6, 8], and urine [8, 9]. Wastewater-based
    epidemiology proliferated during the COVID-19 pandemic because it offered a rapid,
    low-cost, non-invasive method for capturing symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and
    asymptomatic cases at a community level, including those from hard-to-reach and/or
    reticent to test populations [10, 11]. Wastewater monitoring can generate less
    biased insights than clinical testing of individuals as it does not require consent
    to sample from a sewer system [12]. There is considerable debate about whether
    wastewater data is a leading indicator of clinical cases (i.e., temporally ahead
    of). Since wastewater can be immediately analysed from shedding individuals at
    a population level it can feasibly offer more rapid insights than clinical approaches,
    which require the infected individual to proactively be tested for infection,
    something that would normally occur days after the start of an infection. In addition,
    this approach is also biased toward those with health seeking behaviour, missing
    out on those reluctant to test. Evidence suggests the link between cases and wastewater
    data depends on epidemiological (including biological, and health systems factors
    of specific populations of interest) [13], as well as (infra) structural aspects
    (i.e. the scale, frequency of clinical testing and pipe network characteristics).
    Whilst both clinical and wastewater samples require laboratory processing (analyte
    extraction), wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 RNA typically occurs in a more degraded
    form and at lower titre in comparison to clinical samples. However, despite this
    challenge, extracted RNA is amenable to genomic sequencing, providing an opportunity
    to continuously monitor and map the occurrence and spread of new variants [14]
    and their sub-lineages [4]. Schools are known to provide a conducive environment
    for the transmission of both respiratory and enteric infections through large
    numbers of people mixing regularly and at close quarters, in potentially poorly
    ventilated settings [15–17]. School age students can also be individually vulnerable
    due to stress and poor hygiene practices [18]. The role of schools as amplifiers
    of COVID-19 infections was not well-established at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
    [19] due to the unclear role of children in disease prevalence or transmission
    [20, 21] and their systematic under-testing [15]. As data emerged on school-age
    children, there was often close coupling between community cases and infections
    in children, suggesting children reflected local infection burdens [22, 23]. Some
    studies have shown that household transmission is the primary infection modality
    in this age group [24]. Taken together, these data show the importance of managing
    infectious diseases among school-age children during the COVID-19 pandemic [21]
    and support the need for protecting school-age children from novel and re-emerging
    pathogen threats. Near-source sampling (NSS) involves the collection of wastewaters
    within the wastewater conveyance system or storage network upstream of a wastewater
    treatment plant (WWTP). For example, samples have been obtained from pumping stations,
    clusters of buildings, high-risk industrial settings (e.g. meat processing facilities)
    or at the individual building level [3, 11, 14]. Other forms of NSS include sampling
    defined populations within buildings, hubs for onward transmission (e.g., transport
    systems) or closed, confined, or poorly ventilated spaces (e.g., aircraft / ships).
    NSS has been applied in prisons [25], care homes [26], airports and aircraft [27],
    cruise ships [28], hospitals [29], quarantine facilities [30] and academic halls
    of residence [31], among other congregate locations. Localised and NSS generates
    data with a spatial focus supporting implementation of targeted public health
    measures e.g. clinical testing, the use of face masks, surge vaccination, partial
    closure of schools, case isolation, improved ventilation and targeted pharmaceutical
    interventions [32]. The current research explores the potential for school wastewater
    monitoring to provide an independent, actionable data stream to inform public
    health planning on COVID-19 as well as other infectious disease threats. To test
    this, wastewater was collected up to four times a week (Monday-Thursday) in 16
    schools within England (U.K.), enabling data collation to take place over an academic
    year. School wastewater testing for fragments of SARS-CoV-2 occurred throughout
    infection waves driven by several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC), including
    the SARS-CoV-2 wild type, Alpha and Delta variants. A subset of wastewater samples
    was sent for genomic sequencing, enabling the determination of the presence of
    SARS-CoV-2 and the nature of the variant(s) contributing to COVID-19 infections
    within schools. A further sub-set of samples were screened for norovirus by qPCR,
    and a further >280 microbial pathogens and >1200 antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
    genes were assayed using respiratory pathogen enrichment followed by deep metagenomic
    sequencing to consider the utility of these additional targets to further inform
    on health threats within the schools. Together the utility of combining these
    data types (viral loading, novel targets from NSS school wastewater) with community
    wastewater and clinical infection data to help design effective disease surveillance
    systems in schools, is explored. Methods and materials Sample sites Wastewater
    samples were collected at 16 schools over 31 weeks (excluding term breaks and
    holidays) between 20 October 2020 and 15 July 2021. In total, 10 primary schools
    (students aged 4–11 years), five secondary schools (students aged 12–18 years)
    and one further education school (student age >16 years) were included in the
    study. Schools were selected across four local authorities, one in the South East
    (A1), one in the North West (A2) and two in the South West (A3, A4). Selected
    schools encompassed different levels of deprivation (defined by the quintiles
    of the Index of Multiple Deprivation, a measure of relative deprivation based
    on a wide range of an individual’s living conditions) [33] and diversity (based
    on the percentage of pupils classified as white British as published by school
    census) (School Census Pupil Level—GOV.UK (education.gov.uk)). The 16 schools
    selected were located in both high and low prevalence areas, based on confirmed
    cases of COVID-19 infection at the beginning of the study (S1 Table). During the
    monitoring period, the emergence of the Alpha VoC (known as the second wave of
    the pandemic in the UK) resulted in a subsequent lockdown and national closure
    of schools (week commencing 04 January 2021 to 07 March 2021, inclusive). During
    the national lockdown, schools remained open for specific targeted groups i.e.,
    children of key workers. Where student number were <100, sampling was halted to
    avoid concerns about identifying sampled individuals within this potentially vulnerable
    population. Therefore, five schools attended by >100 students continued to be
    sampled throughout the national lockdown, thus continuously sampled throughout
    the monitoring period. In March 2021, schools reopened, and sampling was reinstated
    in two of the original 16 schools after consultation with local and national public
    health decision-makers and school management (Fig 1). Download: PPT PowerPoint

    Comprehensive site surveys were undertaken as part of an earlier trial to identify
    sample locations [21]. To enable effective sample collection from school sewers,
    a small weir was created from a brick placed in the wastewater pipe to generate
    a pool of wastewater to assist sample collection during low flow periods. Samples
    were collected using an Aquacell P2-COMPACT (Aquamatic) autosampler as 7-hour
    composites (one-minute sampling in every five minutes; from now on referred to
    as ‘day sampling’), situated at the first available location downstream of all
    the drains emerging from the school. An additional autosampler was co-located
    in several schools (Fig 1) to run at a higher sampling rate of one-minute sampling
    in every two minutes to target the lunch period (12pm-2pm) (from now on referred
    to as ‘intensive sampling’). Sampling started on 20 October 2020, initially twice
    a week, increasing to four times a week from 4 November 2020. The wastewater was
    collected from each site daily and transferred into plastic 5-litre containers
    (polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate) and immediately transported on melting
    ice to the laboratory for further processing (determination of basic wastewater
    characteristics and viral concentration/RNA extraction), and an aliquot extracted
    for cryogenic preservation (-80°C). Wastewater analysis The wastewater was analysed
    for total suspended solids (TSS), ammonium (NH4-N), orthophosphate (PO4-P), total
    chemical oxygen demand (tCOD), soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), pH, conductivity
    and dissolved oxygen, all following standard methods [34]. Viral concentration
    and RNA extraction were undertaken according to the polyethylene glycol (PEG)
    precipitation method [35] without modification [21, 36]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected
    using quantitative Reverse Transcription—Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR),
    targeting nucleoprotein 1 (N1 gene) and the envelope protein (E gene) [35]. The
    Limit of Detection (LOD; 1268 Gene Copies (GC) / L for N1 and 2968 GC / L for
    E) and the Limit of Quantification (LOQ; 9196 GC / L for N1 and 21300 GC / L for
    21300 GC / L for E) were reported previously in the pilot study [21]. Samples
    were accepted as positive detections if above or equal to the relevant LOD values.
    The % positivity rate was defined as detecting one or both SARS-CoV-2 genes above
    LOQ over a defined period. Detection of human Norovirus Extracted RNA samples
    were pooled per week per site and tested for the presence of human Norovirus using
    primers from the Norovirus Genogroups I and II Advanced kit (Genesig, Primer Design),
    which targets the capsid protein gene (GI) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene
    (GII). Primer and probe sequences are proprietary and available from the manufacturer
    on request. Detection was by RT-qPCR performed using the QuantStudio™ 7 Pro and
    analysed by the Design and Analysis software v2.5 system. The PCR reaction mixtures
    at 20 μL were prepared using Oasing™ Lyphophilised OneStep 2x RT-qPCR Master Mix
    (Primer Design™) per the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR efficiency was accepted
    at 90% and above. Recovery testing using wastewater phage spiking Wastewater supernatants
    (i.e. solids and biomass removed; see pilot study [21] for method) were spiked
    with the Pseudomonas virus Phi6 (Φ6; 7.5x106 GC), which acted as a process control
    to evaluate RNA extraction efficiency. 233 wastewater samples (27.2% of all samples
    collected) were spiked with Phi6 (DSM-21482), which was propagated using the conventional
    double-layer agar method and its host Pseudomonas syringae (DSM-21518), provided
    by Dr Kelly Jobling (Newcastle University, UK). Phage titre was estimated by counting
    plaque-forming units (pfu/mL) and confirmed using RT-qPCR. Extraction of the phage
    involved overnight culture overlay with sterile PBS (4 mL) at 4°C. The supernatant
    from the plate was aspirated, filtered through a 0.45 μm sterile filter and stored
    at 4°C before being used to spike wastewater samples. Aliquots of Phi6 were stored
    at -80°C and defrosted as needed. The recovery of Phi6 was determined by RT-qPCR
    (QuantStudio 7 Pro) using the Oasing Lyphophilised OneStep 2x RT-qPCR Master Mix
    (Primer Design) and the same thermocycler conditions used for Norovirus detection.
    Phi6 was detected and quantified using specific primers and probe sequences [37]
    purchased from ThermoFisher. The primer set; forward 5’-TGGCGGCGGTCAAGAGC-3’;
    reverse 5’-GGATGATTCTCCAGAAGCTGCTG-3’ and the probe 5’-FAM-CGGTCGTCGCAGGTCTGACACTCGC-MGB-NFQ-3’
    corresponded to the amplification region (cDNA fragment of 232 bp) within the
    phi-6S1 gene, located on the S segment and coding for the P8 protein. Phi6 plasmid
    controls consisted of DNA fragments reconstructed by GeneArt Strings (450 bp,
    sequence within the phi-6S1 gene). The plasmid was resuspended and log serially
    diluted (5x106 - 5x100 copies/reaction) for use as the standard curve. The recovery
    of Phi6 was calculated using the following formula: DF = Dilution Factor; 0.05ml
    of RNA sample aliquoted from each 0.1ml elute = DF of 20 Initial spike of extraction
    control = 7.5x106 copies of Phi6. SARS-CoV-2 genome copies were not corrected
    based on Phi6 recovery in line with convention in wastewater monitoring studies
    and therefore represent uncorrected values. The current Phi6 recovery was used
    to assess the consistency of extractions, not as a tool for normalisation. SARS-Cov-2
    variants of concern 277 samples were selected for amplicon sequencing; the majority
    were N1 positive (N = 239, 86.3%) with an additional subset of samples (N = 38,
    13.7%) which presented below the LOD but had evidence of amplification. Purified
    RNA was cleaned with Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads (Omega Bio-Tek) and reverse-transcribed
    using the LunaScript RT SuperMix Kit (New England Biolabs) with the following
    thermocycler conditions: 25°C for 2 minutes, 55°C for 45 minutes, 95°C for 1 minute
    and hold at 4°C. Library preparation was undertaken using EasySeq™ RC-PCR SARS
    CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) Whole Genome Sequencing kit v3.0 (NimaGen). Amplicons
    had a further round of cleanup (as above), and sequencing was generated at 2×150bp
    paired-end reads using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). The bioinformatics
    pipeline used has been previously described in detail [38]. In brief, raw sequence
    reads were processed using the ncov2019-artic-nf v3 pipeline (https://github.com/connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf).
    Subsequently, VarScan was used to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
    and insertions/deletions (Indels), which were filtered against signature mutations
    of VoCs circulating at the time of the study using a custom script. SARS-CoV-2
    VoC profiles were generated based on designations from Public Health England (https://github.com/phe-genomics/variant_definitions)
    and case definitions, i.e. confirmed or possible presence of a VoC, were designated
    to wastewater samples based on the number of their SNPs detected as follows: B.1.1.7
    (VOC-20DEC-01) Alpha was considered to have 13 signature SNPs; the variant was
    reported as confirmed if ≥ 10 of 13 signature SNPs were detected, possible if
    ≥ 5, and no detection if ≤ 4. B.1.617.2 (VUI-21APR-02) Delta was considered to
    have 13 signature SNPs; the variant was reported as confirmed if ≥ 9 of 13 signature
    SNPs were detected, possible if ≥ 5, no detection if ≤ 4. Delta substrains AY.43,
    AY.46.5 and AY.2 were reported as confirmed if ≥ 70% of SNPs in respective profiles
    were detected, possible if ≥ 50%, no detection if ≤ 50%. A “Confirmed” status
    was thus assigned to samples with a high degree of confidence that a variant was
    present, while a “Possible” status was assigned if there was some evidence of
    a variant being present. Logistic regression was applied to analyse the relationship
    between N1 and E GC/mL detection in wastewater (predictor variables) and the probability
    of identifying SARS-CoV-2 VoC (response variable). Additionally, multinomial logistic
    regression was performed to assess the relationship between N1 and E gene copies
    in wastewater samples and whether a variant was confirmed as Alpha or Delta or
    not detected (based on the above definitions). Wastewater monitoring to screen
    for targets of clinical significance within schools RPP-AMR To explore wastewater
    monitoring for additional public health biomarkers, selected samples (n = 59,
    pooled bi-weekly n = 8) (from A3-3-Primary) were screened for other targets, including
    pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. RNA and DNA extracts were
    pooled over two-week periods in an effort to reduce noise in the data generated
    by the stochasticity of people attending school and using the toilet. In total,
    >280 pathogens, including respiratory bacteria, virus, and fungal targets, alongside
    >1200 AMR alleles, were screened via a Respiratory Pathogen ID/AMR (RPP-AMR) Enrichment
    Kit (Illumina) and metagenomic sequencing, performed by Molecular Research LP
    (MR DNA lab, Texas, USA). The process included the conversion of RNA to cDNA by
    reverse transcription, followed by tagmentation and amplification. PCR was used
    to amplify the enriched fragments; the DNA library was evaluated using a Qubit
    and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were pooled
    in equimolar ratios and sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 for 76 cycles. Cloud-based
    software CosmosID was used to assign taxa and sequences from the read data. In
    brief, unassembled reads were compared to a curated database to analyse unassembled
    reads, including for pathogens and AMR targets. COVID-19 case rates and wastewater
    viral loads Two schools (A3-2-Primary and A3-3-Primary) were selected to investigate
    the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 detection within the school wastewater, SARS-CoV-2
    detection at the receiving WWTP and local community COVID-19 case data. The schools
    were selected as both were sampled throughout England’s national school lockdown
    with relatively high levels of positivity. Wastewater data from the local treatment
    plant was acquired from the UK Government’s Wastewater Monitoring programme for
    England [39, 40]. Age-stratified daily COVID-19 cases at the community level were
    obtained from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The latter were used as clinical
    testing data was unavailable from schools in England during the study. Positive
    signal (measurements above LOD) and SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene concentration in wastewater
    were used for modelling (local polynomial regression, LOESS) the NSS detection
    trends for the school case studies and WWTP with overlap to school catchment area.
    Community COVID-19 cases were visually compared to the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater signal
    trends. A lead/lag analysis was performed for the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations (GC/L)
    in school wastewater and local WWTPs to compare the signal between the two-time
    series using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient to assess the degree of temporal
    correspondence between them. Ethics Permission to access sites for wastewater
    collection was obtained from the Head Teacher of each school. Prior to sampling
    commencing at each site, a specialist wastewater sampling company (Aquaenviro)
    undertook a risk assessment method statement (RAMS). Ethical approval for this
    study was obtained from the Middlesex University Ethics Committee (14795). Results
    SARS-COV-2 detection in school wastewater A total of 855 wastewater samples were
    analysed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 amplicons (as N1 and/or E) were
    detected in 31.8% (N = 272) of samples. Of these 272 samples, the N1 target sequence
    was present in 242 samples (89%) and the E gene in 120 samples (44.1%), with both
    genes present in 90 samples (33.1%). 152 samples were positive for the N1 gene
    only, while 30 were positive for the E gene only (S1 Fig). The number of gene
    copies detected ranged from 1.3x103 GC/L (LOD) to 9.2x106 GC/L for the N1 gene
    and from 3.0 x103 GC/L (LOD) to 1.3x106 GC/L for the E gene (S2 Table). The lowest
    RT-qPCR CT values for N1 and E were 26.74 and 27.43, respectively. The mean Phi6
    recovery was 7.5% (0.01–80.87%), similar to the recovery rates reported for other
    studies in the literature (e.g. 2.1%-33.7% [41], 0.078%-0.51% [42] and 1.4%-3.0%
    [43]). None of the targets measured in the wastewater had a significant positive
    correlation (p > 0.05) with recovery of the viral surrogate (S3 Table). The SARS-CoV-2
    positivity rate (i.e., percentage of samples in which N1 and/or E genes were detected
    in relation to the total number of samples collected) was 20% in the first week
    of sampling (week starting 20 October 2020), with an overall positivity rate of
    18.5% for samples collected over the following three-week period (4–25 November
    2020). The highest positivity rate was 80.4% (week commencing 30 November 2020),
    with frequency of detection falling to 56% and 50.6% in the penultimate and final
    week of the autumn term, respectively. At the end of the autumn term (three weeks
    before the Christmas vacation), both N1 and E genes were detected across all samples
    collected from six schools across the three areas. During the period of national
    school closure, the positivity rate in the five schools where monitoring continued
    (four primary and one secondary) was 20.6% (11 January—11 February 2021) (S2 Fig).
    In England, schools reopened from 8 March 2021 (Fig 1) and the overall sample
    positivity rate increased from 20.6% (beginning of March 2021) to 29.3% (end of
    March 2021; start of the Easter vacation). During term time between the Easter
    break and May half-term break (19 April 2021–27 May 2021), the positivity rate
    was 28.2%. During the summer term (08 June 2021–15 July 2021), 34.6% of the samples
    were positive, primarily with a single target (N1 or E gene) detected. In two
    schools, there were pronounced periods of increased concentrations within wastewater
    after the May half-term break. Over two days in School A1-2-Primary (08 June 2021
    and 09 June 2021) levels of N1 and E genes were above 1.81x104 and 6.4x103 GC/L,
    respectively. Higher concentrations were reported at A3-2-Primary, where N1 levels
    up to 9.2x106 GC/L were detected between 10 June 2021 and 06 July 2021 (S2 Fig).
    Establishing link between COVID-19 infections cases and wastewater data The analysis
    of selected school wastewater data (A3-2-Primary and A3-3-Primary) with data derived
    from the receiving WWTP shows levels of SARS-CoV-2 concentration (GC/L) in wastewater
    in schools and associated WWTP were elevated (comparison to previous months) from
    November 2020 to January 2021, showing a steady 5% decline during the January—March
    2021 lockdown. Following school reopening in March, SARS-CoV-2 concentrations
    showed a 24.3% and 18.9% increase in both schools, respectively, with the detection
    of an outbreak at the end of May 2021 (confirmed by the school; personal communication).
    The lead/lag analysis between SARS-CoV-2 schools and WWTP concentration shows
    a maximum correlation when school data are lagged by two weeks (Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient 0.51, p<0.01) for A3-2-Primary and (Pearson’s correlation coefficient
    0.40, p = 0.01) A3-3-Primary, suggesting that the signal in school wastewater
    precedes the increase in the concentrations reported at the WWTP in these cases
    (S4 Table). The highest SARS-CoV-2 concentration determined in this study was
    reported for A3-2-Primary during this time period (9.2 x 106 GC/L) compared to
    concentrations observed in the same time period in the WWTP (Fig 2 - bottom panel).

    Clinical case data indicated that from October 2020 to December 2020, COVID-19
    cases among school-aged children (5–19 years) in the community (MSOA level) surrounding
    the two schools contributed just under 20% of the total cases, decreasing to 15%
    during the January—March 2021 lockdown. As soon as schools reopened on 8 March
    2021, school-aged children contributed over 30% of the cases recorded. After a
    decrease during the second half of April (associated with the Easter vacation
    period of school closure), cases again increased from the end of May to June 2021,
    with the largest contributor to total case numbers identified as the primary school
    age group (5–9 years old). This pattern in the COVID-19 cases in school-aged children
    aligned with trends in SARS-CoV-2 concentration is the school wastewater (Fig
    2 - top panel). Wastewater characteristics variability between and within schools
    No statistically significant relationship was determined between any measured
    wastewater parameter and SARS-CoV-2 concentrations at any school. One exception
    was for ammonia, which showed a weak correlation with the SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene (R2
    = 0.28; p = 0.01) at A3-2-Primary under a high prevalence scenario (i.e., a period
    when SARS-CoV-2 was detected daily at concentrations >LOQ). Under low prevalence
    scenarios (i.e., infrequent SARS-CoV-2 detection), this relationship was no longer
    significant (p>0.05). A similar pattern was also observed in the second case study
    school (A3-3-Primary) but the relationship was not significant. In contrast the
    relationship between pH and N1 gene concentrations varied in direction and strength
    between case study schools (S3 Table). Overall, there was no correlation between
    student population and PO4-P/ NH4-H concentration. Kitchen space and its use for
    lunch preparation was recorded for each school to assess the contribution of kitchen
    waste as an additional source of ammonia (S5 Table). A welch t-test was applied
    to account for unequal sample size between schools which had lunch preparation
    onsite and those without, which showed no significant difference for NH4-H (t
    = - 1.2944, p = 0.21) and PO4-P (t = - 0.9881, p = 0.33) (S5 Table) therefore
    kitchens did not contribute to the loading of key wastewater constituents often
    used for assessing population equivalent. Therefore, other factors such as irregular
    toilet behaviour or possibly chemical cleaning reagents could have contributed
    to lack of relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and these wastewater parameters. Wastewater
    SARS-CoV-2 variant sequencing The detection of VoC and variants under investigation
    (VuI) was reported as confirmed or possible based on the number of signature SNP
    mutations. Alpha (B.1.1.7) was detected as possible on 17 December 2020 at A1-3A-Secondary,
    with confirmed cases in A1-2-Primary school on 28 January 2021 and 03 February
    2021 and in A3-1-Primary school on 10 February 2021. The final detection of Alpha,
    a possible detection, was at A1-3A-Secondary on 17 March 2020. The first confirmed
    case of Delta (B.1.617.2) amongst the monitored schools was at A1-2-Primary school
    on 08 June 2021, a signal that persisted for three consecutive days (08–10 June
    2021). A spike in the presence of Delta was observed in A3-2-Primary school for
    almost a month, from 10 June—07 July 2021. Delta’s sub-lineages AY.43, AY.46.5,
    and AY.2 were also detected in Delta-positive school wastewater samples (Fig 3).
    Indeed, when Delta and its sub-lineages were found, detections were predominantly
    confirmed. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image
    Fig 3. SARS-CoV-2 variants from school wastewater. The presence of the variants
    of concern and variants under investigation (as classified during the monitoring
    period) in the wastewater samples were identified based on the number of their
    signature SNP mutations. (*) Confirmed—All or majority (more than ∼70%) of signature
    SNPs detected. (#) Possible—Detection of more than 38% (Alpha and Delta) or 50%
    (Delta substrains) of signature SNPs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286259.g003
    Logistic regression showed that an increase in N1 and E gene detection in wastewater
    increased the likelihood of VoC detection significantly [N1: Odds Ratio (OR) =
    1.00776, p = 0.01; OR = 1.0003226, p≤0.001, S6 Table). Similarly, when multinomial
    logistic regression was applied, an increase in N1 and E gene detection increased
    the likelihood of both Alpha variant (N1: OR = 1.00708, p = 0.03; E: OR = 1.00029;
    p = 0.007) and Delta variant detection (N1: OR = 1.00825; p = 0.009; E: OR = 1.00034;
    p = 0.002, S7 Table). Screening for other disease markers in school wastewater
    Weekly pooled wastewater samples were tested for Norovirus, with infrequent and
    low-level detection reported using RT-qPCR from March to July 2021 (Table 1).
    The target (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene), which screens specifically for
    the GII genogroup of Norovirus, was quantified at 2380 GC/L (Ct = 33) in a pooled
    sample (29 March 2021–31 March 2021) from A1-2-Primary, with negligible detection
    of Norovirus GI (Ct = 42; 12.41 GC/L) in A1-3B-Secondary (pooled sample 28 June
    2021–01 July 2021). Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original

    samples by RT-qPCR. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286259.t001 To further
    explore the value of wastewater monitoring in schools, a range of clinically relevant
    targets were examined using a novel RPP-AMR enrichment approach. The RPP-AMR panel
    enriches for >280 respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, a range
    of viruses, bacteria, fungi and more than 2000 AMR marker genes. Although DNA/RNA
    quantities used for the assay were consistent with the manufacturer’s specifications,
    the results were uniformly consistent in only identifying the presence of a very
    small number of targets, including: SARS-CoV-2, human Adenovirus 1 and Cronobacter
    sakazakii. SARS-CoV-2 was intermittently detected in samples also testing positive
    by qPCR, while human Adenovirus 1 (HAV-1) was found within sample A3-3-Primary
    school sample (4 May 2021–13 May 2021). HAV-1, is a pathogen that is implicated
    in respiratory infections in young children. The pathogenic bacterium Cronobacter
    sakazakii was detected consistently in pooled A3-3-Primary samples obtained from
    22 March 2021–27 May 2021 (Table 2). This pathogen is most frequently associated
    with contaminated infant formula, causing bacteraemia, meningitis and necrotizing
    enterocolitis. Although C. sakazakii was not present on the panel (RPP-AMR), it
    was still detectable using metagenomic analysis of the raw data generated from
    the sequencing. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original

    samples by enrichment and sequencing. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286259.t002
    The RPP-AMR also reports on >200 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The abundance
    of ARGs was clearly higher than those of the pathogens, which might be expected—as
    such, the presence/absence of these genes has been reported in Fig 4. The relative
    abundance data was compared between pooled weekly samples to derive the diversity
    of unique ARGs. Examination of sequence data from the RPP-AMR revealed that genes
    that were enriched were detected alongside high abundance genes, which were not
    subject to enrichment. Unique ARGs were displayed by antibiotic class and the
    resistome diversity was compared over a 16-week period using 2 weeks sample composites
    within 1 school 8 pooled (A3-3-Primary; Fig 4A). Download: PPT PowerPoint slide

    genes by antibiotic class detected within school wastewater. B) Overview of the
    presence/absence of 15 antibiotic resistance genes identified as key for environmental
    monitoring within pooled school wastewater samples. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286259.g004
    The presence/absence of 15 ARGs (identified as valuable for environmental resistome
    monitoring due to their frequency of detection, link to human disease and potential
    for horizontal gene transfer between environmental and clinical bacteria) [44]
    in pooled school wastewater samples is shown in Fig 4B. Three of these ARGs were
    detected in all school wastewater samples: aph (conferring aminoglycoside resistance),
    ermB (conferring macrolide resistance) and sul1 (conferring sulphonamide resistance).
    In contrast, eight of the target ARGs were not detected in any samples: aac-(6’)-lb-cr
    (aminoglycoside resistance gene); mecA, blaKPC, blaNDM-1 and blaVIM (beta-lactam
    resistance genes); ermF (macrolide resistance gene); qnrS (quinolone resistance
    gene); and vanA (vancomycin resistance gene). The remaining shortlisted genes
    were detected intermittently throughout the sampling period (Fig 4), reflecting
    relatively low antibiotic use in school age children. Discussion The COVID-19
    pandemic has shown the need for increased preparedness of our health systems,
    highlighting the need to refine alternative tools for monitoring the spread of
    diseases and the health of the population in general. Wastewater surveillance
    has been implemented globally [28, 32, 36, 45–47] to support the response to the
    pandemic, providing a rapid, low-cost, non-invasive method for capturing symptomatic,
    pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic cases potentially guiding targeted responses
    and reducing associated costs (e.g., clinical testing). This study is a long-term
    monitoring continuation of a pilot study that established the potential application
    of wastewater surveillance as NSS to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other health markers
    from schools. We reported our initial findings of wastewater detection incidents
    and rates from October 2020 to December 2020 (the mid-stage of the COVID-19 pandemic
    including the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant in the UK) [21].
    Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus provided evidence of the presence of the virus
    in schools at different stages of the pandemic, that the signal in schools preceded
    the signal in the reference WWTP and was associated with clinical cases in the
    community among school-age children. During the period of national school closure,
    the positivity rate in the five schools (four primary and one secondary) was <21%
    suggesting that the December 2021 lockdown—a period of reduced mixing as a non-pharmacological
    intervention—resulted in fewer COVID-19 infections within school age pupils. The
    reduction in SARS-CoV-2 signal observed during the last weeks of the autumn term
    (20th October 2020- 25th November 2020) was likely due to a mix of control measures:
    isolation following positive testing and implementation of remote learning following
    closure in some schools. The extent to which infection within schools drives local
    outbreaks—as opposed to schools reflecting community infection levels–requires
    additional research, and wastewater sampling could help answer this question more
    definitively in future emerging or re-emerging pathogen outbreaks, particularly
    if concurrent testing of household wastewater samples was undertaken. However,
    the interpretation of the lower positivity rate reported in wastewater is supported
    by reference to the age-specific clinical case data (Fig 2 - top panel), which
    indicates a reduction in the percentage of school-age children testing positive
    at the start of 2021. This lower level of positive infections did not then change
    further for the duration of this study, suggesting infections within this age
    group were not increasing compared to overall infections within the community
    where infection trends were more variable. Reported results show how NSS has the
    capability to identify prevalent variants using whole genome sequencing. In addition,
    higher SARS-CoV-2 GC/L is associated with higher genome coverage. The chance of
    recovering good quality genomes, and the required diagnostic SNPs and Indels which
    are distributed across them, was associated with the presence of both N1 and E
    SARS-CoV-2 genes at high concentrations, which is indicative of a less degraded
    sample. Therefore, screening wastewater samples via qPCR for multiple amplicon
    targets, distributed across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, could be a useful approach
    to select samples where variant identification is more likely or prioritising
    resources for samples which will provide the most valuable data to public health
    decision makers. SARS-CoV-2 variant data available from GOV.UK [48] allowed the
    comparison of local occurrences of variants at WWTP and school levels. The Alpha
    variant was not reported in data from the WWTP (corresponding school areas), as
    it was the dominant variant at the time, but this study recovered and identified
    the Alpha variant in school wastewater between December 2020 and March 2021. The
    Delta variant was identified at the school level 3–4 weeks after its first detection
    at the WWTP, possibly indicating a lag between background community transmission
    and school outbreak. The first Delta detection was on 5 May 2021 in the WWTP of
    A1, while the first Delta case was identified on 8 June 2021 at the school (A1-2-Primary)
    level. The WWTP of A3 first detected the Delta variant on 23 May 2021, while the
    first detection in the school (A3-2-Primary) was on 10 June 2021. This could be
    a product of the greater granularity NSS provides and the prospect of school’s
    acting as hotspots with faster responses to local outbreaks to guide public health
    interventions. This highlights the important benefits of combining wastewater
    surveillance using WWTP and NSS to identify outbreaks at the different scales
    and from different populations inherent within a sewage network. The utility of
    sampling school wastewater was further examined through analysis of other relevant
    pathogenic viruses. Here we examined two of the most common genotypes of Norovirus,
    due to its economic and public health implications and the propensity for outbreaks
    in schools [49]. In a similar application of the wastewater surveillance technology,
    Erster et al. [50] was able to isolate and monitor an emerging outbreak of the
    novel Enterovirus D69 outbreak in Israel using paired NSS and WWTP monitoring.
    In the current study, our results corroborate the theory that other pathogens
    were suppressed during the pandemic, driven by lockdowns [51], school closures
    [52] and improved hygiene practices [53]. Despite the absence of Norovirus, highly
    prevalent ARGs were detected in samples, which highlights the potential for wastewater
    surveillance in mapping antimicrobial resistance, although future research is
    needed to confirm linkages between detection of gene targets and antimicrobial
    resistance phenotype. Eze et al. [54] isolated a pan-drug resistant Acinetobacter
    baumannii strain from hospital wastewater in South Africa, responsible for both
    nosocomial infections and opportunistic infections and fatalities. The authors
    highlight the value of NSS from hospital wastewater for acquisition of this type
    of sample but also caution as to the risks posed by pathogens within wastewater
    for the dissemination of disease-causing agents. Nonetheless clinically important
    information was derived from wastewater and emerging tools such as metagenomics,
    target enrichment, lab-on-chip style approaches could provide a flexible platform
    for NSS monitoring to study infections within congregate communities [55]. Diamond
    et al. [56] suggested wastewater surveillance could offer a sentinel system if
    expanded to monitor other pathogens and boost public health preparedness. In the
    UK and USA, public funded schools usually operate with specific geographic catchments
    for intake. Thus, NSS of school wastewater has great potential to offer the sentinel
    system suggested by Diamond et al. [56], as the school represents an age stratified
    snapshot of the local community. This information is useful as a warning for infection
    risk in congregate settings where a high degree of social interactions occurs
    [57, 58] and can support specific community public health response by prioritising
    socially applicable interventions relevant to each local community (i.e., testing
    and vaccine acceptability) [45]. School-based wastewater epidemiological surveillance
    provides more spatial granularity than WWTP level. During the period of the current
    study authors were able to provide specific, timely, and tailored risk mitigation
    advice to school communities (parents, students, and staff), via liaison with
    the school leaders. Future work could identify a tiered framework for hierarchy
    of monitoring for infectious disease agents in schools as suggested by Berry et
    al. [59] for healthcare, with wastewater acting as a cost-effective early warning
    to identify hotpots prior to conducting repeated population-based random surveys
    in year groups in schools. Petros et al. [58] showed the value of collecting social
    data including Wi-Fi co-location information from university students alongside
    NSS using wastewater. The authors showed that length and frequency of social interactions
    alongside participating in high-contact sports were good predictors of COVID-19
    infection risk. This study has implications for school age children who are likely
    to be exposed to similar activities of heighted transmission risk (i.e., sport),
    potential poor hygiene practices and greater numbers of social interactions than
    the majority of the adult population. Consistent with our initial results, this
    study did not find a strong correlation between the wastewater parameters and
    SARS-CoV-2 recovery during long-term monitoring. Sweetapple et al. (2021) [46]
    reported that measurements of ammonium (NH4-N) and orthophosphate (PO4-P) concentrations
    have the potential to be used for population normalisation in wastewater monitoring
    and that both strongly correlated to SARS-CoV-2 recovery. In this school study,
    there was no strong positive correlation between SARS-CoV-2 detection and either
    NH4-N or PO4-P between and within schools. This could be due to the fluctuating
    number of pupils at school on individual sampling days and unpredictable bathroom
    behaviour. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 and water parameters are independent variables,
    and their correlation has been reported as a function of population size [32].
    Other external sources—such as kitchen waste—could have also contributed to ammonia
    and phosphorus loads, and to consider this schools participating in this study
    were asked to share information on kitchen use during the sampling period. However,
    correlation between e.g. population and ammonia levels, as well as difference
    between schools utilising on-site as opposed to off-site kitchens did not show
    any significance (S5 Table). This suggests that other factors i.e., detergents,
    metals etc could impact recovery [60]. Other NSS did not use wastewater constituents
    to normalise / account for population. For example, Acosta et al. [61] normalise
    N1, N2 and E to Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) gene copies which accounts for
    human specific biomarkers. Although variability in diet and lifestyle can influence
    the concentrations reported [62], other studies [4] have used PMMoV suggesting
    an efficient and acceptable recovery of RNA during RNA extraction as order / ranges
    are within published values for municipal (i.e., human derived) wastewater. The
    surfactant concentrations within wastewater can reduce the recovery of SARS-CoV-2
    [63]. This is thought to be due to surfactant with virus interaction reducing
    stability and therefore recovery. Enhanced recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater-settled
    solids has also been reported [64–66], although this aspect was not considered
    as par with this study. Previously, we demonstrated that viral RNA signal recovery
    from school wastewater improved when samples were collected throughout the school
    day (7 hours). This initial finding is confirmed here, with an all-day sampling
    approach associated with a positivity rate of 35.6% in in comparison to a lunchtime
    only sampling positivity rate of 11.9% (S1 Fig). This is likely linked to the
    autosampler missing flush events in NSS when sampling was conducted over a more
    limited period. Further tracing toilet use through monitoring of flush events
    or social surveys would help elucidate how toilet habits influence NSS wastewater
    surveillance data. Detection of a single viral RNA target is most common during
    low prevalence scenarios or in wastewater containing degraded RNA which occurs
    during elevated temperatures [67], different wastewater matrices or during extended
    storage times [68, 69]. In schools, low prevalence was the most likely reason
    for low detection/ positivity rates observed as sampling was undertaken close
    to source and therefore reduced the time for degradation to occur [70]. The wastewater
    signal in schools is better associated with clinical cases observed in school-ages
    population than the signal observed in the WWTP, providing better granular information
    on the circulation of the virus among that specific age group. The presence of
    ARGs is a natural phenomenon, but samples enriched for these gene targets have
    been identified in wastewater from hospitals [71], pharmaceutical industry [72]
    and multiple environmental matrices [73]. Sets of bi-weekly pooled samples from
    A3-3-Primary school were selected (based on high positivity and number of samples
    collected) to be analysed for other health markers in wastewater during the pandemic.
    It should be noted that the sequencing output obtained in this study is only qualitative
    and does not provide measurable expression of the genes. Regardless, results were
    obtained despite concerns with the limitations of wastewater analysis, further
    showing capability of health markers being detected when using a single wastewater
    sample. This suggests that RT-qPCR was a more sensitive approach under conditions
    tested but a trade-off exists in the type of datasets which can be generated with
    wastewater between the depth (of detection) and coverage generated by a single
    sample. For example, other respiratory viruses, such as HAVdetected in the pooled
    samples, are shed within the faeces and thus compliant for detection using wastewater.
    Unlike HAV, Cronobacter sakazakii (detected in schools) can be isolated from the
    environment (i.e. sewer derived), as well as from infections within the shedding
    population (children and staff at school). The current study is not the first
    study to apply metagenomics to characterise other pathogen / AMR targets from
    NSS locations. Spurbeck et al. (2021) [29] applied SARS-CoV-2 amplicon and RNA
    metagenomic sequencing to wastewater isolated from nursing homes. The authors
    detected microbes known to cause nosocomial infections, gastroenteritis, cystitis,
    pneumonia, septicemia, and tetanus. Opportunistic pathogens including A. baumannii,
    A. junii SH205, and A. Iwoffii SH145 which was similar to Eze et al. [54] and
    Campylobacter jejuni. jejuni, which is strongly implicated in gastroenteritis
    etiology alongside strains of Escherichia coli known to cause urinary tract infection.
    This demonstrates additional value, which can be obtained using wastewater monitoring
    approaches for infectious disease monitoring and outside of pandemic as numerous
    clinically relevant disease-causing agents have now been tracked. It is suggested
    that vulnerable populations (schools, prisons, care homes) and low income settings
    are particularly amenable to this inexpensive, aggregate, anonymous, scalable
    and non-invasive approach [3, 74, 75]. The use of NSS within schools raised several
    challenges, including the understanding and use of data on bathroom usage habits
    of school-age children (e.g., reliable access to toilets and use levels at schools)
    and the limitations of the current generation of sample collection technologies
    [76]. These limitations include access to sampling points within the school environment
    (both in terms of full characterisation of contributing sources and the opportunities
    to locate samplers on school grounds) and the mistiming of sample collection in
    relation to flush events, that could result in limited capture of the viral load
    transported within the wastewater. In addition, the contribution of each SARS-CoV-2
    RNA shedding route (e.g., urine, sputum, faeces) to RNA loads in wastewater has
    yet to be elucidated in a school (or any other) environment [77]. Despite these
    limitations, the ability to detect viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the highly variable
    wastewater quality streams expected at a school building level was first demonstrated
    by Castro-Gutierrez et al. [21]. Finally, tracking mobile workers (i.e., support
    / substitute teachers / cleaners etc) through passive wastewater monitoring poses
    inherent challenges and apportioning infections attributed to staff and students
    and identifying social determinants of risk represents a logical next step for
    future research. Some of the identified benefits of schools-based wastewater monitoring
    include generation of longitudinal data sets on the emergence and spread of variants
    and providing direct information on the transmission in high-risk environments,
    such as classrooms. Combined with other socio-economic data, wastewater monitoring
    could indicate schools settings where students, parents, and staff are more likely
    to face structural barriers to vaccination and/or diagnostic testing uptake [45],
    supporting the detection of emerging variants [78] and provision of information
    on the transmission in high-risk environments, such as the classroom [79]. Conclusion
    In this study, new data associated with the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in school wastewater
    monitored for one academic year was generated and linked for the first time to
    both local clinical data and community wastewater. The wastewater data was highly
    dynamic and lagged the community wastewater and infectious rate results. SARS-CoV-2
    positivity rate was detected during national lockdown with restricted school attendance,
    suggesting transmission still occurred among those populations. In addition, wastewater
    showed potential in identifying variants prevalent at different phases of the
    pandemic, providing proof of concept for detecting emerging VoC in schools. Furthermore,
    wastewater sample enrichment coupled with metagenomic sequencing and rapid informatics
    enabled the detection of other clinically relevant viral and bacterial pathogens
    and AMR, revealing the capability of wastewater monitoring to enable public health
    authorities to develop targeted prevention and education programmes for hygiene
    measures within undertested communities across a broad range of use cases. This
    ‘measure once—test many’ approach increases the insights gathered per sample and
    the cost effectiveness of insights derived. This could lead to interventions on
    emerging outbreaks and liaison with local public health decision-makers, who could
    enforce strategies to slow the spread of infection rates in schools and other
    settings within vulnerable populations. Supporting information Number of positive

    Abstract Under heavy rainfall, landslide early warning system (LEWS) is considered
    to be an effective method for providing timely warnings, but previous LEWS presents
    deficiencies such as high cost, high power consumption, and difficulties in secondary
    development. To address the shortcomings, the current study developed a low-cost
    and sustainable LEWS that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) and an off-the-grid

    Chapter © 2023 Introduction Currently, with changing global weather conditions,
    the occurrences of unpredictable and unprecedented heavy rainfall have increased,
    and rainfall-induced landslide disasters have also become frequent. Data shows
    that Asia accounts for 75% of global rainfall-induced landslides, and that East
    Asia is the most affected area (Froude and Petley 2018). For example, Japan is
    located in the East Asian monsoon region, with a mountainous landscape and extremely
    complex geological conditions, making it highly susceptible to landslide hazards.
    During Northern Kyushu Torrential Rainfall Disaster in July 2017, localized and
    torrential rainfall caused massive landslides, debris flow, and flooding of rivers,
    resulting in devastating damage to Fukuoka and Oita prefectures of Kyushu, Japan
    (Hazarika et al. 2020). The disaster caused 34 people to die, and 4 people still
    missing. In order to save human lives and protect properties during rainfall events,
    the prediction of landslide risk is currently a hot topic of research worldwide.
    There are many options for predicting the occurrence of landslides, and appropriate
    measures should have the four characteristics of good predictability, ease of
    deployment, economy, and sustainability. Figure 1 presents the performance of
    several mainstream approaches in terms of the four characteristics. Some studies
    focus on the 3D numerical simulation of the landslide on the basis of field geology
    surveys or Web-GIS (Fan et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020; Dai et al. 2022). The stability
    information and failure mechanism of slope can be obtained by assuming potential
    rainfall conditions or real-time monitoring data, but the accuracy of the results
    obtained from numerical simulation is not high. In addition, using numerical simulation
    software requires specialized research skills and is not easy for everyone to
    operate. Empirical or statistical-based methods such as intensity-duration (I-D)
    curve are widely used to predict landslides (Saito et al. 2010; Baum and Godt
    2010; Fan et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2020; Rosi et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2021). However,
    such predictions are mainly for regional early warning, which brings the limitations
    of prediction for a particular slope in danger zones. In recent years, institutions
    and governments are trying to build large monitoring platforms; for example, InSAR
    (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) technology has been widely used in
    surface deformation monitoring, disaster assessment, and other related fields
    with its outstanding advantages of no weather interference, continuous real-time
    monitoring, and high accuracy in obtaining continuous coverage of ground elevation
    and information (Carlà et al. 2019). GNSS (global navigation satellite system)-based
    monitoring systems can achieve millimeter-level positioning and are also widely
    used in landslide monitoring. However, professional monitoring devices are costly,
    meaning that only well-funded projects can afford this method. They also rely
    on professional operating techniques (Tu et al. 2013). To balance cost, accuracy,
    and convenience, research finds that the application of the landslide early warning
    system (LEWS) with IoT (Internet of Things) is considered to be a practical approach
    to mitigating disasters (Tu et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2019; Piciullo
    et al. 2020; Dai et al. 2021). IoT is a platform that seamlessly connects various
    devices, monitoring objects, and transmission equipment through the Internet (Khan
    and Salah 2018; Kanaya et al. 2013; Kanaya 2021). Compared with the above methods,
    the LEWS based on IoT performs significant advantages. First, it is easy to deploy,
    which allows remote data monitoring, transmission, storage, and analysis (Shi
    et al. 2015). Second, sensors and transmission devices do not need a high cost
    of power consumption during operation, which ensures long endurance of monitoring
    (Lee et al. 2017). What is more, this research found that LEWS based on IoT can
    also quickly adapt to various scenarios, which makes it easy for users to reduce
    the cost (Mois et al. 2017). Figure 1 shows the effectiveness evaluation results
    of various methods, in which a larger evaluation value represents a better effect.
    Fig. 1 Effectiveness evaluation of various disaster reduction methods Full size
    image The IoT-based LEWS has been widely developed and applied, but the currently
    mentioned EWS has, in general, the following shortcomings: (1) reliance on a limited
    variety of sensors leads to poor prediction timeliness; (2) the cost of some equipment
    is still high and some LEWS ignore sustainability; (3) these EWS mainly use systems
    that are industrially manufactured; therefore, it is not possible for the users
    to modify or upgrade the hardware or software architecture by themselves. Therefore,
    it is the focus of this study to overcome the shortcomings of the previous IoT-based-LEWS
    and to make it more applicable, economical, and sustainable. Although scholars
    continue to optimize the economy of the IoT-based LEWS, it presents that the cost
    is still high and few studies consider the sustainability of the system. In order
    to further reduce entire system development costs, as well as to reduce the dependence
    on energy and environmental damage, in the current study, a low-cost and sustainable
    LEWS is introduced that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) and an off-the-grid
    solar energy-powered integrated sensor platform. Laboratory model tests were carried
    out to verify the feasibility of the system according to the significant landslide
    characteristics in Japan. The low-cost and standalone energy harvesting feature
    of the LEWS allows it to be applicable across the world. Components of LEWS This
    study proposed a framework for data acquisition, transmission, analysis, and warning
    of rainfall-induced landslides that employs multifunctional technologies such
    as IoT, data analytics, and calculation of factors of safety (Fs). The proposed
    LEWS framework adopts a modular, loosely coupled architecture that performs three
    parts: data acquisition, data transmission, and data analysis. Data acquisition
    Regarding the part of data acquisition, this study conducted the development of
    sensing devices based on IoT to complete the work of collecting data from the
    monitoring objects. As for the equipment part, the selection principle is ultra-low
    power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and easy deployment. At the same time,
    the system needs to ensure the applicability and access permission of infrastructure
    and control operating costs. Taking into account the economic benefits and the
    application of IoT, sensors in this LEWS are the following: Analog capacitive
    soil moisture sensor (SEN0193): this sensor is selected to measure the soil moisture
    content in the slope Micro pore-water pressure transducers (KPG PA): this micromodule
    equipment is used to obtain the porewater pressure and predict the groundwater
    table by rainwater infiltration Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors:
    high precision 9-axis gyroscope and magnetic meter with Karman filter, low power
    3-axis AHRS IMU sensor (WT901BLECL MPU9250), which is used to measure the deflection
    angle of soil, even some very small movements The IoT boards developed for sensors
    were based on ESP32 development, which has the advantages of easy access to hardware
    and software ecology system, stackable module design, and plug-and-play rich sensor
    expansion, and it was provided by M5 Stack Technology Company. The equipment was
    programmed in Micro Python using the Arduino compiler/IDE. In addition, a handheld
    data logger with wireless mail IoT is considered in the LEWS, which not only can
    display the real-time pore-water pressure trend on the screen but also remotely
    transmit data to the cloud through the IoT system. Data transmission The new developed
    EWS was not only IoT-based hardware devices (sensors and IoT boards) but also
    IoT networks. For the utilization of wireless communication technology, it is
    first necessary to adapt to the functional requirements of the LEWS (usually the
    total amount of data collection and data transmission rate). The Internet connection
    for communication devices and sensors is supported by a wireless LTE mobile router
    (Aterm), with the built-in wireless LAN with a Wi-Fi connection. The Aterm LTE
    can be facilitated by 2.4-GHz low energy with a theoretical maximum range of 100
    m. The detailed parameter information is shown in Table 1. Table 1 Device information
    of early warning system Full size table For remote real-time monitoring, this
    research carried out a visual display on the basis of Ambient. Ambient is an IoT
    data service that receives, stores, and visualizes sensor data. This function
    developed in Arduino compiler/IDE helps to make creative designs for IoT as easy
    as possible. It plots the sensor data in real time without the requirement of
    a detailed initial setup. By adding more settings, Ambient can provide powerful
    customization capabilities such as giving graphs and data names that are easy
    to understand, changing graph types, and overlaying multiple data on one graph.
    The most important thing is that the monitoring results can be observed remotely,
    and it supports various devices to check, such as mobile phones and computers.
    Data analysis Regarding the data analysis part, this research presents the principle
    considered for handling monitoring data. The data processing tire manages IoT
    big data streams, which will be trained for landslide monitoring by proposed risk
    classification. Based on the trend of rainfall infiltration, key warning indices
    such as soil moisture content, pore-water pressure, and deflection angle are set
    in the system, and a comprehensive slope stability analysis is carried out to
    obtain the real-time factor of safety (Fs) of the slope under various rainfall
    conditions. The whole proposed risk classification has been divided into three
    stages: monitoring state (stage I), alert state (stage II), and triggering state
    (stage III). Before each landslide, at least 3 warning signs will be sent. Low-cost
    and sustainable operation As shown in Table 1, the power consumption of each device
    in the entire system is very low, so an off-the-grid solar energy-powered integrated
    sensor platform is used to optimize the sustainability of the system. Research
    finds that only a portable power supply with a 500-Wh battery capacity can support
    monitoring work for more than 7 days in theory. In addition, an ultra-lightweight
    flexible solar panel with a thickness of only 0.2 in and weighing only 2.7 kg
    can continuously power the high-capacity battery under solar energy and theoretically
    can be fully charged in a day. As a result, the standalone energy harvesting feature
    of the LEWS will ensure the sustainability of the monitoring process. The device
    used in this research is shown in Fig. 2, and the detailed operation process of
    the whole system is shown in Fig. 3. In addition, this system provides an open
    architecture that can accommodate and be compatible with any sensor with an I2C
    output, thereby making it possible to be upgraded at any point of time for different
    application scenarios and monitoring requirements. Fig. 2 Equipment configuration
    in the system Full size image Fig. 3 Diagram of early warning process Full size
    image The determination method of threshold Considering the effects of rainfall
    on the monitoring slope, the failure mode in nature usually performs two forms:
    one is deep slope failure which is mainly due to the saturation or even erosion
    of the topsoil by rainfall infiltration where the topsoil mainly contains the
    clay layer, weathered soil, tropical residual soil, etc. and the other kind is
    multiple shallow failures from slope toe and usually occurs in sandy soil slope
    or loess slope. It appears with the phenomenon that the slope gradually tends
    to be saturated from the bottom due to the rise of the groundwater table (Corominas
    et al. 2005). As a result, research will consider the following steps to prepare
    the sensor deployment and threshold setting: (1) conducting preliminary on-site
    geological surveys to build the slope model, (2) regarding the deployment of sensors
    under each borehole in the slope, both moisture sensors and acceleration sensors
    need to be deployed at different depths, and (3) testing the critical or saturated
    water content of the soil to define the threshold, set the threshold of deflection
    angle according to slope geometry, and set the threshold of the porewater pressure
    according to the depth of sensor location in each borehole. Since the failure
    mode is often characterized by multiple shallow landslides (Koizumi et al. 2018;
    Corominas et al. 2005), this study will focus on typical sandy soil slopes to
    give an example of threshold setting and EWS working. Key indicators during rainwater
    infiltration In a designed laboratory test, silica sand has been usually chosen
    to explore the failure mechanism of slope under the condition of heavy rainfall.
    As a result, the system is mainly tested on homogeneous sand slopes currently.
    The infiltration of rainwater on the sandy slope will cause the rise of the groundwater
    level and a decrease of the shear strength. The path of water infiltration, soil
    moisture distribution, and the groundwater table can be considered as important
    indexes for the prediction of landslide. The schematic diagram of rainwater infiltration
    in the slope is shown in Fig. 4a. It can be concluded that with the process of
    infiltration, rainwater will run from slope surface to the impermeable soil layer
    and accumulate on the interface; finally, it will cause the increase of groundwater
    level. Wang et al. (2020) concluded that the soil moisture content will be kept
    constant at one threshold and then become a saturated state as the groundwater
    table increases. According to the result of previous research (Koizumi et al.
    2018; Cogan and Gratchev 2019; Chueasamat et al. 2019), for shallow landslide
    with sandy soil, a landslide often occurs when slope reaches a saturated or quasi-saturated
    state. Based on the rainwater flow in the soil, the soil moisture content at the
    critical state and saturated state can both be used as a threshold reference in
    the infiltration process, and the evolution of porewater pressure can also be
    used as the threshold evaluation standard. When the slope is gradually saturated,
    particles in the slope will move slightly, so sensors will detect some slight
    deflection angles. In the study of using deflection angle to forecast the occurrence
    of landslide, research found that once the internal deflection of the slope exceeds
    the threshold, a landslide will occur rapidly (Uchimura et al. 2015). Fig. 4 Schematic
    diagram of the monitoring point state Full size image Evaluation of slope factor
    of safety (F s) Based on the method for shallow landslides, under the effect of
    transient infiltration, this research presented the safety factor Fs considering
    the distribution of soil moisture content and the increase of groundwater table.
    The numerical calculation method is adopted for rainfall-induced shallow landslides
    and is always based on the assumption of infinite-slope analysis. The inducing
    factors of shallow failure here are the reduction of suction and the increase
    of pore-water pressure under rainfall effects, and the direct manifestation is
    the elevation of the groundwater table. Research by Griffiths and Lu (2005), Baum
    et al. (2010) and Yang et al. (2018) shows that such a calculation method can
    also be extended to solve the problems of unsaturated conditions. In addition,
    considering the 3D failure mode, such as B/H = 2 (B is the slope width and H is
    the slope height), the stability factor obtained will be significantly larger
    than the infinite slope in the current analysis, even 50% higher (He et al. 2019).
    While this study is part of an early warning system, lower Fs will be more suitable
    for a sign of early warning. As a result, the porewater pressure distribution
    is shown in Fig. 4, and Fs is given below: $$F_{s} (Z,t) = \\frac{\\tan \\varphi
    ^{\\prime}}{{\\tan \\beta }} + \\frac{{c^{\\prime} - \\sigma_{s} (Z,t)\\tan \\varphi
    ^{\\prime}}}{{(\\gamma + \\gamma_{w} * w(Z,t)) * Z * \\sin \\beta * \\cos \\beta
    }}$$ (1) Here Z means the depth below the ground surface (as shown in Fig. 4),
    t is the measuring time, β (°) is the angle of slope, φ′ (°) is the soil friction
    angle for effective stress, c′ (kPa) is the soil cohesion for effective stress,
    γ (N/m3) is the soil unit weight, γw (N/m3) is the unit weight of groundwater,
    w is soil moisture content, and σs (kPa) is porewater pressure. Flowchart of early
    warning process Four important warning indices, soil moisture content, porewater
    pressure, soil deflection angle, and safety factor (Fs), are considered to evaluate
    the state of the slope and issue signals of landslides. The thresholds set in
    this research are as follows: 1. Soil moisture thresholds Mc_t1 and Mc_t2, which
    represent the critical value of sand slope before saturation and saturated volumetric
    moisture content respectively, 2. Porewater pressure: Pw_t1 and Pw_t2, Pw_t1 is
    the state when the porewater pressure is first captured, which is generally 0–0.1
    kPa and Pw_t2 is the critical value before landslide, 3. Small deflection angle
    thresholds D_t1 and big deflection angle thresholds D_t2 before landslide, and
    4. Threshold of safety factor Fs_t, which is usually 1.0 and is in a safe state
    when Fs > 1 and in danger state when Fs < = 1. As the flowchart in Fig. 5 shows,
    first of all, slope morphology parameters and soil types of the monitored area
    need to be set first to complete the initial modelling. Then, the thresholds of
    warning indices from sensors and calculations need to be input into the system
    and represent the transition of each risk stage. All the warning indices are determined
    by the type of soil and the shape of the slope. After setting all the thresholds,
    the work will start. The first stage is monitoring state, in which the soil moisture
    will increase from initial volumetric moisture content to Mc_t1 with the rainwater
    infiltration; since the rainwater does not reach to impermeable layer, there is
    no porewater pressure in this step. So, the 1st warning message will be sent at
    time of t1 once the porewater pressure sensors detached reaction of rising Pw_t1
    or all moisture sensors reach Mc_t1, which also means that the system enters alert
    state. The system will plot a slope risk status map based on the real-time monitoring
    data, including the presentation of the groundwater table, the soil moisture content
    of the monitoring point, and the real-time safety factor. Then, the soil moisture
    sensor will capture the rapid increase, and the slope will become a saturated
    state as the groundwater level moves from bottom up. However, in this state, porewater
    pressure does not reach the threshold Pw_t2 and acceleration sensors do not find
    any fluctuations (less than D_t1). Once the acceleration sensors exceed the small
    deflection threshold D_t1 or porewater pressure reaches the threshold Pw_t2, the
    2nd warning message will be released at the time of t2, and the state will enter
    the third stage: triggering state. Finally, when real-time Fs is smaller than
    1.0 or deflection angle is more than D_t2, the system will give the last warning
    message at the time of t3 and landslides will occur within a very short time.
    Figure 5 describes the whole process and timeline of early warning in detail.
    Fig. 5 Flowchart of proposed LEWS Full size image Test study based on LEWS Preparation
    work of the model test based on LEWS This designed laboratory test is based on
    a hypothetical homogeneous slope and uniform rainfall infiltration, and research
    conducted the influence of different rainfall intensities (45, 70, and 100 mm/h).
    The slope model in the test was built in a rectangular box, and it was designed
    to be 800 mm (length) × 400 mm (width) × 450 mm (height), which is similar to
    the model in Cogan and Gratchev (2019). The base layer height is 100 mm and the
    slope layer height is 350 mm. Sensor combinations used in this test are 6 soil
    moisture sensors, 3 micro porewater pressure sensors, and 4 acceleration sensors.
    The artificial rainfall simulator and information of model size are shown in Fig.
    6. To obtain the soil moisture distribution of the slope, six soil moisture sensors
    (S1–S6) are distributed in different parts of the slope. Three micro porewater
    pressure sensors (P1–P3) are located at the bottom to map the movement of the
    groundwater table and four acceleration sensors (M1-M4) are arranged along the
    surface to capture the shallow movement. The layout of sensors in this test is
    performed in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Model test and sensor layout Full size image This
    research also conducted some testing work with reference to previous studies (Wang
    et al. 2020) to obtain the moisture evolution of sand soil K7. Result shows that
    the critical value of sand slope before the saturation state is around 28% and
    that saturated volumetric moisture content is 36–38%, so the research set MC_t1
    = 28% and MC_t2 = 36%. Since the P1 was located below the hillslopes, it was the
    first sensor to react; Pw_t1 is set to 0.1 kPa. The vertical distance between
    P1 and slope surface is 20 cm, so 1.5 kPa was set as the Pw_t2 in this model.
    According to the previous study on deflection angle (Uchimura et al. 2010, 2015),
    it was concluded that operators need to be cautious when deflection angle reaches
    0.005°/h and waning level enters to alert/evacuation state once deflection angle
    is more than 0.1°/h. The system in this research will give 3 warning messages,
    and each test usually lasts 1–2 h. Deflection angle index is set to D_t1 = 0.1°,
    which is one of the weathervanes that state changes from alert state to triggering
    state, and this study also set that D_t2 = 1°, which means the landslide will
    occur soon. Since this study uses the most unfavorable porewater pressure coefficient
    to calculate the safety factor, the obtained FS is always lower than the actual
    situation, so setting FS to 1 is an early warning of landslide occurrence. As
    a result, the threshold set in this research is (1) MC_t1 = 28% and MC_t2 = 36%,
    (2) Pw_t1 = 0 ± 0.1 kPa and Pw_t2 = 1.5 kPa, (3) D_t1 = 0.1° and D_t2 = 1°, and
    (4) Fs_t = 1.000. Results of monitoring data All real-time data will be transmitted
    to the cloud and displayed visually. Figures 7, 8, and 9 perform the time history
    of volumetric moisture content, porewater pressure, soil deflection angle, and
    factor of safety (Fs) under three rainfall intensities. It is obvious that greater
    rainfall intensity results in faster landslides. Monitoring results show that
    moisture sensor S2 was always the last sensor that detached reaction because it
    was located at the deepest part of the slope and it also stayed away from the
    slope surface. Therefore, when S2 reaches the threshold, it is considered that
    the entire monitored slope reaches the threshold MC_t1. In addition, porewater
    pressure sensor P1 was always the fastest sensor to monitor porewater pressure
    because it had the shortest distance from the slope. Comparing the time of MC_t1
    and Pw_t1, it is found that the time of MC_t1 is usually smaller than Pw_t1; for
    example, time for S2 to reach MC_t1 in three cases was around 48, 40, and 35 min,
    respectively, but the response time for P1 in the three cases was 65, 42, and
    35 min. Therefore, the first signal will be sent at an earlier time. Before the
    first warning, the slope was in stage I: monitoring state. With the infiltration
    of rainwater, the soil moisture content was kept stable for a short time near
    the threshold MC_t1. On the contrary, S1 and S2 re-increased faster than other
    sensors because the groundwater table went up from impermeable soil layer, and
    all the sensors raised to MC_t2 in turn as soil slope gradually became a saturated
    state. Research found that S1 was always the first sensor that reached MC_t2,
    time for the area near S1 to become a saturated state in three cases was 81, 62,
    and 48 min, which was considered to be one important index for the 2nd warning.
    After entering stage II: alert state, porewater pressure increased rapidly. The
    time for porewater pressure sensor to reach MC_t2 was 92, 65, and 50 min in three
    cases. As the porewater pressure increased, it is obvious that there was some
    fluctuation from the data of acceleration sensors. D_t1 was set to evaluate the
    intensity of fluctuation, and research found that M1 near the slope toe was the
    first sensor to detach rection and the time of D_t1 in three cases was 93, 70,
    and 50 min. According to the principle of early warning, compare the time when
    the three parameters reach the threshold, and the second warning signal will be
    released at time of 92, 65, and 50 min. After 2nd warning was sent, the whole
    slope was in danger state and it entered stage III: triggering state. Obvious
    deflection angle was captured by the sensor from M1 to M4, because sandy soil
    slopes often cause multiple shallow landslides. When in triggering state, the
    deflection angle of M1 increased from D_t1 to D_t2 at time of 106, 80, and 57
    min. At this time, the Fs also dropped rapidly until reaching the critical value
    of 1.00. Under the three rainfall cases, Fs reached the critical value in 99,
    76, and 56 min, respectively, which are all less than the time of deflection angle
    D_t2. Therefore, the 3rd message was sent when Fs reaches the critical value.
    Research also finds that it cost only 3–12 min for the occurrence of the landslide
    after 3rd message. Table 2 records the time of each indicator threshold, warning
    signal, and the occurrence time of multiple landslides in detail. The experimental
    results were in line with expectations; that is, the three warnings were sent
    before the landslide occurred. Fig. 7 Monitoring results under rainfall intensity
    45 mm/h Full size image Fig. 8 Monitoring results under rainfall intensity 70
    mm/h Full size image Fig. 9 Monitoring results under rainfall intensity 100 mm/h
    Full size image Table 2 Time of each indicator, the signal, and the occurrence
    time of multiple landslides Full size table According to the data from different
    sensors, the system plots the real-time slope risk maps, including the migration
    of the groundwater table at each warning time, and for each moisture sensor, this
    study marks the Fs to provide the local factor of safety. At the beginning of
    the unsaturated stage, due to rainfall infiltration, the water content in the
    upper part is greater than the lower until the porewater pressure appears. As
    rainfall continues, the groundwater table continues to rise. It is obvious that,
    for the sandy soil slope, although the whole slope is not completely saturated,
    the slip surface may occur in the saturated zone. As Figs. 10, 11, and 12 show,
    the failure slip will usually occur below the groundwater table. S3 and S5 are
    located closer to the slope surface, which makes nearby areas more vulnerable
    to erosion. In this way, research can obtain a lower Fs than the actual situation,
    which can play a good role in early warning. The result in the figures also show
    that those areas near S3 and S5 are more prone to landslides, as they all appear
    within the collapse range of the final landslide. Fig. 10 Real-time indicator
    value under rainfall intensity 45 mm/h Full size image Fig. 11 Real-time indicator
    value under rainfall intensity 70 mm/h Full size image Fig. 12 Real-time indicator
    value under rainfall intensity 100 mm/h Full size image Discussion of the model
    test To evaluate the accuracy of the test results, research conducted a comparison
    with representative intensity-duration thresholds with similar soil types (Chien
    et al. 2005; Dahal and Hasegawa 2008; Cogan and Gratchev 2019). I-D thresholds
    explain the time to collapse against different rainfall intensities and have been
    widely used around the world as an early warning system. As shown in Fig. 13,
    in this study, two important times were used to compare, namely, the first shallow
    landslide on the slope surface and the final deep landslide. It was found that
    most of the results in the test are between the upper bound (Chien et al. 2005)
    and lower bound (Dahal and Hasegawa 2008), which verifies the rationality of the
    system. But test result of the first shallow landslide is a bit lower than the
    average value of previous studies because the slope in this research was considered
    to be whole homogeneous and this study set a big initial water content (12%) and
    large slope angle (45°). The rainfall intensity-duration thresholds were developed
    using data, and the function of thresholds are Fig. 13 Results of I-D thresholds
    compared with previous research Full size image $${I\\_}_{1\\mathrm{st}}=98.78*{D}^{-1.228}$$
    (2) $${I\\_}_{\\mathrm{final}}=128.4*{D}^{-1.252}$$ (3) Here I is rainfall intensity
    (mm/h) and D is the duration (h). The I-D thresholds obtained in this study can
    also provide certain reference values for similar soil sample slopes. In this
    experiment, a camera is built on the front of the model to capture the entire
    moving process of landslides. Research presents the front view at different duration
    times during rainfall intensity 100 mm/h. As the initial state is shown in Fig.
    14, from the side view, 7 tracking points were marked in the slope, of which 4
    points (points a–d) are along the slope and 3 points (points e–g) are inside the
    slope. Research defines three slope failures based on obvious movement captured
    by motion analysis, which occurred successively from bottom to top. Figure 14
    shows that points a and e have the fastest response, while points a, b, and c
    have longer displacement than other points. It can be clearly seen that after
    the first landslide occurs, it will quickly spread to multiple landslides and
    eventually produce extremely violent long-distance landslides. According to the
    results in the figure, more than 50% of the sliding distances of the monitoring
    points are derived from the last deep landslide. It only takes 3–12 min from the
    3rd signal to landslide, especially the most severe rainfall intensity of 100
    mm/h. Therefore, it is necessary to start the evacuation of personnel and important
    properties in dangerous areas after the first signal is issued, and the transfer
    work of personnel and assets is completed when the second signal is issued. Only
    in this way can it be ensured that there is no life and property threat when the
    third signal is issued. Fig. 14 Erosion of slope as failure progresses (schematic
    under rainfall intensity 100 mm/h) Full size image From all the above results,
    it can be seen that for a designed homogeneous sandy slope, throughout the monitoring
    process, the thresholds generally appear in the following order: MC_t1, Pw_t1,
    MC_t2, Pw_t2, D_t1, Fs_t, and D_t2. Although some parameters are never used as
    warning indicators in the whole early warning process, the changes in values can
    be used as a guarantee for the normal operation of the entire system monitoring
    process. LEWS deployment as an example The current test LEWS deployment work was
    located on an embankment slope. The purpose of this section is to lay a solid
    foundation for large-scale deployment in dangerous areas in the future. The bottom
    of the whole embankment is compacted well and the water table was located 15 m
    below the ground, which means it is more stable than the upper part. In order
    to reduce costs and make it easy to deploy, this study only considers the most
    vulnerable area with a depth of 1.5 m under the ground surface, and the current
    scheme does not deploy any porewater pressure sensors because of the very deep
    groundwater table. The profile of the EWS deployment is shown in Fig. 15, and
    the two sides are the newly developed EWS. It can be found that for every 0.25
    m, we set a soil moisture sensor and for every 0.75 m we set a 3D acceleration
    sensor. Therefore, there will be six soil moisture sensors and two 3D acceleration
    sensors totally in the design borehole, and one solar battery system with 1000
    Wh capacity is quite enough for at least 10 days of operation with continuous
    rainfall. Fig. 15 LEWS deployment on the embankment slope Full size image Tests
    were carried out on soil samples from the field to test the evolutionary characteristics
    of soil moisture content. Research set a moisture content of 38% as the threshold
    value. When the threshold is reached, a first warning signal is planned to be
    issued. For the deflection angle, the study adopted an approach consistent with
    the classical early warning principle that a second warning signal will be given
    when the deflection angle is greater than 0.01°/h. A third warning signal will
    be given when the deflection angle is bigger than 0.1°/h. It has been monitored
    for a short time, and the moisture sensor data shows that the soil moisture content
    has decreased; it is easy to understand because the system was deployed on rainy
    days while there was no heavy rainfall during the monitoring period, and the data
    of the acceleration sensor presented that a certain deflection angle was generated,
    but the difference was less than 1 degree than the data 1 week before, so the
    deformation was around 0.004°/h, which is much less than the warning threshold
    of 0.01°/h. In addition, the real-time Fs is 1.08. As a result, now, the monitoring
    area is in a safe state. Conclusions In order to evaluate slope stability under
    rainfall conditions and carry out early warning analysis for landslides, this
    research proposed a new LEWS based on multiple sensors with IoT to monitor and
    forecast rainfall-induced landslides. Model tests have been conducted to verify
    LEWS feasibility. Here are some conclusions of this study: 1. The LEWS proposed
    in this study reduces the development cost by several times, and the low energy
    dissipation device can be adaptively balanced under a photovoltaic generation
    system, thus achieving sustainability. In addition, this system provides an open
    architecture for users to update hardware and software under different application
    scenarios and monitoring requirements. 2. According to the method of threshold
    determination in this study, research divides the process into three stages. A
    series of model tests under different rainfall intensities confirmed the feasibility
    and prediction accuracy of the system. The system successfully issued 3 warning
    messages before the occurrence of a landslide, and the deployment work of LEWS
    on the embankment slope outside can be considered as a representative case for
    applying low-cost and sustainable early warning systems in the future. Data availability

  description: This study reports the search of available data published regarding
    microbial occupational exposure assessment in poultries, following the PRISMA
    methodology. Air collection through filtration was the most frequently used. The
    most commonly used passive sampling method was material collection such as dust,
    cages, soils, sediment, and wastewater. Regarding assays applied, the majority
    of studies comprised culture-based methods, but molecular tools were also frequently
    used. Screening for antimicrobial susceptibility was performed only for bacteria;
    cytotoxicity, virological and serological assays were also performed. Most of
    the selected studies focused on bacteria, although fungi, endotoxins, and β-glucans
    were also assessed. The only study concerning fungi and mycotoxins reported the
    carcinogenic mycotoxin AFB1. This study gives a comprehensive overview of microbial
    contamination in the poultry industry, emphasizing this setting as a potential
    reservoir of microbial pathogens threatening human, animal, and environmental
    health. Additionally, this research helps to provide a sampling and analysis protocol
    proposal to evaluate the microbiological contamination in these facilities. Few
    articles were found reporting fungal contamination in poultry farms worldwide.
    In addition, information concerning fungal resistance profile and mycotoxin contamination
    remain scarce. Overall, a One Health approach should be incorporated in exposure
    assessments and the knowledge gaps identified in this paper should be addressed
    in further research.

    contamination; poultries; food safety Graphical Abstract 1. Introduction The One
    Health approach incorporates human, animal, and plant health, as well as the health
    of their shared environment, for supporting a multidisciplinary and holistic approach
    that integrates monitoring, planning, and evaluation to optimize co-benefits and
    public health outcomes [1,2]. In addition, the One Health approach supports global
    health by fostering coordination, collaboration, and communication among different
    sectors at the human–animal–environment interface to address common health threats
    such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), food safety, zoonotic diseases, and several
    others [2,3]. The industrialization of the poultry sector poses a considerable
    negative impact on air, soil, and water. The increase in waste management problems
    can be considered as one of the major drivers fostering harmful effects on environmental
    health [4]. Indeed, pathogens can be disseminated by unrecognized pathways, for
    example, on airborne dust and animal wastes utilized in agriculture and, consequently,
    water and soil quality may be impacted [5]. Poultry production intensification
    needs increases in livestock numbers and densities, the use of particular feed
    to raise conversion ratios, and shorter production cycles [4,6]. Consequently,
    such changes may potentially alter transmission patterns and the evolutionary
    conditions of dominant pathogens, leading to emergence of zoonotic diseases [4,7].
    The environment of animal husbandry, such as humidity level, number of animals,
    ventilation type, and hygiene measures may influence microbial development [8].
    In fact, intensive animal production is also considered as one of the causes for
    biodiversity loss and potentially for upcoming pandemics [2,9]. Agricultural expansion
    and intensification bring wildlife, livestock, and people into closer contact,
    allowing animal microbes to spill over into people and causing infections, sometimes
    outbreaks, and less frequently epidemics and pandemics [1,2]. Production intensification
    of livestock raises concerns about the feasibility of the One Health model for
    animal production regarding the protection of the health of animals, workers,
    and consumers [10]. Thus, intensive poultry farming not only poses a significant
    risk to workers [11,12] but can also act as a potential public health menace [1,4].
    Human and animal well-being is also in the scope of a One Health approach. Animal
    diseases threaten human health, food safety, and security, driven by the transmission
    of zoonotic diseases or by the loss of animal productivity. Adequate hygiene management
    is therefore critical to avoiding the negative human health and economic repercussions
    of foodborne diseases [13]. We shouldn´t consider the close linkage and interdependencies
    of human and animal health without considering maintenance of stable ecosystem
    services that can be threatened by livestock rearing methods and/or excessive
    exploitative human activities [14]. In 2013, the European Union (EU) through the
    Directive 2003/99/EC aimed to improve the system for monitoring and collection
    of information on zoonoses, antimicrobial resistance, and foodborne outbreaks
    (EU, 2013). In 2017, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),
    European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and European Medicines Agency (EMA) jointly
    established a list of harmonized outcome indicators to assist EU Member States’
    assessment of the progress in reducing the use of antimicrobials and AMR in both
    humans and food-producing animals (ECDC, EFSA, EMA; 2017). More recently, in 2021,
    a list of harmonized outcome indicators was presented per country in the scope
    of the One Health approach (ECDC, EFSA, EMA; 2021). Additionally, since 2011,
    EFSA has reported zoonoses, zoonotic agents, and foodborne outbreaks and, in 2019,
    the annual EU Summary Reports were renamed the “EU One Health Zoonoses Summary
    Report” which is co-authored by EFSA and ECDC. In the scope of food safety, the
    poultry industry remains a public health issue, since foodborne pathogens can
    be in contact at all phases of the producing chain. Thus, identifying the sources
    and routes of transmission of pathogens is required in order to reduce their occurrence.
    Some regulatory guidelines have been designed to answer these concerns, namely
    the Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005, concerning microbiological contaminants for
    food safety criteria. However, the food industry is known to be very committed
    to food safety assurance, but less concerned with the safety of workers, and biological
    risk assessment is usually neglected by occupational health professionals due
    to the lack of systematized information about the biological agents involved [15].
    In fact, the microorganisms’ occupational exposure is being neglected in a wide
    range of industrial sectors (besides poultry production), being less recognized
    and not so well described in comparison with other occupational agents [16]. Concerning
    the occupational health legal framework, Portuguese employers are obliged by regulation
    to assess and prevent exposure to occupational risks [17] and specifically to
    biological agents. The Directive 2000/54/EC of the European Parliament and the
    Council of September 18 sets the rules regarding risk assessment if exposure to
    biological agents cannot be avoided [18]. However, it is not common to include
    zoonosis and AMR as a source of risk in studies on occupational risk assessment
    of animal-related occupations. In 2020, the European Agency for Safety and Health
    at Work (EU-OSHA) published a review about biological agents and prevention of
    work-related diseases, and animal farming was considered a high-risk occupation
    [19]. Due to the lack of studies regarding poultry farms this study aimed to perform
    a systematic review to provide a broad overview of the state of the art in the
    developed subject, describing the microbiological contamination reported in previous
    studies developed in poultry farms and indicating which parameters and methods
    were applied to perform the microbial contamination assessment in this setting
    in different scopes (occupational/food safety/animal health). 2. Materials and
    Methods 2.1. Registration The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist [20] was completed (Supplementary Material—Table
    S1). 2.2. Search Strategy, Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria This study reports
    the search of available data published in the period of 1 January 2000 to 20 January
    2023. The search terms aimed to identify studies on microbial occupational exposure
    assessments, selecting studies on sawmills that included the terms “exposure”
    AND “microorganisms” AND (“poultry” OR “broilers”), with English as the chosen
    language. The databases chosen were PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ (accessed
    on 20 January 2023)), Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/ (accessed on 20 January
    2023)), and Web of Science (WoS) (www.webofscience.com (accessed on 20 January
    2023) following the PRISMA methodology. This search strategy identified 258 papers
    in all databases. Articles that did not fulfill the inclusion criteria were not
    subjected to additional review (but some of them were used for Introduction and
    Discussion sections) (Table 1). Table 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for
    the articles selected. 2.3. Study Selection and Data Extraction The selection
    of the articles was performed through the Rayyan intelligent systematic review
    application, which is a free web-tool that greatly speeds up the process of screening
    and selecting papers for academics working on systematic reviews, in three rounds.
    The first round was conducted by one investigator (BG) and comprised the screening
    of all titles to eliminate papers that were duplicated or unrelated to the subject.
    Rayyan was then used to analyze the papers that were chosen. The second round
    was a screening of all abstracts carried out by two investigators (BG and RC).
    The full texts of all potentially relevant studies were evaluated in the third
    round, taking into account the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential divergences
    in the selection of the studies were analyzed and resolved by four investigators
    (BG, MD, RC, and PP). Data extraction was then conducted by BG. It was also checked
    over by MD and CV. The following details were manually extracted: (1) databases,
    (2) title, (3) country, (4) environment assessed, (5) objective, (6) microorganisms
    and metabolites, (7) analyzed matrices, (8) sampling methods, (9) analytical methods,
    (10) main findings, (11) references. 2.4. Quality Assessment The assessment of
    the risk of bias was performed by two investigators (BG and CV). Within each study,
    we evaluated the risk of bias across three parameters divided into key criteria
    (environment assessed, microorganisms and metabolites, sampling methods, analytical
    methods). Each parameter’s risk of bias was rated as “low,” “medium,” “high,”
    or “not applicable.” The studies for which all the key criteria and most of the
    other criteria were characterized as “high” were excluded. 3. Results The workflow
    diagram for selecting studies is illustrated in Figure 1. Initially, 259 studies
    were found in the database search, from which 197 abstracts were examined and
    97 complete texts were assessed for eligibility. After considering the inclusion
    and exclusion criteria, a total of 39 studies were disregarded, mostly because
    they were related to biocontrol efficacy, clinical trials, or biological samples.
    A total of 58 studies related to microbial exposure in poultry facilities were
    selected. Figure 1. PRISMA-based selection of articles. Characteristics of the
    Selected Studies Table 2 describes the main characteristics of the selected studies.
    Of the reviewed studies (n = 58), 34 were conducted in Europe (9 in Germany [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29],
    8 in Poland [25,30,31,32,33,34,35,36], 4 in Portugal [37,38,39,40], 3 in Italy
    [41,42,43], 1 in the Netherlands [44], Spain [45], Austria [46], Lithuania [47],
    France [48], Denmark [49], 1 in Denmark and Switzerland [50], and 2 in several
    European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
    Poland, and Spain [51] and Denmark, Switzerland, and Spain [52]). Thirteen studies
    were performed in Asia, namely, six in China [39,53,54,55,56,57], four in Korea
    [58,59,60,61], one in Lebanon [62], one in India [37], and one in Iran [63]. Eight
    studies were carried out in America, including six in the United States of America
    [64,65,66,67,68,69] and two in Canada [70,71]. In Africa, three studies were conducted
    in Egypt [72,73,74] while, in Oceania, two studies were performed in Australia
    [75,76]. Table 2. Characteristics of and Data Obtained in the Selected Studies.
    . The majority of studies (31 out of 58, 53%) were performed on poultry farms
    [23,24,27,28,30,31,32,35,36,38,40,41,43,44,48,49,54,55,57,60,62,63,66,68,69,70,71,72,74,76,78];
    followed by animal farms (19 out of 58%, 33%), namely, six on poultry and swine
    farms [40,50,51,52,58,64], two on poultry and dairy farms [37,53], two on poultry
    farms, sheep sheds, and horse stables [33,49], one on cattle, chicken, swine,
    and sheep [67], one on poultry, swine, and cattle [59], one on cow barns, swine,
    sheep sheds, poultry houses, horse stables, and buildings for storage of hay [34],
    one on poultry, pork, and beef farms [45], one on a duck hatchery [22], one on
    a turkey hatchery [21], one on swine, chicken, and cattle farms [61], one on poultry
    farms and live poultry markets [56], and one on poultry processing plants [75].
    Additionally, three studies (5%) covered several workplaces (one on a cement plant,
    composting plant, poultry farm, and cultivated area [25], one on a poultry farm,
    flourmill, and the textile and food industry [73], and one on a poultry farm,
    swinery, feed preparing and storing house, grain mill, wooden panel-producing
    factory, and organic waste and recycling facilities [47]. Most of the studies
    focus on occupational health (33 out of 58, 57%) [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,30,31,36,38,39,40,41,42,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,55,58,59,60,64,66,67,70,73,74],
    followed by food safety (6 out of 58, 10%) [43,45,49,69,71,75] and human health
    (5 out of 58, 9%) [32,53,56,63,77]. Some studies encompass occupational and animal
    health (4 out of 58, 7%) [33,35,54,61], while some studies focus only on animal
    health (4 out of 58, 7%) [44,57,68,76]. Few studies focused on human and animal
    health (2 out of 58, 3%) [78]. One study focused on environmental health and food
    safety [29], one on human and environmental health [62], and one on environmental
    health [37]. Regarding microbial contamination, most of the selected studies focused
    on bacteria (31 out 58, 53%) [21,22,23,24,26,27,28,29,30,35,37,43,44,45,49,51,53,54,55,56,57,62,63,64,67,68,69,71,75,76,77],
    while some considered bacteria and fungi (8 out 59, 14%) [25,46,49,58,60,66,73,74].
    Eight studies (14%) considered microorganisms and metabolites, six studies (10%)
    focused on bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins [42,50,52,59,61,72], one focused on
    bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, and β-glucans [31], and one focused on bacteria and
    endotoxins [70]. In addition, six studies (10%) focused only on fungi [32,36,38,39,47,78],
    three studies (5%) on endotoxins [33,34,48], one study on fungi and mycotoxins
    [40], and one study on viruses [41]. The most frequent sampling method was air
    sampling (36 out of 58, 62%) [21,22,23,24,26,27,28,30,31,32,34,35,36,38,39,42,46,47,48,50,52,53,54,55,57,58,59,60,61,64,65,66,70,73,74,78].
    Considering active sampling, air collection through a filtration method was frequent
    (24 out of 58, 41%) [21,22,23,24,26,27,28,30,31,34,36,42,47,48,49,50,52,55,57,59,61,64,70,73].
    The impaction method was also recurrent (12 out of 58, 21%) [31,32,38,39,46,54,58,59,60,61,70,78],
    followed by the impingement method (4 out of 58, 7%) [23,46,47,73]. Additionally,
    one study used the two-stage bioaerosol cyclone [27]. Regarding passive sampling,
    material collection was the most frequent methodology applied (13 out of 58, 22%)
    [21,33,34,35,37,38,45,51,56,62,68,69,71], namely of dust (3 out of 58, 5%) [33,35,51],
    litter samples (3 out of 59, 5%) [38,62,68], bird carcasses (3 out of 58, 5%)
    [45,69,71], and animal fecal samples (2 out of 59, 3%) [69,71]. Manure and soil
    samples [37], eggshell [21] and specimens, feces, cages, soils, sediment, wastewater,
    and surface swabs from chopping boards [56] were collected. Some studies performed
    surface swabs (11 out of 58, 19%) [22,39,41,43,44,49,67,71,74,76,77] of bird cloacas
    (5 out of 58, 8%) [43,44,49,71,77], bird cloacas and human sera [41], human sera
    [22], the skin of workers [67], nose and throat of workers [74], fecal droppings
    [76], and the floor [39]. Furthermore, three studies used both active and passive
    sampling methods [39,40,74] and two studies performed personal air sampling [50,74].
    Considering analytical procedures for microbial characterization, the majority
    of studies used culture-based methods (41 out of 58, 71%) [21,23,24,25,28,29,30,31,32,35,36,37,38,39,40,42,43,44,45,46,47,49,52,53,55,58,59,60,61,62,63,65,68,69,71,72,73,74,75,76,77].
    Fluorescence quantification was also recurrent (5 out of 58, 9%) [21,22,27,50,52].
    In addition, screening for antimicrobial susceptibility was carried out only for
    bacteria (13 out of 58 studies, 22%) [29,37,43,45,49,53,63,65,69,71,72,75,77].
    In addition, two studies performed a cytotoxicity assay [25,35] and one study
    used both virological and serological assays [41]. Molecular tools were frequently
    applied (29 out of 58 studies, 50%) [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,37,38,39,43,44,49,51,53,54,56,57,64,65,66,67,70,71,75,77,78].
    Several studies performed PCR (9 out of 58, 16%) [23,24,25,38,39,54,57,71,77],
    while some resorted to RT-PCR [43,53]. Antibiotic resistance gene sequencing was
    carried out by four studies (7%). While some studies rely on metagenomics analysis
    (2 out of 58, 3%) [51,56], others rely on whole-genome sequencing [29], while
    one study used restriction fragment length polymorphism [27] and other pyrosequencing
    analyses [66]. Several studies performed gene sequencing (20 out of 58, 33%),
    with the 16s rRNA gene being the most frequently sequenced (11 out of 58, 19%)
    [21,22,23,26,27,28,44,53,57,64,67], followed by vanA PCR (2 out of 58, 3%) [49,65].
    Additionally, one study performed 16s rRNA, tetL, tetW, and E. coli gene sequencing
    [54], and one study sequenced tetracycline resistance genes [35]. Gas chromatographic
    and spectrophotometric methods were also used by some studies (5 out of 58, 9%)
    [33,34,35,70,72]. Regarding metabolite characterization, Limulus amebocyte assay
    was frequently used for endotoxin assessment (11 out of 58, 19%), while one study
    used ELISA assay for mycotoxin assessment [40]. On the other hand, chemical analysis
    of litter samples was performed by one study [62]. Furthermore, quantitative kinetic
    Glucatell assay was used for β-glucan assessment [31]. Additionally, some studies
    performed questionnaires [50,74] and spirometric measures from workers were performed
    [50,74] . According to the microbial assessment, several studies evidence the
    presence of bacteria (26 out of 58, 45%) [21,22,23,25,27,30,35,43,44,51,53,54,55,60,61,62,64,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,77]
    in facilities associated with poultry production. Fungal exposure was also evidenced
    by 14 studies (24%) [25,32,35,36,38,39,42,60,65,66,72,73,74,78]. Furthermore,
    microorganisms´ metabolites such as endotoxins were detected by eight studies
    (14%) [33,42,48,53,59,61,70,72], while endotoxins and β-glucans were evidenced
    by one study [31]. The only study that performed fungal and mycotoxin assessment
    found the carcinogenic mycotoxin AFB1 [40]. Overall, occupational exposure to
    microorganisms is a frequent concern reported by the selected studies (15 out
    of 58, 26%) [22,23,27,31,33,35,36,40,41,42,48,55,67,70,72]. Indeed, the risk of
    exposure to potential pathogenic bioaerosols originating in poultry facilities
    is emphasized in some studies (5 out of 58, 9%) [21,54,55,59,60]. 4. Discussion
    Industrialization has led to increased animal density in enclosed production buildings,
    resulting in high concentrations of viable and non-viable bacteria and fungi,
    as well as metabolites in bioaerosols [21]. The poultry industry has been found
    to pose a significant global health risk due to microbiological contamination
    [73]. Farm facilities housing multiple animals promote complex mixtures of microorganisms
    in bioaerosols, including dust-containing feathers, skin fragments, feces, feed
    particles, microorganisms, and chemicals [74]. Long shifts in manufacturing plants
    have become common, resulting in workers inhaling complex bioaerosols, which can
    pose several health hazards in agricultural environments [21]. This situation
    has prompted increased studies on occupational health. Bioaerosols from farms
    can also pose health risks to nearby residents [53,74], highlighting the importance
    of research on human health, environmental impact, and the One Health approach
    to address these concerns. Broilers and laying hens are susceptible to bacterial
    and viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, as indicated by several studies
    [38,51,62,70]. The transmission of pathogens can occur through inhalation, close
    contact with infected animals, feces, litter, or contaminated objects, and inadequate
    biosecurity controls can result in significant economic losses [74]. As international
    trade expands, food safety concerns regarding the rapid spread of foodborne pathogens
    through the global food chain are increasing [73]. Moreover, environmental health
    concerns arise from the utilization of animal by-products, such as poultry manure
    and litter, in agriculture. Repeated use of these by-products as manure can lead
    to the accumulation of contaminants in agricultural soils, potentially increasing
    their bioavailability and toxicity in the environment [74]. Air sampling has been
    widely used to characterize occupational exposure to fungi, but it is important
    to consider the appropriate sampling period and the influence of variables such
    as ventilation and building features. Passive sampling methods, such as settled
    dust assessment, have been shown to be more reliable for collecting contamination
    over a longer period of time. Broiler manure and animal bedding have been identified
    as the primary sources of indoor air microbial contamination in the poultry industry
    [76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83]. It is recommended to use a multiapproach sampling protocol
    for a more comprehensive understanding of microbial contamination. While culture-based
    methods have been primarily used for microbial characterization, culture-independent
    methods such as cloning approaches and quantitative real-time PCR have shown to
    be suitable for various bioaerosol measurements. Molecular tools, such as whole-genome
    sequencing, could provide more information on the biodiversity of microorganisms
    in these environments. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of considering
    various sampling methods and assays in the assessment of indoor microbial contamination
    in the poultry industry [60,61]. Studies on bioaerosols in poultry production
    are limited and identifying all organisms, both viable and non-culturable, is
    important for characterizing bioaerosols in these facilities [60]. Inhalation
    exposure to non-viable microorganism components such as endotoxins and mycotoxins
    may cause health hazards, so evaluating non-viable components may be useful for
    assessing pulmonary disease risk. Microbial assessment of poultry farms shows
    the presence of numerous microbes, including zoonotic pathogens, which can act
    as transport agents of airborne diseases [49,61]. Despite the growing threat of
    fungal infections to human health, there are fewer studies conducted on fungi
    (and also viruses) compared to bacteria, and this lack of attention and resources
    makes it challenging to determine the precise burden of fungal infections and
    to encourage policy and programmatic action [75]. Due to the extensive use of
    antibiotics in the livestock industry, these facilities are significant sources
    of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Therefore, multidrug-resistant bacterial
    pathogens may be transmitted through the inhalation of bioaerosols [55]. This
    explains the frequent screening for bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility by
    several studies [29,37,43,45,49,53,63,69,71,72,75,77]. Several potentially pathogenic
    bacteria have been identified [24,30,75,77]. The potential dispersal pattern and
    distance of airborne bacteria and ARGs from these animal sources remain unknown
    [53]. However, it is important to note that clinically significant multidrug-resistant
    bacteria Staphylococcus sp. [53,75], E. coli [29], Campylobacter jejuni [71],
    among others, belonging to the WHO priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant
    bacteria (2017), were isolated from poultry farms. Recently, the World Health
    Organization (WHO) published the first fungal priority pathogens list [79], listing
    19 groups of human fungal pathogens associated with a high risk of mortality or
    morbidity. This formal recognition by the WHO highlights an important group of
    infections, which has been perennially neglected in terms of the awareness and
    research funding needed [80]. Regarding fungal assessment, despite the low number
    of studies (14 out of 58, 24%), several fungi comprising the critical priority
    group of the WHO list (2022), namely, A. fumigatus, were frequent in indoor air
    samples [32,36,47], along with Candida albicans [32]. Regarding the high-priority
    group, Fusarium sp. [32,38,47], the order Mucorales [40,47], and Candida tropicalis
    [36] were also some of the ones reported. Concerning microbial components, endotoxin,
    a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, poses a serious
    health risk [34]. Endotoxins found in airborne organic dust have been linked to
    respiratory disease in both humans and animals [34]. Regarding mycotoxins, some
    of the literature already evidenced occupational exposure in animal production
    facilities [40]. In fact, fungal species recognized as mycotoxin producers were
    reported in some of the selected studies [32,36,42,78]. Even though only one of
    the selected studies performed mycotoxin assessment, the obtained results are
    enough to hypothesize that workers in these settings may be at a higher risk of
    Aspergillus mycotoxicosis. Indeed, elevated concentrations of A. flavus and A.
    versicolor were recovered through environmental sampling. Additionally, through
    human biomonitoring, analysis of mycotoxins and/or their metabolites in blood
    and urine evidence detectable levels of the carcinogenic mycotoxin AFB1 [40].
    Briefly, to mitigate and decrease such pollutants it is crucial to establish international
    standards for what constitutes good microbiological indicators from environmental
    samples, which could be used to guide risk reduction decisions and create effective
    incentives for people to follow such guidance, which have already been suggested
    [81]. Globally, temperature rises due to climate change have various impacts on
    ecosystems, human health, animal health, and food production, which also affect
    AMR [81]. The emergence of resistant fungal strains in occupational exposure scenarios
    has already been demonstrated [82,83]. Indeed, temperature increases may influence
    the susceptibility of pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and parasites) in chicken environments
    [84]. Thus, as in the case of bacteria, antifungal resistance should be addressed
    in further research [85,86]. Additionally, it is crucial to investigate the effects
    of heat stress on poultry production to formulate various effective mitigation
    strategies to reduce significant production losses [84]. The prevalent airborne
    microorganisms in animal production buildings are not well characterized in terms
    of quantity, composition, and risk group. Identification and quantification would
    be useful for determining the causative agents and performing risk assessments
    [27]. The poultry industry must be sustainable, and it needs to produce more with
    less, while benefiting all [87]. The sector must improve human, animal, and environmental
    health and welfare. Implementing a comprehensive and coordinated One Health approach
    that incorporates exposure assessment can help tackle threats to health and ecosystems
    [81], ensuring priority areas for action in order to mitigate microbial exposure,
    promoting a safe environment for workers and animals in poultry facilities, along
    with less environmental impact. Overall, these findings highlight the need for
    improved biosecurity measures and environmental management practices to ensure
    animal health, food safety, and environmental sustainability in the poultry industry.
    5. Conclusions This review allowed us to identify microbiological contamination
    reported in the poultry industry, sampling methods and assays already employed
    to assess occupational exposure to microbial contamination within different scopes
    (occupational health, food safety, and animal health), and knowledge gaps to be
    tackled in future studies. Poultry workers are exposed to several microbial contaminants
    in their workplace. Exposure to bacteria and fungi has been assessed and reported,
    as well as bacterial metabolites (namely endotoxins), β-glucans, and mycotoxins.
    Occupational exposure to microorganisms is a frequent concern, and the risk of
    exposure to potential pathogenic and resistant bioaerosols originating in poultry
    facilities is emphasized. Future research should aim to identify the main sources
    of contamination in this setting. A One Health approach is a vital framework and
    the use of effective risk assessment tools and strategies can help prevent occupational
    exposure and protect the health of workers, consumers, and animals. Supplementary

  description: Red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) causes significant economic losses
    in aquaculture. Here, we analyzed the pathogenicity, viral shedding, and transmission
    dynamics of RSIV in rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) by employing immersion
    infection and cohabitation challenge models. Rock bream challenged by immersion
    exposure exhibited 100% mortality within 35 days post RSIV exposure, indicating
    that the viral shedding in seawater peaked after mortality. At 25 °C, a positive
    correlation between the viral loads within infected rock bream and virus shedding
    into the seawater was observed. Specific RSIV lesions were observed in the spleen
    and kidney of the infected rock bream, and the viral load in the spleen had the
    highest correlation with the histopathological grade. A cohabitation challenge
    mimicking the natural transmission conditions was performed to assess the virus
    transmission and determine the pathogenicity and viral load. The RSIV-infected
    rock breams (donors) were cohabited with uninfected rock bream, red sea bream
    (Pagrus major), and flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) (recipients) at both
    25 °C and 15 °C. In the cohabitation challenge group maintained at 15 °C, no mortality
    was observed across all experimental groups. However, RSIV was detected in both
    seawater and the recipient fish. Our results provide preliminary data for further
    epidemiological analyses and aid in the development of preventive measures and
    management of RSIVD in aquaculture.

    Figures Versions Notes Simple Summary Red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) has been
    reported to be susceptible to various marine fish species in Asian countries such
    as South Korea, and it causes significant economic losses due to massive mortalities
    in rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) in particular. However, studies on the impact
    of the virus shed from RSIV-infected rock bream on other fish species are limited.
    Here, we investigated the dynamics of the virus by simulating the natural conditions
    of RSIV infection in rock bream and examining its release into seawater and the
    risk of horizontal transmission through cohabitation with other fish species.
    Our data demonstrated that the virus shed from RSIV-infected rock bream caused
    high mortality rates in surrounding fish species through horizontal transmission.
    Our findings suggest the potential for RSIV-infected rock bream in farms to spread
    the disease to neighboring farms. Additionally, our results demonstrated a high
    correlation between RSIV load and viral shedding ratio in rock breams, as well
    as between RSIV load and histopathological infection grades. Abstract Red sea
    bream iridovirus (RSIV) causes significant economic losses in aquaculture. Here,
    we analyzed the pathogenicity, viral shedding, and transmission dynamics of RSIV
    in rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) by employing immersion infection and cohabitation
    challenge models. Rock bream challenged by immersion exposure exhibited 100% mortality
    within 35 days post RSIV exposure, indicating that the viral shedding in seawater
    peaked after mortality. At 25 °C, a positive correlation between the viral loads
    within infected rock bream and virus shedding into the seawater was observed.
    Specific RSIV lesions were observed in the spleen and kidney of the infected rock
    bream, and the viral load in the spleen had the highest correlation with the histopathological

    was performed to assess the virus transmission and determine the pathogenicity

    at 15 °C, no mortality was observed across all experimental groups. However, RSIV
    was detected in both seawater and the recipient fish. Our results provide preliminary
    data for further epidemiological analyses and aid in the development of preventive
    measures and management of RSIVD in aquaculture. Keywords: Megalocytivirus; histopathological;
    viral shedding; viral kinetics; cohabitation challenge 1. Introduction Red sea
    bream iridovirus (RSIV), the causative agent of red sea bream iridoviral disease
    (RSIVD), inflicts significant economic losses on the aquaculture industry [1].
    Initially isolated from cultured red sea bream (Pagrus major) in Japan in 1990
    [2], RSIV was identified in rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) for the first time
    in South Korea in 1988 [3,4]. Since then, the virus has been frequently reported
    in several countries in East and Southeast Asia [5]. RSIV is a member of the Megalocytivirus
    genus of the family Iridoviridae and is reported to be highly pathogenic and infectious,
    with infections recorded primarily during the warm summer months [1,5]. The World
    Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) considers RSIVD a major threat to the health
    of aquatic animals and the aquaculture industry [1]. RSIV has a broad host range
    with over 30 species of fish known to be susceptible to infection [1,5]. Infected
    fishes typically exhibit blackening of the skin, anemia, splenomegaly, and abnormal
    swimming behavior. Histopathological examination reveals abnormally enlarged cells
    and necrotic lesions primarily in the spleen and kidneys [5,6,7]. RSIV-infected
    fishes have been shown to shed the virus into seawater, facilitating horizontal
    transmission through seawater, which is considered the primary route of RSIV spread
    [1,8]. The transmission of RSIV among fishes can occur through various routes,
    including waterborne transmission and direct contact with infected fish. Additionally,
    it was reported that the viral shed from RSIV-infected broodstock red sea bream
    caused a horizontal infection of juvenile red sea bream, as demonstrated by the
    presence of RSIV in seawater [9]. Through experimental infection under cohabiting
    conditions, Min et al. demonstrated that the horizontal transmission of RSIV can
    occur between rock bream and rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii) [10]. These findings
    suggest that the horizontal transmission of RSIV can occur between different fish
    species cohabiting in the same environment, highlighting the importance of studying
    the transmission dynamics of RSIV in multi-species aquaculture systems. Effective
    disease management strategies are critical to prevent the spread of RSIV and minimize
    the associated economic losses. With no effective therapeutic available, the early
    detection of pathogens and understanding viral transmission between hosts is essential
    for the effective control and prevention of disease spread. The risk of the horizontal
    transmission of RSIV highlights the importance of developing effective disease
    management strategies, which should include developing sensitive and reliable
    diagnostic tools for the early detection of RSIV and implementing appropriate
    biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction and spread of the virus in aquaculture
    farms. Furthermore, understanding the genetic diversity of the virus and the factors
    that contribute to differences in susceptibility among fish species can inform
    the development of more effective disease control strategies. Factors such as
    waterborne transmission, the release of infected fish into the surrounding seawater,
    and the differences in RSIV susceptibility among different fish species contribute
    to the spread of the virus. Therefore, the risk of horizontal transmission of
    RSIV among fish populations poses a significant threat to the aquaculture industry.
    Rock bream is known to be the most susceptible species to RSIV [1]. Out of the
    244 reported cases of RSIVD in South Korea from 2013 to 2022, rock bream was the
    most affected species (82.8%) with 202 cases, and mortality due to RSIV occurs
    in rock bream every year [11]. Even though only 10 cases of RSIV were reported
    in red sea bream with a relatively low mortality rate [11], RSIV shed from this
    species can also damage surrounding farmed fish [9]. Flathead grey mullet is a
    major aquaculture species, representing the third largest aquaculture production
    in South Korea. Iridovirus was detected in farmed flathead grey mullet in Singapore
    between 1999 and 2003, resulting in a mortality of 10–50% [12]. In South Korea,
    RSIV was detected in wild flathead grey mullet in 2005 [13], and in farmed flathead
    grey mullet in 2014, 2017, 2021, and 2022 [11]. Flathead grey mullet is mentioned
    by WOAH as a fish species susceptible to RSIV; however, there is insufficient
    information or research on the pathogenicity of RSIV and its potential for experimental
    horizontal transmission to this species. This study aimed to understand the horizontal
    transmission of RSIV among different fish species via sea water following viral
    shedding from infected rock bream. We also aimed to study the transmission dynamics
    and histopathological correlates of infection employing immersion infection in
    rock bream. Histopathological scoring and infection grade criteria were defined
    for RSIV-infected rock bream, red sea bream, and flathead grey mullet, based on
    infection kinetics. These findings provide novel insights into the risk of RSIV-infected
    rock bream and can help establish measures to control RSIVD in fish farms. 2.
    Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Fish Rock bream (total length: 10.4 ±
    2.7 cm; weight: 22.7 ± 7.3 g), red sea bream (total length: 9.7 ± 0.5 cm; weight:
    13.7 ± 1.7 g), and flathead grey mullet (total length: 10.2 ± 0.9 cm; weight:
    9.2 ± 2.7 g) were obtained from hatcheries located in Geoje and Namhae, Gyeongsangnam-do,
    South Korea, where RSIVD had not been reported. The fish were then acclimated
    in a 1600 L tank for 2 weeks. During the acclimatization period, individual tanks
    (1600 L) were used for each fish species, and a flow-through aquaculture system
    (500–1000 L/h) was employed. The system continuously supplied sand-filtered seawater
    passed through a 50 μm filter and treated with UV irradiation (UV-treated >30
    mW/cm2). The water temperature was maintained at 25 ± 2 °C, and commercial feed
    was provided twice daily. Prior to experimentation, 15 fish from each species
    were randomly selected and tested for RSIV using PCR analysis, as described in
    the Aquatic Animal Diagnostic Test Manual for WOAH and qPCR [1,14]. Subsequent
    studies were conducted after confirming that the fish were not infected with the
    virus. 2.2. Virus The RSIV strain used in this study was from a previous study
    [8]. To generate the crude stock of the virus, the spleen tissue of the rock bream
    infected with RSIV was homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min at
    4 °C. The virus supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter and
    inoculated onto Pagrus major fin (PMF) cells (National Fishery Products Quality
    Management Service, Busan, South Korea), as described in a previous study [15],
    and then incubated for 7 days after RSIV inoculation. The cell culture supernatant
    was harvested and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and used as an inoculum for
    RSIV. The RSIV copy number was determined using a quantitative polymerase chain
    reaction (qPCR), as described in Section 2.3. 2.3. qPCR and Virus Concentration
    in Seawater Genomic DNA was extracted from fish tissues (25−50 mg) and blood (100
    μL) using an AccuPrep® genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer, Daejeon, Republic
    of Korea), as per the manufacturer’s manual. The extracted DNA was measured for
    RSIV copy number using a previously reported qPCR assay protocol [8,14]. All qPCR
    assays were performed using a Dice® Real Time System III (Takara, Kusatsu, Japan).
    The RSIV concentration in seawater was determined using the flocculation method
    using iron chloride, as previously reported [8,16]. A total of 500 mL of seawater
    was collected from a fish tank and passed through a 1.6 μm pore size glass microfiber
    filter (GF/A; Whatman, Maidstone, UK), followed by a 0.45 μm pore MF-Millipore™
    membrane filter (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). To form Fe-RSIV flocculates using
    iron chloride, 4.83 g of iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3∙6H2O) was dissolved
    in 100 mL of distilled water. Subsequently, 50 μL of the iron chloride solution
    was added to the 500 mL seawater, and the seawater containing the iron chloride
    solution was gently stirred at 200 rpm for 1 h at room temperature using a magnetic
    stirrer. The Fe-RSIV flocculates were then filtered under reduced pressure through
    a 0.8 μm pore size polycarbonate filter (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) fixed to a filter
    holder with a receiver (Nalgene, New York, NY, USA). The viruses collected on
    the 0.8 μm pore size polycarbonate filters were then transferred to 2 mL tubes
    and stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction. Filtered virus flocculates were extracted
    directly from the filter using the AccuPrep® Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer,
    Daejeon, Republic of Korea) in the same manner as previously reported [8]. The
    viral shedding ratio (RSIV copies/L/g) of RSIV-exposed fish was determined by
    dividing the average number of viral genome copies in seawater by the average
    weight of surviving fish in the tank. Seawater for the analysis of the viral shedding
    ratio was collected from the tanks where mortality occurred. 2.4. Histopathological
    Scoring and Grading of RSIV Infection Histopathological analysis was performed
    on the harvested organs (brain, eye, gills, heart, kidney, liver, skin, and spleen)
    to score and grade RSIV infection. Each sample was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
    formalin for 24 h and then refixed in the same solution for another 24 h before
    gradually being dehydrated with an ethanol series (70–100%). The samples were
    further cleared with xylene, embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 4 μm slices.
    Finally, the sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) following general
    protocols. RSIV infection scoring was classified into four stages: (1) less, (2)
    mild, (3) moderate, and (4) severe. Each stage was scored blindly by a fish pathologist
    for renal and splenic lesions, both necrotic lesions and enlarged cells. Necrotic
    lesions in kidneys were scored according to the following criteria: score 1 (less)
    if localized and present in less than 5% of the renal tubule; score 2 (mild) if
    present locally, but sporadically present in 5% or more of the renal tubules;
    score 3 (moderate) if present in parenchymal tissues and glomeruli in addition
    to renal tubules; score 4 (severe) when there was tubule necrosis due to necrotic
    lesions and atrophy due to parenchymal tissue and glomerular necrosis. Necrotic
    lesions of the spleen were scored based on the following criteria: focal lesions
    involving a small number of cells were scored as 1 (less); score 2 (mild) was
    given when many cells undergoing necrosis were identified; score 3 (moderate)
    was given if necrosis had already progressed and cell exudate and inflammatory
    cell infiltration had occurred; score 4 (severe) was given if necrosis had already
    progressed and parenchymal tissue atrophied due to necrosis. The scoring of enlarged
    cells in the kidney was based on the following criteria: score 1 (less) if present
    locally in renal tubules and parenchymal tissues, score 2 (mild) when a small
    number of cells were present in renal tubules, parenchymal tissues, and glomeruli,
    score 3 (moderate) when 30% or more of the cells in one or more of the renal tubules,
    parenchymal tissues, and glomeruli were replaced by enlarged cells, and score
    4 (severe) when more than 50% of the cells were replaced. Enlarged cells in the
    spleen were scored from 1 to 4 based on their frequency in the parenchymal tissue.
    The scoring standards are described in Figure S1. Grading of the RSIV-infected
    samples was performed following the scoring stage and was assigned by weighting
    according to lesion severity. Enlarged cells representing general lesions of RSIV
    infection were designed to account for 70% of grading, and RSIV-induced necrotic
    lesions, which had a lower correlation with viral load, were designed to account
    for 30% of grading. Changes in other organs were recorded but not graded because
    of their insignificant correlation. The grading scale was as follows: Grade 0
    (G0) was less than or equal to 0.2; grade 1 (G1) was greater than 0.2 and less
    than or equal to 0.8; grade 2 (G2) was greater than 0.8 and less than or equal
    to 1.5; grade 3 (G3) was greater than 1.5 and less than or equal to 2.0; grade
    4 (G4) was greater than 2.0. 2.5. Experimental Immersion Infection of Rock Bream
    The immersion infection experiment was conducted on rock bream to confirm the
    pathogenicity of RSIV under natural mimetic conditions. Prior to infection, each
    group of fish (n = 30) was acclimatized for two weeks in a 50 L water tank maintained
    at 25 °C and 15 °C. The RSIV titer in seawater was maintained at very high (107
    RSIV copies/mL), high (105 RSIV copies/mL), medium (103 RSIV copies/mL), and low
    (101 RSIV copies/mL) doses during the 2 h 30 min immersion following virus dispensing
    in the rock bream tank. In this study, the RSIV challenge experiments were conducted
    in 16 tanks at each water temperature (25 °C or 15 °C). Eight tanks (four at 25
    °C and four at 15 °C) were used to determine the cumulative mortality, and the
    other eight tanks (four at 25 °C and four at 15 °C) were used for time-point sampling.
    After immersion exposure, 100% of the seawater in all groups was replaced with
    fresh seawater. The control group (n = 30) received no treatment. Half (50%) of
    the rearing seawater for each group was replaced daily with seawater treated by
    sand filtration, 1 μm housing filter, and UV (>30 mW/cm2). Mortality in each group
    was recorded for 40 days, and viral loads were analyzed by sampling various tissues
    (the spleen, gills, kidneys, heart, stomach, eyes, liver, intestine, brain, skin,
    and muscle) of the dead fish. To investigate the dynamics of RSIV in virus-exposed
    rock bream, three fish were collected at 3, 5, 7, 10, 14-, 21-, 30-, and 40 days
    post-exposure (dpe), and whole blood, eyes, gills, skin, livers, spleens, kidneys,
    hearts, and brains were collected. To measure RSIV shedding from infected fish
    into the rearing seawater, 500 mL (n = 3) of seawater was collected from a fish
    tank where mortality was observed, concentrated through iron flocculation, and
    quantitatively analyzed. For histopathological observation, tissues (n = 3), excluding
    whole blood, collected at 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, and 40 days after RSIV immersion
    exposure in rock bream were fixed in 10% neutral formalin and analyzed as described
    in Section 2.4. 2.6. Interspecies Cohabitation Challenge To investigate the horizontal
    transmission of RSIV from infected donor rock bream to naive recipient fish (rock
    bream, red sea bream, and flathead grey mullet), a cohabitation challenge was
    introduced. The donor fish groups (n = 30 in each group) were injected intraperitoneally
    (IP) with RSIV (106 RSIV copies/fish), and naive rock bream, red sea bream, and
    flathead grey mullet (recipient groups, n = 30 in each group) were cohabited with
    the donor fish. In this study, the RSIV cohabitation challenge was conducted in
    12 tanks at each water temperature (25 °C or 15 °C). Six tanks (one for each cohabitation
    group at 25 °C and 15 °C) were used to determine the cumulative mortality, and
    the other six tanks (one for each cohabitation group at 25 °C and 15 °C) were
    used for time-point sampling. In the cohabitation challenge experiment, donor
    and recipient fish were separated using cages with a mesh size that allowed for
    smooth water flow within the tank. To prevent the horizontal transmission of the
    virus shed through the fish abdomen, the donor fish’s body surface was washed
    with flowing seawater after virus injection, and 100% of the rearing seawater
    was replaced 6 h later before introducing the recipient fish. The negative control
    group consisted of rock bream (n = 30 in each group) injected with L-15 medium
    and naive fish (n = 30) cohabited. All groups of fish (donors and recipients)
    were maintained in 100 L tanks at 25 °C and 15 °C, and 50% of the rearing seawater
    was replaced daily, as previously described. The spleens and kidneys of fish (donors
    and recipients, n = 3 in each group) were sampled 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30,
    and 40 days after cohabitation exposure to determine the RSIV load in the fish.
    To investigate the load of RSIV shed from fish, 500 mL of rearing seawater (n
    = 3 in each group) was collected, concentrated, and then the virus was quantitatively
    analyzed. For histopathological observation, the spleen and kidney tissues (n
    = 3) collected at 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, and 40 days after RSIV IP injection
    in the fish (donors and recipients, n = 3 in each group) were fixed in 10% neutral
    formalin and analyzed as described in Section 2.4. All experimental protocols
    were performed following the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
    Committee of Gyeongsang National University (approval numbers: GNU-220526-E0056,
    GNU-220526-E0057, and GNU-220526-E0058). 2.7. Statistical Analysis Statistical
    analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9.5. An ordinary one-way analysis
    of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s correction was performed for multiple group
    comparisons. Within each group, significant differences were compared to controls
    when the virus was initially detected. Pearson correlation coefficients were utilized
    to analyze the correlation between the viral shedding ratio in seawater and viral
    load, as well as the correlation between histopathological infection grade and
    viral load. Statistical significance was denoted by the following convention:
    * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001. 3. Results 3.1. Pathogenicity
    Assessment of RSIV Immersion Infection After the immersion exposure of the rock
    bream with 107, 105, 103, and 101 RSIV copies/mL at 25 °C, 100% cumulative mortality
    was observed at 20, 31, 33, and 35 dpe, respectively (Figure 1A). At 15 °C, no
    mortality was observed in any immersion exposure groups nor in the negative controls
    (Figure 1A). The distribution of RSIV in the tissues of the fish that died (n
    = 8) following immersion exposure at 25 °C showed the highest viral load in the
    spleen (109.4 RSIV copies/mg), which was significantly higher than the lowest
    viral load observed in the muscle (107.8 RSIV copies/mg) (**** p < 0.0001) (Figure
    1B). Figure 1. (A) The cumulative mortality of rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus),
    following immersion exposure with red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) at 25 °C and
    15 °C using four different viral concentrations (107, 105, 103, and 101 RSIV copies/mL).
    The control group was not subjected to any treatment. (B) RSIV tissue distribution
    in rock bream that died due to RSIV is also shown. The mean viral copy numbers
    (n = 8) are represented by bars, and asterisks are used to indicate significant
    differences (* p < 0.05; **** p < 0.0001) compared to the muscle. 3.2. Viral Load
    Kinetics in Rock Bream and Viral Shedding Ratio In the immersion-exposed groups
    with 107, 105, 103, and 101 RSIV copies/mL at 25 °C, the viral loads in all tissues
    of rock bream tended to be relatively low (<104 RSIV copies/mg) up to 10 dpe (Figure
    2). After 14 dpe, the viral load rapidly increased in all tissues, with the highest
    viral load observed in the spleen and kidney, the major target tissues of RSIV.
    The group exposed to 107 RSIV copies/mL tended to have a faster virus replication
    than other exposure concentrations. The spleen consistently had the highest viral
    loads at all time points sampled. RSIV was detected in seawater from 3 dpe at
    all concentrations of immersion exposure at 25 °C, and the amount of virus shed
    into seawater increased as the viral load in the fish increased. During the period
    of active fish mortality (12−35 dpe), the viral shedding ratio in seawater was
    approximately 104−107 RSIV copies/L/g (Figure 2). Figure 2. Viral load in various
    tissues (blood, eye, gill, skin, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and brain) and
    RSIV shedding ratio in seawater after red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) immersion
    exposure in rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) at 25 °C and 15 °C at four concentrations
    (final concentrations: 107, 105, 103, and 101 RSIV copies/mL). The RSIV shedding
    ratio (RSIV copies/L/g) was determined based on the total weight (g) of the fish
    remaining in the tank and the number of viral copies detected in the rearing seawater.
    Copy number determination of RSIV was analyzed in three fish and seawater per
    sampling interval. Significant differences were determined using a one-way ANOVA
    with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001;
    **** p < 0.0001). In the RSIV immersion exposure group maintained at 15 °C, no
    significant differences in viral load were observed with regard to the titer of
    the RSIV inoculum. The virus was detected in fish until the end of the experiment,
    and all tissues exhibited low viral loads (<105 RSIV copies/mg) until the endpoint
    (Figure 2). RSIV was detected in seawater at 3 dpe in the groups exposed with
    107 and 105 RSIV copies/mL at 15 °C, and at 5 dpe in the immersion-exposed group
    with 103 and 101 RSIV copies/mL. The highest viral load in seawater was observed
    at 30 dpe at all concentrations of RSIV immersion exposure, which was significantly
    different from the first detection time point (* p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001, ****
    p < 0.0001). Viral shedding in seawater was observed up to 40 dpe, and approximately
    101.5 RSIV copies/L/g were shed, but no mortality was observed (Figure 2). 3.3.
    Correlation between Viral Load in Various Tissues and RSIV Shedding Ratio A correlation
    analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between the viral load
    in various tissues and RSIV shedding ratios in rock bream following immersion
    exposure at 25 °C. Strong positive correlations were observed in all nine tissues
    examined, including the spleen, with the highest correlations found in the heart
    and kidneys (Pearson’s r > 0.90, **** p < 0.0001) (Figure 3A). The correlation
    between viral load and viral shedding ratio in the nine tissues of rock bream
    following immersion exposure at 15 °C was relatively low (Figure 3B). Despite
    the low RSIV load in fish, the virus was detected in the seawater. Figure 3. A
    correlation analysis was performed to examine the association between the viral
    load in nine different tissues (spleen, kidney, heart, gills, eyes, liver, skin,
    brain, and blood) and the red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) shedding ratio in seawater
    after immersion exposure of rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) with RSIV at (A)
    25 °C and (B) 15 °C. The plot depicts the average viral load (n = 3) and viral
    shedding ratio (n = 3) in the collected fish and seawater at the same sampling
    time. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine significant differences
    (* p < 0.05; **** p < 0.0001). 3.4. Analysis of Histopathological Grade of RSIV
    Infection The presence of histopathological lesions was confirmed by extracting
    the liver, skin, brain, eyes, spleen, kidney, heart, and gill tissue of RSIV immersion-exposed
    rock bream at 25 °C and 15 °C. Each tissue showed specific symptoms, but no significant
    differences were found for each RSIV immersion exposure concentration except for
    spleen and kidney (Figure S1). A significant difference in the severity of RSIV-induced
    necrotizing lesions and enlarged cell lesions with respect to the concentrations
    of the inoculum was confirmed in the spleen and kidney. The viral load and histopathological
    infection grade were compared following RSIV immersion exposure of rock bream
    at 25 °C (Figure 4A,B). Changes in histopathological grades of infection were
    observed in the spleen among the eight tissues. A G3 lesion was observed in the
    spleen of a rock bream exposed with 107 RSIV copies/mL at 7 dpe, with a viral
    load of 107.6 RSIV copies/mg. G4 lesions were observed after 10 dpe, and the viral
    load was higher than 109 RSIV copies/mg. In rock bream exposed to 105, 103, and
    101 RSIV copies/mL, G1–G3 lesions were observed in the spleen at 10–21 dpe, and
    the viral load was lower than 107 RSIV copies/mg at this time. In conclusion,
    the infection grade in the spleen increased faster with higher RSIV immersion
    exposure concentration, and G3–G4 level lesions were confirmed at the time of
    fish death. The correlation between viral load and histopathological lesions was
    low in the kidney, the main target tissue of RSIV. Although the rock bream immersion
    exposed with 107 RSIV copies/mL had a high intrarenal viral load of 108.9 RSIV
    copies/mg in the kidney at 14 dpe, the histopathological infection grade was lower
    than G2. Figure 4. (A) Viral load and (B) histopathological grade results after
    immersion exposure with red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) at four concentrations
    (final concentrations 107, 105, 103, and 101 RSIV copies/mL) in rock bream (Oplegnathus
    fasciatus) at 25 °C. The box represents the average of three fish, and an analysis
    was not performed because all fish died due to RSIV infection, as seen in the
    gray box (A,B). In the RSIV immersion exposure group at 15 °C, lesions lower than
    G2 were observed at all exposure concentrations, and RSIVD-specific histopathological
    lesions were observed only in the spleen and kidney (Figure 5A,B). Figure 5. (A)
    Viral load and (B) histopathological grade results after immersion exposure with
    red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) at four concentrations (final concentrations:
    107, 105, 103, and 101 RSIV copies/mL) in rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) at
    15 °C. The box represents the average of three fish. (A) Gray boxes show no RSIV
    detected in fish and seawater. 3.5. Correlation between Viral Load and Histopathological
    Infection Grade Histopathological lesions specific to RSIVD were observed in all
    tissues, except for the brain and skin. However, due to the low abundance of histopathological
    lesions and their insignificant correlation with the viral load, the eyes, gills,
    liver, and heart were excluded from further analysis. Correlation analysis between
    viral load and infection grade was performed on selected samples in which RSIV
    was detected by qPCR from the spleen (25 °C group, n = 57; 15 °C group, n = 72)
    and kidneys (25 °C group, n = 57; 15 °C group, n = 72) of rock bream immersion
    exposed at 25 °C and 15 °C. In the group challenged with RSIV at 25 °C, significant
    correlations were found between viral load and histopathological infection grade
    in the spleen and kidney, the major target tissues of RSIV (spleen: Pearson’s
    r = 0.8567, **** p < 0.0001; kidney: Pearson’s r = 0.3572, ** p = 0.0064) (Figure
    6A,B). On the other hand, in the group challenged with RSIV at 15 °C, no significant
    correlation was observed between the viral load and histopathological infection
    grades (Figure 6C,D). Histopathological infection grade (G3–G4) was exclusively
    observed in the spleen (Figure 6A). Figure 6. Correlation analysis between the
    RSIV viral load and histopathological infection grade in the spleen and kidney
    of rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) infected by RSIV immersion at (A,B) 25 °C
    and (C,D) 15 °C. Statistical significance was determined using Pearson correlation
    coefficients (** p < 0.01; **** p < 0.0001). 3.6. Evaluation of Risk Associated
    with RSIV Cohabitation Challenge 3.6.1. Interspecies Mortality An interspecies
    cohabitation challenge was introduced to assess the risk of the horizontal transmission
    of RSIV from infected rock bream to uninfected rock bream other and susceptible
    species. Mortality was assessed following cohabitation challenges between rock
    bream (donor) and recipient fish species, including rock bream, red sea bream,
    and flathead grey mullet. At 25 °C, rock bream (donor) exhibited 100% cumulative
    mortality at 16 dpe, while rock bream (recipient) had 100% cumulative mortality
    at 27 dpe (Figure 7A). Cumulative mortalities following the cohabitation challenge
    between rock bream (donor) and red sea bream (recipient) were 100% at 16 dpe and
    22 dpe, respectively (Figure 7B). The cumulative mortalities after the cohabitation
    challenge between rock bream (donor) and flathead grey mullet (recipient) were
    100% at 15 dpe and 31 dpe, respectively, which were slower than those observed
    in the challenges with rock bream and red sea bream (recipient) (Figure 7C). No
    deaths were observed in any groups challenged with cohabitation at 15 °C, or in
    the control groups at 25 °C and 15 °C (Figure 7A–C). Figure 7. (A–C) Cumulative
    mortality after cohabitation challenges was evaluated in naïve rock bream (Oplegnathus
    fasciatus), red sea bream (Pagrus major), and flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus)
    recipients with donors of rock bream that were intraperitoneally (IP) injected
    with red sea bream iridovirus (106 RSIV copies/fish) at 25 °C. The control group
    of donors was IP injected with 100 µL of L-15 medium (virus-free), and the recipients
    were not treated in any way. No mortality was observed at 15 °C. 3.6.2. RSIV Dynamics
    in Fish and Rearing Seawater At 25 °C, rock bream (donors) were IP injected with
    RSIV (106 RSIV copies/fish) and subsequently cohabitated with a naïve rock bream
    (recipients) (Figure 8A). The RSIV-exposed rock bream (donors) exhibited an increasing
    virus load over time, with the highest viral loads of 109.5 and 109.4 RSIV copies/mg
    observed in the spleen and kidney, respectively, at 14 dpe. The virus was detected
    in the rock bream (recipients) spleen and kidney at 3 dpe, with the highest viral
    loads of 107.6 and 106.8 RSIV copies/mg, respectively, observed on 21 dpe. The
    presence of RSIV in the seawater was detected from 3 dpe, and the shedding ratio
    of RSIV in seawater significantly increased during the period of observed fish
    mortality, which occurred between 10 and 14 dpe. At 14 dpe, the highest seawater
    viral load was 106.3 RSIV copies/L/g, and a significant difference was observed
    compared to the first detection time of 3 dpe (**** p < 0.0001). After the complete
    mortality of the donor rock bream at 21 dpe, the amount of RSIV in seawater decreased
    to 105.1 RSIV copies/L/g. Figure 8. (A–F) The viral kinetics were evaluated after
    cohabitation challenges involving naïve rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus), red
    sea bream (Pagrus major), and flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) (recipient,
    R) post red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) intraperitoneal injection (106 RSIV copies/fish)
    in rock bream (donor, D) at 25 °C and 15 °C. The viral load in fish was measured
    in the spleen (S) and kidney (K), and the virus shed from the fish into the rearing
    seawater was expressed as RSIV shedding ratio (SW). The RSIV shedding ratio (viral
    genome copies L/g) was determined based on the total weight (g) of the fish remaining
    in the tank and the number of viral copies detected in the rearing seawater. Copy
    number determination of RSIV was analyzed in three fish and seawater per sampling
    interval. Significant differences were determined using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
    multiple comparisons test (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001).
    At 25 °C, rock bream (donors) were IP injected with RSIV (106 RSIV copies/fish)
    and subsequently cohabitated with naïve red sea bream (recipients) (Figure 8B).
    The RSIV-exposed rock bream (donors) had the highest viral load in the spleen
    and kidney at 10 dpe, with 109.3 and 108.4 RSIV copies/mg, respectively. After
    cohabitation with the rock bream, the RSIV was detected in the recipient red sea
    bream from 5 dpe, with a sharp increase in the viral load observed in the spleen
    and kidney after 14 dpe. At 21 dpe, the highest viral load was observed in the
    spleen and kidney, with 108.8 and 106.8 RSIV copies/mg, respectively. The virus
    in seawater had the highest shedding ratio of 105.9 RSIV copies/L/g at 14 dpe
    when rock bream (donors) mortality was active, and a significant difference was
    observed compared to 3 dpe, the first detection period (**** p < 0.0001). At 25
    °C, rock bream (donors) were IP injected with RSIV (106 RSIV copies/fish), and
    subsequently cohabitated with naïve flathead grey mullet (recipients) (Figure
    8C). The RSIV-exposed rock bream (donors) showed the highest viral load in the
    spleen and kidney at 10 dpe, with 109.3 and 109.2 RSIV copies/mg, respectively.
    After cohabitation with the rock bream, RSIV was first detected in the flathead
    grey mullet (recipients) at 3 dpe, and the highest viral load was observed in
    the spleen at 21 dpe, with 105.6 RSIV copies/mg. The highest viral load was observed
    in the kidney, with 105.1 RSIV copies/mg at 14 dpe. Subsequently, at 30 dpe, the
    viral load in the spleen and kidney decreased to 103.1 and 102.4 RSIV copies/mg,
    respectively. The highest amount of RSIV in seawater was detected at 14 dpe, with
    106.1 RSIV copies/L/g, showing a significant difference from 3 dpe (**** p < 0.0001).
    After that, the amount of RSIV in seawater decreased to a range of 102.1–103.1
    RSIV copies/L/g after 21 dpe, when all rock bream (donors) had died. During this
    period, between 21 dpe and 30 dpe, the mortality of flathead grey mullet (recipients)
    was active, but the amount of virus in seawater was low. At 15 °C, rock bream
    (donors) were IP injected with RSIV (106 RSIV copies/fish) and subsequently cohabitated
    with naïve rock bream (recipients) (Figure 8D). In the spleen and kidney of the
    RSIV-exposed rock bream (donors), the virus load remained below 104 RSIV copies/mg
    during 1–10 dpe. After that, the virus load increased rapidly, and at 21 dpe,
    the highest virus loads of 106 and 104.5 RSIV copies/mg were observed in the spleen
    and kidney, respectively. At 40 dpe, a decrease in viral load was observed in
    the spleen and kidney, with 103 and 102.4 RSIV copies/mg detected, respectively.
    The RSIV was first detected in the spleen and kidney of the rock bream (recipients)
    at 5 dpe after cohabitation with the RSIV-exposed rock bream (donors). The viral
    load remained below 105 RSIV copies/mg throughout the entire duration of the experiment.
    The RSIV was first detected in the seawater at 5 dpe, and the highest shedding
    ratio of the virus was observed at 7 dpe, with a level of 103.3 RSIV copies/L/g.
    Subsequently, the amount of virus in seawater steadily decreased, and on 40 dpe,
    it was detected at a level of 102.2 RSIV copies/L/g. At 15 °C, rock bream (donors)
    were IP injected with RSIV (106 RSIV copies/fish) and subsequently cohabitated
    with naïve red sea bream (recipients) (Figure 8E). In the RSIV-exposed rock bream,
    the viral load in the spleen and kidney was maintained at a level of 104 RSIV
    copies/mg during 1–10 dpe and subsequently increased to 106.3 and 104.9 RSIV copies/mg,
    respectively, at 21 dpe. At 40 dpe, the viral load had decreased to a level below
    102 RSIV copies/mg. The RSIV signal started appearing in the spleen and kidney
    of the red sea bream (recipients) at 5 dpe following cohabitation with the exposed
    rock bream (donors). The highest viral loads of 103.7 and 103.2 RSIV copies/mg
    were observed in the spleen and kidney, respectively, at 21 dpe, which then decreased
    to 101.9 and 102.7 RSIV copies/mg at 40 dpe. In seawater, RSIV was first detected
    at 5 dpe and was maintained at a level lower than 102 RSIV copies/L/g until the
    end of the experiment. At 15 °C, rock bream (donors) were IP injected with RSIV
    (106 RSIV copies/fish) and subsequently cohabitated with naïve flathead grey mullet
    (recipients) (Figure 8F). The viral loads in the spleen and kidney of the RSIV-exposed
    rock bream were maintained at 104 RSIV copies/mg during 1–10 dpe, followed by
    a sharp increase after 14 dpe. At 21 dpe, the spleen and kidney showed the highest
    viral load, with 105.8 and 104.8 RSIV copies/mg, respectively. A significant difference
    in the viral load was observed in the spleen compared to 1 dpe (**** p < 0.0001).
    The RSIV was first detected in the flathead grey mullet (recipients) at 3 dpe
    following cohabitation with an RSIV-exposed rock bream (donors), with the highest
    viral loads of 104.2 and 103.6 RSIV copies/mg detected in the spleen and kidney,
    respectively, at 14 dpe. There was no detection of RSIV after 30 dpe. The presence
    of RSIV was first observed in seawater at 3 dpe, with the highest amount of the
    virus, 102.3 RSIV copies/L/g, confirmed at 10 dpe. No RSIV was detected in seawater
    after 21 dpe. 3.6.3. Histopathological Infection Grade In the cohabitation challenge
    between rock bream (donors) and rock bream (recipients) at 25 °C (Figure 9A),
    G1 and G0 lesions were observed in the donor spleen and kidney, respectively,
    at 3 dpe. At 5 dpe, G4 lesions were observed in the spleen with a high viral load
    of 107.1 RSIV copies/mg. G4 lesions were observed in the kidney from 10 dpe, with
    a very high viral load of 108.4 RSIV copies/mg. In the rock bream (recipients),
    lesions lower than G2 were observed in the spleen and kidney from 3 to 14 dpe,
    and the viral load was lower than 106 RSIV copies/mg. At 21 dpe, when a viral
    load of approximately 107 RSIV copies/mg was observed, G2 and G1 lesions were
    observed in the spleen and kidney. As a result of the cohabitation challenge between
    rock bream (donors) and red sea bream (recipients) at 25 °C (Figure 9B), G3 lesions
    were observed in the spleen and kidney of rock bream (donors) at 5–7 dpe, when
    a high viral load was observed. Subsequently, at 10–14 dpe, when rock bream mortality
    was actively occurring, approximately G4 lesions were observed in the spleen and
    kidney. In the red sea bream (recipients), lesions lower than G2 were observed
    from 3 to 14 dpe, and the viral load in the spleen and kidney was lower than 105
    RSIV copies/mg. Thereafter, when the viral load of 108.8 RSIV copies/mg was detected
    in the spleen, G4 lesions were observed. In the cohabitation challenge between
    rock bream (donors) and flathead grey mullet (recipients) at 25 °C (Figure 9C),
    G1 lesions were observed in the spleen and kidney of rock bream (donors) for 3–5
    dpe. Subsequently, G3–G4 lesions were observed when the viral load reached approximately
    108 RSIV copies/mg. In flathead grey mullet (recipients), lesions of G1–G2 were
    observed from 3 to 21 dpe, and the viral load was lower than 105 RSIV copies/mg.
    Figure 9. (A–F) Histopathological grade was evaluated following cohabitation challenges
    involving naïve rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus), red sea bream (Pagrus major),
    and flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) (recipient, R) after intraperitoneal
    injection of red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) into rock bream (donor, D) at 25
    °C and 15 °C. The box indicates the average histopathological grade of the spleen
    (S) and kidney (K) collected from three fish. The gray box indicates that analysis
    could not be performed because all fish died due to RSIV infection. In the cohabitation
    challenge between rock bream (donors) and rock bream (recipients) at 15 °C (Figure
    9D), G1–G2 lesions were observed in the spleen and kidney of rock bream (donors)
    from 3 to 10 dpe, respectively. At 14 dpe, G3 lesions were observed in the spleen
    with a high viral load of 104.7 RSIV copies/mg. In the rock bream (recipients),
    lesions lower than G2 were observed in the spleen and kidney from 3 to 40 dpe,
    and the viral load was lower than 104 RSIV copies/mg. As a result of the cohabitation
    challenge between rock bream (donors) and red sea bream (recipients) at 15 °C
    (Figure 9E), G2 lesions were observed in the spleen of rock bream (donors) from
    3 to 14 dpe. Subsequently, at 21 dpe, G3 lesions were observed in the spleen with
    a viral load of 106.3 RSIV copies/mg. In the red sea bream (recipients), lesions
    lower than G1–G2 were observed from 5 to 40 dpe, and the viral loads in the spleen
    and kidneys were lower than 104 RSIV copies/mg. In the cohabitation challenge
    between rock bream (donors) and flathead grey mullet (recipients) at 15 °C (Figure
    9F), G0–G1 lesions were observed in the spleen and kidney of rock bream (donors)
    from 3 to 10 dpe. G3 lesions were observed in the spleen and kidney at 14–21 dpe,
    with a viral load ranging from 104.4 to 105.8 RSIV copies/mg. Subsequently, the
    viral load decreased, and the histopathological infection grade decreased to G0–G2
    lesions. In the flathead grey mullet (recipients), G1–G2 lesions were observed
    from 5 to 10 dpe, and the viral load was lower than 103 RSIV copies/mg. At 14
    dpe, G3 lesions were observed in the spleen with a viral load of 104.2 RSIV copies/mg.
    After 30 dpe, no viral load was detected in the body, and no RSIV infection lesions
    were observed in the spleen and kidney. 4. Discussion Intraperitoneal injection
    is generally preferred in RSIV challenge experiments owing to its high rate of
    infection and the lower amount of virus required. However, this route of infection
    is considered unnatural because the virus bypasses the host’s mucosal immune barrier,
    which serves as the first line of defense [17,18]. In contrast, the immersion
    challenge represents a more natural route of infection and is, therefore, a viable
    alternative for studying virus entry and the temporal progression of the disease.
    Although cohabitation studies offer a model that is highly similar to natural
    infection [19,20], it can be difficult to determine the exact infection dose and
    time. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the pathogenicity
    of RSIV in rock bream using an immersion challenge that mimics natural infection
    in fish farms. To analyze the dynamics of RSIV infection, viral shedding, and
    histopathological lesions in rock bream, challenge experiments were conducted
    at varying concentrations of the inoculum and distinct water temperatures. Additionally,
    a cohabitation challenge model was used to assess the risk of the horizontal transmission
    of RSIV. Rock bream exposed with 107, 105, 103, and 101 RSIV copies/mL by immersion
    at 25 °C exhibited 100% cumulative mortality during the experimental period. In
    a previous study, Pacific Bluefin tuna exhibited a cumulative mortality rate of
    44.9% at 22 dpe when challenged with 6.0 × 106 RSIV copies/L via immersion at
    25 °C [21]. However, no mortality was observed in greater amberjack when challenged
    with a higher exposure concentration of 3.2 × 107 RSIV copies/L via immersion.
    To induce mortality in greater amberjack via immersion, a higher concentration
    (3.2 × 109 RSIV copies/L) was used, resulting in a cumulative mortality rate of
    approximately 80% [21]. The species-specific variation in the susceptibility of
    fishes to RSIV may have contributed to the differences in the mortality rates.
    Rock bream challenged via immersion at 15 °C did not show mortality irrespective
    of the titer of the inoculum, which aligns with previous studies suggesting that
    RSIV is less virulent at lower temperatures [22]. However, when rock bream was
    exposed to RSIV at 15 °C, the virus was detected in the seawater as early as 3–5
    dpe, with virus amounts consistently detected in seawater until the end of the
    40-day experiment, despite virus amounts being lower than 102 RSIV copies/L/g.
    This emphasizes the risk of horizontal transmission through extended periods of
    virus shedding. In this study, a highly significant correlation was observed between
    the viral load in various tissues and the RSIV shedding ratio in rock bream exposed
    via immersion. This finding suggests that quantification of RSIV in seawater using
    non-invasive methods could be useful in indirectly assessing the disease progression
    status of RSIV in farmed fish. In rock bream that were immersion exposed with
    RSIV at 25 °C, the highest viral load was observed in the spleen among all collected
    organs during most stages of infection, including the early stage of infection.
    While the spleen and kidneys are recognized as the primary target organs for RSIV,
    the virus could also be detected in other organs such as the heart, gills, and
    eyes [1,14]. In contrast, in the group without mortality or disease progression
    (all challenge groups at 15 °C), a low viral load was detected in all organs examined
    regardless of the RSIV target organ. Previous studies have reported differences
    in the organ distribution of RSIV in rock bream, with asymptomatic yearling rock
    bream in a fish farm showing RSIV predominantly in the heart, stomach, intestines,
    muscles, eyes, and gills, rather than in the spleen [23]. Another study reported
    that the highest viral load was observed in the spleen and kidney in RSIV-infected
    naïve rock bream [14]. These differences suggest that yearling rock bream that
    survived RSIV infection may have harbored the virus without disease progression
    in the major target tissues, resulting in a low viral load. In previous studies,
    the mortality threshold for rock bream due to RSIVD infection was suggested to
    be >106 copies/μL in the spleen [24]. In this study, while the highest viral load
    was observed in the spleen, fish mortality was noted after surpassing the mortality
    threshold, with high viral loads detected in most tissues at the time of mortality.
    This suggests the possibility that after the virus has sufficiently replicated
    in the cells of the hematopoietic tissues, which are the primary target organs
    in fish, the normal structure and function may collapse, leading to systemic infection
    in other tissues and concurrent fish mortality. In this study, the lesions of
    the spleen caused by RSIV infection showed a higher correlation with concentration
    and disease progression, while the kidney tended to have a more sensitive primary
    reaction (necrotic lesions at lower viral loads of RSIV). Based on these results,
    our study strongly suggests that the spleen is the most suitable target organ
    for describing the extent of the pathology in RSIV-infected rock bream. Histopathological
    lesions are common in fish affected by viral infections and can be indicative
    of disease severity and progression [25,26]. The severity of the lesions can be
    influenced by viral load. Several studies have explored the correlation between
    viral load and histopathological lesions in fish. For example, salmonid alphavirus
    (SAV), a significant viral pathogen in Atlantic salmon causing severe systemic
    disease, exhibits a positive correlation between the severity of its associated
    histopathological lesions and viral load, with high levels of viral load resulting
    in severe histopathological changes [27]. In White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus),
    when challenged with Veronaea botryosa at 13 °C and 18 °C, histopathological lesions
    were observed at 13 °C, but a higher mortality rate and more severe histopathological
    lesion severity were observed at the more susceptible 18 °C [28]. In this study,
    higher mortality rates, viral loads within fish, and pronounced histopathological
    lesions were observed at 25 °C compared to 15 °C. These results support previous
    research, which suggests that the optimal temperature range for RSIV replication
    in vivo and in vitro is 20–25 °C, as well as observations of mortality due to
    RSIVD during high water temperatures in the summer at rock bream farms [29,30].
    In addition to the viral load, other factors can also impact the severity of histopathological
    lesions in fish. Environmental factors such as temperature, water quality, and
    stress can all contribute to the progression of viral infections and exacerbation
    of the histopathological changes [31,32,33]. Histopathological analysis is a crucial
    tool for the diagnosis and management of viral infections in fish. The severity
    of histopathological lesions can help to identify the viral pathogen and determine
    the appropriate course of action to control the disease [34,35]. In addition,
    understanding the correlation between viral load and the grade of the histopathological
    lesions can aid in developing effective treatment strategies for viral infections
    in fish [36,37,38]. For example, antiviral drugs can be used to decrease the viral
    load and reduce the severity of histopathological changes [39,40,41]. In most
    studies, either quantitative analysis of the pathogen or qualitative analysis
    of histopathological lesions is conducted, based on the purpose of the investigation
    and analytical methods employed. Performing both analyses despite being challenging
    may yield more comprehensive results, leading to more accurate and effective diagnostic
    and management strategies. Consequently, it is essential to select appropriate
    methods of analysis depending on the research objective. In our study, we observed
    a significant positive correlation between viral load and the presence of enlarged
    cells and necrotic lesions in the spleen of rock bream infected with RSIV. Therefore,
    it is crucial to consider both RSIV histopathological lesions and viral load in
    diagnosing and managing RSIV in natural habitats and aquaculture. The cohabitation
    challenge model was employed to assess the potential for horizontal transmission
    of RSIV from infected rock bream to uninfected rock bream, red sea bream, and
    flathead grey mullet as recipients. Mortality patterns and viral shedding kinetics
    varied based on the RSIV susceptibility of the recipient species cohabiting with
    the donor fish. At 25 °C, all challenge groups of rock bream (donor) exhibited
    a cumulative mortality rate of 100% approximately two weeks after infection, and
    rock bream and red sea bream (recipients) in the cohabitation challenge with rock
    bream (donor) died within three weeks. In contrast, flathead grey mullet showed
    a cumulative mortality rate of 100% at 31 dpe after the cohabitation challenge.
    Although the peak virus levels detected in seawater from the three cohabitation
    challenge groups were similar at approximately 106 RSIV copies/L/g at 14 dpe,
    flathead grey mullet exhibited the slowest mortality rate. This suggests differences
    in susceptibility to RSIV among fish species and provides direct evidence that
    RSIV-infected rock bream can transmit the virus to other fish species horizontally.
    Although no mortality was observed at 15 °C, the detection of RSIV in seawater
    and recipient fish supports the idea that rock bream (donor) can shed the virus
    even at low temperatures, which may be a factor in the annual summer outbreak
    of RSIV. This observation is supported by a previous study where RSIV was detected
    in seawater at a temperature as low as 11.7 °C in a red sea bream farm [9]. However,
    further studies are required to investigate the duration of viral shedding following
    RSIV infection. RSIV has been reported to survive in seawater at 25 °C and 15
    °C for approximately 7–10 days [42]. To investigate the dynamics of RSIV in aquaculture
    settings, disease progression can be monitored through qPCR or histopathological
    analysis of fish. However, to assess the risk of disease occurrence in neighboring
    farms beyond the area of RSIV outbreaks, non-invasive detection of RSIV in seawater
    may be a valuable alternative by considering the duration of virus survival. Our
    study provides evidence that the virus released from rock bream, the most susceptible
    species to RSIV, can cause horizontal infection and mortality in other fish species
    through cohabitation challenges, supported by quantification of the virus in seawater.
    This implies that rock bream may be a significant contributing factor to the ongoing
    outbreaks in aquaculture. 5. Conclusions Taken together, the results of this study
    indicate a high correlation between viral load and RSIV shedding ratio, as well
    as between viral load and histopathological lesions in rock bream infected with
    RSIV at 25 °C. Moreover, this study demonstrates the potential for the virus shed
    from RSIV-infected rock bream to spread the disease to other fish species. Supplementary

    a significant advance in the prevention and management of DFUs and other pressure
    injuries as well as compression therapy corrections. 1 Introduction Diabetic foot
    ulcers (DFUs), a major complication of diabetes, are hard-to-heal wounds that
    affect millions of people (2.49 million) in the U.S., with yearly incidence ranging
    from 2% to 6% and an average annual Medicare expenditure of $29.16 billion.[1-14]
    DFUs usually suffer from a long healing cycle (78 days on average) and a high
    recurrence rate (40% of DFU patients have a recurrence within one year of ulcer
    healing). Adequate offloading, which alleviates pressure from the ulcer site,
    is critical for aiding in ulcer treatment.[2, 6, 8, 15, 16] Currently used methods
    of offloading include instructing the patient to be on non-weight bearing (using
    a walker, crutches, etc.), the use of a removable device/adaptive footwear, or
    the application of non-removable total contact casting by the healthcare provider.
    Despite intensive efforts, it is shown that patients’ adherence to offloading
    recommendations has been measured as low as 2.2% overall and 28% with removable
    devices, which poses a big challenge for the treatment of DFUs.[17, 18] This low
    adherence is related to a key limitation of the offloading techniques: a lack
    of incorporated technologies that are able to provide continuous pressure monitoring
    of the ulcer to accommodate the diminished sensation capabilities of patients’
    feet (due to nerve damage) and to alert them when to offload. To address this
    limitation and improve patients’ adherence to offloading recommendations, there
    is an urgent need for devices that can continuously monitor the pressure for effective
    prevention and optimized treatment of DFUs. Several studies report the use of
    various types of pressure sensors for pressure monitoring purposes, including
    piezoresistive-type commercial sensors.[19-26] The large dimensions (sizes of
    over 10 mm in many cases and large thicknesses) and mechanical properties (e.g.,
    high modulus) of most devices prevent accurate measurements and a comfortable
    interface to the ulcer, especially underneath the foot. Furthermore, large external
    hardware and associated wiring represent barriers for use in the home setting
    and prevent continuous monitoring under certain scenarios such as daily activities.
    Desired features in pressure monitoring devices for DFUs include: i) being soft,
    flexible, and small to provide comfortable and localized pressure monitoring underneath
    the foot; ii) being highly accurate and reliable; iii) enabling wireless communications
    for use in consumer devices like smartphones and tablets; and iv) easy integration
    with existing offloading techniques. This paper reports a pressure-sensor-integrated
    smart bandage system with all of these attributes to allow continuous monitoring
    of the pressure applied to foot ulcers and to provide real-time feedback to users
    via wireless data transmission and a customized app on a smartphone. Composed
    of a soft force-sensitive film, the pressure sensor has displayed a highly linear
    response to exerted pressure, high reliability, and water-proof capabilities relevant
    to this application. A custom-designed user interface allows the display and interpretation
    of the recorded pressure, where options of text and sound alerts enable immediate
    notification of users/patients when insufficient offloading occurs. Users/patients
    can utilize this device for continuous pressure monitoring in the home setting,
    the operation mode of which is especially important for the prevention and treatment
    of DFUs. In addition, clinicians can use this technology as a tool to evaluate
    whether the DFU patient has adequate offloading necessary to promote wound healing,
    thereby providing an opportunity for patient-clinician partnership to achieve
    the mutual goal of ulcer healing. 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Design and Fabrication
    of the Pressure-Sensor-Integrated Smart Bandage A schematic illustration in Figure
    1A highlights locations susceptible to DFUs such as the medial plantar regions
    of the foot, and major components of the smart bandage system: a flexible resistive
    pressure sensor, a battery-powered flexible printed circuit board (fPCB), and
    a smartphone-based custom-designed graphic user interface (GUI). The thin, flexible
    pressure sensor can be conformally applied to the skin surface, while avoiding
    irritation. The fPCB hosts relatively rigid electrical components and is positioned
    at locations where the fPCB may not compromise patient comfort or the wound healing
    process, such as the ankle or within the velcro of offloading shoes. The system
    is powered by a coin cell battery (Energizer, CR1225, 3V, 48 mAh) mounted on the
    back of the fPCB (Figure 1B). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Design
    of a wireless pressure-sensor-integrated smart bandage system. A) Schematic illustration
    of the smart bandage system, including a pressure sensor, a printed circuit board
    (PCB) that houses electronics, and a custom-designed user interface, for pressure
    monitoring of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). B) Optical images of the front side
    of the PCB denoting key components, as well as the backside of the PCB where a
    battery is integrated for power supply. C) Circuit and block diagram of the system
    composed of three parts: a connecting housing that integrates the sensor to the
    PCB, circuit components that amplify and transmit analog data, and a data processing
    unit that converts the analog data to a digital format and transmit them to the
    user interface via Bluetooth. Figure 1C presents electronics block diagrams of
    the pressure sensor and the fPCB module, including analog circuits processing
    the sensor signal, a microcontroller (MCU), and a wireless data transmission interface
    to a smartphone. Voltage divider circuits built with the resistive pressure sensor
    and reference resistors convert resistive measurements of pressure into corresponding
    voltage signals under a constant voltage supply of 2.2 V from a linear voltage
    regulator. Subsequent low-power operational amplifiers (OpAMPs, ADA4505-1, Analog
    Device Inc.) amplify and buffer the signal, which is then sampled and digitized
    by a 12-bit analog-digital converter (ADC) inside the MCU (nRF52832, Nordic Semiconductor
    Inc.). The digital signal is smoothed with a 5-point move-average filter to increase
    the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The MCU contains the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    protocol and through a 2.4 GHz chip antenna, transmits data to any compatible
    smartphone that installs the custom-designed GUI software, a smartphone app to
    process and display the measured pressure values in real-time. The app converts
    the ADC raw data to readable pressure values using an empirically determined equation
    (Supporting Information Note 1). It also features advanced functions, including
    setting up a pressure threshold above which the app will send both sound and text
    alerts to users for immediate offloading (see details in section 2.4). Such an
    alert system eliminates the need for the user/patient to constantly check their
    phone or to interact with the device, which is very efficient in promoting offloading.
    The system performs pressure measurements at a 20 Hz sampling rate and transmits
    an averaged pressure value every 6 s (0.17 Hz) in this study, under which the
    battery has an expected lifetime of 3 to 4 days. This lifetime is sufficient for
    the application in DFUs considering that wound dressing is usually changed every
    3 to 4 days.[27] The overall system is lightweight, weighing 2.16 g including
    the battery (0.88 g). A key component of the system is a thin, soft resistive
    pressure sensor designed to be integrated into a medical-grade bandage and tailored
    to meet the performance requirements of the present application (Figure 2A,B).
    The sensor is composed of a low-cost force-sensitive film (Velostat electrically
    conductive copolymer, 100 µm thick, Adafruit Industries), which is laser patterned
    into a circular shape (1.5 cm in diameter) to accommodate the size of a typical
    foot ulcer.[28, 29] The circular pressure sensor is addressed by orthogonal conductive
    threads (36 AWG copper wires) on each side and sandwiched between two encapsulation
    layers of biocompatible polyimide tapes (60 µm thick) from the top and bottom.[12,
    19] Regions of overlap between the 2 row and column orthogonal electrodes respond
    to normal forces through a change in the through-film resistance[30] (Figures
    S1 and S2, Supporting Information). The pressure sensor has shown to be insensitive
    to small bending angles (Figure S3, Supporting Information). For the application
    in DFUs, the pressure sensor is integrated into a special ulcer-oriented bandage
    (Mepilex 3″ × 3″, Gothenburg, Sweden)[31] and secured in the wound dressing with
    a layer of meshed Mepitel (Figure 2B) on top. Please note that the developed smart
    bandage for managing DFUs is typically left in place every 3 to 4 days and can
    be up to 7 days. Also, the flexible pressure sensor is compatible with various
    types of bandages including those with improved breathability and antimicrobial
    properties.[32] However, the investigation of those characteristics of bandages
    is not the focus of this study and will be pursued elsewhere. The thin, flexible,
    lightweight characteristics of the sensor-integrated smart bandage allow conformal
    integration to the skin surface to avoid skin irritation. The low cost of the
    force-sensitive film and the simple assembly approach allow the potential for
    scalability. Figure 2C presents the fractional changes in ADC values across a
    range of pressures relevant to the application in DFUs. The results indicate a
    high degree of linearity (R2 = 0.993) across the range of pressures relevant to
    the application on DFUs. The measurement range, which is important for monitoring
    pressure on the foot of users/patients of varying weight is significantly larger
    than pressure sensors using silicon nanomembranes with operating ranges of 5–30
    kPa[33] and comparable to pressure sensors based on metal traces with operating
    ranges of up to 350 kPa.[21] In addition, all measured data up to 240 kPa show
    excellent agreement with applied pressure from a mechanical tester, as shown in
    Figure 2D. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Design, fabrication, and

    change in digital voltage values of the pressure sensor as a function of applied

    Pressure Sensor The prompt response of the pressure sensor, good durability, and
    low hysteresis are important attributes for applications to the offloading of
    DFUs to promote wound healing.[6] The response time of the pressure sensor is
    tested by applying a constant load (225 kPa) to the sensor, while recording the
    sensor readout. The sensor shows a fast response time of 0.3 s for loading and
    unloading, which is sufficient for monitoring real-time pressures on users’ feet
    during their daily activities (Figure 3A).[19] In addition, the sensor exhibits
    excellent durability and cyclability, with negligible hysteresis in response up
    to 100 cycles under a peak pressure of 60 kPa (Figure 3B and Figure S6, Supporting
    Information), which is also in agreement with previous studies of the low hysteresis
    of Velostat-based biosensors.[34] In addition, we also test the sensing stability
    of the sensor by measuring its performance under applied loads (Figure S4, Supporting
    Information) and dynamic environments (Figure S5, Supporting Information), further
    demonstrating the reliability of the sensor performance. Figure 3 Open in figure

    the pressure sensor. B) Performance of the pressure sensor under cyclic loading
    with a zoomed-in view of two cycles. C) Fractional resistance change of the pressure
    sensor, while being merged in water, with a pressure sensor tested in ambient
    conditions as a control group (n = 3). D) Fractional resistance change of the
    pressure sensor as a function of temperature relevant for the application of DFUs
    (n = 3). Waterproof capabilities are another important aspect of the pressure
    sensor in the application of the potentially wet wound environment of DFUs, where
    sweat and other excreted body fluids exist. We test the performance of the pressure
    sensor in both dry (as a control group) and humid environments. The pressure sensors
    demonstrate remarkable waterproof capabilities (Figure 3C), showing no significant
    change in resistance over 5 days, which is sufficient for DFU users where bandages
    are usually changed every 3 to 4 days.[27] In addition, it is important for the
    pressure sensor to exhibit reliable performance across a range of temperatures
    close to the human body temperature (37 °C). This is especially true for the pressure
    sensor used for pressure monitoring of DFUs as it will interface with open sores
    that usually have a higher temperature during wound healing.[10, 11] We test the
    performance of the pressure sensor under varying temperatures by placing it in
    a convection oven with controlled temperatures ranging from 20 to 40 °C. As shown
    in Figure 3D, the sensor has shown negligible resistance changes as temperature
    increases, demonstrating the reliability of the sensor, which is also consistent
    with existing studies of the force-sensitive film used for fabricating the pressure
    sensor.[30] 2.3 Trials of Real-Time Pressure Monitoring on Healthy Subjects To
    evaluate the applicability of the pressure-sensor-integrated smart bandage in
    real-time pressure monitoring of the foot during daily activities, we apply two
    smart bandages to the sole and heel of a healthy volunteer''s foot (regions susceptible
    to DFUs), respectively, to test their performance (Figure 4A). Please note that
    appropriate informed written consent of all participants in this study has been
    obtained prior to performing the experiments. The fPCB along with electronic components
    is located and secured to the dorsal part of the ankle covered underneath a sock.
    Figure 4B–E shows the measured pressure values, while the healthy volunteer performs
    various daily activities, including sitting, standing, and walking. The pressure
    changes depend on the activities described above (Figure 4B). More specifically,
    the measured pressure remains constant during sitting and standing, with minimal
    fluctuations during standing, which can be attributed to small shifts in the user''s
    weight. Based on the magnitude and the evolution of the recorded pressure, a correlation
    between pressure and daily activities can be potentially established when coupled
    with advanced data analysis approaches like machine learning,[35] which would
    be very helpful as a diagnostic tool for clinicians to keep a record of the activities
    of patients. However, this data analysis approach is not the focus of the work
    and will be pursued elsewhere. The sensors also show remarkable temporal resolution
    during the walking test (Figure 4E), with each stride being easily distinguishable.
    This further demonstrates the fast response of the sensors described earlier,
    which is relevant for the application in DFUs. In addition, under all tested daily
    activities, we observe a stark difference between pressure recordings from the
    two sensors distributed at the sole and the heel, respectively, with the pressure
    sensor on the heel experiencing a higher magnitude of pressure. This is expected
    as most people bear the majority of their weight on the heel of their feet.[36,
    37] We also calculate the accumulated pressure time integral (APTI) resulting
    from activities in Figure 4A, which is shown to be correlated to the skin blood
    flow.[38] The APTI is determined to be 2317.2 and 3150 kPa s–1 for the sole and
    heel locations of the foot within a period of 45 s, respectively, while the volunteer
    is performing standing, sitting, and walking. These results demonstrate the great
    potential for the smart bandage to be applied to DFU patients to monitor the pressure
    in real-time and improve patients’ adherence to offloading. Figure 4 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Testing of the soft pressure-sensor-integrated smart bandage
    system on healthy volunteers. A) Schematic illustration of applying the pressure
    sensors on the medial plantar (sole) and heel positions of a healthy volunteer.

    performs various activities including sitting, standing, and walking. Zoomed-in
    views of real-time pressure while the volunteer is sitting C), standing D), and
    walking E). To further demonstrate the compatibility of the smart bandage with
    existing offloading techniques, we test the pressure-sensor-integrated bandage
    to the sole and heel regions, while the healthy volunteer is on barefoot and wearing
    a medical-grade forefoot offloading boot, respectively (Figure 5A). The fPCB is
    rerouted to the dorsal part of the ankle and secured with medical tape for the
    testing. It is worth noting that before testing, we first calibrate the sensor
    by ‘zeroing’ the readings of each device experiencing no loads to improve the
    measurement accuracy (Figures S7–S9, Supporting Information). More specifically,
    ADC values of pressure sensors under zero loads (at rest) are recorded and averaged
    into a calibrated ADC value, from which all subsequent ADC values are subtracted
    (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Such calibration method improves the consistency
    of measurements and eliminates the effect of noises and sensor variability (Figure
    S9, Supporting Information). Figure 5B shows that compared to wearing an offloading
    boot, the sole experiences ≈70% more pressure when standing barefoot. Higher pressures
    are also experienced while walking barefoot compared to that with the boot (Figure
    5C). When the sensor is relocated to the heel of the foot, the measured pressures
    between barefoot and medical boot trials are much closer (Figure 5D–E). This is
    because the medical boot used here is specially designed to alleviate pressure
    at the metatarsal/toe regions of the foot. We also calculate the pressure time
    integral (PTI), an important parameter to evaluate the loading on the foot.[39]
    Figure S10 (Supporting Information) indicates that the PTI values for one stride
    of walking show a similar trend as that of the real-time pressure monitoring,
    i.e., a larger magnitude on the heel of the foot and reduced loading when wearing
    an offloading boot. These results indicate the effectiveness of the boot in alleviating
    the pressure on the foot for offloading and the compatibility of the smart bandage
    system with existing offloading techniques including wearing a removable boot
    to facilitate the offloading of DFUs. In addition, the alert system of the smart
    bandage, which will be discussed in section 2.4, will send immediate notifications
    to the users under circumstances where the pressure is above a pressure threshold
    for offloading. This feature allows the users/patients to become aware of excess
    loading to their DFUs despite their lack of sensation capabilities at the foot
    as described earlier and make interventions accordingly. Figure 5 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Testing the smart bandage with a medical-grade offloading boot.

    real-time pressure with the sensor applied to the heel position during standing
    D) and walking E). Legends of “Boot” and “Foot” refer to the conditions where
    the participant wears an offloading boot and barefoot, respectively. 2.4 Customized
    Application Interface for Data Display and Alerts To wirelessly transmit and demonstrate
    the measured pressure data from the pressure-sensor-integrated smart bandage,
    a customized, user-friendly IOS application, incorporated with a variety of advanced
    features like visual effects and alerts, is developed. Pairing the sensor with
    the app by simply pressing the ‘connect’ button on the screen of the user interface
    (smartphone) initiates the testing, where users can set a pressure threshold,
    calibrate the device, and start a session (Movie S1, Supporting Information).
    A bar chart, which is the default setting of the display, shows the status of
    the pressure compared to the preset pressure threshold represented by a dashed
    line (Figure 6A). Under sufficient offloading, the bar chart and real-time pressure
    values are displayed in green, along with a green smiley face symbol to indicate
    the user is compliant with the current offloading threshold (Figure 6A). When
    the pressure threshold is exceeded, i.e., insufficient offloading, a text alert
    “Threshold Exceeded” and a sound alert will be generated immediately, and in the
    meantime, the bar chart and the real-time pressure value turn in red along with
    a red frown face as an easily identifiable warning for offloading (Figure 6B and
    Movie S2, Supporting Information). The bar chart can also be switched to a line
    plot showing the measured pressure values for the most recent 5 min in real-time
    (Figure 6B and Movie S3, Supporting Information). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint IoS application interface. A) Schematic illustration and sensor performance
    under the sufficient offloading condition, where the corresponding app interface
    displays pressures under the threshold value along with a green smiley face. B)
    Schematic illustration and sensor performance under the insufficient offloading
    condition, where the app screenshot shows the displayed pressure above the threshold
    value along with a red frown face and generated text and audio alerts. The bar
    chart can be switched to a line chart to display the real-time pressure. Other
    features include the session history, which includes session duration, threshold
    value, percentage of time when the pressure is above the threshold, and the average
    pressure of each session, along with a visual color indicator and an option to
    export the session data to a .txt file. The customized app is capable of sending
    audio and visual alerts even when it runs in the background of the iOS device
    (Movie S4, Supporting Information). Alerts will be generated when the pressure
    applied to the foot exceeds the pressure threshold, or disconnection between the
    sensor and the app occurs due to conditions like power off, under which automatic
    reconnection will be available once the power is turned on. In addition, the app
    can provide a summary report of all the tested sessions, where the duration of
    each tested session, the pressure threshold, the percentage of time when the pressure
    threshold is exceeded, and the average pressure are displayed. The app also supports
    exporting the summary report to a .txt file for easy access to clinicians as a
    potential diagnostic tool for DFU patients. Those advanced features provide a
    very convenient tool for patients to maintain sufficient offloading and for clinicians
    to track the offloading conditions of their patients and make medical decisions
    accordingly. 3 Conclusion The soft, flexible, wireless pressure-sensor-integrated
    smart bandage system introduced in this study enables continuous monitoring of
    pressure at the ulcer site of DFUs and provides real-time feedback to users. Laser
    patterning of force-sensitive films and assembly yield soft pressure sensors that
    exhibit high linearity, fast response time, negligible hysteresis, and excellent
    water-proof capabilities across the entire range of pressures and periods relevant
    for this application. The low cost of the constituent materials and the simple
    fabrication technique allow the potential for scalability. Experimental studies
    and trials on healthy subjects demonstrate reliable pressure monitoring performance
    and easy integration of the smart bandage with existing offloading techniques
    like offloading boots, which establishes its feasibility for clinical trials.
    The custom-designed app allows the display and interpretation of the measured
    pressure data and supports advanced features like visual and sound alerts when
    insufficient offloading occurs to the user. Future opportunities include pilot
    clinical studies on DFU patients to fully verify the functionality of the smart
    bandage system in promoting the healing of DFUs, as well as machine-learning-assisted
    data analysis approaches to empower the system''s functionalities such as position
    and/or activity recognition for a potentially intelligent medical care system.
    Additional options include integrating other types of physical sensors like temperature
    sensors and biochemical sensors into the smart bandage for multimodal sensing
    and treatment of DFUs.[40, 41] More broadly, the smart bandage has applications
    to the offloading of other pressure injuries such as prosthetic blisters and bedsores,
    and to compression therapies like correcting the application of lower extremity
    compression wraps.[42, 43] 4 Experimental Section Sensor Fabrication A CO2 laser
    (VLS 2.30, Universal Laser System, Ansonia, CT) was used to pattern the force-sensitive
    film (Velostat electrically conductive copolymer, 100 µm thick, Adafruit Industries)
    into a circular geometry (diameter: 1.5 cm) to accommodate the size of a typical
    foot ulcer. Two pairs of orthogonal conductive threads were laid across the circular
    sensor. Encapsulating the sensor with polyimide tape (60 µm thick) from the top
    and bottom completed the assembly of the sensor. Please note that sensors used
    for water-proof testing were further encapsulated at the edges with a thin layer
    of silicone adhesive (Kwik-Sil, World Precision Instruments). There was no concern
    about any potentially negative impact on healthy human subjects given the FDA-approved
    materials and non-invasive nature of the device used in this work. Printed Circuit
    Board The PCB was fabricated by PCBWay. The electrical components including resistors
    and capacitors were ordered from Digikey and were soldered to the corresponding
    locations of the PCB using low-temperature solder paste and a solder gun. A custom-made
    PCB case was also designed to protect the PCB board from the environment and act
    as a more comfortable interface between the PCB and skin (Figure S11, Supporting
    Information). The case was 3D printed using PolyJet VERO Black ink. Acknowledgements

  description: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could flexibly and efficiently observe
    land surface and obtain surface information at very high frequency and resolutions.
    In recent years, UAV technology has been greatly improved and the UAVs are increasingly
    applied in large amount of civilian fields. The UAV Remote Sensing (UAVRS) is
    a comprehensive technology composed of UAV flying aircraft, light remote sensing
    payload, satellite positioning device, remote-control system, communication technology
    and application technology. An UAVRS system is mainly composed of UAV platform,
    load system, ground control and data transmission system and image processing
    system. With the popularity of civilian UAV products and the development of UAV
    remote sensing payload, UAVRS also shows an explosive growth trend in various
    industries. However, the short battery life and limited coverage of the civilian
    drones are one of the key factors restricting the UAVRS applications. Besides,
    although the application of UAVs in various industries and fields continues to
    deepen, most of them are single-type applications in a certain discipline or industry.
    The 5G technology and wireless communication technology advance and will give
    rise to the UAVRS applications in terms of“networking”,“IoT”, and“real-time”,
    as well as cross-domain and convergence application. The modern cities are highly
    complex and sociotechnical. They comprise people and communities interacting with
    one another and with objects (e. g., roads, buildings) within a range of urban
    settings or contexts. It is extremely difficult to monitor and manage such complex
    sociotechnical systems. The monitoring and mapping of pollutions, traffic, infrastructures
    are great challenges in rapidly changing cities, and especially gained increasing
    attentions of citizens and are putting great stresses on policy makers and urban
    planners. Theoretical and practical efforts to create better city monitoring and
    management systems have a long history. In the 21st century, we recognize and
    conceive “creative”,“smart”and“knowledge”cities, in which the multidisciplinary
    Information and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has played a vital
    role. The Internet of Things (IoT) promotes the development of the smart cities.
    However, in various urban domains, the cities equipped with a sensor-based web,
    or a cyber-physical information infrastructure, are far from sufficient to help
    policy makers or citizens to get a full understanding of the real time or near
    real time city conditions. To this end, due to their mobility, autonomous operation,
    and communication/processing capabilities, UAVs are envisaged in many smart city
    application domains. In this article, we describe a technology of air-ground collaborative
    low-altitude UAV remote sensing network system. The system composes of intelligent
    UAV, the UAV base station (drone-in box) and operation system. The UAV remote
    sensing network can provide high-frequency and real-time observations of the land
    surface. Based on the UAV remote sensing network, we constructed a comprehensive
    application for urban governance. An UAVRS network composed of eight UAV base
    stations was deployed in Danzao Town, Foshan City. Connected through 5G network,
    the UAVRS network advances the UAV inspection frequency, spatial coverage, and
    response time. It provides revolutionary and intelligent services for local agents
    and departments of water affairs, environment protection, public security, urban
    management, and emergency. The UAVRS network system in Danzao is expected to develop
    a real-world smart city paradigm that could be copied and migrated to other towns
    across the country.

    樊邦奎和张瑞雨，2017）。人机技术诞生于二十世纪初，最初由英国研制，其核心技术也长期掌握在英美国家手中。早期的无人机主要以军事用途为主，直到二十一世纪才逐渐走向民用领域（
    李德仁和李明，2014）。中国无人机起步较晚，但发展迅速，随着以大疆创新科技有限公司为代表的一批无人机科技企业在民用轻小型无人机领域的异军突起，中国无人机制造技术及无人机产业也迈入世界前列（
    郭庆华 等，2021）。 无人机遥感UAVRS（UAV Remote Sensing）即无人机与遥感技术的结合，是一种由无人机驾驶飞行器、轻型遥感载荷、卫星定位装置、遥测遥控系统、通讯技术和遥感应用技术组成的一门综合技术（
    李德仁和李明，2014； 郭庆华 等，2021； Colomina和Molina，2014）。无人机遥感系统主要由：无人机平台、载荷系统、地面控制与数据传输系统和影像处理系统组成。随着消费级无人机的普及，以及无人机遥感载荷的发展，无人机遥感在各行业领域的领域也呈现爆发式增长的趋势（
    廖小罕 等，2019； 张继贤 等，2021）。以UAV为关键词在Web of Science数据库检索发现，2000年至今，以无人机（UAV）为关键词的发文数总量超过50000篇，且呈现指数级增长；涉及的领域包括工程学、计算机科学、自动控制等工程领域，也包括遥感、地质、环境、农业、自然地理等基础与应用基础研究领域（图1）。

    min左右，实际覆盖半径则一般不超过2 km（ Yang等，2017； Zhang等，2021）。此外，虽然无人机在各行业和领域的应用不断深入，但大部分都是在某一学科或行业的单一类型应用，应用范围小、应用场景单一。因此，基于多无人机协作的无人机遥感组网系统得到越来越多的关注。早在2010年前后，美国军方就将无人机组网作为无人机传感网的重要发展方向（U.S.
    Army，2010）。国外学者提出了无人机物联网IoD（Internet of Drones）的概念，并阐述了无人机物联网在军事、农业、交通、物流、测绘等领域的应用潜力（
    Abdelmaboud，2021； Gharibi等，2016）。但目前为止，除了谷歌（Google）、亚马逊（Amazon）、联邦快递（DHL）等电商企业在物流领域的实践，国外无人机物联网在民用领域的应用仍在起步阶段，未见有成熟的应用案例（
    Nex等，2022）。中国学者也提出了无人机组网遥感观测的概念（ 廖小罕 等，2016），并提出依托野外观测台站建设区域无人机空港和调度中心，支撑无人机区域组网遥感观测应急与常态化服务需求。在此基础上，开展了无人机空港布局优化、无人机低空航路网构建技术等研究（
    刘俊伟 等，2021； 鹿明 等，2019； 徐晨晨 等，2020）。“十一五”（2006年—2010年）以来，国家层面也持续加大对高分辨率无人机遥感应用研究的支持力度，特别是2017年，国家重点研发“地球观测与导航”领域立项支持了“高频次迅捷无人航空器区域组网遥感观测技术”项目，该项目构建了高频次迅捷无人机组网遥感观测技术体系，并在国土安全监测、生态环境监测、灾害应急等监测任务中成功开展了应用示范（
    廖小罕 等，2021）。近年来，具备自动充换电功能的无人机自动机场（又称“机巢”、“基站”）的出现大大提高了无人机的续航能力，随着5G技术、无线通信技术的逐步成熟，将为无人机遥感带来“网联化”、“物联化”、“实时化”的巨大机遇，以及跨界融合和应用场景综合化的需求和发展趋势（
    Nex等，2022）。 本文基于无人机智能基站，提出一种空地协同的低空无人机遥感网构建方法，将边缘计算、人工智能、4G/5G通讯等技术集成融合，实现无人机的集群控制和协同作业，并构建了面向智慧城镇的实例化应用场景，初步探索了低空无人机遥感的网联化应用，并探讨了低空无人机遥感网技术面临的问题及发展趋势。
    2　空地协同无人机遥感网的提出 2.1　基本概念 目前，无人机组网方法主要包括两种，一种是无人机搭载UWB （Ultra-Wideband）信号标签，与就近部署的信号基站通讯，执行集群调度任务，另一种是无人机载有4G或5G通信模块，无人机通过4G或5G通信模块进行组网，与地面移动信号基站通信，执行集群调度任务（
    Gupta等，2016； Zeng等，2019； Liu等，2019）。但是，上述两种方式均存在以下问题：一方面通信信号的稳定性差，难以满足大区域的集群调用需求，另一方面在执行集群调度任务前，均需要大量的事前准备和人为干预，无法及时地进行任务的执行。
    本文提出了一种基于无人机智能基站组网的低空无人机遥感网，由无人机智能基站组网，实现多台无人机的集群控制作业。无人机遥感网由智能无人机、无人机智能基站、运营系统3部分组成。无人机智能基站是一种可实现无人机的无人值守、自主起飞、精准降落、电池热替换、远程监控、全天候作业的智能基站，能够直接在监测区域进行野外部署，支持无人机的远程控制与自主回收，从而使无人机具备7×24小时不间断作业的能力。智能无人机由工业无人机、机载计算模块、5G通信模块组成，可以通过机载计算模块实现信息的快速提取和处理，通过5G通信实现数据的及时回传。遥感网运营系统则是整个无人机遥感网的控制中枢，运营系统简化了无人机操作流程，可以一个指令让分布在各地无人机基站同时作业，达到一人全管的目标。无人机遥感网通过无人机基站实现无人机高频次观测，通过遥感网运营系统实现无人机自主协同作业，通过智能无人机实现信息的智能处理。
    无人机遥感网的各个节点（基站），由集群调度服务器相连接，集群调度服务器与各个无人机巢建立光纤、4G或5G通信连接，各个基站与对应的无人机建立专用无线通信连接。集群调度服务器将子任务下发至对应的目标基站，使各个目标基站控制内部无人机从目标起飞、按照集群调度子任务中的飞行航线飞行，实时接收无人机回传的任务数据，并在集群调度子任务完成之后回收无人机，低空无人机遥感网的设计架构如图2所示。

    network 下载:  原图 | 高精图 | 低精图 2.2　主要特点 空地协同无人机遥感网是无人机组网观测的一种特殊形式，不具有传统无人机自组网的无中心、自组织的特点，而是采用无人机智能基站作为无人机遥感网的网络拓扑的节点，每个节点兼具停机场、充/换电站、收发器、路由器的功能。此外，本文提出的无人机遥感网的“网”也具有多层含义，在技术层面，是无人机组网这一具体技术；在应用层面，指利用多个无人机进行协同观测，形成类似于卫星监测网、地面传感网的低空对地观测网络，其特点在于分布式、全自主、高频次、高精度、多功能，区别于无人机集群作业所采用的自组网。主要特点包括：
    （1）网络节点和拓扑结构的相对固定。传统的无人机组网中，每台无人机为一个节点，在无人机移动时，网络的拓扑结构是动态变化的，对网络连通性、协议性能、通信链路的稳定性有较高的要求。空地协同无人机遥感网以无人机智能基站作为无人机组网的节点，无人机与智能基站间进行通信，无人机遥感网的拓扑结构是稳定的。
    （2）无人机的稀疏性。传统的无人机组网通常针对同一目标和任务，无人机在一定空域内密度较高，在这种情况下，无人机组网一般只包括同类型的无人机，且对无人机间的通信连通性和性能要求较高。空地协同无人机遥感网构建的目的是完成较大范围的地表信息的监测，因此无人机在空中是分散分布的，无人机间的距离大都在3
    km或以上，一般不需要考虑无人机间通信的能耗和性能问题。 （3）节点功能的多样性。在无人机组网中，地面基站通常作为中继站，负责无人机的通信和数据的传输。本文的无人机智能基站兼具了无人机自动机场和充/换电站的功能，因此，每个节点的无人机都具备高频次作业的能力，解决了多旋翼无人机组网中的无人机续航难题。相较于无人机空中自组网，本文提出的无人机遥感网具有更多和更灵活的应用场景。
    3　低空无人机遥感网构建 3.1　智能无人机 智能无人机是无人机遥感网的终端，是具备机载计算资源的无人机，能够在前端独立处理飞行过程中采集的信息。本研究将自主研发的云冠2-5G微型计算机（https：//www.geoai.com/facility/yunguan［2022-08-09］）搭载在多旋翼无人机上，使无人机可以完成复杂的图像处理和识别工作。云冠2-5G搭载了NVIDA
    Jetson Xavier NX模块，并具备5G通信功能；云冠2-5G适配大疆经纬M300RTK、经纬M210 V2等多款设备和开源飞控系统（图3）。目标识别算法采用了YOLO算法，该算法是Redmon等于2015年提出的（
    Redmon等，2016），因其具有比较简洁的结构，计算处理速度快，常用于边缘计算应用（ Shi等，2016； Barthélemy等，2019； Alam等，2019；
    Liang等，2022）。本研究采用了其近期发布的YOLOv5版本，用于交通巡检、水务巡查、电力设施巡查等实际应用场景中的快速前端识别。 图3  搭载云冠的大疆经纬M300

    3.2　无人机智能基站 无人机智能基站是无人机遥感网的载体和组成节点，本研究采用的为智臻-G900固定式无人机智能基站（https：//www.geoai.com/facility/nest/G900［2022-08-09］），包括无人机智能基站舱体、升降平台、自动归中系统、自动充电系统、气象站、UPS、工业空调等，无人机智能基站外部结构如图4所示。基站主要功能包括停放无人机、自主充电/换电、自主巡检、一键起飞、精准降落、飞行条件监测、实时传输、飞行航线规划等，能够抵抗强风暴雨和高温低寒等恶劣天气。基站内置机械手臂，可实现无人机电池的自动更换，内置4组电池，保障无人机全天候不间断巡检作业，同时更换的电池自动放置充电仓。无人机智能基站为无人机的续航和远程操控提供了保障，实现了无人机的长时间无人值守作业和自动化作业，理论上，根据无人机的续航时间，每台无人机基站可覆盖为30—50
    km2。 图4  无人机智能基站结构及组成 Fig. 4  Structure and composition of UAV intelligent base
    station 下载:  原图 | 高精图 | 低精图 3.3　无人机遥感网运营系统 无人机遥感网运营系统是低空无人机遥感网络的综合管理平台，对内主要实现整个遥感网的物联网级控制，包括无人机控制，基站控制、挂载控制等，对外主要提供在无人机遥感网基础上的无人机应用服务如无人机指挥调度、航线规划、算法分析等，并基于这些应用服务提供行业定制化系统。无人机遥感网运营系统主要分为3层，分别是管控层、服务层、应用层，各层之间具有相对独立性，通过定义接口实现服务交互，便于维护。
    管控层负责系统中底层设备的物联网级控制管理。底层设备主要包括无人机、基站、挂载3类，由于不同设备的自带的控制协议与接口都有差异，因此需要采用统一的物联网协议进行规范化或者进一步封装，以便上层服务调用。管控层通过网络通信模块与服务层进行数据交换，接收服务层指挥命令、上传遥感数据以供分析处理。
    服务层介于管控层和应用层之间，负责提供可复用的服务，具体服务内容包括无人机指挥调度与作业过程监控、无人机数据回传与共享管理、无人机作业航线的动态规划、无人机数据分析算法及无人机所处位置的地图信息等，除了自研服务外，第三方服务如遥感影像处理方法等也可以通过扩展的方式进行集成，便于应用层调用。以上服务内容通过打包建立各种服务中台的方式对应用层开放，使得应用层不需要关注底层架构和变化即可满足应用需求。
    应用层主要负责具体业务逻辑处理，仅关注与实现业务领域逻辑、实际需求，系统所有的交互均从数字化大屏形式的应用层进入。应用服务面向多个行业和场景，例如面向城市管理，可提供城市巡查、两违识别、市容整治、施工监管；面向交通行业，可提供交通巡查、事故取证、违章协查、行为识别；面向安防行业，可提供高空侦察、走私摸查、喊话规劝、协助安保；面向应急行业，可提供森林防火、隐患排查、灾情勘探、走失救援；面向水务行业，可提供河道、水库、岸线巡查以及排污监测；面向国土行业，可提供正射、倾斜、全景、点云数据采集能力；面向能源行业，可提供变电站、输电线路、管道、光伏巡查等（图5）。

    图6  多路无人机数据回传系统框架 Fig. 6  Framework of multi-channel UAV data transmission system
    下载:  原图 | 高精图 | 低精图 无人机与基站之间主要通过1.4 GHZ/2.4 GHZ/5.8 GHZ等点对点无线电信号进行通讯，是目前多旋翼无人机与地面通信的主要方式。但点对点无线电信号被遮挡或者干扰时，会切换到4G/5G等运营商网络进行备份通讯，备份通讯通过内置在云冠2-5G上的4G/5G通信模组实现。基站通过遥控器天线接收到数据后，会通过相应的网络协议将数据回传给平台，其中数传数据主要通过MQTT协议（
    Standard，2019），回传至平台的消息服务器，图传数据主要通过RTMP（ Parmar和Thornburgh，2012）或WebRTC协议（ Bergkvist等，2012）回传至平台的流媒体服务器。文件数据主要通过HTTP（
    Fielding，1999）或FTP协议（ Gien，1978）回传至平台的文件服务器。 在传输效率方面，数传对带宽占用较少，图传会根据无人机信号强度不同进行调整（降低码率和图像分辨率），通常情况下，1.4/2.4/5.8
    Ghz传输带宽能达到10 Mbps，可以满足高分辨率图像和视频直播的需求。但由于文件传输占用带宽较大，因此，文件的传输通常在在无人机降落后执行，无人机降落后数传图传关闭，整个链路只服务于文件传输。
    4　低空无人机遥感网实践与应用 4.1　丹灶镇低空无人机遥感网 无人机遥感是“天—空—地”一体化的监测体系中的重要一环，是卫星观测和地面监测之间的桥梁，可以弥补卫星遥感监测在时效性、空间分辨率上的不足，也可以配合地面监测，解决地面监测的尺度问题和空间代表性难题。但由于续航时间的约束，单个无人机采集数据的空间范围有限，因此，依托无人机智能基站，构建低空无人机遥感观测网，可以在较短时间内获取较大范围的无人机影像，实现高频次迅捷观测，具有较高的应用价值。此外，无人机智能基站设备部署灵活、成本可控，搭载的智能无人机具备一定的计算能力，整个无人机遥感网通过运营系统进行调度和控制，可以实现“传感器—无人机—基站—组网—数据—应用”的全链条应用，不仅可以服务于低空无人机对地观测科学研究，也可以满足应急观测和常态化服务的需求，特别是在智慧城镇管理、基层治理等区域性综合应用中，有望发挥关键作用。本研究围绕低空无人机遥感网的综合应用，在广东省佛山市丹灶镇构建了覆盖全域的低空无人机遥感网系统，形成了面向智慧城镇治理的低空无人机遥感网解决方案。
    丹灶镇是中国百强镇、国家生态镇，辖区总面积143.5 km2，截至2021年，丹灶镇辖24个社区、6个行政村。丹灶镇有高新技术企业总数232家，有“中国日用五金之都“之称。近年来，丹灶镇快速发展的同时，城镇治理也面临诸多挑战，迫切需求新的城镇管理手段来提高城镇管理效率和智能化程度。丹灶镇低空无人机遥感网由分布在全镇8个区域的无人机智能基站组成，无人机基站的部署综合考虑了丹灶镇不同区域的气候条件、基础设施情况、禁飞区范围、地形等因素。每台机巢搭载一架大疆经纬M300型多旋翼无人机（图7）。机巢通过光纤与无人机遥感网运营系统相连接，无人机遥感网的中央控制系统能够远程指挥调度无人机进行作业，可实现无人机航行规划、任务下发、远程控制、成果回传等。

    | 高精图 | 低精图 组网完成的无人机每次巡检只需从系统获取已规划的航线，或手工规划的航线，自动根据航线进行飞行作业，航线只需规划一次便可循环利用，为无人机常态化运行提供便利。低空无人机组网克服了传统单机频繁转场、耗时较长、效率较低的弊端，为无人机开展大规模、常态化、高效率的监测和巡查提供可能性。
    4.2　低空无人机遥感网应用 4.2.1　违建识别 违章建筑给城市监管和管理带来了很大难题。遥感技术已经在城市违法建设查处、城市布局、城市改造、历史文化保护中得到了广泛的应用，如Ikonos、Quickbird，以及高分和资源系列卫星（
    李德仁 等，2009； 王丹 等，2021； 刘艳红 等，2012）。然而，一方面珠三角地区多云雨天气，高分辨率光学遥感影像的获取受天气影响大，光学遥感影像的观测频率难以保障。另一方面，佛山作为粤港澳大湾区的核心城市之一，建筑密度大、发展速度快，光学卫星影像的分辨率仍难以满足实际需求。低空无人机遥感网提供了固定范围的高频次、高精度监测手段。本研究中，利用无人机智能基站对重点区域进行每周一次的固定路径和范围的激光雷达点云数据（LiDAR）采集。对采集的数据，利用变化监测方法筛选出潜在变化位置。为了避免错检，设定了高度差20
    cm以及面积差15 m2作为阈值，即高度变化在20 cm以下或面积变化小于15 m2的变化均被自动排除。此外，为了避免雨天或浓雾的影响，数据采集均在无雨和无雾的时段进行。目前，重点区域的基础点云数据采集完成，基于采集的数据，与基础数据对比，可检测出疑似变化位置，通过人工判读，筛选出疑似违法建筑，再通过对比同时期的无人机正射影像，可进一步进行确认（图8）。

    下载:  原图 | 高精图 | 低精图 利用无人机遥感网，可实现固定区域、固定路径的常态化巡查，以及标准化的数据处理流程，保障了违建识别的准确检测。此外，利用无人机遥感网的中央控制系统，执法人员远程指挥调度无人机进行不定期的巡检，大大缩减了人工巡查的人力和时间成本，也减少了卫星遥感调查造成的漏检以及滞后。
    4.2.2　交通巡查 无人机由于机动、灵活的优势，在交通管理中已经广泛应用，例如交通事故现场的快速勘察、交通拥堵的疏解、交通执法查处等。单一无人机巡航范围小，续航时间有限，是无人机交通执法中常面临的难点。本研究中使用无人机遥感网协助交通执法，一名执法人员可以通过无人机遥感网控制系统同时远程调度一台或多台无人机，在交通高峰时段，在指定区域按照指定路线进行常规巡逻，并可进行悬停巡逻和拍照。例如，执法人员可操控无人机对实时交通状况进行巡查，机载“云冠”计算模块内置了人、车识别的预训练模型，可实时进行车流量的统计（图9（a））。此外，“云冠”同时搭载了安全帽检测算法，可自动检测出骑行电动车和摩托车未带头盔的驾驶员（图9（b）），执法人员可通过机载的喊话器对其进行警告。在交通事故或交通拥堵发生时，执法人员也可以调度事发地点最近的无人机机巢，通过无人机第一时间赶往现场，进行初步勘察并可通过喊话器指导现场人员。
    4.2.3　大气污染监测 监测城市空气污染的常规方法是空气质量监测站。空气质量监测站的测量精度高，但存在成本过高、占地面积大、维护成本高等问题，此外，这些站点是局地尺度的，只表示一个监测点及其周围有限区域的空气质量，而无法提供某些特定区域空气污染的详细空间分布。例如，在工业区，网格化的空气质量数据有助于环保人员发现空气污染的热点，定位超标排放的工厂。为此，在本研究中，无人机配备了空气质量传感器（Sniffer4D灵嗅），该传感器一次可检测8种气体和颗粒物浓度，包括VOC、SO2、CO、NO2、PM1.0、PM2.5、PM10、O3和2个气象变量（气温和相对湿度）。以图10中两个区域为例，这两个区域存在27家涉及气体污染排放的工业企业，本研究采用临近的两台无人机，搭载Sniffer4D灵嗅传感器，对上述区域开展定点监测。图10展示了2021年某日对两个区域进行监测的结果（仅展示部分指标）。利用常规手段，对如此多且较大范围的企业进行大气排放物的监测，需要经过大量人口排查和实地采样工作，本研究采用无人机搭载气体传感器，同时利用远程无人机遥感网控制系统，可实现对区域内任意指定区域的大气污染的实时监测。利用该方法，有望实现对工业区、城市关键区域的定时、定点的网格化大气环境质量监测，为城市大气污染的源头摸排与治理提供重要的技术手段。

    | 低精图 4.2.4　水质监测 水产养殖是丹灶镇的重要产业，近年来，水产养殖业呈现稳步增长态势。在水产养殖不断发展的同时，其造成的环境风险也随之增加。丹灶位于珠江的北江和西江交汇之处，养殖尾水造成的周边水域污染，将对珠江口海域造成极大的污染风险（
    单既亮 等，2019； 葛小君 等，2022； 徐润生 等，2007）。水质监测是评价水质情况与水污染防治的主要依据，常规的水产养殖水质监测方法包括人工采样和在线监测，通常需要大量的人力和经济成本，且覆盖范围有限，无法由点到面获取区域水质分布情况。卫星遥感虽然已经被广泛应用于地表水质监测（
    彭保发 等，2018； 闻建光 等，2007），一方面受云雨影响，光学遥感影像的有效观测频次难以保障，另一方面，养殖池塘面积较小，卫星影像的空间分辨率有限，往往难以准确反映池塘的水质情况。
    本研究将低空无人机遥感网与实地采样相结合，开展区域内水体污染情况调查。以2022年某日在重点区域开展的水样采集为例，采集33个地面监测点位水样进行检测，地面水样使用采水器采集表层水（水面下0.5
    m），检测的水质项目包括化学需氧量、悬浮物、叶绿素a、总磷、总氮等。在采集水样的同时，控制3台无人机在重点区域开展无人机多光谱影像的同步采集。利用多项式模型对采集的多光谱影像进行5种水质参数的反演，分别是叶绿素a、化学需氧量、悬浮物、总氮和总磷，经过对比实验，各参数反演所用波段组合及精度评估如表1所示，局部区域反演结果如图11所示。结合低空无人机遥感手段，可以通过少数的实地水样采集，实现重点区域高分辨率的养殖池塘水质制图，并可以快速定位污染超标的池塘，为环境监测和执法部门开展水环境污染的风险评估和治理提供可靠的基础信息。低空无人机遥感将可以为相关部门提供定时定点的水质监测，并实现污染超标池塘的精确定位。未来，将结合水质在线监测手段，构建空地协同的水质监测传感网络，进一步提高低空无人机遥感网在城镇水环境监测中的效率和精度。

    王柯 等，2017； 张昌赛 等，2017）。当前，输电线路的无人机巡检仍然主要依赖人工操作无人机完成，自动化程度较低，且存在误操作的安全隐患。 本研究采用了基于三维激光点云的自动驾驶三维航线规划，利用高精度的输电线路三维激光点云数据，综合考虑无人机飞行能力、作业特点、飞行安全、作业效率、起降条件、相机焦距、安全距离、巡查部件大小、云台角度、机头朝向等的基础上进行全自动航线规划，输出架空输电线路高精度地理坐标、可重复飞行作业航线规划成果以供多旋翼无人机进行自动化作业。此外，集成了360°单线激光雷达挂载，可进行25
    m范围内输电线路的360°全方位扫描测距检测，实现远距离精准测量和智能避障，可确保在GPS、RTK信号丢失情况下的飞行安全。 本研究构建了多类型/目标缺陷库，包括8万张220
    KV，500 KV线路的绝缘子、防震锤、悬垂线夹等铁塔关键部件标注，以及绝缘子自爆、鸟巢、防震锤破损、销钉缺失等常见缺陷的标注。通过预训练的YOLOv5模型，实现前端的缺陷实时识别，平均检测率达到91.25%，检测速度可以达到149毫秒/图片。本文将无人机三维航线规划技术、激光避障技术与低空无人机遥感网技术相结合，并在无人机遥感网运营系统中集成三维航线规划、缺陷标注与智能识别功能，实现了输配电线路的自动化巡检（图12）。

    本文提出的低空无人机遥感网及其应用模式推动了无人机遥感的区域组网监测技术的发展和应用，为基层城镇治理提供了高效、精准、先进的解决方案。在实际应用中，无人机遥感网仍面临诸多挑战与问题，也将是低空无人机组网观测未来的发展趋势。
    （1）多载荷集成作业。实际应用中，不同的任务往往对无人机载荷有不同的需求，由于现有无人机与载荷以及不同载荷之间互相独立，且当前无人机载重有限，因此，仍需要根据任务需求更换载荷。未来，硬件层的多类型载荷集成将是无人机载荷的发展方向。轻小型无人机的载荷将向多任务、标准化、模块化发展，并实现多类型载荷的协同作业，比如光学相机、多光谱相机、激光雷达，乃至气体传感器的集成，多类型载荷的集成将使无人机遥感网的应用更加智能化和自动化。
    （2）多链路多模式信号通讯。目前无人机通讯链路过于单一，影响数据回传质量，随着国家对无线电通讯协议的放开，无人机将采用更多通讯方式进行通讯，不同通讯链路可以互相备份，根据实际需要进行自动切换，如平时采用2.4/5.8
    Ghz进行无人机通讯，当巡查距离较远则切换至1.4 GHz，当在市区飞行因楼层遮挡过多影响信号时则切换至4G/5G进行无人机通讯，无人机回到基站后则切换至基站内部的WIFI信号进行采集数据的回传。网络连接方式也可以根据应用需求采用多种模式，单基站应用时采用简单的点对点通讯，但多基站应用时则采用自组网通讯，使无人机可以实现去中心化，支持跳飞、轮飞等特殊作业方式，除此之外，在遥感网中还可以专门配置信号中继站，只负责进行信号的中转，低成本解决因信号遮挡作业范围较短问题。
    （3）自主协同与“航母式”无人机遥感网。未来，低空无人机智能基站将成为重要的无人机新型基础设施，随着边缘计算、云计算和通信技术的发展，无人机的多机协同自组网和智能化运行，将是未来无人机遥感网及应用领域的重要趋势，个体无人机将摆脱遥控器，实现集群化、智能化、规模化和多样化的应用。此外，针对固定式无人机基站监测范围有限问题，未来，“航母式”无人机基站将是重要的发展方向。“航母式”无人机基站通过移动指挥车放飞无人机，能够同时搭载多台无人机和异地起飞降落，实现移动式的机动性无人机组网监测。
    （4）空天地协同监测体系。无人机低空遥感网具有机动、灵活等优势，但在一些应用场景中，仍只是卫星遥感的辅助和补充，例如，在大范围的生态环境、农情、气象、海洋环境监测中，卫星遥感仍是主要的技术手段。此外，物联网在智慧城市、智慧农业等应用场景中逐渐发挥作用，物联网具有更高的准确性和时效性，但监测尺度小、运维成本高，是其主要的不足。空天地一体化的监测技术体系是目前遥感传感网融合发展的趋势（
    陈能成 等，2020），然而，三者的协同应用仍是相互独立的。未来，随着垂直起降固定翼、复合固定翼无人机的发展，无人机智能基站将有更多样的形式和更广泛的应用，同时，卫星遥感、低空无人机传感器、物联网高度集成融合的空天地协同传感网络将成为重要的发展方向，可以支撑高频次、大范围、常态化的同步观测，也有望推动未来低空无人机遥感网及其应用的重要突破。
    （5）数据管理、融合与共享。无人机获取的数据具有大数据的典型特征，一方面，无人机数据采集门槛低，数据存量已经呈现井喷式增长，另一方面，受限于标准化程度低、处理分析技术能力有限等问题，大量的数据难以有效利用，数据处理分析的自动化和智能化程度低，数据融合难、复用难，已成为无人机遥感发展的技术瓶颈之一。此外，由于无人机采集数据精度较高，加之无人机应用的不断大众化，在保障数据安全的前提下，数据的有效共享和流通是无人机应用面临的巨大挑战。未来，无人机遥感数据的汇聚和共享的信息基础设施，以及不同时空、不同传感器、不同机构和个人采集的无人机遥感数据的组网应用及其标准化，将是无人机遥感网重要的研究方向；融合地理空间智能、时空大数据、摄影测量等一系列技术的新一代无人机遥感数据处理技术也将是未来无人机遥感网需要解决的关键技术。

    The most important environmental problem facing the world currently is climate
    change [1], with the rising sea level being one of the most important consequences
    for intertidal zones [2]. Climate change affects numerous parts of the Earth’s
    ecosystem, as well as human organization and quality of life. The effects of a
    globally changing climate, manifested in rising sea levels, more frequent occurrences
    of prolonged droughts, and other extreme climatological phenomena, can be predicted
    and forecast only on the basis of reliable and long-term multiparametric measurements.
    In this sense, The Seventh National Communication and Third Biennial Report of
    the Republic of Croatia under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
    Change (UNFCCC), among other things, emphasize Water and Marine Resources Management
    as a vulnerable sector. It is also emphasized that climate change will have significant
    direct and indirect effects on agriculture due to the trend in rising sea levels
    and the salinization of karst aquifers. This especially refers to river valleys,
    estuaries, and deltas that are predominantly used for agriculture and, at the
    same time, are at high risk of various degradations due to climate change. Although
    the rise in sea level has been recorded throughout the 20th century, these processes
    have intensified towards the end of the century [3]. According to the 2013 report
    of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is very likely that
    the global mean sea level rose by 1.7 (1.5 to 2.9) mm year−1 between 1900 and
    2010 and by 3.2 (2.8 to 3.6) mm year−1 between 1993 and 2010 [4,5]. Coastal areas,
    which are home to more than 60% of the world’s population, and characterized by
    intensive human activities such as tourism and agriculture [6], are particularly
    vulnerable to seawater intrusion (SWI), leading to groundwater quality degradation
    with adverse effects on surface water resources and associated agroecosystems
    [6]. Coastal landforms, or deltas, represent the transition between the riverine
    and marine environments [7] and are highly sensitive to natural changes and climatic
    influences from the downstream sea (sea level rise, tides, waves) and upstream
    rivers (freshwater inflow) [5]. At the same time, vulnerability is further exacerbated
    by increasing human activities such as land reclamation, land use change, irrigation,
    and groundwater extraction [8]. SWI and salinity patterns in deltas result from
    the interplay of morphology and topography, tidal regimes at the river mouth,
    and salinity fluctuations between marine and freshwater discharge [1]. In the
    long term, SWI may lead to serious consequences in terms of the degradation of
    water quality for specific purposes such as drinking water, industrial use, and
    agriculture [9]. As seawater is denser, it may intrude beneath the freshwater
    and form a saltwater wedge [10], which plays an important role in the distribution
    of both chemical and biological variables and their effects on water quality in
    general [11]. Seawater can intrude into surface waters and easily spread inland
    along rivers and natural or artificial channels, and easily infiltrate groundwater.
    More recently, human interventions such as the excessive overexploitation of freshwater
    resources and alteration of natural river flows (e.g., construction of hydropower
    plants and dams) [12] have exacerbated the situation leading to periods when river
    flow is reduced to a threshold beyond which it cannot prevent seawater from intruding
    inland [10,13]. In situations of low inflow situated upstream, seawater can intrude
    for kilometers and deteriorate the chemical properties of the water of coastal
    plains and valleys [13]. The result is the salinization of groundwater and the
    increase in salinity of streams, rivers, and lakes, and the mobilization of salts
    in the soil profile [14]. Considering the salinization of surface and groundwater,
    soils are most at risk [15]. Soil salinization is a global problem and is one
    of the main problems of soil degradation, as saline and alkaline soils cover over
    932 million ha worldwide, or about 7% of the total land area of the Earth [16]
    and 30 million ha in Europe or about 3% of the total land area of Europe, mainly
    on the Mediterranean coast [17]. More frequent and severe droughts, irregular
    precipitations, and changes in sea levels are expected to exacerbate salinization
    processes [5], which in turn could lead to desertification in many Mediterranean
    agricultural areas [18]. During the 1990s, the Mediterranean coast experienced
    an increased sea level rise of up to 5 mm year−1 among all coastal areas [19],
    which increased the SWI into coastal areas. Some of the important Mediterranean
    deltas affected by SWI include Ebre in Spain [20], Po in Italy [21], Neretva in
    Croatia [22], and Nile Delta as one of the largest deltas in the world [23]. In
    addition, the Nile Delta aquifer is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs in
    the world [23] and could be highly affected by SWI and possible rises in sea levels
    in the future. Recent studies show that SWI impacts in the Nile Delta can be observed
    in groundwater up to 45 km from the coast [24], while a projected 1 m sea level
    rise would inundate 32% of the total area of the Nile Delta, resulting in a 15%
    reduction in the available freshwater volume [25]. The importance and, at the
    same time, the extreme vulnerability of river deltas to climate change [26], especially
    rising sea levels and SWI, necessitate the establishment of environmental monitoring
    systems, especially water monitoring [27]. Although many countries have well-established
    surface and groundwater monitoring systems regulated by national legislation [28]
    that aim to preserve valuable agroecosystems and mitigate the effects of climate
    change, not many of them are automated and still rely on sampling and laboratory
    analysis. While sampling-based monitoring is useful for general water quality
    characterization and the detection of long-term trends and seasonality, high-frequency
    automated monitoring enables the quantification of extremes, short-term trends,
    and the sub-daily variability of water quality parameters [29]. For some parameters,
    such as pH weekly or monthly, sampling could be sufficient [30], but for parameters
    such as phosphorus [31,32], nitrates [32], and especially electrical conductivity
    [33], continuous high-frequency data could provide significant benefits in understanding
    the hydrological and hydrochemical behavior of different water bodies [32]. The
    main objective of this review is to present different approaches in water quality
    monitoring, focusing on the development, benefits, and potential challenges of
    automated continuous monitoring systems. We also present the implementation of
    such a system in a river delta influenced by a range of natural and anthropogenic
    processes, where the system can be used to collect high-frequency data on the
    state of the agroecosystem. 2. Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) According to the
    international organization for standardization (ISO), monitoring is defined as
    the programmed process of sampling, measuring, and recording or signaling, or
    both, of various water properties, often with the aim of assessing compliance
    with established objectives [34]. Water quality monitoring (WQM) refers to the
    collection of representative information on the physical (temperature, turbidity,
    color, electrical conductivity (EC), suspended solids, sediment), chemical (pH,
    dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), nutrients, organic and
    inorganic compounds), and biological (algae, bacteria, viruses) characteristics
    of various water bodies in both spatial and temporal scales [35] and can effectively
    guide water resource protection for safe and clean water [36]. WQM is of both
    local and global interest and is usually regulated by legislation [28], such as
    the Water Framework Directive [37] in the European Union. To understand the process
    dynamics and changes of a watershed, a well-designed WQM network is essential
    [35]. The design of WQM systems is a complex field and requires specialized knowledge
    [38], which has recently evolved to include specific and focused topics such as
    eutrophication [39], acidification, salinization, and various types of contaminations
    [35]. When designing a monitoring network, several things, such as the number
    and spatial distribution of WQM stations, the objective of monitoring, as well
    as sampling frequency and variables selection [35], should be carefully considered.
    There are two different approaches to water quality monitoring. The traditional
    approach to water quality monitoring using water samples and costly laboratory
    analysis is still the most commonly used in both researchers and established water
    quality programs. On the other hand, automated devices such as sensors, water
    quality probes, and even remote sensing techniques have recently been used to
    reduce costs and labor and collect data at a high frequency. Development of Automated
    Continuous WQM Systems As water resources were recognized as a national priority
    in the first half of the 20th century, water quality surveys, the precursor to
    WQM, were used to characterize water suitability for a variety of purposes [40].
    The traditional approach to water quality monitoring based on grab sampling, typically
    taking a relatively small volume of water, usually once a month, can be quite
    challenging and is even unlikely to obtain reliable and representative results
    on water quality status [41]. In addition, it is labor intensive and can be financially
    challenging as it includes both on-site sampling and laboratory analysis costs.
    Over the next 50 years, advances in technology led to the development of the first
    continuous WQMs, which can be described as in situ monitoring with a higher temporal
    frequency. In the early 1950s, one of the first prototypes of continuous WQM,
    which measured and recorded water temperature and EC on a strip chart, was installed
    at a monitoring station at the Delaware Estuary near Philadelphia (United States)
    in 1955 [40,42]. Since then, continuous WQM has evolved, and today WQM is conducted
    using automated techniques such as sensors or multiparameter probes that typically
    measure a number of different parameters such as temperature, pH, DO, EC, turbidity,
    as well as concentrations of various ions using ion-selective electrodes (ISE)
    [43] (Figure 1). To adequately describe a variety of different natural and anthropogenic
    processes that vary on smaller time scales, the sub-daily time step would usually
    be appropriate for continuous WQM [40]. In addition to spot field or laboratory
    measurements, multiparameter probes can be used for long-term monitoring, and
    when combined with some types of telemetry solutions such as modems, data collection,
    and transmission, can be conducted remotely via GPRS, 3G, 4G, etc., without the
    need for frequent site visits [40]. Telemetry solutions provide efficiencies and
    improve the reliability of WQM because data and stations can be managed remotely,
    and the time between field maintenance trips can be extended [40], reducing labor
    and costs. Figure 1. Scheme of automated continuous WQM. Automatic monitoring
    devices nowadays produce relatively reliable, high-frequency data, provided that
    some sort of quality assurance is performed [41], and many countries, such as
    the U.S. and Germany, have already started to transform their monitoring programs
    by using automatic sensors [44]. There are many commercially available technologies
    and instruments for monitoring water quality parameters such as pH, EC, temperature,
    and DO in (near) real-time that provide reliable data [45]. Over the past 20 years,
    many researchers, although addressing different problems in different areas [46,47,48],
    have used some type of multiparameter probe that has measured different parameters.
    Recently, several continuous autonomous WQM systems/platforms have been developed
    worldwide. When developing WQM systems with sensors for continuous measurements,
    it is important to consider the objective of the research and the type of water
    body and to select the variables of interest accordingly [49]. An example is the
    research of [50], which investigated the effects of drought on ecosystem metabolism
    (gross primary production and ecosystem respiration) using high-frequency in situ
    data on DO from the Connecticut River watershed (U.S.). The DO, water level, temperature,
    and EC were measured using Eureka Manta 2 multiparameter probes at 15 min intervals
    over a 2-year period, with on-site calibration performed at least once a month
    to ensure proper functioning. Similarly, [51] investigated ways to improve chlorophyll-a
    estimation in the Krishnagiri Reservoir, a major source of irrigation water in
    Tamil Nadu, India, by using remote sensing and in situ measurements. For the in-situ
    measurements, the Aquaread 2000 multiparameter sonde was used to measure temperature,
    salinity, EC, TDS, and chlorophyll-a in sampling campaigns during 2019–2020, and
    the results were used to develop time-series forecasting models. A more complex
    and advanced system for monitoring and collecting hydrometry, water quality, suspended
    sediments, and bedload data has been developed and implemented by a group of authors
    [49]. The multi-instrument platform RIPLE (River Platform for Monitoring Erosion)
    was developed using commercially available sensors (except for the fiber optic
    turbidity meter) to measure discharge, water quality, and sediment flux variables,
    and with a user interface that allows the visualization of data and remote configuration
    of the platform. All sensors are controlled by a data logger with a 10 min measurement
    interval and data transmission via 3G/GPRS. The system has been implemented on
    two rivers in the French Alps, the Romanache in Bourg d’Oisans (September 2016–October
    2018) and the Galabre in La Robine sur Galabre (since October 2018), to demonstrate
    the proper functioning of the system. On a larger scale, ref. [52] a wireless
    sensor network called SoilWeather has been developed as an operational in situ
    network for river basins that provides (near) real-time information on weather,
    soil moisture, and water quality with high temporal resolution. The established
    network covers the entire 2000 km2 Karjaanjoki River basin (Finland) with a total
    of 70 sensor nodes: 55 weather stations, four nutrient monitoring stations, and
    11 turbidity monitoring stations. Data are collected at high frequency, once per
    hour for nutrient measurements and at 15 min for all the other sensors. Real-time
    data are made available in the form of graphs and tables in two different internet-based
    data services provided by the sensor vendors and are accessible only to project
    participants. Due to the large number of sensors collecting data with high temporal
    frequency, relatively high maintenance resources and effective data quality control
    must be ensured. Although the system is still under development, it was concluded
    that sensors collecting water quality data require more fieldwork than meteorological
    and terrestrial data collections, so no reduction in the fieldwork is expected
    compared to traditional sampling-based monitoring. In addition to commercially
    available systems, which still require significant financial investment [53],
    much recent research has focused on the development of low-cost prototypes for
    water quality monitoring, many of which are based on Arudino platforms [54,55]:
    an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
    Ref. [56] developed a prototype river water quality monitoring system consisting
    of commercially available individual sensors that measure the pH, temperature,
    light, EC, DO, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). The sensors were coupled
    with the Arduino Mega 2560 to collect and process the data. After testing, preliminary
    results showed that, with proper calibration, the sensors could provide accurate
    results over extended periods of time and may be suitable for continuous long-term
    water quality monitoring. [57] made the prototype more suitable for field and
    long-term deployment, especially in coastal areas where temperature and salinity
    were important parameters affecting the coastal environment. They designed a probe
    with sensors for temperature and conductivity (Atlas Scientific) based on an Arduino
    platform with a data logging attachment. Measurements were compared to a commercially
    available YSI 6600 probe, and it was found that the RMSE was 1.35 ppt for salinity
    and 0.154 °C, indicating that this type of device may be used as a low-cost alternative
    to more expensive instruments. Two different approaches can be taken in designing
    and developing continuous WQM systems: The use of commercially available and reliable
    sensors in conjunction with data acquisition instruments. The development of low-cost
    prototypes based on open-source hardware (OSH). While the latter is less expensive,
    they require additional expertise, especially with regard to calibration and validation.
    In addition, these systems are not yet suitable for long-term deployment in diverse
    environments such as rivers, streams, and coastal areas, but it is hoped that
    future development will enable the use of low-cost platforms for continuous water
    quality monitoring. Both commercially available and developed WQM sensor systems
    generally measure a similar set of water parameters such as temperature, pH, EC,
    and DO, with pH and EC in addition to TDS and salinity (which can be derived from
    EC), most of which are essential for monitoring SWI into the coastal surface and
    groundwater resources. 3. Overview of the Automated Continuous Monitoring System
    (ACMS) in Neretva River Delta (NRD) 3.1. Neretva River Delta The NRD (Figure 2)
    is located on the southern Adriatic coast in Croatia (43°00 N, 17°30 E), covering
    an area of more than 12,000 ha, of which about 5000 ha have been converted into
    agricultural land through numerous complex reclamation projects throughout history,
    creating a polder-type land that is used mainly for citrus and vegetable cultivation
    [58]. The functionality of the polder-type land system is maintained by a complex
    network of hydrotechnical solutions, including a series of pumping stations, canals
    of different orders, sluices, and embankments that prevent the area from flooding
    [22]. A more detailed characterization of the area is given by [58]. The area
    has a Mediterranean climate with dry, hot summers and humid, mild winters. The
    mean annual rainfall for the weather station Ploče is 1077 mm, with most of the
    rainfall occurring in the period from October to April. The mean annual air temperature
    is 15.9 °C, with January being the coldest (7.0 °C) and July being the warmest
    month (25.7 °C). The NRD is not only an important source of income through agricultural
    production but also an important natural resource due to the diversity of flora
    and fauna. Figure 2. Project area and installed sensors (modified map form DELTASAL
    web portal). Although the problem of SWI and salinization of the surface and groundwater,
    and thus, the risk of soil degradation, occurs throughout the Croatian coastal
    area, these processes are most pronounced in the NRD, which is considered one
    of the most vulnerable areas in Croatia for climate change. This issue is also
    addressed in the strategic document “The Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change
    of the Republic of Croatia until 2040 with a view to 2070” [59], which proposes
    a wide range of climate change adaptation measures in the areas of fisheries and
    hydrology, as well as water and marine resource management, agriculture, biodiversity,
    forestry, and health. It highlights that climate change will have significant
    direct and indirect impacts on agriculture due to the trend in rising sea levels
    and salinization of karst aquifers, such as the NRD, resulting in occasionally
    or even permanently saline water resources that are used for the irrigation of
    agricultural crops [60,61]. This can have numerous negative consequences for the
    agro-biocoenosis of the delta. Agricultural soils are particularly at risk, as
    their structure changes due to high sodium and chloride concentrations, which
    can lead to a long-term decrease in soil fertility and use value [62], directly
    affecting the decline in yield and quality of agricultural crops [58]. Due to
    its location and geological and hydrogeological features, the NRD is under the
    significant influence of the Adriatic Sea. The NRD is a tectonically formed karst
    depression where eroded material transported by the upstream river has been deposited
    on the limestone bedrock over geological time [58]. The area consists of three
    main aquifers: (I) an unconfined, mostly fine sand layer with a depth of up to
    10 m, (II) a compact clay layer with variable depth (10–25 m), and (III) a confined
    gravel layer with variable depth to the bedrock [63]. The NRD is a typical salt
    wedge estuary due to its microtidal environment and high freshwater inflows [64].
    During periods of low freshwater inflow (summer), seawater enters the Neretva
    riverbed and forms a salt wedge that can extend more than 20 km upstream from
    the river mouth [13,65]. During periods of higher freshwater inflow from the catchment,
    the salt wedge is pushed downstream toward the Adriatic Sea. The mean annual discharge
    is set at 290–330 m3 s−1 and varies seasonally between 40–200 m3 s−1 in summer
    and over 1600 m3 s−1 in winter [66]. It is estimated that at a discharge rate
    of about 500 m3 s−1, the salt wedge is completely displaced from the Neretva riverbed
    [13]. In addition to the pronounced salt wedge, due to its proximity to the Adriatic
    Sea and the karst characteristics of the valley, the sea also intrudes directly
    into the karstic coastal aquifer and degrades the quality of surface and groundwater
    resources. 3.2. Monitoring of Water and Soil in NRD In complex ecosystems, the
    establishment of a reliable, comprehensive monitoring system is necessary because
    it enables high-quality and timely decision-making. In this sense, three types
    (i.e., stages) of WQMs have been established at the national level: surveillance,
    operational, and investigative monitoring, implemented by EU legislation—Water
    Framework Directive—WFD [37] and national legislation—Croatian Water Act [67]
    by the Croatian Waters (Public Water Management Company). Surveillance monitoring
    is used to establish baseline quality and assess long-term changes, while operational
    monitoring is used to provide additional data on water bodies that are at risk
    or do not meet the environmental objectives of the WFD [68]. Both surveillance
    and operational monitoring are mandatory for member states and are established
    at a national level. The third type of monitoring, investigative monitoring, is
    used in special cases and to address specific problems. In Croatia, one of the
    investigative monitoring systems is set in the NRD to monitor soil and water salinity.
    The monitoring system in its current form was established in 2009 [69] and focuses
    on salinization problems in order to identify long-term changes that have natural
    (SWI) and anthropogenic (agriculture) causes and to provide effective data on
    the state of the environment to farmers and decision-makers. To address various
    processes and practices, water and soil salinity are monitored in four major polders
    (Vrbovci, Luke, Vidrice, and Opuzen ušće) in the area and at several additional
    locations outside the polders. Water monitoring consists of surface and groundwater
    monitoring with traditional monthly sampling campaigns. Surface water samples
    are collected at four major watercourses, four pumping stations, and seven drainage
    canals, while groundwater samples are collected at seven shallow piezometers (4
    m deep), which are located in the center of each polder and at two additional
    locations. A more detailed description can be found in [22]. Traditional WQM with
    monthly sampling, while the most reliable monitoring approach due to its inclusion
    of laboratory analysis, may not be sufficient to detect all the rapid changes
    that occur in dynamic environments such as river deltas between two sampling events.
    To detect such changes, it is important to develop and implement an ACMS that
    can provide data in (near) real-time and include a range of sensors to monitor
    various parameters, including climatic, hydrologic, soil, and water quality parameters.
    3.3. Site Selection In 2020, two different polders of the NRD, Vidrice, and Luke,
    were selected for the implementation of an ACMS. In the design and implementation
    of an ACMS, the selection of representative sites is crucial. With this in mind,
    based on more than a decade of water quality monitoring in the NRD [69,70], two
    representative sites were selected for the implementation of an ACMS. The two
    sites differ in many aspects, such as their position in the Delta and distance
    from the sea, dominant salinization processes, soil characteristics, and finally,
    land use, including the degree of use and different agricultural practices. The
    Vidrice polder (Figure 2) is located on the left bank of the Mala Neretva River
    and covers an area of about 580 ha. The Mala Neretva River is one of the three
    remaining armlets of the Neretva River, which was originally designed for flood
    control with sluices installed at both ends. The sluice in Opuzen is located at
    the mouth of the Neretva River into the Mala Neretva River and is primarily used
    for flood control, while the other one is located at the mouth of the Mala Neretva
    River into the Adriatic Sea and is mostly closed, preventing seawater from entering
    the river. The area is described in detail in [71]. Today, the main function of
    the Mala Neretva River is to provide fresh water for the irrigation of agricultural
    land downstream from Opuzen. The Vidrice polder has an average elevation of −0.44
    m a.s.l. with a low of −2.61 m a.s.l. and the water level in the polder is maintained
    by constant pumping at the Prag pumping station with an installed capacity of
    6.45 m3 s−1 [63] located at the end of a 9.4 km long primary drainage canal. The
    excess water is pumped into the Mala Neretva River. Most of the agricultural parcels
    in the Vidrice polder are used for the intensive cultivation of citrus fruits,
    mainly mandarins. Due to its location, the Vidrice polder is under the strong
    influence of the Adriatic Sea, with seawater intruding directly into the deep
    and shallow aquifer [63]. The other site is located in the Luke polder (Figure
    2): one of the first polders created in the NRD in the 1960s. The polder is located
    on the right bank of the Neretva River and covers an area of 290 ha, which is
    mainly used for vegetable production. Today, however, many of the agricultural
    plots have been abandoned due to unresolved ownership issues and degradation as
    a result of the salinization of water and soil resources [69] or have low-intensity
    agricultural production. Unlike the Vidrice polder, the salinization in the Luke
    is derived from the Neretva River and the salt wedge rather than from the groundwater.
    Salt wedge affects the water quality in the polder throughout the year, especially
    in summer when the inflow from the catchment is low; the irrigation demand is
    the highest. The average elevation of the polder is −1.37 m a.s.l. with the lowest
    point at −3.04 m a.s.l. In order to protect the area from flooding and to ensure
    the groundwater level stays below the pedological layer [63], water is pumped
    from the polder through the pumping station Luke with an installed capacity of
    2.45 m3 s−1 to the Neretva River downstream of the polder. 3.4. Automated Continuous
    Monitoring System ACMS installed in the NRD consists of water quality monitoring,
    soil salinity monitoring, surface water regime monitoring, and the monitoring
    of weather conditions with a number of sensors. Water (groundwater and surface
    water) and soil monitoring are set at both Vidrice and Luke monitoring locations
    (ML). Vidrice ML is set in a mandarin orchard, while Luke ML is set on a parcel
    with intensive vegetable production, mostly cabbage, melon, and watermelon. In
    addition, at Vidrice ML, stations for monitoring the surface water regime such
    as water level and velocity in canals at several positions throughout the polder,
    and an automatic meteorological station for monitoring weather conditions are
    installed. Locations and installed sensors are shown in Figure 1. Data from each
    sensor were collected in (near) real-time with a high temporal resolution and
    were managed through a newly developed database and a web portal available for
    various project stakeholders (Figure 3). Figure 3. Scheme of DELTASAL ACMS. 3.4.1.
    Monitoring of Surface Water and Groundwater Quality Water salinity refers to the
    presence of major dissolved inorganics such as Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Cl−, SO42−,
    and HCO3− [72]. Electrical conductivity (EC) is a numerical expression of the
    ability of water to conduct an electric current [72] and is a function of ion
    concentration in the solution [73]. Because it can be measured easily and quickly
    with a variety of conductometers, EC can be used as a surrogate measure for TDS
    and salinity [74]. As described, the current monitoring system in the NRD is set
    with monthly water sampling [70], which is sufficient for the detection of long-term
    changes in water quality [34] and potential long-term trends [29]. For detecting
    sudden changes in the water quality that may occur in environments such as river
    deltas that are influenced by a range of natural and anthropogenic factors, sub-daily
    intervals or continuous measurements may be more appropriate [34]. To monitor
    changes in EC and several other parameters at a higher temporal resolution, two
    sets of multiparameter probes are installed at each ML: one in the drainage canal
    for surface water monitoring and another in a shallow piezometer (4 m deep and
    110 mm wide) for groundwater monitoring. Water from the drainage canal is used
    for crop irrigation. Generally, probes can be used for real-time spot measurements
    [47,48] or can be deployed for automatic long-term monitoring [46,50]. The installed
    Aquaread AP 5000 multiparameter probe is made from marine grade aluminum, anodized
    for corrosion and biofouling resistance, and can operate at a temperature range
    of −5 °C to 70 °C. The probe is fitted with a set of pre-installed sensors to
    measure temperature, depth, pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), EC, TDS,
    specific seawater gravity (SSG), resistivity, salinity, and DO. The measurement
    ranges for all the parameters are given in Table 1. In addition, the probe can
    be fitted with several other sensors, optical such as turbidity and chlorophyll,
    or ion selective sensors (ISE), such as ammonia, chloride, calcium, nitrate, and
    fluoride. The probes are cleaned and calibrated according to the manufacturer’s
    instructions [48] using the recommended solutions, once a month from May to September
    due to algal growth and to prevent biofouling and twice a month from October to
    April when the temperatures are lower, and the algal growth on the probes is reduced.
    Table 1. Sensors integrated into ACMS with measuring parameters, ranges, accuracy,
    and resolution. Each individual probe is connected to a single modem for data
    collection and transmission by means of wireless data connection to the GSM network
    (GPRS). The collected data are usually sent to the end user via e-mail through
    the GDT Server. The system, which includes both the probe and the modem, is fully
    autonomous and powered by a solar panel and set of batteries in case of the panels
    not working properly. The data collection interval is set to one hour, which is
    a balance between the higher temporal resolution of the data (as opposed to monthly
    monitoring) and extending the life and durability of the sensors, especially the
    pH sensor, which needs to be replaced more frequently. 3.4.2. Monitoring of Soil
    Salinity Soil salinity is a measure of the concentration of all soluble salts
    in the soil water and is usually expressed as electrical conductivity (EC) [75].
    In the laboratory, it is usually determined using the saturated soil extract (ECe)
    [76], and in the field, it is usually measured by determining the apparent electrical
    conductivity (ECa) [77]. ECa represents a measure of bulk electrical conductivity
    [78]. Today, ECa is determined using soil sensors, many of which use time domain
    reflectometry (TDR) technology to simultaneously measure ECa and the soil water
    content [79]. Under the investigative monitoring system, soil sampling campaigns
    are carried out twice a year, after the dry summer season (the end of September)
    and after the wet winter season (the end of March) [70]. Current soil sampling
    and monitoring can only detect seasonal changes, such as the accumulation of salt
    in the profile (dry season) and the leaching of salts (wet season). A higher temporal
    resolution of soil salinity data could be beneficial for agricultural production
    planning, especially during the irrigation season when changes may be more pronounced
    due to the varying quality of available water used for irrigation. To monitor
    (near) real-time soil salinity resulting from both the irrigation and capillary
    rise of groundwater, a set of four soil sensors was installed in close proximity
    to the piezometers at both MLs. Meter TEROS 12 TDR sensors that monitored soil
    temperature, moisture and ECa were installed at four depths, every 25 cm up to
    100 cm of the soil profile (Table 1). The salts that accumulated in the soil originated
    either from the surface waters used for crop irrigation or from shallow groundwater
    whose level depended on climatic conditions (rain) as well as an anthropogenic
    activity such as the constant pumping of excess water through the pumping stations.
    A set of sensors at each location was connected to a data logger that can store
    and send (near) real-time data to a cloud-based application (via SIM card). The
    measurement interval was set to 15 min. The sensors were factory calibrated, and
    no further soil-specific calibrations were performed. The soil monitoring system
    is also power-autonomous with a small solar panel and researchable batteries.
    3.4.3. Monitoring of Surface Water Regime The surface water monitoring setup installed
    in the Vidrice polder consists of four monitoring stations—three of which are
    located on the primary canal, with their respective positions reflecting the main
    inflow points from the secondary canals, and one located in the secondary canal
    adjacent to the surface water salinity multiparameter probe. The stations (Geolux
    HydroStations) are equipped with an LX-80 Radar Level Sensor for monitoring water
    levels and an RSS-2–300 W radar for monitoring water surface velocity (Table 1).
    The stations are equipped with a SmartObserver datalogger for (near) real-time
    data transmission and are powered by solar panels. All measurements were recorded
    at 15 min intervals, synchronized, and sent to the cloud-based database. 3.4.4.
    Monitoring of Weather Conditions Weather monitoring plays a central role in understanding
    the hydrologic cycle and is used in many different fields, including agriculture.
    Automated weather stations generally use various meteorological sensors to monitor
    and report weather elements such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure,
    wind speed, and precipitation [80]. Weather data for the NRD was usually obtained
    from the national Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service at the end
    of each year for the closest station to the research area (Ploče). To enable the
    (near) real-time weather data collection, an automatic weather station that measures
    a number of parameters such as air temperature and humidity, wind speed, global
    radiation, and precipitation (Table 1) at 15 min intervals was installed at Vidrice
    ML. The weather station also provides information on potential evapotranspiration
    (PET): an important parameter for calculating water requirements and crop irrigation
    scheduling. The station is autonomous and powered by a solar panel. Data were
    sent via SIM card to a desktop or mobile application provided by the manufacturer,
    where the data could be managed and downloaded. 3.4.5. Developed Data Base and
    Web Application for Various Stakeholders A normalized database was developed to
    store and retrieve various measurements in a uniform manner. A network of online
    sensors from four different vendors was established, with each vendor having its
    own protocol for data transmission. The providers Pinova, METER, and Geolux have
    their own websites with API (application programming interface) for retrieving
    current measurements, with METER and Pinova returning JSON (JavaScript Object
    Notation) objects each in their own format, while Geolux returned data in the
    CSV (comma-separated values) format. The vendor Eijkelkamp (Aquaread), on the
    other hand, regularly sends data in email attachments in a CSV format. On the
    DELTASAL server side, a communication service regularly queries the providers’
    websites and checks for incoming emails, analyzes the data, and inserts the analyzed
    data into the database (Figure 2). Both the public and administrative portals
    are served by the. NET core services, which run on the application server. The
    public portal is implemented in the Vue.js and Vuetify frameworks, while the administration
    portal is implemented in Vue.js, which is supported by Devextreme components.
    The administration portal allows system administrators to maintain all relevant
    database catalogs, check system status, authorize users, and perform advanced
    queries. The public portal allows authorized users to visualize measurement locations
    on the map and view the graphs of selected parameters at selected locations in
    a given time period. The available data through the public portal is primarily
    used by agricultural producers and agricultural advisory agency staff who support
    farmers in the region. The public portal is also available to local staff of Croatia
    Waters: a public company responsible for the maintenance and management of the
    Neretva River watershed. From late 2020/early 2021, when the system was installed
    and fully operational, until November 2022, more than 8 million individual data
    measurements from the water, soil, and weather sensors were collected. 3.4.6.
    Data Usage and Application The ACMS installed at two sites in the NRD enables
    data collection at a high temporal resolution. With a resolution of 15 min for
    all sensors except the multiparameter water quality probes (resolution is set
    to 1 h), a total of 4512 raw data are collected daily. Data are collected from
    sensors installed in various components of the environment, including the hydrosphere,
    lithosphere, and atmosphere, to provide a more comprehensive picture of the processes
    affecting the river delta in the context of the changing climate, particularly
    SWI. Such systems are extremely valuable because they can detect sudden changes
    that cannot be detected by traditional grab sampling monitoring [81], especially
    in aquatic environments. The data collected by such systems can have a variety
    of applications. Collected data are available to project stakeholders such as
    farmers, decision makers (agricultural advisory service and water management companies),
    and academic researchers. Farmers can utilize the data in (near) real-time to
    plan their production and adjust agricultural practices to agroecosystem conditions.
    In the NRD, water from drainage canals is typically used to irrigate agricultural
    crops. The quality of the irrigation water depends on climatic conditions as well
    as the daily polder maintenance (i.e., pumping), so surface water quality data,
    along with precipitation data and PET calculations obtained from the weather station
    and soil moisture data from the soil sensors, can be used to plan irrigation.
    Most of the crops grown in the NRD are sensitive to high water and soil salinity,
    especially citrus trees [82] and strawberries [83]. Therefore, farmers can monitor
    not only the quality of the water used for irrigation but also the salt movement
    and dynamics in the soil profile with soil sensors. Because salts accumulated
    in the soil profile can come either from irrigation or from the capillary rise
    in saline groundwater [84], monitoring groundwater levels and quality multiparameter
    probes installed in shallow piezometers are also important. Data collected from
    weather stations allows farmers to anticipate possible pest invasions and plan
    crop protection measures. Decision-makers can also benefit from data collected
    with ACMS. Agricultural advisory service staff can use the data to help farmers
    plan their production and develop guidelines for site-specific agricultural production
    based on the quality of the available water and soil resources. Regular polder
    maintenance is critical for the NRD because most of the agricultural land is below
    sea level. Data on water quality and regime, particularly water levels, can be
    used to adjust pumping regimes [81] to both meet the requirements of maintaining
    safe water levels in the polders and ensure that farmers have good quality water
    to meet their irrigation needs, which is necessary for achieving high yields and
    high-quality crops. Finally, academic researchers from various areas of expertise,
    such as agriculture, computer engineering, civil engineering, chemistry, etc.,
    can use the data to develop models to predict the future values of different parameters,
    which can be useful to other stakeholders. In general, simulation and forecasting
    models for water quality can be grouped into three broad categories: mechanism,
    stochastic, and regression models [85]. Mechanism models are used to analyze the
    evolution of the internal mechanism of different water bodies [86]. They usually
    require a large amount of input data, such as terrain features, water flow, and
    level, flow rate, water quality index, human activities, etc., and have a complex
    structure. Nevertheless, they are widely used in research, and among the best-known
    models are SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) [87] and WASP (Water Quality
    Analysis Simulation Program) [88]. On the other hand, stochastic and regression
    models are based on statistical techniques [85] and predict water quality by exploring
    time series characteristics and data structure, and they generally require fewer
    data than mechanism models. Many different stochastic time series models are used
    in hydrology. However, the most commonly used is the ARIMA model (autoregressive
    integrated moving average model), which is used to predict various hydrologic
    and water quality variables such as precipitation [89], water level [90], nitrate
    concentration [91], salinity [92], and ions such as Cl−, SO42−, HCO3−, Ca2+, Mg2+
    [93]. As for regression models, the linear regression model is one of the simplest
    and most common machine learning (ML) algorithms used in many different research
    areas [94]. Thanks to technological development, especially in computer science,
    more complex ML models are now being used to solve problems in water research
    [95]. A variety of different algorithms can be used for water quality prediction,
    such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree
    (DT) random forest (RF), and finally, many different types of artificial neural
    networks (ANN) [95]. Since ML models are data-oriented [96], they can be a powerful
    tool for predicting water quality parameters, especially when big data from continuous
    monitoring are used [97]. The developed and validated models can be used to predict
    short and long-term changes that can ultimately serve as guidelines in planning
    the future management of water and soil resources in threatened agroecosystems
    such as river deltas that are under the direct influence of climate change, particularly
    rising sea levels, and SWI. 4. Benefits and Challenges of ACMS The use of ACMS
    in water quality monitoring offers many advantages over traditional monitoring
    with grab sampling. ACMS enables real-time, periodic, and reliable data collection
    [28]. Many commercially available technologies have been implemented through ACMS,
    such as multiparameter probes, which provide a reliable means of detecting anomalies
    in water systems [45]. The automatic collection of data at high temporal frequencies,
    as opposed to traditional monthly sampling, allows the detection of sudden changes
    in water quality parameters as a result of natural and anthropogenic influences.
    The systems can be easily updated with additional sensors, and the collected data
    can contribute to multidisciplinary studies to understand the functioning of critical
    zones [49], such as coastal areas and river deltas. Multiparameter probes measure
    multiple parameters simultaneously, and among the most common are temperature,
    pH, EC, turbidity, DO [28], and, more recently, nutrient concentrations with ion-selective
    electrodes (ISE). Provided that the real-time data collected are validated, they
    can serve as a powerful tool to enable timely and effective decision-making by
    various stakeholders such as farmers, watershed management companies, academic
    researchers, etc. Although the initial cost of such a system may be higher, it
    can be reduced in the long run by reducing laboratory analysis and field visits,
    especially when parameters such as EC and temperature are measured, as they are
    less affected by biofouling and do not require frequent calibrations [98]. Sensor
    data can also be used as surrogates for measuring other parameters by using regression
    analysis to provide estimates [99]. A water quality surrogate is a continuous
    sensor measurement that is used as a proxy for statistically estimating the concentration
    of a water quality parameter that cannot be readily and easily measured or for
    which it is impractical to collect at high temporal frequency [40,100]. Some of
    the published surrogate models can be used to predict various parameters such
    as the concentration of sediments, suspended solids, chloride, dissolved solids,
    nitrogen, phosphorus, and trace element concentrations using easily measured variables
    such as stream flow, turbidity, water temperature, EC, and rainfall [40]. As mentioned
    earlier, the collected big data can be used not only as surrogate models for forecasting
    but also to develop accurate and reliable stochastic and ML models for the short
    and long-term prediction of water quality parameters that can be used to develop
    guidelines for future management. Nevertheless, there are some drawbacks to the
    use of ACMS. One of the main factors limiting continuous water quality monitoring
    is certainly sensor biofouling, as it reduces the sensitivity of the sensors and
    interferes with their readings [98]. Optical sensors such as turbidity and DO
    are more affected than pH, EC, and temperature [98]. Regular field visits with
    maintenance and calibration are important to inspect instruments for possible
    damage, control instrument drift, and avoid physical and chemical interference
    and biofouling. Calibration intervals vary from once a month to several times
    a year, depending on the manufacturer and sensor type [53]. Another drawback is
    the limited number of parameters that can be reliably and accurately measured.
    Although ISEs are commercially available to measure concentrations of various
    ions such as calcium, magnesium, chloride, ammonium, nitrate, etc., they have
    several potential limitations, including frequent calibration, low stability and
    robustness, low life expectancy [101], susceptibility to interference from other
    ions, and biofouling [40]. Collecting data at a high temporal resolution can also
    present significant challenges for data storage and processing. If collecting
    data from multiple vendors, the development of a unified database should be considered.
    Erroneous and missing data are not uncommon in ACMS and must be tracked and corrected
    by automated algorithms, possibly with alerts for missing or out-of-range measurements
    [52]. Finally, remote locations may not be suitable for telemetry data transmission
    due to low or no reception signal, but still, on-site data collection might be
    considered in such cases. The complexity of water monitoring systems, resulting
    from a large number of parameters (physical, chemical, and biological) that can
    be monitored in aquatic ecosystems, limits the possibility of a more comprehensive
    approach in a review article. The selection of parameters for ACMS depends primarily
    on the research objective and available technology; therefore, the focus of this
    review was only on parameters that were closely related to surface and groundwater
    salinization as a result of SWI in coastal areas. In addition, only those parameters
    that can be reliably measured have been addressed in this review, based on our
    own experience as well as the experience of other researchers. For a more comprehensive
    overview of continuous automated water quality monitoring, it would be important
    to explore other proximal and remote sensing technologies for monitoring various
    pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, such as nitrate, phosphorus, etc., which may
    serve as input data for the development and implementation of rapid alert systems
    in ACMS. 5. Conclusions Recent technological advances have enabled WQM systems
    to operate automatically and continuously, using different types of sensors and
    multiparameter probes to measure a variety of parameters. To date, several automated
    WQM systems have been developed and deployed in various environments globally.
    Hence, in this review, special emphasis is placed on ACMS within the case study,
    which enables high-frequency continuous data acquisition from a range of sensors
    in (near) real-time. To facilitate data management and data analysis, the development
    of a unified database should be considered. A unified database with the development
    of a web-based portal or application enables easy data availability to various
    stakeholders directly (e.g., water management companies) or indirectly (e.g.,
    farmers) involved in the WQM. The implementation of ACMS can have a significant
    impact on detecting rapid changes in the environment due to natural and anthropogenic
    impacts, which are further exacerbated by climate change. The true value and utility
    of an ACMS are demonstrated not only by its ability to quantify extremes, short-term
    trends, and sub-daily variability but also by the fact that this monitoring approach
    provides easier and faster access to data for end users. There are several important
    recommendations that should be considered when designing and implementing an ACMS.
    Particular attention should be paid to site selection, as monitoring frequency
    is not a limiting factor in ACMS; regular maintenance of equipment, the control
    and validation of collected data, the clear definition of stakeholders and end
    users of the data, and finally, building a unified database that allows the easier
    use and processing of collected big data should be considered. Future developments
    of WQM equipment and systems should aim to make automated WQM systems more available
    in terms of lower cost, greater reliability, and accurate measurements with less
    interference and biofouling, longer periods between calibrations, and the development
    of additional sensors such as specific ion electrodes for more comprehensive monitoring
    of aquatic ecosystems. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.R. (Marko Reljić)

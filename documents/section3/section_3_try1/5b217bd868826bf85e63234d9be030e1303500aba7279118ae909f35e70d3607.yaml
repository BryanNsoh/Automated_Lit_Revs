    technology has been studied for many years, but due to insufficient investment
    in research and development of irrigation equipment, it cannot be effectively
    promoted and applied. In order to improve the water use efficiency of farmland
    irrigation, the automatic monitoring of groundwater level change, soil moisture
    change, and crop seasonal growth status is realized in the ditch or pump well
    irrigation area. An intelligent measuring terminal for water-saving irrigation
    based on RN2026 microcontroller is developed. The terminal uses the coefficient
    of “water conversion by electricity” to automatically convert the water consumption
    of farmers and uses the price mechanism of water rights to affect farmers’ water
    conservation. In combination with changes in groundwater level, crop evapotranspiration,
    and dynamic changes in soil moisture, precision irrigation strategies are automatically
    generated to guide farmers to use water rationally. Through the function and performance
    experiments, the results show that the error of the coefficient of “water conversion
    by electricity” is less than 1%, the error of electric energy measurement is less
    than 0.5%, the estimated value of average water use right per unit arable area
    is consistent with the actual value, and the predicted value of daily average
    soil moisture change is consistent with the measured value. The equipment has
    strong adaptability to the environment, high measurement accuracy, strong data
    processing ability, low cost, and other characteristics. It meets the requirements
    of water-saving irrigation technology in practical applications and has good promotion
    and application value. 1. Introduction In northern China, natural rainfall usually
    cannot meet the needs of crop growth, and pumping groundwater or ditch water for
    irrigation is the decisive factor for stable and high yield of crops [ 1]. In
    recent years, the proportion of agricultural irrigation water has become higher
    and higher, causing the groundwater level to drop year by year, which has a great
    impact on the local climate and environment [ 2]. Therefore, it is necessary to
    further strengthen the intelligent construction of agricultural water-saving irrigation
    measurement terminal, improve the efficiency of agricultural irrigation water,
    and realize the sustainable development of agricultural irrigation. At present,
    most irrigation intelligent measurement devices charge by swiping the card, by
    installing a card reader module inside the smart electricity meter, or connecting
    the card reader module outside the data collector. Wang et al. developed the remote
    water and electricity metering equipment for agricultural motor wells and used
    radio frequency identification technology to complete the accurate management
    of water use in irrigation areas [ 3]. Li et al. designed an intelligent double
    control system of water and electricity for agricultural irrigation well house.
    Through a four-layer distributed partial closed loop structure, the charge management
    for water and electricity in one card is realized [ 4]. Liu et al. designed an
    intelligent control system for wireless irrigation of seedlings based on ARM and
    STM32 and realized high-precision agricultural irrigation based on S3C2410A microprocessor
    and mobile data services [ 5]. The results show that these methods mainly solve
    the household metering problem of farmers’ irrigation electricity. However, due
    to the high investment cost of agricultural irrigation metering equipment, the
    lack of water right restraint mechanism, crop growth status monitoring, soil moisture
    monitoring, and other measures, the farmers have not formed a precise irrigation
    strategy to guide farmers. Farmers often rely on experience to flood irrigation,
    resulting in serious waste of water resources. In view of the high investment
    cost of agricultural irrigation metering facilities and the inability to monitor
    crop growth status, soil moisture status, groundwater level status, and water
    right constraint mechanism in real time, this paper adopts the method of “water
    conversion by electricity” based on water flow velocity to measure water consumption
    in real time through irrigation electricity consumption, replacing the traditional
    water meter metering method [ 6]. With the intelligent measurement terminal equipment
    as the carrier, it can sense the agricultural growth state, soil moisture, groundwater
    level, power consumption data, irrigation water volume, and other data; formulate
    accurate irrigation strategies according to the water level changes, water right
    indicators, and soil moisture in different regions; and guide farmers to conduct
    scientific irrigation and save water, which is of great significance for the sustainable
    development of agricultural irrigation [ 7]. 2. The Overall Design of Intelligent
    Measurement Terminal System The intelligent measurement terminal system is mainly
    composed of RN2026 microcontroller, AC sampling circuit, LCD module, card swiping
    button module [ 8], motor control, data storage module, water level monitoring,
    and soil moisture monitoring module; the overall system architecture is shown
    in Figure 1.    Figure 1  Architecture diagram of intelligent measurement terminal
    system. During the operation of intelligent measurement terminal, the microcontroller
    collects the change of groundwater level through the water level monitoring module,
    drives the servo motor according to the water level change limit set by the user,
    and makes the groundwater pump handle the reasonable position [ 9]. After the
    farmer swipes the card and presses the key, the alternating current sampling circuit
    inputs the voltage and current signals to the RN2026 microcontroller, which calculates
    the power consumption of each farmer’s irrigation, and calculates the farmer’s
    water consumption through the “water conversion by electricity” coefficient. The
    electricity consumption process and fee deduction of farmers are displayed by
    liquid crystal display [ 10]. The soil moisture monitoring module is used to monitor
    the change of soil moisture content in real time and timely remind farmers of
    scientific irrigation according to the preset precision irrigation strategy. The
    power consumption data and water consumption data of farmers are reported to the
    power consumption information acquisition system through 4G module or broadband
    carrier module. 3. The Hardware Design of Intelligent Measurement Terminal 3.1.
    The Design and Analysis of Main Control Circuit Due to the poor operating environment
    of the intelligent measurement terminal, it operates in high temperature, high
    humidity, and other environments for a long time. Document 3 uses STM32F103 chip,
    which has the advantages of the highest clock frequency, large storage capacity,
    and rich peripheral interface resources and the disadvantages of no metering function,
    requiring external electricity meters and water meters [ 3]. Document 5 uses S3C2410A
    chip, which has the advantages of high performance, flexible configuration, and
    strong data processing capability. The disadvantage is that it requires external
    power and water sensors, and the system stability is poor [ 5]. In view of the
    above reasons, the main control circuit of this terminal selects a RN2026 microcontroller
    with high integration, wide voltage of 2.8 V~5.5 V, high accuracy, high reliability,
    and low power consumption, and the power error is less than 0.1%. The chip integrates
    arm Cortex-M0 core, 256 Kb flash, 48 KB SRAM, 7-channel Σ-ΔADC, three-phase metering
    and fault detection module, metering accuracy self-detection module, four-way
    multiplexed SAR ADC, eight-way multiplexed GP-ADC, independent power supply hardware
    temperature compensation RTC, a variety of communication peripheral interfaces,
    etc., which are applicable to the metering, communication, control, and other
    functions and performance requirements of the well irrigation measurement terminal
    [ 11]. The traditional water metering method needs to install a water meter, which
    is costly and requires a lot of maintenance. In order to save costs and improve
    the reliability of the product, this paper selects the RN2026 chip with the electric
    energy metering function to realize the water metering function through the “water
    conversion by electricity” algorithm and avoid installing water meters and other
    metering equipment. The intelligent measurement terminal adopts the modular design
    method, collects the voltage and current signals of motor well irrigation in real
    time through the AC sampling module, and uses the RN2026 built-in measurement
    algorithm to accumulate the electric energy data in real time. The peripheral
    circuit of the microcontroller RN2026 is configured with card swiping module,
    liquid crystal display module, EROM data storage, ESAM data encryption, 4G communication,
    HPLC broadband carrier communication, and other modules. See Figure 2 for details
    [ 12]. Under normal operation, the power consumption of the intelligent measurement
    terminal is about 0.05 W. In the slack season of irrigation, the intelligent measurement
    terminal automatically enters the sleep mode. The power consumption in the sleep
    mode is about 0.01 W, and all the power consumption costs are borne by the power
    company.    Figure 2  The main control circuit of intelligent measurement terminal.
    3.2. The Power Supply Design Analysis The intelligent measurement terminal is
    generally installed at the end of the line in the low-voltage platform area, and
    voltage instability often occurs, so the reliability of the power module is required
    to be high. The power module adopts the switching power supply scheme design,
    using R231H switching power module, three-phase four-line width range AC power
    275 V-475 V input, the output is 12 V DC voltage, the error is less than ±2%,
    the output rated current is 280 mA, and the maximum output current is 350 mA.
    The power module supplies power to the HPLC broadband carrier module and outputs
    DC5V and DC3.3v voltages through JW5018 and SGM2203 DC step-down chips, respectively,
    to supply power to 4G module, RN2026, and other peripheral circuits. See Figure
    3 for the detailed design principle [ 13].    Figure 3  The power module circuit
    diagram. In order to improve the reliability of the power module and prevent the
    impact of lightning short-term overvoltage on the intelligent measurement terminal,
    add varistors VR1, VR2, and VR3 at the input end of the power module, and pass
    the surge test at the same time. In addition, in order to avoid damage to the
    power module caused by overvoltage during ground fault, MZ11-06E800 thermistor
    is added at the input end to ensure that the power module can recover automatically
    after the ground fault is removed. 3.3. The Design of Data Storage Circuit The
    data storage of intelligent measurement terminal is composed of FLASH storage
    and EEPROM. FLASH storage is used to store fixed data such as device address,
    water price, electricity price, and user information [ 14]. FLASH memory adopts
    MAX25L6406 chip, the fast programming time is 0.6 milliseconds, the erasability
    and programming times are 100000, the data retention time is 20 years, and the
    data storage capacity is 64 KB, such as so FLASH_CE, FLASH_SO Interfaces are connected
    with RN2026 master chip. See Figure 4 for detailed circuit.    Figure 4  The FLASH
    storage circuit diagram. The design of EEPROM storage adopts CAT24C512WI chip,
    with a storage capacity of 512 k, which is used to store dynamic data of intelligent
    measurement terminal, such as electric quantity data, power consumption record,
    fault record, and other data. See Figure 5 for the detailed design circuit.    Figure
    5  The EEPROM storage circuit diagram. 3.4. The Alternating Current Sampling Circuit
    Alternating current sampling circuit is the core circuit of intelligent measurement
    terminal, which is divided into voltage sampling and current sampling. The voltage
    sampling is composed of six 294 K and two 1 K high-precision voltage dividing
    resistors [ 15]. The voltage signals at both ends of the RA7 resistor are collected
    through the UAP and UAN pins of the microcontroller RN2026, and the phase A voltage
    is generated through analog-to-digital conversion. Since the load of the intelligent
    measurement terminal is a high-power motor well pump, the high-precision 500 : 1
    current transformer is used for current sampling. The input end of the transformer
    is connected with the transient diode Z1 and connected with the IAP and IAN of
    the microcontroller RN2026 through R1 and R3 step-down resistors and symmetrical
    RC filter circuit. The accuracy of voltage and current sampling is 0.2%. See Figure
    6 for the detailed circuit [ 15]. This circuit module takes the voltage and current
    sampling of phase A as an example, and the principle of phase B and phase C is
    consistent with that of phase A.    Figure 6  The alternating current sampling
    circuit diagram. 3.5. The Analysis of Card Swiping Circuit In the process of swiping
    cards to use electricity or water, users swipe cards frequently. If contact cards
    are used, repeated swiping of cards is likely to cause poor contact [ 16]. In
    order to improve the service life of cards and card readers, this card swiping
    circuit is designed with noncontact RF card reading technology. The induction
    coil is arranged inside the card [ 17]. Through the electromagnetic induction
    principle of the coil, the card balance, user information, etc. are read into
    the RN2026 microcontroller. The user can swipe the card normally only by putting
    the card close to the card reader. See Figure 7 for the detailed data interaction
    process [ 18].    Figure 7  The card swiping data interaction diagram. 4. The
    Function Design of Intelligent Measurement Terminal 4.1. The Calculation Method
    of Irrigation Water Volume and Algorithm of “Water Conversion by Electricity”
    Coefficient The total water consumption in Hebei is mainly composed of groundwater,
    surface ditch water, natural precipitation, and water purchased from other regions
    [ 19]. After removing daily domestic water, industrial production water, environmental
    protection water, and standby water, the remaining distributable water is agricultural
    irrigation water [ 20]. This study collected the amount of water resources, agricultural
    irrigation water consumption, and unit arable land water consumption in each city
    by collecting the official websites of municipal governments in Hebei region [
    21]. According to the principle of dynamic balance of water resources, taking
    the total amount of available water resources in the city area as the upper limit
    of water consumption in the city area, and based on the total amount of water
    used in various industries, the profit and loss balance relationship is calculated
    [ 22]. For urban areas where the total annual water consumption exceeds the local
    available water resources, the insufficient part shall be included in the adjustment
    of agricultural irrigation water, which shall be averaged to the total area of
    arable land in the whole urban area to obtain the adjustment amount of irrigation
    water per unit of arable land area [ 23]. Subtract the adjustment amount from
    the irrigation water consumption per unit of arable land area in the previous
    year to obtain the revised average water consumption authority per unit of arable
    land area in the current year. See the following formula for the detailed calculation
    method: In formula (1), is the total amount of water resources in an urban area,
    is the water volume of surface ditches, is the underground water volume, is the
    purchased water volume, and is the natural rainfall of the year; the unit of the
    above variables is m3. In formula (2), is the water consumption for agricultural
    production in an urban area, is the domestic water consumption in an urban area,
    is the water consumption for environmental protection, is the industrial water
    consumption, and is the reserve water consumption; the unit of the above variables
    is m3. In formula (3), is the irrigation water consumption per unit cultivated
    area, the unit is m3·m-2, and is the total area of arable land in an urban area,
    the unit is m2. In order to solve the problem of lack of water metering facilities
    for motor well irrigation, the method of electricity to water coefficient is referred
    to as “water conversion by electricity,” and the water consumption of users can
    be calculated by measuring electricity alone [ 24]. According to the “water conversion
    by electricity” coefficient, the agricultural irrigation water consumption is
    calculated, and the optimized water consumption per unit of arable land is used
    as the upper limit of irrigation water. In the urban areas of Hebei Province,
    where groundwater or ditch water is used as irrigation water, the upper limit
    of irrigation water is the irrigation water consumption per unit of arable land.
    According to the “water conversion by electricity” coefficient calculated by the
    intelligent measurement terminal, and further based on the actual measured irrigation
    power consumption and the corresponding measured water volume in Pingxiang County,
    Xingtai City, the above “water conversion by electricity” coefficient is verified.
    According to the geographical location of farmers’ cultivated land in Pingxiang
    County, the geographical location of motor wells used for irrigation, and the
    upper limit of water consumption per unit of arable land area corresponding to
    this location, the water consumption of each irrigation farmer is obtained by
    using the calculation coefficient of “water conversion by electricity,” and the
    intelligent measurement terminal is used to adjust the irrigation power consumption
    of each farmer as the control method of the total amount of irrigation water [
    25]. Through the intelligent measurement terminal, the data of pumping speed,
    pumping time, pump diameter, and so on of the pump in the motor well are collected,
    and the “water conversion by electricity” coefficient based on the water flow
    speed is calculated in a certain time. This coefficient is reused to other adjacent
    wells, and the water consumption is obtained by multiplying the power consumption
    each time by the “water conversion by electricity” coefficient, thus greatly reducing
    the investment cost of water metering facilities. The calculation of the “water
    conversion by electricity” coefficient is divided into the following four steps.
    The first step is to calculate the cross-sectional area of the pumping pipeline.
    See formula (4) for the detailed calculation method. In formula (4), is the sectional
    area of the pumping pipeline, the unit is m2, is the circumference, and is the
    pipeline radius, the unit is m, which is determined according to the parameters
    indicated on the factory nameplate of the pump. The second step is to calculate
    the pipe length. See formula (5) for the detailed calculation method. In formula
    (5), is the length of the pumping pipeline, the unit is m, is the water flow velocity,
    the unit is m·s-1, and is the irrigation time, the unit is H. The third step is
    to calculate the volume of irrigation water. See formula (6) for the detailed
    calculation method. In formula (6), is the volume of irrigation water, the unit
    is m3, is the cross-sectional area of the pipe in formula (1), and is the length
    of the pipe in formula (5). The fourth step is to calculate the coefficient of
    “water conversion by electricity.” See formula (7) for the detailed calculation
    method. In formula (7), is the coefficient of “water conversion by electricity,”
    is the electricity generated within the irrigation time , the unit is kWh, and
    is the volume of water used in formula (6). By establishing the mode of standard
    wells, the “water conversion by electricity” coefficient of standard wells is
    distributed to other ordinary power consumption management terminals, and water
    metering and charging businesses can be carried out. If a water meter is installed
    at each measuring point to measure irrigation water consumption, the cost of water
    meter installation and maintenance is about CNY 5000 per year. Therefore, compared
    with the method of installing water meters, the cost of each measuring point can
    be saved about CNY 5000 by using the method of “water conversion by electricity.”
    For the ditch irrigation mode, this method is also applicable, but the depth of
    the ditch should be considered when selecting the water pump, and the pump matching
    the depth of the ditch should be selected as far as possible to better ensure
    the accuracy of the “water conversion by electricity” coefficient. 4.2. The Control
    and Management of Water and Electricity Charges The water charge is calculated
    by multiplying the water consumption by the water price with the method of “water
    conversion by electricity.” The water price is formulated and issued by Hebei
    Provincial Development and Reform Commission. The annual three-level quota water
    volume is allocated according to each 666.67 m2 of land. The first-level water
    price is , the second-level water price is , and the third-level water price is
    ; the unit is CNY·m-3. For the applied water volume is , , and ; the unit is m3;
    the water price is set according to the principle of . The water and electricity
    charges are controlled by the intelligent measurement terminal. The water and
    electricity prices are set in the terminal storage unit, or when the price changes,
    the water and electricity prices are distributed remotely through the electricity
    information acquisition system [ 26]. After the user starts to swipe the card
    to use electricity, the terminal will automatically settle the electricity consumption
    each time according to the start time, initial electricity consumption, end time,
    and end electricity consumption of each user [ 27]. According to the “water conversion
    by electricity” coefficient, the current water consumption is converted, and the
    current electricity and water consumption expenses are obtained according to the
    electricity price and water price set in advance. After the power consumption
    is completed, the terminal automatically deducts the water and electricity fees
    in the user’s electricity purchase card and returns the deducted balance to the
    user’s electricity purchase card [ 28]. See Figure 8 for the detailed process.    Figure
    8  The control flow chart of water and electricity charges. 4.3. The Control and
    Management of Water and Electricity Charges In this paper, the APSIM (agricultural
    production systems simulator) algorithm model is used to determine the soil moisture
    control index [ 28]. The algorithm model combines the management system, environmental
    conditions, crop growth characteristics, and other parameters and checks the actual
    parameters obtained based on the product of the above three parameters. The verified
    algorithm model can accurately predict the growth and yield of crops in the same
    environment. Based on the measured data of irrigation water for wheat, corn, and
    soybeans planted in Pingxiang County, Xingtai City, the APSIM algorithm model
    is validated, and the optimized algorithm model is used to calculate the growth
    and impact on yield under different irrigation water indicators. According to
    the simulation effect, the irrigation time, frequency, and water consumption of
    different crops are formulated to obtain the highest crop yield under the condition
    of optimal indicators. The irrigation data for checking the APSIM model algorithm
    is from Pingxiang County, Xingtai City, and the validation time is from 2020 to
    2021, a total of two crop growth seasons. The soil layer above 85 cm of the verification
    point is sandy soil, and the soil layer below 85 cm is clay. The average water
    content of soil above 1.8 m is about 34.6%, the wilting humidity is 9.8%, and
    the soil pH value is 7.8. During the observation period, the organic fertilizer
    content in the soil layer above 25 cm is 19~22 g.kg-1, the nitrogen content is
    72~89 mg.kg-1, the phosphorus content is 22~39 mg.kg-1, and the potassium content
    is 87~118 mg.kg-1. When sowing wheat in autumn, nitrogen (360~410 kg.hm-2), phosphorus
    (160~190 kg.hm-2), potassium (21 kg.hm-2), and other fertilizers are evenly spread
    on the surface of the farmland. Nitrogen fertilizer is applied to wheat, corn,
    soybeans, and other crops at the flowering and pollination period according to
    25% of the sowing time. After soil tillage, the wheat weight is 148~190 kg hm-2
    sowing; using water sowing method, the spacing between rows is about 16 cm; corn
    is sown at equal intervals of 55 cm, with a density of 5.2~6.1 m-2. The irrigation
    experiment using APSIM model needs to focus on three irrigation modes. The flowering
    and growth period of crops needs full irrigation (FI). Combined with the precipitation
    of the year, it generally needs to be irrigated 3-6 times. When the soil moisture
    is sufficient, the critical growth period of crops (CI, irrigation in critical
    period) can be irrigated once, under the condition of sufficient soil moisture
    and the minimum irrigation mode (MI) without irrigation in the key growth period.
    The irrigation water volume is set at 65~85 mm, which is normally treated as three
    times. The experimental field is randomly selected, and each area is about . Different
    test fields are separated by more than 3 meters, and the construction of different
    test fields interferes with each other. The irrigation water is groundwater or
    ditch water, which is transported by circular pipes. The intelligent measurement
    terminal calculates the water consumption for each irrigation. During the experiment,
    the water consumption, power consumption, crop growth, and final output are recorded
    in detail. The determination of the development period of wheat, corn, soybeans,
    and other crops is recorded according to the probability of 55% of the typical
    characteristics. Records of wheat growth density and dynamic changes are determined
    at 1 m in each test field 5 lines of regional records; record the harvest quantity
    of corn at harvest time, and calculate the harvest density. Install a 2.2 m deep
    neutron tube in each test field to regularly measure the water content of the
    2.2 m soil layer. In the harvest period of crops, 90 stems of wheat, 3 soybeans,
    and 4 corn were selected for seed analysis in each experimental field; harvest
    all wheat, summer corn, and soybean plants in each test field mechanically, and
    measure the yield after each seed is naturally dried. 4.4. Dynamic Balance Monitoring
    of Soil Water Content The dynamic balance monitoring method of soil water content
    is based on the dynamic balance of soil water content in the root layer of crops,
    combined with the weather and the actual growth of crops, to monitor the balance
    of soil water content, so as to determine the soil water content in the root layer
    of crops in different development periods and then compare it with the predetermined
    soil irrigation water index, judge whether the soil needs irrigation operation,
    and measure the amount of irrigation. Assuming that the runoff in the horizontal
    direction of the soil is ignored, the change of water content in the soil layer
    of crop root activity in a certain period of time is expressed by the following
    water content balance formula: In formula (8), is the farmland water content in
    the current period, is the farmland water content in the previous period, is the
    natural rainfall in the current period, is the irrigation water consumption in
    the current period, is the water content of water vapor retained in the roots
    of crops in the current period, is the crop growth consumption in the current
    period, and is the soil leakage in the current period; the unit of the above variables
    is m3. During dry weather, the amount of soil leakage can be ignored. Wheat, soybeans,
    corn, and other crops have great differences in root states in different growth
    cycles. It is predicted according to the length of crop growth. is calculated
    according to the double coefficient method of crops. See formula (9) for details.
    In formula (9), is the crop foundation coefficient, which is affected by the crop
    leaf density and soil water content; is the evapotranspiration coefficient, which
    is affected by the shallow soil water content; is the standard evapotranspiration
    of crops, which is mainly affected by climatic conditions. The above three parameters
    are calculated according to the method of FAO-56 [ 29]. Soil moisture, climate
    change, crop evapotranspiration, and other data are monitored and collected in
    real time by the intelligent measurement terminal. According to the preset irrigation
    strategy, irrigation decision-making events are generated and reported to the
    electricity information system through the 4G communication module. The system
    sends them to farmers to guide farmers in precision irrigation. Farmers can view
    the irrigation strategy pushed by the system through the mobile phone APP and
    carry out farmland irrigation or fertilization by referring to the irrigation
    strategy. Farmers can feed back the rationality of irrigation strategies through
    mobile APP, and the system continuously optimizes the irrigation strategies according
    to the feedback of farmers to form a good interaction mechanism. 5. Experimental
    Verification 5.1. The Error Verification of “Water Conversion by Electricity”
    Coefficient The coefficient of “water conversion by electricity” is the linear
    relationship between farmers’ irrigation power consumption and water consumption.
    The water consumption is calculated according to the power consumption and used
    to collect water charges. As long as the given water consumption per 666.67 m2
    of farmland is converted into the given power consumption, the total water consumption
    can be adjusted. The coefficient of “water conversion by electricity” is the core
    parameter of regulating groundwater extraction by using intelligent measurement
    terminal. According to the irrigation power and water consumption data of farmers’
    motor wells in Pingxiang County, Xingtai City, the accuracy of the “water conversion
    by electricity” coefficient under different regional motor wells and irrigation
    modes is analyzed. The results show that in a small range, the shallow groundwater
    level, hydrogeological environment, and motor well conditions are not different,
    the “water conversion by electricity” coefficient of different farmers’ motor
    wells is relatively stable, and the pump lift, the power, and the difference of
    parameters such as water flow velocity and irrigation mode are the main influencing
    conditions. This paper selects 10 agricultural machine wells in Pingxiang County,
    Xingtai City, to verify the “water conversion by electricity” coefficient at different
    groundwater levels. When the water level of 10 agricultural machine wells is 45
    meters, the “water conversion by electricity” coefficient is between 3.55 m3·kwh−1
    and 3.63 m3·kWh−1; the coefficient is between 4.95 m3·kwh−1 and 5.33 m3·kwh−1
    when the groundwater level is 30 meters and between 9.90 m3·kwh−1 and 9.98 m3·kwh−1
    when the groundwater level is 15 meters. The above results show that the “water
    conversion by electricity” coefficient is relatively stable, which is consistent
    with the rated working parameters of the pump of the motor well, but different
    irrigation modes such as sprinkler irrigation, canal irrigation, and pipe irrigation
    have the greatest impact on this coefficient. The detailed results are shown in
    Figure 9. The horizontal axis in the figure represents the irrigation power consumption
    of farmers, and the vertical axis represents the water consumption. Three different
    types of water pumps are used to select the power consumption records of 10 households.
    The results obtained through linear fitting show that the water consumption is
    obtained by multiplying the electricity quantity by the coefficient of “water
    conversion by electricity.” In practical application, it needs to be adjusted
    according to the irrigation mode.    Figure 9  The verification results of “water
    conversion by electricity” coefficient. 5.2. The Estimation Results of Average
    Water Use Authority per Unit Arable Area Allocating the total water consumption
    in a city area to the unit arable land area and determining the upper limit of
    irrigation water per unit arable land are important measures to optimize the agricultural
    irrigation water resource management system and improve the efficiency of water
    resource management [ 30]. By collecting the recent total water resources and
    agricultural irrigation water consumption of the county from the official website
    of the county, it is estimated that the available amount of shallow groundwater
    in Hebei is 664~2984 m3·hm−2. According to the existing total water consumption
    of various industries and the accounting balance relationship, for counties and
    cities where the actual total water consumption exceeds the standard available
    water, the part exceeding the standard will be supplemented by agricultural irrigation
    water, the total amount of agricultural irrigation available water in the county
    after reduction will be calculated, and then, it will be evenly distributed to
    the arable land unit area, and based on this, the average water authority per
    unit arable land area after reduction will be obtained. See Table 1 for details.
    Table 1  The cultivated land area irrigated by groundwater and water consumption
    per unit arable area in Hebei region. According to the data in Table 1, Shijiazhuang
    has the largest average available water per unit of arable land, followed by Baoding
    and Handan, and Cangzhou has the least. In the same prefecture level city, the
    largest difference in the water volume per unit of arable land area in different
    counties and districts is Cangzhou area, from the smallest 664 m3·hm−2 to the
    largest 1918 m3·hm−2. The water volume per unit of arable land area in different
    areas varies greatly. The annual water consumption of wheat, corn, soybeans, and
    other crops in Hebei is between 740 and 860 mm [ 30], and the available irrigation
    water consumption can provide about 9%-38% of the crop water consumption. The
    available water volume in different urban areas and counties is inconsistent,
    and the water authority per unit arable land area and the appropriate irrigation
    mode need to be determined according to the actual situation [ 31]. 5.3. The Verification
    of Dynamic Equilibrium Prediction Method of Soil Water Content The dynamic balance
    method of soil water content in formula (8) is compared with the actual measured
    dynamic change of soil water content to evaluate the reliability of predicting
    the result of soil water content by using the dynamic balance method of soil water
    content [ 32]. The daily evapotranspiration (ET0) of wheat, corn, and soybeans
    during the growth period from 2019 to 2020 and the actual evapotranspiration under
    different irrigation modes are shown in Figure 10. The leaf index of wheat, corn,
    and soybean in the growth period of minimum irrigation period, critical period,
    and full irrigation period was significantly different in the middle and late
    development period; affected by the size of crop canopy and the change of soil
    moisture, the daily evapotranspiration of the three irrigation cycles gradually
    increased in different growth periods. The total water consumption of wheat in
    the minimum irrigation period, critical irrigation period, and full irrigation
    period is 284.3 mm, 388.1 mm, and 533.2 mm, respectively, and that of corn is
    212.4 mm, 278.2 mm, and 388.5 mm, respectively. The water content conditions of
    the three irrigation periods are obviously different, which provides a basic condition
    for verifying the reliability of the prediction method of soil water dynamic balance
    [ 33].    Figure 10  The change of actual evapotranspiration under different irrigation
    modes. Using the dynamic balance formula (8) of soil water content and the double
    crop estimation coefficient method of actual crop water consumption provided by
    FAO56 [ 34], the average root water content of wheat, corn, and soybeans under
    three irrigation modes from 2019 to 2020 is calculated. Among them, the root depth
    of wheat, corn, and soybean in different growth cycles is between 0 and 1.5 m.
    The maximum evaporation depth of soil water is calculated as 15 cm, and the lower
    limit of crop water consumption without water deficit is calculated as 56% of
    the total effective soil water content for wheat, 51% for corn, and 48% for soybeans.
    According to the long-term observation data of Pingxiang County, Xingtai City,
    the crop coefficients of wheat, corn, and soybean in different growth cycles are
    between 0.59 and 0.95 when there is no water deficit. When the soil water content
    of crop roots is lower than 43% (wheat) and 48% (corn) of the effective value,
    the crop root coefficient will show a linear decreasing trend according to the
    decline of water content [ 35]. When the root soil moisture content decreases
    to the wilting moisture content, the crop coefficient is 0. The average water
    holding capacity of 2 m soil layer in Pingxiang County is calculated as 34%, and
    the wilting water content is 11%. The results of the model algorithm simulation
    and the daily average soil water content using the intelligent measurement terminal
    under different irrigation modes are shown in Figure 11. The correlation coefficient
    between the simulated value and the measured daily soil water content under the
    three irrigation modes is between 0.94 and 0.96, and the similarity between the
    two is high, indicating that the above method can accurately predict the change
    of root soil water content to guide farmers’ irrigation decisions.    Figure 11  The
    daily average soil water content change. 5.4. The Performance Verification of
    Intelligent Measurement Terminal In order to verify the accuracy of the measurement
    error of the motor well irrigation measurement terminal, the experiment is carried
    out according to the requirements of GB/T 17626.3-2016 radio frequency electromagnetic
    field radiation immunity standard. The experimental ambient temperature is 23°C,
    the experimental field strength is 10 V/m and 30 V/m, and the sample direction
    is the front, side, and top surface. 80 MHz-2000 MHz pulse signal is applied during
    the experiment. During the experiment, five measurement error data were recorded
    at each frequency point. After the above experiment, the terminal error of pumping
    well irrigation measurement was less than 0.5%, which increased by 1.15% compared
    with the measurement error of 1.65% in literature [ 36], meeting the expected
    goal. See Table 2 for the detailed records of some error data. Table 2  The electric
    energy measurement error data record form. 6. Conclusion In this paper, an intelligent
    measurement terminal device based on RN2026 microcontroller is designed. The function
    and performance of the intelligent measurement terminal are verified by experiments.
    The results show that (1) the coefficient of “water conversion by electricity”
    based on water flow speed is more stable, and the coefficient error is less than
    1%, which is basically consistent with the rated working parameters of different
    types of well water pumps. (2) The estimation result of average water use right
    per unit of arable land area is basically consistent with the actual situation
    of various cities in Hebei. Shijiazhuang City has the largest average available
    water volume of arable land area, while Cangzhou City has the smallest. (3) The
    predicted results of soil moisture dynamic balance are consistent with the daily
    average soil moisture change and the actual evapotranspiration change trend under
    different irrigation modes, and the correlation coefficient between the simulated
    value and the measured daily soil moisture is 0.94~0.96. (4) The measurement error
    of the intelligent measurement terminal is less than 0.5%, meeting the test requirements
    of GB/T 17626.3-2016 RF electromagnetic field radiation immunity standard. (5)
    Compared with the traditional irrigation mode, the intelligent measuring terminal
    can save 12 m3 of water per 0.067 hm2. The intelligent measuring terminal of water-saving
    irrigation is mainly used in the pump well irrigation mode. This paper mainly
    studies the method of “water conversion by electricity” coefficient based on water
    flow speed, the establishment of water right constraint mechanism, the determination
    of soil moisture control index, and the monitoring method of soil moisture dynamic
    change. Compared with other water-saving irrigation equipment, the biggest advantage
    is to automatically generate irrigation strategies based on the groundwater level,
    soil moisture, and crop growth status to guide farmers to conduct scientific irrigation
    and achieve good application results. The current research on intelligent measurement
    terminals mainly focuses on the electricity use scenarios of agricultural irrigation
    card swiping, while in practical applications, there are electricity use scenarios
    of public rental houses, commercial streets, and other public places. In the future,
    we will study the intelligent power technology under different application scenarios,
    improve the intelligent level of equipment through remote code scanning, and meet
    the application requirements of different scenarios. Data Availability All data,
    models, and code generated or used during the study appear in the submitted article.

  description: Film hole irrigation is a new type of film-mulched irrigation technology.
    To investigate the influences of five factors—bulk density, initial soil water
    content, irrigation depth, film hole diameter and infiltration time—on the infiltration
    characteristics of film hole irrigation, 12 experiments were conducted. The infiltration
    characteristics considered were the cumulative infiltration (I), infiltration
    rate (i) and average increment of soil water content (∆θ). Two empirical models
    were established that describe the relationship of I with ∆θ and various influential
    factors. The proposed models of I and ∆θ had a root mean square error of 5.82 ml
    and 0.003 cm3 cm−3, respectively. The results revealed that the effects of initial
    soil water content and irrigation depth on I were not significant (P > 0.05) and
    that the ranking of factors according to degree of influence, from large to small,
    was infiltration time, soil bulk density and film hole diameter. Soil bulk density,
    initial soil moisture, irrigation depth and film hole diameter had highly significant
    effects on ∆θ (P < 0.01), and their ranking according to degree of influence,
    from large to small, was initial moisture content, soil bulk density, irrigation
    depth and film hole diameter. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

    of North China account for three-fifths of all farmland in China but only one-fifth
    of all water resources. This shortage of water resources has severely restricted
    agricultural and economic development in these regions (Deng et al., 2006; Song
    et al., 2010). The use of advanced agricultural water-saving irrigation technology
    and improvement of the irrigation water utilization coefficient in areas of irrigation
    would considerably ease this discrepancy between water supply and demand (Belder
    et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2006; Swatuk et al., 2015). Numerous forms of water-saving
    irrigation technology are currently being used, such as sprinkler irrigation (Maroufpoor
    et al., 2018), microsprinkler irrigation (Sarkar et al., 2008), drip irrigation
    (Ghumman et al., 2018; Sui et al., 2015), intermittent irrigation (Nie et al.,
    2011), surge-root irrigation (Zhong et al., 2019) and film hole irrigation (Li
    et al., 2017). In the arid regions of north-west China, however, sprinkler irrigation
    requires high investment and may be affected by wind. Because of factors such
    as low water quality and emitter clogging, microsprinkler and drip irrigation
    are difficult to popularize over large areas. Intermittent and bubbled-root irrigation
    require skilled labour that is lacking in north China. Therefore, a reasonable,
    economical and safe irrigation method and technology are required according to
    local conditions. In recent years, film hole irrigation is one technology that
    has attracted increasing attention. Film hole irrigation is a relatively new irrigation
    method in which a plastic film is laid on a bordered field and used for water
    conveyance through crop holes and specific irrigation holes (Saeed and Mahmood,
    2013). The total area of crop holes and specific irrigation holes is only 3–5%
    of the total irrigated area. The other 95–97% of the area is irrigated by seepage
    beside the irrigation hole (Sun, 2009). Compared with conventional surface irrigation
    (Darouich et al., 2017), this technology reduces the amount of deep seepage, prevents
    evaporation of water located between plants, and has clear water-saving and fertilizer-retaining
    effects; moreover, the flow resistance of the plastic film is low and the flow
    speed is high; therefore, furrows can be lengthened, which reduces the size of
    the temporary field project and its occupied area and improves the land utilization
    rate (Li et al., 2017). Through film hole irrigation, water is irrigated directly
    to the roots of the crop, improving the uniformity and quality of irrigation (Fan
    et al., 2019). In addition, film hole irrigation has advantages such as increasing
    temperature, preserving moisture, preventing soil compaction, accelerating the
    decomposition and absorption of organic components in the soil (Ming et al., 2018)
    and improving the quality of agricultural products; it is also suitable for dry
    surface irrigation in arid and semi-arid regions (Zacharias et al., 2016). From
    a theoretical perspective, film hole irrigation involves three-dimensional point-source
    infiltration under a low-pressure water head (i.e. irrigation depth). The infiltration
    characteristics of film hole irrigation are fundamental to determining a field
    film hole irrigation scheme with high application efficiency and distribution
    uniformity. Similar to those of surface irrigation (Darouich et al., 2017), the
    infiltration characteristics of film hole irrigation are affected by many factors,
    such as initial soil moisture content, soil bulk density, film hole diameter and
    irrigation depth. Therefore, determining the infiltration characteristics of film
    hole irrigation and identifying the main factors influencing these characteristics
    are necessary. Numerous laboratory studies and some field studies have been conducted
    on film hole infiltration during the last two decades in China, and these studies
    have mainly focused on infiltration characteristics, wetting patterns and influential
    factors and have considered both single and multi-point source infiltration. Soil
    texture was discovered to significantly influence the cumulative infiltration
    capacity and distribution and redistribution of soil water in film hole irrigation
    (Fan et al., 2019). Soil bulk density (Li et al., 2017) and initial soil water
    content (Saeed and Mahmood, 2013) have significant effects on infiltration capacity;
    soil infiltration capacity decreases with increasing soil bulk density and initial
    soil water content. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the factors
    influencing the infiltration characteristics of film hole irrigation, most have
    performed only single-factor analysis, leading to a lack of uniformity in comparisons
    of different factors. The single-variable method was employed in a few studies
    of multiple factor analysis for film hole irrigation (Li et al., 2017), but this
    method neglects the interactions of various factors. The overall effect of multiple
    factors was reported to be not the simple summation of the individual effects
    of each factor but rather the combination of various factors, which produces a
    new effect (Edwards et al., 2016). Because the infiltration characteristics of
    film hole irrigation are influenced by the interaction between multiple factors,
    identifying the dominant factors that affect film hole irrigation under the influence
    of multiple factors is required. Given the high reliability of the orthogonal
    test in exploring the influence of multiple factors (Chen et al., 2003; Li and
    Hu, 2005; Sun et al., 2011), the laboratory tests conducted in the current study
    were designed according to the orthogonal test sheet, and the free infiltration
    characteristics of film hole irrigation under the interaction between multiple
    factors were analysed. Therefore, the objectives of this study were as follows:
    (i) to investigate the effects of various factors on the water infiltration characteristics
    in film hole irrigation and then to identify the dominant factors; and (ii) to
    propose and verify empirical models that estimate the cumulative infiltration
    and average incremental increase in moisture content in a wetted body subjected
    to film hole irrigation. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Experimental design Given
    the constraints of film hole irrigation in the field, film hole diameters are
    generally determined according to the actual situation of crops. Typically, the
    diameters of film holes are 3–8 cm. The irrigation depths relative to the film
    mulch are maintained within the range of 2–8 cm. The effects of soil bulk density,
    initial soil water content, irrigation depth, film hole diameter and infiltration
    time were considered in the experiments. The first four of the aforementioned
    factors were assumed to have three levels; therefore, nine tests were designed
    according to the orthogonal test sheet. In addition, three tests were designed
    for the purpose of verification. Therefore, a total of 12 tests were designed,
    the details of which are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Experimental scheme Treatment

    water content. 2.2 Experiment material Figure 1 illustrates the laboratory set-up
    for the experiments (Li et al., 2017). Considering the symmetric characteristics
    of film hole infiltration, the soil bin, composed of 10-mm-thick transparent acrylic
    material, was designed to have dimensions of 24-cm length, 24-cm width and 60-cm
    depth. The bottom of the soil bin had numerous 2-mm parallel air vents for ventilation,
    and on both sides of the bin were side holes from which the soil sample could
    be taken for measuring the soil water content; the diameter of each hole and the
    distance between the holes were 1.5 and 5 cm, respectively. Before the soil bin
    was filled with soil, transparent adhesive tape was placed on both sides of the
    soil bin to prevent the soil from falling out of the box. A Mariotte vessel was
    used to maintain a constant irrigation head, and this vessel had an inner diameter
    of 9 cm and height of 90 cm. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Simplified
    experimental setup 2.3 Experiment methods The experiments were conducted from
    January to April 2018 at the State Key Laboratory Base of Eco-Hydraulic Engineering
    in Arid Area, Xi''an, China. Silt loam (based on the US Department of Agriculture
    Soil Taxonomy System), which was taken from Baqiao District in Xi''an City, was
    used in the experiments. Table 2 lists the particle size distribution of the experimental
    soil. Soil samples were collected from depths of 20–60 cm. The samples were air
    dried and then sieved through a 2-mm sieve. Soil moisture content was measured
    using the oven-drying method, and water addition was calculated according to the
    target moisture content. The soil was stirred after being sprayed with water and
    sealed with waterproof plastic cloth for 24 h so that the water would diffuse
    evenly. The moisture content was checked repeatedly before the soil bin was filled
    to ensure the desired initial soil water content for the 12 treatments. The film
    hole diameters employed in the free infiltration tests were 3, 5 and 8 cm. The
    soil samples were compacted into the soil bin at bulk densities of 1.30, 1.35
    and 1.40 g cm‾3 to simulate the in situ bulk density. The soil was loaded and
    compacted in the bin in 5-cm layers to obtain a homogeneous soil profile. To prevent
    evaporation completely, the soil surface was covered with a polyethylene sheet.
    The film hole device was located perpendicular to the surface of the soil bin
    to observe the movement of the wetting front. To simulate a sufficient water supply
    during film hole irrigation, an irrigation depth of 2–8 cm was maintained by the
    Mariotte bottle. The cumulative infiltration was recorded through the Mariotte
    bottle initially at small intervals (5 min) and then at large intervals (30 min).
    Because the soil used was light in colour and the wetted body had a considerably
    darker colour, the position and shape of the wetting fronts at different infiltration
    times could be painted onto the outer walls of the soil bin. Table 2. Details

    The statistical analysis software Excel 2003 and SPSS 17.0 were used for data
    processing and analysis, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted
    on the cumulative infiltration and average incremental increase in soil water
    content under the effects of different factors. The least significant difference
    method was employed to conduct multiple comparisons of significant difference
    among the various factors and at different levels. Multiple linear regression
    (MLR) was used to conduct regression analysis on the models containing various
    influential factors. The Z-score normalization method was employed for normalization
    of the data to eliminate complications caused by the dimensions and orders of
    magnitude of the data. 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Dynamic change of cumulative
    infiltration Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between cumulative infiltration
    and the infiltration time of film hole irrigation under different experimental
    treatments. Cumulative infiltration was discovered to increase with an increase
    in infiltration time. For the same infiltration time, the cumulative infiltration
    in the various experimental treatments was 255–629 ml. The cumulative infiltration
    in treatments 2 and 3 was 107 and 147% higher, respectively, than that in treatment
    9. Differences were discovered in the cumulative infiltration for each group of
    experiments, indicating that different factors had different influences on the
    cumulative infiltration in film hole irrigation. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Curves of cumulative infiltration of film hole irrigation under different
    experimental treatments To further analyse the influence of multiple factors on
    the cumulative infiltration, MANOVA was conducted, the results of which are presented
    in Table 3. The effects of soil bulk density, film hole diameter and infiltration
    time on cumulative infiltration were extremely significant (P < 0.01). Soil bulk
    density is mainly influenced by soil pores, which indirectly reflect the gas phase
    proportion and soil compactness (Bean and Dukes, 2015; Labelle and Jaeger, 2011).
    Additionally, the film hole diameter directly influences infiltration in the water–soil
    interface because larger holes lead to larger film hole areas and more channels
    through which water can enter the soil (Hu et al., 2012; Saeed and Mahmood, 2013).
    Therefore, the soil bulk density and film hole diameter strongly influence infiltration,
    which is a finding similar to those of Helalia (1993) and Li et al. (2017). The
    initial soil water content had a non-significant influence on the cumulative infiltration
    (P > 0.05) when it was 8, 12 and 16%, which is consistent with the conclusions
    of Li et al. (2017) and indicates that the soil infiltration capacity is not sensitive
    to initial water content. Thus, if the initial soil water content of the soil
    changes slowly, then the influence of soil water content on soil infiltration
    capacity can be neglected. The weak influence of initial water content on soil
    infiltration capacity has led to different research results being obtained regarding
    the effects of the initial water content on cumulative infiltration capacity and
    saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. When the initial soil water
    content of the soil changes greatly, Hawke et al. (2006) and Liu et al. (2011)
    reported that saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity increase with an
    increase of initial water content. By contrast, Lado et al. (2004) indicated that
    both types of hydraulic conductivity increase with an increase of initial water
    content. According to Table 3, irrigation depth—which was taken as 2, 5 and 8
    cm—also had a non-significant influence (P > 0.05) on the cumulative infiltration
    of film hole irrigation. The water depth was controlled within 2–8 cm because
    of the constraints on film hole irrigation in the field. Given the small range
    of values for irrigation depth, the influence of irrigation depth on infiltration
    capacity was weak, similar to the research result of Li et al. (2017). Therefore,
    when performing muddy water infiltration by using double-ring infiltrometers to
    solve the problem of muddy water precipitation caused by the automatic water supply
    through a Mariotte bottle, scholars may neglect the influence of irrigation depth
    on infiltration capacity by using the measuring cylinder method for manual water
    supply (Sun, 2009). Table 3. Influence of different factors in different levels

    on cumulative infiltration (P < 0.01), Values followed by different letters within
    the same factor in column differ significantly at P < 0.05 by the LSD test. F-value
    is the statistic of variance analysis. In general, the larger the F-value, the
    greater the influence of the factor on cumulative infiltration. Given the non-significant
    influence of initial water content and irrigation depth on cumulative infiltration,
    MLR was employed to determine the empirical formula for the relationship between
    cumulative infiltration and the other three influential factors: (1) where I is
    the cumulative infiltration of film hole irrigation (ml), μ the infiltration constant,
    γ the soil bulk density (g cm−3), d the film hole diameter (cm), T the infiltration
    time (min) and a, b and x are empirical coefficients. Using MLR, I was calculated
    to be (2) The root mean square error (RMSE) was 5.82 ml, the coefficient of correlation
    (r) was 0.995 and the coefficient of determination (R2) from the regression was
    0.991 (P < 0.01). The relatively high R2 and relatively low RMSE indicated the
    high accuracy of Equation 2 for estimating the cumulative infiltration. To verify
    the applicability of Equation 2, laboratory experiments were performed for treatments
    10–12. The values measured in the tests were compared with the values calculated
    using the model, and the results are illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 3 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison between measured and calculated values of
    cumulative infiltration The relative error between the experimental values of
    treatments 10–12 and calculated values obtained using the empirical model in Equation
    2 were −11.67 to 10.13, −9.02 to 10.19 and −10.42 to 10.34 cm, respectively. The
    experimental values of cumulative infiltration were generally smaller than the
    calculated values, perhaps because during the filling of the soil bins, the lower
    layers of soil were compacted repeatedly, resulting in a bulk density higher than
    the designed bulk density and leading to high soil compactness and lower measured
    cumulative infiltration. However, the relative errors were within ±12%, and the
    regression lines were close to the 1 : 1 line. The low errors indicated that the
    empirical model effectively describes the relationship between the cumulative
    infiltration of film hole irrigation and multiple factors, including the infiltration
    time. The empirical model presented in Equation 2 contains three influential factors,
    which have different units and orders of magnitude. Therefore, the importance
    of their effects on cumulative infiltration could not be directly determined according
    to the regression coefficients a, b and x. Thus, the data were normalized. After
    data normalization, the normalization regression coefficients a, b and x were
    −0.200, 0.105 and 0.969, respectively, indicating that infiltration time had the
    strongest influence, followed by soil bulk density and then film hole diameter.
    Two of the normalization regression coefficients were higher than 0, indicating
    that the corresponding factors were positively related to the cumulative infiltration.
    One normalization regression coefficient was lower than 0, indicating that the
    two variables were negatively related. The cumulative infiltration of film hole
    irrigation was positively related to the infiltration time and film hole diameter
    and negatively related to the soil bulk density. 3.2 Dynamic change of soil water
    infiltration rate The cumulative infiltration of film hole irrigation was differentiated
    by the infiltration time to obtain the function relationship between the soil
    infiltration rate and infiltration time in the film hole irrigation experiments:
    (3) where i is the soil infiltration rate (ml min−1). According to Equation 3,
    the soil infiltration rate decreased with increase in infiltration time. When
    the infiltration time was sufficiently long, the soil infiltration rate became
    stable. Given the different effects of various factors on the soil infiltration
    rate, partial derivatives were obtained for different factors, and then the absolute
    values were obtained to analyse the sensitivity of the soil infiltration rate
    to the various factors (Morris et al., 2014): (4) (5) Using Equations 4 and 5,
    the sensitivity of the soil infiltration rate to soil bulk density and film hole
    diameter was calculated. Higher sensitivity indicated a stronger influence of
    the corresponding factor on the soil infiltration rate (Bai et al., 2016). The
    first treatment was used as an example; the sensitivity of the soil infiltration
    rate to the factors was calculated, and the curves corresponding to changes in
    the factors are plotted in Figure 4. The sensitivity was considerably decreased
    when the corresponding factors were increased, indicating that the soil bulk density
    and film hole diameter influenced the soil infiltration rate. The sensitivity
    to soil bulk density and film hole diameter covered the range 3.19–7.69 and 0.05–0.13,
    respectively, indicating that the influence of soil bulk density was stronger
    than that of film hole diameter, which is consistent with the findings of Li et
    al. (2017). The sensitivity may have been greatly affected by infiltration time,
    in agreement with Zhong et al. (2018). The decreasing tendency of the sensitivity
    with increases in the factors was noticeable at the infiltration time of 55 min
    but less apparent at infiltration times of 190 and 360 min. For example, the sensitivity
    to soil bulk density was reduced to 3.63 at 55 min with the increase in soil bulk
    density but was reduced to 3.10 and 2.86, respectively, at 190 and 360 min. Figure

    and each factor (take the treatment 1 as an example): (a) soil bulk density; (b)
    film hole diameter 3.3 Dynamic change of average incremental of moisture content
    In film hole irrigation, the shape of the wetting body of free infiltration is
    close to a semi-ellipsoid, and the film hole device is located on the vertical
    angle of the soil bin. The volume of the wetting body is that of a one-eighth
    semi-ellipsoid, expressed as (6) where Vt is the volume of the free infiltration
    wetting body in film hole irrigation (cm3), Sx the horizontal wetting front movement
    distance (cm) and Sz the vertical wetting front movement distance (cm). According
    to the water balance principle (Valiantzas, 1997) (7) where ∆θ is the average
    incremental increase in moisture content of the wetting body under free infiltration
    in film hole irrigation (cm3 cm−3) and I is the cumulative infiltration of film
    hole irrigation (ml). The volume of the wetting body for different infiltration
    times was plotted on the horizontal axis, and the corresponding cumulative infiltration
    was plotted on the vertical axis. The slope of the curve indicates the average
    incremental increase in moisture content (∆θ) of the wetting body. According to
    the curves obtained in nine tests, which are presented in Figure 5, cumulative
    infiltration and wetting body volume had a significant linear relationship, which
    was fitted with the linear function with the interval of 0. The results are listed
    in Table 4. During the free infiltration of film hole irrigation, ∆θ did not change
    with infiltration time and thus had only one value. According to ∆θ in Table 4,
    the ∆θ values obtained from different treatments were extremely different. For
    treatments 1 and 4, ∆θ was 217 and 198% higher than that for treatment 9, respectively,
    indicating that ∆θ was related to soil bulk density, initial water content and
    film hole diameter. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Relationship between

    R2 is the coefficient of determination for the fit of the linear function to the
    experimental data. To further analyse the effects of multiple factors on ∆θ, MANOVA
    was conducted, the results of which are presented in Table 5. The influence of
    soil bulk density, initial water content, irrigation depth and film hole diameter
    on ∆θ in film hole irrigation was highly significant (P < 0.01). Under the same
    influential factors, the difference of Δθ of each factor at different levels was
    significant (P < 0.05). Table 5. Influence of different factors in different levels

    effect on average incremental of moisture content (P < 0.01). Values followed
    by different letters within the same factor in column differ significantly at
    P < 0.05 by the LSD test. F-value is the statistic of variance analysis. In general,
    the larger the F-value, the greater the influence of the factor on average incremental
    of moisture content. The empirical formula used to establish the relationships
    between ∆θ and the influencing factors was (8) where g, e, f, m and n are fitting
    parameters, θ0 the initial soil water content (%) and h the irrigation depth (cm).
    Using MLR, ∆θ was calculated as (9) The RMSE was 0.003 cm3 cm‾3, the coefficient
    of correlation (r) was 0.996 and the determination coefficient (R2) from the regression
    was 0.991 (P < 0.01). The relatively high R2 and relatively low RMSE indicated
    that Equation 9 is highly accurate for estimating ∆θ. To verify the applicability
    of the empirical model presented in Equation 2, the calculated values obtained
    for treatments 10–12 and the measured values were used in a comparison analysis,
    the results of which are listed in Table 6. The relative errors in ∆θ between
    the experimental values for treatments 10–12 and values calculated using the empirical
    model in Equation 9 were 2.76, 4.31 and −3.95 cm, respectively. The errors were
    thus generally small, indicating that the empirical model can be used to accurately
    describe the relationship between ∆θ and the multiple factors. Table 6. Comparison

    The normalization regression coefficients e, f, m and n were −0.409, −0.885, 0.144
    and 0.142, respectively, indicating that the ranking of the four variables regarding
    their effect on ∆θ, in descending order, was as follows: initial water content,
    soil bulk density, irrigation depth and film hole diameter. ∆θ was positively
    related to irrigation depth and film hole diameter and negatively related to soil
    bulk density and initial water content. Given the actual texture of soil in north-west
    China, Xi''an silt loam, a representative soil, was selected for the experiment,
    and the experimental results were remarkable. The conclusions obtained in this
    paper can be applied to other soils, but the parameters of the empirical model
    would need to be modified. The current research on the multiple factors affecting
    infiltration characteristics in film hole irrigation was mainly focused on soil
    factors (soil bulk density and soil initial water content); the technical factors
    of film hole irrigation (distance between film holes, opening ratio and water
    discharge time) will be the focus of future research. Examining the soil factors
    in stages is necessary, and such investigations can be used as the foundation
    and reference for future research on the technical factors of film hole irrigation.
    4 CONCLUSIONS The following conclusions have been drawn: the effects of initial
    soil water content (θ0) and irrigation depth (h) on the cumulative infiltration
    (I) of film hole irrigation were non-significant (P > 0.05); however, the influence
    of soil bulk density (γ), film hole diameter (d) and infiltration time (T) on
    I was significant (P < 0.05) and they are ranked, in descending order, as T, γ
    and d. An empirical model was established for evaluating the correlations between
    the factors and I, and the relative errors between the calculated and measured
    values were within ±12%; the irrigation rate was greatly influenced by γ and to
    a lesser degree d. The sensitivity was strongly affected by T. A smaller T-value
    corresponded to a greater tendency of the sensitivity to decrease with an increase
    in the factors; the average incremental increase in moisture content (∆θ) of the
    wetting body was not affected by T but was significantly strongly affected (P
    < 0.01) by θ0, γ, h and d in descending order. An empirical model was established
    that meets the precision requirement according to the verification results. The
    findings presented in this study might only be suitable and reasonable for the
    study area investigated, but the research method provides a reference for studies
    on the infiltration characteristics of film hole irrigation in other regions.

  description: Due to the shortage of water resources, serious water pollution, improper
    use of water and the occupation of agricultural water rights by other industries,
    China's agriculture will face the risk of water shortage in the future. Due to
    the amount of water resources in North China is relatively small compared with
    that in South China, coupled with extensive operating methods and the low level
    of agricultural irrigation technology, water resources are wasted seriously, the
    problem of agricultural water shortage in North China is more serious. Optimal
    allocation of water resources is one of the main measures to alleviate the shortage
    of agricultural water resources, and is an important means to achieve sustainable
    use of water resources. Accurate prediction of regional agricultural water consumption
    is the key to optimal allocation of water resources. Grey model is a method to
    study “poor information”, “small sample” and uncertainty problems, which is widely
    used in economics, finance and other fields. The amount of historical data of
    annual agricultural water consumption is not enough, which is affected by many
    factors, and has concussion. Therefore, it is suitable to use grey model to predict
    agricultural water consumption. The oscillation characteristics of agricultural
    water consumption data series have a certain impact on the prediction accuracy
    of the model. To resolve these problems, an improved fractional grey prediction
    model is proposed in this paper. Based on the monotonically decreasing non-negative
    series which transformed from the oscillation series of the agricultural water
    consumption, a multi-objective optimization model was constructed according to
    the two objective functions of “maximum (or minimum) order” and “the best fit
    of historical data”, which was solved by the improved non-dominated sorting genetic
    algorithm II (NSGA-II) method. Agricultural water consumption in the test set
    for the research areas of Tongliao city (42°15’N-45°59’N, 119°14’E-123°43’E),
    Ordos city (37°35’24″N-40°51’40″N, 106°42’40″E-111°27’20″E) of Inner Mongolia
    autonomous region and Baoji city(33°35’N-35°06’N, 106°18’E-108°03’E) of Shaanxi
    province was predicted by the grey model (GM(1, 1)) model of fractional order
    reverse accumulation, the order of which was optimized according to the results
    of the test set fitting. The average error of the prediction was 2.23%, 1.77%
    and 0.31%, respectively. In order to test the performance of the model, the model
    proposed in this paper was compared with the traditional GM (1, 1) model, traditional
    autoregressive model and the combined model based on the wavelet analysis theory
    respectively. Among them, the average prediction error of GM(1, 1) model for the
    Tongliao and Baoji city is 5.55% and 1.28%, but the detection is failed for the
    Ordos city. The average prediction error of autoregressive model for the three
    research areas is 3.34%, 4.17% and 6. 49%. The average prediction error of agricultural
    water consumption in Ordos City of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region based on the
    combination model of wavelet analysis theory is 2.87%. The results show that compared
    with GM(1, 1) model, the prediction effect of the model in this paper is better,
    which depends on the objective function of “the best fitting of historical data”
    and the objective function of “the largest (or the smallest) order” to reduce
    the learning degree of the model for noise, because the model in this paper transforms
    the oscillating data and reduces the uncertainty of the data, so compared with
    the autoregressive model without data processing, the model in this paper is less
    affected by data volatility. In this paper, the idea of fractional order “in between”
    is used to improve the traditional gray model with positive integer as order,
    which can effectively improve the accuracy of the model. At the same time, the
    method of reverse accumulation is used to increase the use of new data. On the
    whole, for the prediction of agricultural water consumption in all research areas,
    the model in this paper has the minimum error, strong generalization ability and
    certain practicability, which can provide a basis for the prediction of regional
    agricultural water consumption and the allocation of agricultural water resources
    in northern China.

    is the key to optimal allocation of water resources. Grey model is a method to

    of the model. To resolve these problems, an improved fractional grey prediction
    model is proposed in this paper. Based on the monotonically decreasing non-negative

    consumption, a multi-objective optimization model was constructed according to
    the two objective functions of \"maximum (or minimum) order\" and \"the best fit
    of historical data\", which was solved by the improved non-dominated sorting genetic
    algorithm II (NSGA-II) method. Agricultural water consumption in the test set
    for the research areas of Tongliao city (42°15′N～45°59′N, 119°14′E～123°43′E),

    respectively. In order to test the performance of the model, the model proposed
    in this paper was compared with the traditional GM (1,1) model, traditional autoregressive
    model and the combined model based on the wavelet analysis theory respectively.
    Among them, the average prediction error of GM(1,1) model for the three research
    areas is 5.55%, failed detection, and 1.28%. The average prediction error of autoregressive
    model for the three research areas is 3.34%, 4.17% and 6.49%. The average prediction
    error of agricultural water consumption in Ordos City of Inner Mongolia Autonomous
    Region based on the combination model of wavelet analysis theory is 2.87%. The
    results show that compared with GM(1,1) model, the prediction effect of the model

    KEYWORDS: Film slit irrigationnumerical simulationSWMS-2Dsimplified model Introduction
    Water shortage is of great concern for agriculture in the arid and semi–arid regions
    of China, comparing with water from urbanization, industrialization, and other
    ways of water consumption (Pereira et al. 2002; Qiu et al. 2014). Aiming to improve
    the utilization efficiency of agricultural water, advanced water–saving irrigation
    methods, such as drip irrigation, sprinkler and micro–sprinkler irrigation has
    been encouraged to be applied in northwest China (Li et al. 2000; Deng et al.
    2006; Du et al. 2010; Li 2010); however, such methods cost much. Considering the
    local specific situation and economic conditions, employing such methods has difficulties
    in poor regions. Therefore, a low–cost and high water efficiency irrigation method,
    with simple and easy operation is in urgent requirement (Valipour 2014). In recent
    three decades, agricultural film mulch technique has become a globally applied
    agricultural practice for high yields and water–use efficiency improvement. The
    surface plastic film coverage can primarily protect seedlings under arid climate,
    prevent evaporation, providing a stable soil temperature and humidity, prevent
    weed growth, reduce the use of herbicide and fertilizer, and increase yield (Lamont
    1993; Tarara 2000; Mckenzie et al. 2001; Espí et al. 2006; Chalker–Scott 2007;
    Scarascia-Mugnozza et al. 2011). Given the wide usage of plastic mulch in practice
    and its advantages, the film slit irrigation technique emerges, that is, the plastic
    film coverage is put in the field between two rows of crops seeding. Such irrigation
    method, which is widely adopted in arid and semi–arid areas of north-western China
    (Wang et al. 2016), can considerably reduce water seepage at the beginning of
    irrigation furrow, and improve irrigation uniformity; in addition, it can offer
    the strengths of surface film coverage. Mathematical models, such as winSRFR,
    have been widely applied in the design of irrigation systems to improve the efficiency
    of water application and the uniformity of water distribution (Bautista et al.
    2009). In the model, the infiltration and roughness are the key parameters to
    be determined. As with surface irrigation, the infiltration characteristics are
    the fundamental for determining a field scheme with high application efficiency
    and distribution uniformity (Nie et al. 2014). From the theoretical point of view,
    film slit irrigation is a two–dimensional linear source infiltration under low
    pressure water head (i.e., water depth above plastic mulch). Meanwhile, film slit
    irrigation is affected by many factors, such as water head, soil texture, bulk
    density, film slit widths, and spaces of slits. Several studies on film slit infiltration
    have been conducted basically in wetting patterns and infiltration characteristics
    in recent two decades in China (Yao et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2015); however,
    such researches mainly focused on empirical model simulation, ignoring how different
    factors affecting infiltration. Therefore, the key influencing factors need to
    be determined, further for infiltration modelling. Numerical simulations have
    been widely used to study soil water movement through unsaturated porous media.
    Simulations were carried out using several software, such as SWMS-2D, HYDRUS–2D,
    and HYDRUS–3D, which have been effectively applied to simulate two/three–dimensional
    irrigation (e.g., furrow irrigation, drip irrigation, and subsurface drip irrigation)
    with high accuracy in predicting the wetting pattern and infiltration characteristic
    (Šimůnek et al. 1995; Skaggs et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2007; Lazarovitch et al.
    2009; Kandelous and Šimůnek 2010; Bautista et al. 2014). SWMS-2D is a Fortran–based
    open–source software package that can solve the Richards equation for saturated–unsaturated
    water flow; meanwhile, comparing with HYDRUS, it is more flexible and reliable,
    because it can be used to simulate the water flow in the vadose zone under various
    conditions by modifying the codes (Xing et al. 2018), therefore, in present study,
    SWMS-2D is selected to simulate the typical line–source infiltration under film
    slit irrigation condition. For film slit irrigation method, research into the
    impacts of various influencing factors on soil moisture and cumulative infiltration
    is of theoretical relevance. And establishing a simplified model on the basis
    of fewer factors for infiltration estimation is of practical significance. The
    main objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the effects of soil texture,
    initial soil moisture, irrigation water depth, soil structure, opening ratio (ρ),
    and film slit width (d) and spacing on cumulative infiltration and further determine
    the dominant factors, according to the SWMS-2D–based simulations, and (2) propose
    a simplified double–factor model for infiltration estimation, expecting to be
    convenient applied in the cropland. Numerical model simulation of film slit irrigation
    and experiments verification Laboratory experiments The experiments were conducted
    in silt loam and sandy loam from the bench and the third terrace of Weihe River,
    located in Yangling region of Shaanxi Province, China. The designed widths of
    slit and film are generally based on the actual situation of field crop which
    are usually 5–20 cm and 20–40 cm, respectively. The opening ratio (ρ), which means
    the ratio of the uncovered film slit area to the total field area, usually varies
    from 15%–45%, the quota of irrigation is 300–450 m3 ha−1, the water depth (i.e.,
    head) above the film mulch is 6–12 cm (Xue et al. 2007). Usually, the soil needs
    to be irrigated when the soil water content (SWC) reaches 40%–60% of the field
    capacity. Considering the aforementioned conditions, 8 treatments (i.e., T1–T8)
    were finally designed for the experiments as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Test scheme
    of film slit irrigation. Download CSVDisplay Table Figure 1 (i) illustrates the
    laboratory setup for the experiments. Taking into account the symmetry characteristics
    of film slit infiltration, three sizes of soil bin were designed, including a)
    27-cm-length, 5-cm-width, and 70-cm-depth; b) 21-cm-length, 5-cm-width, and 70-cm-depth;
    and c) 15-cm-length, 5-cm-width, and 70-cm-depth. Many 2-mm parallel air vents
    were set at the bottom for ventilation; and some holes, with diameter and space
    of 5 cm and 1.5 cm, respectively, were set at both sides of the soil bin for sample
    collection to measure the SWC. A Marriotte vessel was used to maintain a continuous
    water supply and a constant water head. Figure 1. Experimental device diagram:

    as experimental soils. The soils were collected from 20–60 cm depth of a field
    just after winter wheat was harvested. Soil samples were air–dried, sieved through
    2-mm mesh, and then compacted into the soil bin at bulk densities of 1.30, 1.35,
    1.40, and 1.45 g cm−3 to simulate the in situ bulk density. Some water was added
    to the dry soil and mixed with the soil so as to reach the initial SWC of 40%
    and 60%. The cumulative infiltration was recorded, and the SWC was measured at
    the end of infiltration. Numerical model establishment and calibration Generally,
    variably saturated water flow in porous media is usually given by the following
    modified Richards’ equation: ∂ θ ∂ t = ∂ ∂ x K ( φ m ) ∂ φ m ∂ x + ∂ ∂ z K ( φ
    m ) ∂ φ m ∂ z − ∂ K ( φ m ) z (1) where θ is the soil water content (cm3 cm−3);
    φm is the soil matric potential (cm); K(φm) is the hydraulic conductivity (cm
    min−1); x is the horizontal distance (cm); z is the depth from the soil surface
    (cm), taken positive downward; and t is time (min). The space of film slit infiltration
    can be described as a two–dimensional infiltration shown as Figure 1 (ii–a). With
    the infiltration process, the water moved into inner soil and the wetting pattern
    is shown as Figure 1 (ii–b). The initial condition of film slit irrigation is
    described as Equation (2): φ = φ 0 , 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 2 S , 0 ≤ z ≤ H , t = 0 (2) where
    φ0 is the initial water potential before irrigation (cm−1); d is the width of
    slit (cm); S is the distance between the center lines of two adjacent film slits
    (cm); and H is the soil depth in simulation (cm). The boundary condition of experiments
    is presented in Figure 1 (ii). The boundary AB is the surface for water entering,
    with water head of h0 (Equation (3)), the boundary BC is covered with plastic
    mulch without infiltration or evaporation, and this is regarded as the zero–flux
    boundary, shown as Equation (4). The boundaries AE and CD are partial symmetry
    boundaries without exchange of water flow in x direction, and they are also the
    zero–flux boundary, shown as Equations (5)–(6). The boundary ED is the bottom
    that had no effects on the infiltration, so with fixed initial soil water potential
    as shown as Equation (7). B o u n d a r y A B : φ = h 0 , z = 0 , 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 2

    retention model (Mualem 1976; Genuchten 1980), using the computer program developed
    by van Genuchten–Mualem et al. (Genuchten et al. 1991) (Equations (8)–(10)). θ

    the residual and saturated water contents (cm3 cm−3), respectively; Ks is the
    saturated hydraulic conductivity (cm min−1); α is an empirical parameter that
    is inversely related to the air–entry pressure value (cm−1); m and n are an empirical
    parameter related to the pore–size distribution, m = 1–1/n; l is an empirical
    shape parameter, normally equal to 0.5; and Se is the effective saturation. A
    centrifugal machine (SCR–20) was used to construct the water retention curve;
    and a horizontal column infiltration was conducted to obtain Ks (Table 2). Moreover,
    in order to analyze the effect of different soil conditions and irrigation technical
    factors on the infiltration characteristics of film slit irrigation, the cumulative
    infiltration (hereinafter referred to the average infiltration amount of unit
    area under film slit controlling area) was simulated under different infiltration
    conditions in several different soils. The parameters of van Genuchten–Mualem
    model for 9 typical soils were obtained from RETC software (Genuchten et al. 1991),
    listing in Table 2 (last 9 lines). Table 2. The van Genuchten-Mualem model parameter

    infiltration 11 types of soil (Table 2), including silt loam with bulk densities
    of 1.30 g cm−3 and 1.40 g cm−3, sandy loam with those of 1.35 g cm−3 and 1.45
    g cm−3, as well as other 9 typical soils, were selected to analyze the characteristics
    of film slit infiltration. A simplified equation using fewer dominant factors
    was further proposed, on the basis of the Kostiakov model (Equation 11), for cumulative
    infiltration calculation of film slit irrigation. I = k t α (11) where I is cumulative
    infiltration (mm); t is infiltration duration (min); k is infiltration coefficient
    (mm min−α); and α is infiltration index. Error analysis The agreement of the simulations
    with the measured data was quantified by following statistical indicators, including
    mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), relative percentage
    error (RPE), percent bias (PBIAS), and Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) (Moriasi
    et al. 2007). These parameters are defined as follows, M A E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N Y
    i s i m − Y i o b s (12) R M S E = 1 N − 1 ∑ i = 1 N Y i s i m − Y i o b s 2 ,

    − Y ˉ i o b s ) 2 (16) where N is the total number of data points in each case,
    Yisim is the ith simulated data and Yiobs is the ith observed data. The magnitudes
    of RMSE values are indicative of performance of simulated data but do not show
    degree of over or underestimation of simulated values by SWMS-2D. The indicator,
    MAE, is used for quantitative evaluation of the performance of SWMS-2D simulations.
    Thus, MAE and RMSE (Chai and Draxler 2014) are selected to assess the performance
    of SWMS-2D on SWC distribution. Meanwhile, for a more accuracy evaluation of SWMS-2D
    on cumulative infiltration, statistical indicators RPE and PBIAS are selected.
    Furthermore, the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) is another indicator
    providing a quantitative estimate of the model goodness of fit. Results and discussion
    Soil water content distribution and cumulative infiltration and performance of
    SWMS-2D in film slit irrigation Figure 2 illustrated the comparisons between the
    measured and simulated data of SWC distribution at the end of 8 treatments (i.e.,
    120 minutes), in which the measured SWC were represented by black dots, while
    simulation results by SWMS-2D were shown as contour lines. The measured and simulated
    cumulative infiltration of 8 treatments under the same duration (i.e., 120 minutes)
    was shown in Figure 3. It was clear from Figures 2 and 3 that there were little
    differences between simulated and measured data, indicating that SWMS-2D can well
    describe the SWC distribution and cumulative infiltration, although slight gaps
    were observed between measured and simulated values. And this was attributed to
    preliminary stage of infiltration and empirical nature of developed equations
    (Lubana and Narda 1998). Figure 2. Comparisons on measured and simulated data

    RMSE and NS for SWC values ranged from 0.002 cm3 cm−3, 0.003 cm3 cm−3, and 0.91
    to 0.021 cm3 cm−3, 0.027 cm3 cm−3, and 0.99, respectively. Meanwhile, for the
    cumulative infiltration, values of RPE, PBIAS and NS were ranged from 2.46%, 0.13%,
    and 1.00 to 11.82%, 7.45%, and 1.00, respectively (Table 3). It can be then concluded
    that SWMS-2D performed well in SWC distribution and cumulative infiltration simulations,
    due to a large NS (very close to 1.0) and other small statistical indicators for
    SWC distribution and cumulative infiltration. Table 3. Correlation between measured

    CSVDisplay Table Different factors affecting cumulative infiltration of film slit
    irrigation Effect of initial soil water content on infiltration characteristics
    of film slit irrigation As simulated values of cumulative infiltration under film
    slit irrigation by SWMS-2D were not different from those measured during experimentation,
    the simulations with different initial SWC (i.e., 40%, 50%, 60% of effective saturation)
    of 3 soils (i.e., sand, silt loam with bulk density of 1.30 g cm−3, and sandy
    loam with bulk density of 1.35 g cm−3) were conducted under the width of film
    and slit 12 cm, 30 cm, respectively. The irrigation depth was 8 cm and the irrigation
    amount was 300 m3 ha−1. The cumulative infiltration of film slit irrigation at
    different initial SWCs were shown in Figure 4(a). It was found that the infiltration
    slightly decreased with the increases in initial SWC. The water potential gradient
    decreased with increasing initial SWC, leading to a slight decrease in water infiltration.
    However, the initial SWC had little effects on the infiltration characteristics
    of film slit irrigation. Figure 4. Analysis on film slit infiltration affected

    Display full size Effect of irrigation head on infiltration characteristics of
    film slit irrigation Simulations for different irrigation heads (i.e., 4 cm, 6
    cm, 8 cm) were conducted with silt loam with bulk density of 1.30 g cm3, sandy
    loam with bulk density of 1.35 g cm−3 and sand, respectively. All the simulations
    were set for the 12-cm-width film and 30-cm-width slit, initial SWC 50% of field
    capacity, and the irrigation amount of 300 m3 ha−1. It was observed from Figure
    4(b) that the irrigation head had little effects on the infiltration characteristics;
    meanwhile its effect on film slit infiltration was weak (Swartzendruber and Hogarth
    1991). This is attributed to that the advanced wetting front in the soil profile
    is mainly affected by the matric potential rather than gravity potential of surface
    water, although the infiltration slightly increased with increasing irrigation
    water depth. However, this small increase can be ignored. Effect of typical layered
    soil depth on infiltration characteristics of film slit infiltration Layered soil
    is the actual soil condition, and the simulations on layered soil were therefore
    conducted in 6 cases with different soil types and bulk densities under different
    upper soil depth (4 level depths) to analyze the effect of upper soil depth on
    cumulative infiltration of film slit irrigation. Case 1 involved sandy loam (1.35
    g cm−3) on top with silt loam (1.30 g cm−3) underneath. Homogeneous soils and
    upper soils with 15-, 20-, and 30-cm-deep soil layers were simulated for all cases.
    Case 2 involved silt loam (1.40 g cm−3) on top with the sandy loam (1.45 g cm−3)
    underneath. Case 3 involved loamy sand on top with loam underneath. Case 4 involved
    loam on top with loamy sand underneath. Cases 5 and 6 involved combinations of
    the same soil types but with different bulk densities, that is, Case 5 contained
    silt loam with bulk densities of 1.40 and 1.30 g cm−3, whereas case 6 comprised
    sandy loam with bulk densities of 1.35 and 1.45 g cm−3. Figure 4(c) showed that
    the cumulative infiltration was mainly affected by the upper soil hydraulic characteristics
    of soils above 15-cm-depth, relative to that beyond 15-cm-depth. This meant that
    the upper soil characteristics were dominant to the film slit infiltration characteristics
    (Ma et al. 2010). For further research, only soil characteristics of upper layer
    need to be considered. Effect of different film slit widths and opening ratios
    on infiltration characteristics of film slit irrigation The soils selected for
    simulation were silt loam and sandy loam with bulk densities of 1.30 and 1.45
    g cm−3, respectively, and loam and sand (from RETC software). The designed initial
    condition was designed as film slit spacing of 20 cm, irrigation head of 6-cm-depth,
    initial water content of 50% field capacity, and irrigation amount of 300 m3 ha−1.
    It was observed from Figure 5 that the simulated cumulative infiltration was affected
    by ρ and d, and it increased with the increase in ρ, whereas decreased with the
    increase in d under the same ρ condition. In addition, the infiltration rate for
    the sand was the largest, followed by silt loam and sandy loam in a decreasing
    order. Figure 5. Infiltration pattern curve under different film slit spacing:
    (a1, a2) silt loam, γd = 1.30 g cm−3; (b1, b2) sandy loam, γd = 1.45 g cm−3; (c1,
    c2) loam; and (d1, d2) sand. In the legend, the percentage values are equal to
    ρ, and the following values are equal to d. γd represents dry bulk density. Display
    full size Establishment of simplified model for film slit infiltration Before
    establishing the simplified model for film slit infiltration, we should explore
    the relationship between parameters k and α in Kostiakov model. 10 soils (Table
    4) were used to fit the relationship between k and α based on Equation (11) (Table
    4). The determination coefficients (R2) of different soils were all more than
    0.99, indicating the Kostiakov model accurately described the cumulative infiltration
    of film slit infiltration. Furthermore, according to the aforementioned analysis,
    under the same soil texture and bulk density as actual field film slit irrigation,
    the cumulative infiltration was weakly affected by the initial SWC and irrigation
    head. Therefore, ρ and d were viewed as the two main influencing factors during
    simplified model establishment. After extensive verification, Equations (17)–(18)
    were proposed based on the relationships between parameter k, α, ρ, and d. k =
    A ρ τ d μ (17) α = B − η 1 ρ − η 2 ρ d (18) Table 4. Fitting infiltration parameter
    values. Download CSVDisplay Table where k is the infiltration coefficient (mm
    min−1); ρ is the opening ratio; d is the film slit width (cm); α is infiltration
    index; and A, τ, μ, B, η1, and η2 are fitting parameters. Based on the data of
    k and α (Table 4), the parameters A, B, τ, μ, η1, and η2 were fitted by using
    Matlab software, and the values of τ, μ, η1, and η2 were equal to 1.35, 0.31,
    0.35 and 0.002, respectively; while parameters A and B varied with soil texture
    and bulk density. Therefore, Equation (11) was re–constructed with combination
    of ρ and d (Equation (19)). I = A ρ 1.35 d 0.31 t B − 0.35 ρ − 0.002 ρ d (19)
    Validation of simplified model Performances of parameters k and α were tested
    by comparing simulated values with estimated values through 10 different soils.
    Figure 6 illustrated that the simulated values obtained from Table 4 kept consistent
    with the estimated values obtained from Equations (17)–(18). It was concluded
    that the simplified model (Equation (19)) was suitable for estimating cumulative
    infiltration for various soils with different ρ and d. This indicated that the
    proposed simplified model can describe the changes of cumulative infiltration
    over duration under film slit irrigation condition. Furthermore, it was noteworthy
    that the values of α were all gathered from 0.65 to 0.95, which needs further
    analysis. Figure 6. Comparison of simulated and estimated value of k and α. No.

    (i.e., silt loam from Luochuan with bulk density of 1.30 g cm−3, and sandy loam
    from Ansai with bulk density of 1.35 g cm−3); in addition, a published datum was
    selected to make a more thoroughly evaluation of the simplified model. The dataset
    was obtained from Xue et al. (2007), in which the experimental soil was silt clay
    with bulk density of 1.40 g cm−3, taken from the third terrace of Wei River, in
    Yangling region. The film widths of experiments were 5, 15, and 25 cm, respectively.
    The simplified model equations of each soil were listed as Equations (20)–(22).
    Figure 7 showed the calculated values obtained from Equations (20)–(22) were in
    good agreement with the experimental values, indicating that the Equation (19)
    can effectively describe the characteristics of film slit infiltration. The MAE
    and RMSE values of cumulative infiltration ranged from 1.032 mm and 1.239 mm to
    3.129 mm and 3.804 mm, respectively, and the NS values were very close to 1.0;
    meanwhile, the results were in good agreement with the fitted parameters A and

    of SWC and cumulative infiltration for film slit irrigation through the SWMS-2D
    were conducted on silt loam and sandy loam with different bulk densities. After
    the investigations on 6 influencing factors (i.e., soil texture, initial soil
    moisture, irrigation water depth, soil structure, ρ, and d), we find that ρ and
    d have more obvious influences on cumulative infiltration than other four factors,
    based on which, ρ and d could be viewed as the two dominant factors. Specifically,
    the cumulative infiltration increases with the increase in ρ, but decreases with
    the increase in the d under the same ρ condition. Furthermore, a simplified double–factor
    model is proposed on the basis of ρ and d, which is justified by 3 soils (i.e.,
    silt loam from Luochuan, sandy loam from Ansai, and silt clay from Yangling).
    In all, the proposed model using ρ and d (i.e., opening ratio and film slit width)
    could be employed to estimate cumulative infiltration of film slit irrigation
    for a certain soil. Author Contributions Xiaoyi Ma and Haiyan Fan conceived and

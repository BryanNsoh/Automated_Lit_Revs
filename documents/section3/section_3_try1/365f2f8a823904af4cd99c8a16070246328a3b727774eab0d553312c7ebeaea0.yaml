    there are certain risks in other regions. In addition, of all seasons, summer
    and spring have the slightest bias, followed by autumn and winter. From 2017 to
    2020, bias in 2019 and 2020 are the smallest, and the areas with large deviation
    are south of climate zone 3, the coastal area of climate zone 6, and the boundary
    area of climate zone 7.

    Notes Abstract Reference Crop evapotranspiration (ET0) datasets based on reanalysis
    products can make up for the time discontinuity and the spatial insufficiency
    of surface meteorological platform data, which is of great significance for water

    evapotranspiration (ET0) is a critical factor for calculating crop evapotranspiration,
    the accurate estimation of which plays a vital role in irrigation engineering
    design and planning, water resources management, and climate change research [1,2,3].
    Due to its large population and rapid economic development, China is facing a
    severe water shortage problem. The country’s per capita water resource is only
    one-fourth of the world average level [4]. Therefore, an accurate estimation of
    ET0 in this region would provide a scientific basis for rationally allocating
    water resources and minimizing the imbalance between water supply and demand [5].
    Currently, the standard estimating method of ET0 is the Penman-Monteith equation
    (FAO56 PM) recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations (FAO) [6,7]. This method combines energy balance and the aerodynamic theory,
    which is strongly applicable under different climatic conditions. However, the
    main drawback of this method is that it requires a high quality of meteorological
    data, including air temperature, relative humidity or dew temperature, solar radiation,
    and wind speed [8,9]. In many regions of the world, there are not enough weather
    stations to monitor the meteorological factors. Additionally, high-quality, long-term
    observational data are lacking, especially in developing countries, which hinders
    the application of the PM method for ET0 estimation on large spatial scales [10,11,12].
    In recent years, reanalysis products have become one of the main grid data sources
    for water resource management research [13]. Reanalysis data are generated by
    running a numerical weather-predicting model that assimilates the observed atmospheric
    and surface data to reconstruct the past surface, ocean, and atmospheric state
    variables. Unlike geostatistical grid data derived from spatial interpolation,
    the spatial structure of weather variables (such as temperature and wind speed)
    synthesizes physical laws embedded in numerical models [8]. Nowadays, many reanalysis
    data sets have developed rapidly and are used in various fields. Baatz et al.
    (2020) [14] analyzed state-of-the-art methods, recent developments, and prospects
    of reanalysis for three subcomponents of the Earth system (atmosphere, ocean,
    and land), they points out the method’s increasing computational capabilities,
    the growing availability of long-term satellite data with global coverage, and
    the advancements in model-data fusion methods such as variational and sequential
    data assimilation. In addition, the above paper discusses the increasing awareness
    of the drastic changes in the Earth system related to anthropogenic and climatic
    factors and the way they drive reanalysis development. Recently, networks of distributed
    in-situ sensors such as buoys and biogeochemical Argo floats [15], eddy covariance
    stations [16], surface water runoff observations [17], and meteorological station
    data [18] were used in the reanalysis of physical and biogeochemical Earth system
    processes. Munoz-Sabater et al. (2021) [19] presented the new global ERA5-Land
    reanalysis. The quality of ERA5-Land fields was evaluated by direct comparison
    to many in situ observations collected for the period 2001–2018, and for comparison
    to additional model or satellite-based global reference datasets. Overall, the
    water cycle was improved in ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 according to the different
    variables evaluated, whereas the energy cycle variables showed similar performances.
    Both ERA5 and ERA5-Land perform substantially better than ERA-Interim. Reanalysis
    data have also been applied and compared to estimate evapotranspiration in different
    regions of the world. Boulard et al. (2016) [20] calculated ET0 using the ERA-Interim
    reanalysis data and verified its accuracy in a water balance study in northeastern
    France. Srivastava et al. (2016) [21] found that ERA-Interim ET0 was superior
    to NCEP/NCAR ET0 in the UK. Pelosi et al. (2020) [22] also compared two reanalysis
    datasets for ET0 estimation in southern Italy. Woldesenbet et al. (2021) [23]
    evaluated the ET0 in the Omo-Gibetta watershed and achieved good prediction results.
    Song et al. (2015) [24] judged the spatiotemporal characteristics of ET0 in the
    Shaanxi Province based on NCEP reanalysis data and made future predictions. Liu
    et al. (2019) [25] estimated the future ET0 in the Poyang Lake basin based on
    the CMIP5 model. The results showed that the stepwise regression downscaling model
    established by the NCEP reanalysis data and the basin ET0 had better simulation
    results. ET0 was assessed in the Iberian Peninsula by Martins et al. (2016) [26].
    The focus here is to use the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National
    Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) hybrid reanalysis product and gridded
    dataset to calculate ET0 with good simulation results. Raziei (2021) [27] used
    the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric
    Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis, combined with a gridded dataset, to calculate
    monthly ET0 for 43 meteorological stations distributed across Iran. The results
    show that the ET0 calculated by the mixed reanalysis had a better effect than
    the ET0 calculated by the observations at most research stations. Milad and Mehdi
    (2022) [28] used reanalysis products to estimate ET0 in areas with sparse data
    and showed that ERA5 provided more accurate estimates of daily and monthly ET0.
    Some scholars have also compared satellite grid data with meteorological station
    values. Wang et al. (2019) [29] comprehensively evaluated and compared this newly
    released precipitation product (Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals V05B) and
    its predecessor TRMM 3B42V7 based upon the ground-based observations under complex
    topographic and climatic conditions over the Hexi Region in the northwest arid
    region of China. Their results indicated that compared to ground-based observations,
    both IMERG and 3B42V7 showed good performance with slight overestimation. Prakash
    et al. (2016) [30] investigated the capabilities of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring
    Mission (TRMM), Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), and the recently
    released Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) in detecting and
    estimating heavy rainfall across India. The results indicated that the multi-satellite
    product systematically overestimates its inter-annual variations. With continuous
    advances in numerical weather models, computing, information, and communication
    technology (ict) tools, and data assimilation techniques, along with continuous
    improvements in the quality of atmospheric and ground data obtained from satellites,
    the spatial and temporal resolution and reliability of reanalysis data have been
    gradually improved year after year. The China Meteorological Administration Land
    Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) is the only real-time service system in land
    surface data assimilation systems in China. It uses a combined technology of integration
    and assimilation to fuse data from various sources, such as ground observation,
    satellite observation, and numerical model products [31]. The output of this system
    includes high spatial and temporal resolution land surface driving products such
    as temperature, air pressure, specific humidity, wind speed, precipitation, solar
    shortwave radiation, and soil moisture. These could be applied in agricultural
    drought monitoring, mountain flood geological disaster meteorological services,
    climate system model assessments, and spatial fine grid real data services. Although
    many studies have evaluated the quality of the CLDAS data, there are limited reports
    on the estimation of ET0 by this dataset. In this paper, we used the meteorological
    reanalysis data of 689 surface meteorological stations in China from 2017 to 2020
    and found four grid data points around each meteorological station through calculation
    and processing. We then calculated the value of the target station using the inverse
    distance weight method, compared it with the measured data of local meteorological
    stations and evaluated the accuracy of CLDAS data through statistical indicators.
    Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the accuracy of ET0 simulation with CLDAS
    products for the first time by comparing meteorological data from 689 ground weather
    stations and to exploring a product that could provide accurate ET0 for areas
    lacking meteorological data observation. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Introduction
    to CLDAS CLDAS is an isolatitude and longitude mesh fusion analysis product covering
    the Asian region (0–65° N, 60–160° E) with a resolution of 0.0625° × 0.0625° and
    1 h, and a spatial geometric distance of 9 km between the corresponding grid points,
    including six variables: 2 m air temperature, 2 m specific humidity, 10 m wind
    speed, surface pressure, precipitation, and shortwave radiation. This dataset
    is developed by using the Space and Time Mesoscale Analysis System (STMAS), optimal
    interpolation (OI), probability density function matching (CDF), physical inversion,
    terrain correction, and other techniques based on ground and satellite observations
    from a variety of sources. The dataset’s quality and spatio-temporal resolution
    in China is better and higher than in the international market. The scientific
    goal of CLDAS is to use data fusion and assimilation technology, on the ground
    observation, satellite observations, numerical model products, and other sources
    of data fusion to obtain high space-time resolution and high-quality temperature,
    pressure, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and radiation elements such as
    lattice data to drive the land surface model, obtain soil temperature and humidity,
    etc. The research focuses on processing and acquiring land surface driving data,
    realizing the operation and integration of multiple land surface models, and improving
    the underlying surface data, vegetation parameters, and atmospheric driving data.
    2.1.1. Data Sources for CLDAS (1) Ground observation data: hourly temperature,
    air pressure, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and other data observed by
    more than 2400 national automatic weather stations and nearly 40,000 regional
    automatic weather stations after quality control. (2) ECMWF (European Center for
    Mediumrange Weather Forecasts) numerical analysis/forecast products: global 3
    h, 0.125° resolution 2 m temperature, 2 m humidity, 10 mU/V wind speed, surface
    pressure, and other data products released by EC (European Center). (3) GFS numerical
    analysis/prediction products: NCEP released global ozone, atmospheric precipitation,
    surface pressure, and other data products with 3 h and 0.5°. (4) Satellite precipitation
    products: FY2 precipitation estimation products (nominal disk chart) of the National
    Satellite Meteorological Center; East Asia Multi-Satellite Integrated Precipitation
    Data Product (EMSIP) with a resolution of 1 h and 0.0625° for the Asian region
    operated by the National Meteorological Information Center. (5) Fusion precipitation
    product: the fusion product of FY2/CMORPH precipitation and automatic ground station
    precipitation with 1 h and 0.1° resolution in China operated by the National Meteorological
    Information Center. (6) FY2 satellite entire disk nominal map: multi-channel geostationary
    satellite observation data with 1 h and 5 km resolution (subsatellite point) of
    the Service of National Satellite Meteorological Center (nominal disk map). (7)
    DEM data: a global 30m spatial resolution topographic data product jointly measured
    by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and NIMA (National Bureau
    of Surveying and Mapping of the Ministry of Defense) was used to re-sample DEM
    topographic data with a spatial resolution of 0.0625° in the Asian region using
    the area weight method. 2.1.2. CLDAS Data Processing Methods The 2 m temperature,
    2 m specific humidity, 10 m wind speed, and surface pressure products take ECMWF
    numerical analysis/forecast products as the background field. Topographic adjustment
    and multi-grid variational technology (STMAS) are used to integrate the observation
    data of automatic ground stations in China. The background field outside China
    is formed by topographic adjustment, variable diagnosis, and interpolation to
    the analysis grid. The DISORT radiative transfer model used ozone, atmospheric
    precipitation, and surface pressure in GFS numerical analysis products as the
    dynamic input parameters for the radiative transfer model. Additionally, FY2E/G
    satellite VIS channel complete disk nominal map data inversion was used to form
    the short-wave radiation product. The above information comes from the China Meteorological
    Data Sharing Network (https://data.cma.cn/, accessed on 1 May 2021). The data
    used in this study included temperature, global solar radiation, relative humidity,
    and wind speed, of which the height of wind speed was 10 m and the height of other
    meteorological variables was 2 m. The data spanned from 2017 to 2020. 2.2. Reference
    Evapotranspiration According to the FAO56 PM equation [32], reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0; mm d−1) can be calculated as: 𝐸 𝑇 0 = 0.408( 𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+𝛾 900 𝑇 𝑎 +273 𝑈( 𝑒
    𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) Δ+𝛾(1+0.34𝑈) (1) where 𝑅 𝑛 is the net radiation at the crop surface,
    usually calculated by 𝑅 𝑠 (Global solar radiation); 𝐺 is the soil heat flux density;
    𝑇 𝑎 is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height; 𝑈 is the wind speed at 2
    m height; 𝑒 𝑠 and 𝑒 𝑎 are the saturation and actual vapor pressure, respectively;
    Δ is the slope of vapor pressure curve, and 𝛾 is the air psychrometric constant.
    In daily time-step in this study 𝐺 can be neglected [33,34]. 2.3. Data Sources
    To examine the performance of this dataset, meteorological data from 689 ground
    meteorological observation stations of the China Meteorological Administration
    (CMA) were collected, which included maximum and minimum temperatures at 2 m,
    global surface radiation or sunshine durations, relative humidity at 2 m, and
    wind speed at 10 m. If necessary, sunshine durations were converted into global
    radiation using a formula from a previous study [35]. The stations were divided
    into seven climate zones [36,37]. The specific distribution is shown in Figure
    1, and the names are shown in Table 1. Figure 1. Climate zones of China and geographical
    distribution of 689 meteorological stations. (See Table 1 for the names of climatic
    zones 1–7). Table 1. Names of the seven climate zones. To obtain the daily reanalysis
    variables for Equation (1) (identified by subscript CLD), the following steps
    were taken: (a) daily TmaxCLD and TminCLD were selected as the maximum and minimum
    of the 24 daily available 1-h values of the Tmax and Tmin sequences, respectively;
    (b) daily RHCLD was obtained by calculating the 24-h average value of 24 RH values
    per day; (c) calculating the 24-h cumulative value of the 12-h Rs as the daily
    RsCLD value; (d) wind speed at 10 m (U10CLD) was calculated as the 24-h average
    of 24 1-h values, which were then converted to a height of 2 m (UCLD) using Formula
    (2) as follows, respectively: 𝑈= 𝑈 𝑧 4.87 ln(67.8𝑧−5.42) (2) where 𝑧 is the height
    of the wind speed observation instrument (in this paper, 𝑧 is equal to 10) for
    each meteorological station. Grid data from four grid points around it were selected
    and interpolated to the station by the inverse distance weight (IDW) method. The
    formula is as follows: 𝑉= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑣 𝑖 𝐷 2 𝑖 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 1 𝐷 2 𝑖 (3) where 𝑉 is the
    inverse value, 𝑣 𝑖 is the value of the control point, and 𝐷 𝑖 is the weight coefficient.
    2.4. Statistics Indicators Three common statistical indicators, including the
    coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute
    error (MAE), and percent bias (PBias) were chosen to evaluate the accuracy of
    the CLDAS meteorological variables and ET0 in this study. The corresponding formulas
    are: MAE= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 | 𝑀 𝑖 − 𝑃 𝑖 | (4) RMSE= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝑀 𝑖 − 𝑃 𝑖 ) 2 − −
    − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (5) 𝑅 2 = [ ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑀 𝑖 − 𝑀 ¯ 𝑖 )( 𝑃 𝑖 − 𝑃 ¯ 𝑖
    )] 2 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑀 𝑖 − 𝑀 ¯ 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑃 𝑖 − 𝑃 ¯ 𝑖 ) 2 (6) PB= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑃 𝑖
    − 𝑀 𝑖 ) ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑀 𝑖 (7) where 𝑀 𝑖 is ET0 calculated by meteorological station
    data, 𝑃 𝑖 is ET0 calculated by the CLDAS gridded data, 𝑀 ¯ 𝑖 is average ET0 calculated
    by meteorological station data, 𝑃 ¯ 𝑖 is average ET0 calculated by the CLDAS gridded
    data, and 𝑛 is the number corresponding to ET0 data. Higher R2 values (closer
    to 1) or lower RMSE and MAE values indicate a better estimation performance of
    the CLDAS dataset. The closer PB is to 0, the better the estimation performance
    of the CLDAS dataset. 3. Results 3.1. Meteorological Factors 3.1.1. Air Temperature
    Table 2 shows the statistical indicators of maximum and minimum temperatures in
    the CLDAS data for the seven climate zones in China. Results indicated that the
    accuracy for the maximum and minimum temperatures differed in different climatic
    regions. For the maximum temperature, CLDAS data showed a high correlation with
    data from ground stations in the four northern climate zones (i.e., climate zones
    1–4), with R2 larger than 0.9. Climate zone 5 in the humid climate region also
    yielded a good correlation. In climate zones 6 and 7, the correlations between
    the two datasets were slightly worse when compared with other climate zones. However,
    climate zone 6 showed the smallest values in terms of statistical errors, with
    RMSE and MAE valued at 2.9 and 2.3 °C, respectively. This may be since the range
    of temperature changes in this region is not as large as that in other regions,
    and the area of this climate zone is significantly smaller than that in other
    climate zones, so the temperature change in this region is not as dramatic as
    that in other climate zones. The RMSE and MAE of the high-altitude climate zone
    (i.e., climate zone 7) were 6.55 °C and 5.83 °C, respectively. Figure 2, Figure
    3 and Figure 4 show the spatial error distribution of the maximum temperature
    in CLDAS. Overall, the errors at most stations were within a small range. However,
    in climate zone 7 and the north-central area of climate zone 1, there was a big
    error in the regions, with RMSE and MAE of many stations more significant than
    10 °C, while R2 was lower than 0.5. Such huge variations in model errors in these
    stations might be resulted from the regional climate model parameter variations
    and were unlikely caused by the overall overvalued or undervalued problem of models
    that may cause significant variation for ET0 estimation. Figure 2. RMSE values
    of the five meteorological factors of in all stations. Figure 3. MAE values of
    the five meteorological factors of in all stations. Figure 4. R2 values of the
    five meteorological factors of in all stations. Table 2. Statistical indicators
    of maximum and minimum temperatures in different climate zones of China. The minimum
    temperature behavior in the CLDAS data set was similar to the maximum temperature.
    However, compared with the maximum temperature, correlations between the minimum
    temperature of CLDAS and the station’s temperature were higher in all seven climate
    zones, with all R2 larger than 0.9. In climate zone 6, the minimum temperature
    error was the lowest among all climate zones, with RMSE and MAE valued at 1.87
    °C and 1.5 °C, respectively. On the contrary, climate zone 7 had the highest error,
    with RMSE and MAE reaching 5.1 and 4.53 °C, respectively. In addition, the lowest
    temperature error in climate zone 1 was also relatively high, with RMSE and MAE
    valued at 4.03 °C and 3.45 °C, respectively, which might affect the accuracy of
    ET0 estimation. As can be seen from Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4, the performance
    of Tmin was similar to that of Tmax. Therefore, the accuracy of most stations
    was within an acceptable range. However, some stations showed significant errors,
    which were mainly located in the middle of climate zone 1 and climate zone 7.
    These stations with high error in the minimum temperature had a high coincidence
    with corresponding high Tmax error stations, indicating severe problems in the
    temperature simulation of the stations. 3.1.2. Solar Radiation Table 3 shows the
    statistical indicators of solar radiation (Rs) in the CLDAS data for the seven
    climate zones. Across climate zones, RMSE ranged from 5.18 to 6.21 MJ m−2 d−1,
    and MAE ranged from 3.83 to 4.54 MJ m−2 d−1. The differences in Rs errors among
    different climate regions were not as apparent as those in air temperature. However,
    the R2 of climate zone 7 was significantly lower than that of other climatic regions.
    These results were similar to the results reported by Liu et al. (2009) [38].
    However, their values were generally higher than that of the radiation model based
    on temperature, where the median RMSE was 3.3 MJ m−2 d−1 in humid regions of China
    (Fan et al., 2019) [39]. The above phenomenon indicated that the radiation data
    in the CLDAS data set did not perform well. Table 3. Statistical indicators of
    solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed in different climate zones
    of China. Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the spatial distribution of Rs
    errors. Overall, the error of Rs in climate zones 1–3 was better than in other
    climate zones. The RMSE of most stations was more significant than 6 MJ m−2 d−1.
    This might be due to the severe air pollution in the above areas [40], which would
    pose particular challenges to accurate simulation. 3.1.3. Relative Humidity Statistical
    indicators of CLDAS RH are shown in Table 3. Climate zone 7 had the most significant
    error among all regions, with RMSE and MAE reaching 31.29% and 27.62%, respectively,
    close to a random distribution. The consistency between CLDAS and site data in
    other climatic regions was also not high, with R2 ranging from 0.39 to 0.59. However,
    the values of RMSE and MAE indicated that they were still within acceptable limits.
    Compared climate zone 1 with climate zone 6, the consistency of climate zone 1
    was higher, but the RMSE and MAE of climate zone 6 are lower. This result could
    be attributed to the fact that climate zone 6 is within the humid region with
    high annual average relative humidity, while climate zone 1 is in the arid area
    where the relative humidity changes more sharply. Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure
    4 showed that the overall error of this data set was larger in climate zone 7
    than in other climate zones. In addition, compared with the northeast part of
    climate region 5, the error of RH in the western part of the same climate zone
    (i.e., areas bordering climate zone 7) was significantly larger. Although there
    was a relatively large error for RH in some regions, the estimation of ET0 would
    unlikely be affected, as previous studies have found that RH would have a low
    contribution to ET0 in most regions of China [41]. 3.1.4. Wind Speed Statistical
    indicators of CLDAS U are shown in Table 3. From the perspective of R2, the consistency
    between CLDAS near-surface wind speed and station data was poor in all climate
    zones, while from the perspective of RMSE and MAE, their accuracies were acceptable.
    In addition, the mean difference between climate zones was within 30%. However,
    according to the spatial distribution of the error (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure
    4), the RMSE of some stations was more than 3 m s−1, of which the errors of most
    stations in climate zone 7 were significant. Compared with the inland stations,
    the R2 of the coastal stations was higher. However, RMSE and MAE were also higher,
    indicating a problem of overestimation or underestimation. The worldwide modeling
    for wind speed is challenging and often inaccurate. Similar results were obtained
    for ERA5 [22], NCEP/NCAR [27], and GLDAS [42]. This is mainly due to the complex
    terrain changes on the ground, and the wind speed is greatly affected by the roughness
    of the underlying surface. In addition, it is not easy to simulate the movement
    direction of winds accurately. 3.2. Reference Evapotranspiration The statistical
    indicators of calculated ET0 based on the CLDAS dataset are shown in Table 4.
    Among all climate zones, climate zone 1 had the best consistency (R2 = 0.84) between
    CLDAS data and station data, while climate zone 3 showed the lowest errors (RMSE
    = 0.87 mm d−1 and MAE = 0.58 mm d−1). For climate zone 7, the values of RMSE (1.37
    mm d−1) and MAE (1.19 mm d−1) were higher than the corresponding values in any
    of the other climate zones. Figure 5 shows the spatial distribution of statistical
    indicators. Across climate zones, R2 overall showed a decreasing trend from the
    north to the south, and the southernmost region (i.e., climate zone 6) had the
    lowest value of R2. However, the spatial distributing patterns of RMSE and MAE
    were different from R2. The stations with significant errors are mainly distributed
    west of climate zone 1, the coastal areas, and the boundary areas between climate
    zone 7 and other climate zones. This is mainly due to the more complex climate
    change between climate zones. In addition, the high wind speed error in the coastal
    areas often leads to a significant ET0 error. Figure 5. Spatial distribution of
    ET0 statistical indicators. Table 4. Statistical indicators of reference evapotranspiration
    in different climate zones of China. To explore the differences in the CLDAS data
    in different climate regions, one station from each climate zone was randomly
    selected to fit the correlation between the calculated ET0 based on CLDAS and
    the FAO56-PM ET0 (Figure 6). Although there were a few outliers, the scatter points
    in climate zone 1 were more concentrated to the 1:1 line than those in other climate
    zones. Scatter points in climate region 2 were slightly more dispersed than in
    climate zone 1 and showed some obvious overestimations when ET0 was more significant
    than 6. In climate zone 3, the accuracy was excellent when the value of ET0 was
    low (<2 mm) but showed a decline as the following scatter points started to discretize.
    However, no overestimation or underestimation existed. In climate zone 4, the
    error was relatively large when ET0 ranged from 3 mm to 6 mm. When the ET0 of
    climate zone 5 was less than 2, the problem of underestimation appeared, and then
    the points were scattered in the 1:1 line for two measurements, but the distance
    from the 1:1 line was far. In climate zone 6, the error was significant when ET0
    was greater than 3 mm, and some scatter points were obviously overestimated or
    underestimated. Although the points were not as discrete as those in climate zones
    4 and 5, the ET0 of climate zone 7 showed a significant underestimation. Figure
    6. Scatter plots of CLDAS and FAO56 PM values of ET0 in different climates. Figure
    7 shows the ET0 box diagram of a station randomly selected from each climate zone.
    From the median value, there are differences in the performance of different climate
    regions. Among them, the ET0 prediction bias of climate region 2 and climate region
    3 is slight. The bias of climate region 6 and 7 is large. In addition, from the
    extreme value, the bias of ET0 estimated in climate zone 4 and climate zone 6
    is small, and other regions have overestimated or underestimated in varying degrees.
    From the quartile line, there are significant differences in ET0 estimation in
    climate regions 5, 6, and 7. The predicted ET0 performance of climate zones 1,
    2, 3, and 4 is relatively good. Figure 7. The box diagram of CLDAS and FAO56 PM
    values of ET0 in different climates. 3.3. Seasonal Performance of Reference Evapotranspiration
    from CLDAS Since the demand for water resources varies significantly between seasons,
    it is necessary to assess the performance of the CLDAS dataset in different seasons.
    Figure 8 shows the RMSE performance of CLDAS ET0 in the four seasons. In spring
    (March–May), stations with RMSE smaller than 1.5 mm d−1 accounted for more than
    85% of all stations across China. The RMSE was lower in the south of climate zone
    1 and the middle and north of climate zone 3, ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm d−1. For
    most stations of climate zones 2, 4, 5, and 6, RMSE values ranged from 1–1.5 mm
    d−1. Stations with errors greater than 1.5 mm d−1 are mainly located in climate
    zones 1 and 7. Figure 8. Seasonal RMSE of ET0 calculated from CLDAS dataset. In
    summer (June–August), the RMSE of CLDAS ET0 was generally higher than that of
    spring. More than 80% of the stations had RMSE ranging between 1 mm d−1 and 1.5
    mm d−1. Stations with RMSE smaller than 1 mm d−1 were mainly concentrated in the
    southern part of China and near the boundary area between climate zones 5 and
    6. Stations with RMSE greater than 1.5 mm d−1 were distributed in all climatic
    regions, of which climate zone 7 had the largest RMSE, followed by climate zone
    1. Especially for the southwest area of climate zone 7, stations in this area
    were sparse, and the error was relatively large, with the value of RMSE larger
    than 2 mm d−1. In autumn (September–November), RMSE was less than 1 mm d−1 in
    80% of all stations, and stations with a significant error were still mainly concentrated
    in climate zone 7. It is worth mentioning that there were also many stations with
    RMSE greater than 1 mm d−1 in the coastal areas of climatic zone 6. This is mainly
    due to the relatively high temperature of this area in autumn, resulting in a
    relatively large RMSE. In winter (December–February), RMSE in northern regions
    (i.e., climate zones 1–3) was lower than 0.5 mm d−1 due to the minimal ET0 value.
    RMSE of most stations in climate zones 4 and 5 was less than 1 mm d−1. However,
    the values of RMSE in the southern part of climate zone 7, the coastal part of
    climate zone 6, and the western part of climatic zone 5 were more outstanding
    than 1.5 mm d−1. Among all seasons, summer had the most significant RMSE error,
    followed in order by spring, autumn, and winter. The CLDAS dataset performed well
    in climate zones 2, 3, 4, and 5, but performed poorly in all seasons in climate
    zone 7. In addition, the coastal areas of climate zone 6 also did not perform
    well in autumn and winter. Because the demand for water resources varies significantly
    in different seasons, it is also necessary to evaluate the specific overestimation
    or underestimation of the CLDAS dataset in different seasons. This provides a
    more detailed reference for practical production and life applications. Figure
    9 shows the PBias distribution of ET0 calculated by CLDAS in the four seasons.
    In spring, the sites with PBias between 0.2 and 0.2 accounted for about 70% of
    all sites in the country, and the overall forecast stability was good. The values
    of ET0CLD in the southern regions of climate zone 1, climate zone 2, the southern
    part of climate zone 3, most of climate zone 4, and the central and northern parts
    of climate zone 5 are within 10% of the local station data. In climate zone 7
    (Underestimated), numerical biases are generally greater than 30%. The prediction
    of ET0CLD in the junction area of climate zone 7 and other climate zones is not
    very stable, and most of them are underestimated. In addition, the ET0CLD in coastal
    areas will have a relatively large bias. Figure 9. Seasonal PBias of ET0 calculated
    from CLDAS dataset. In summer, the bias of ET0 calculated by CLDAS is generally
    smaller than that in spring, but some sites have large fluctuations (the bias
    is greater than 60%), and the PBias of more than 60% of the sites is between −10%
    and 10%. ET0CLD is in the climate zone 3. The southeastern coastal areas (overestimated),
    the southern part of climate zone 5 (overestimated), and the western coastal areas
    of climate zone 6 (overestimated) have large biases from the local weather station
    data, with a gap of about 10% to 30%. Numerical bias with zone 7 (underestimation)
    is generally greater than 30%. The prediction of ET0CLD for meteorological stations
    in the junction of climate zone 7 and other climate zones is not very stable,
    and most of them are underestimated. In autumn, the bias of ET0 calculated by
    CLDAS is generally larger than that in spring and autumn, and only about 50% of
    the sites have PBias between 10% and 10%. The western region (underestimated),
    the central and western regions of climate zone 5 (underestimated), the southern
    coastal region of climate zone 6 (underestimated), and the climate zone 7 (underestimated)
    have large biases from the data of local meteorological stations, with a gap of
    more than 30%. In addition, the prediction accuracy of the ET0CLD of the meteorological
    stations at the junction of climate zone 3 and other climate zones decreased significantly.
    Most showed an overall underestimation. In winter, the bias of ET0 calculated
    by CLDAS is generally the largest, among which the bias of ET0CLD from the local
    station data in the southern region of climate zone 1, the central region of climate
    zone 2, the central region of climate zone 3, and the central and eastern regions
    of climate zone 5 is 10%. Within %; ET0CLD in the northern region of climate zone
    1 (overestimated), the southern coastal region of climate zone 3 (overestimated),
    most of climate zone 4 (underestimated), the central and western regions of climate
    zone 5 (underestimated), the southern part of climate zone 6 Coastal areas (underestimated),
    and climate zone 7 have large biases from local weather station data, with a gap
    of more than 30%. In addition, the prediction accuracy for the ET0CLD of the meteorological
    stations in the transition areas of different climatic zones will drop significantly,
    and both overestimation and underestimation exist. Figure 10 shows a boxplot of
    the calculated PBias for the CLDAS dataset. From the median value of PBias, there
    are biass in the performance of different seasons. Among these, the estimated
    bias in spring and summer is smaller, the performance in autumn is second, and
    the performance in winter is the largest. From the quartile line (aside from winter),
    the estimated differences in the other three seasons were small. From the perspective
    of extreme values, the estimated maximum and minimum values in winter are not
    good. The performance in summer is the best, and the estimated bias is the smallest.
    In conclusion, of all seasons, summer and spring have the slightest bias, followed
    by autumn and winter. The CLDAS dataset performs well in climate zones 2, 3, 4,
    and 5 but not in all seasons in climate zone 7. In addition, the coastal areas
    of climate zone 3 and climate zone 6 also performed poorly in autumn and winter,
    and the performance at the interface of different climate zones was also relatively
    poor. Figure 10. The box diagram of Seasonal PBias of ET0 calculated from CLDAS
    dataset. 3.4. Annual Performance of Reference Evapotranspiration from CLDAS China
    is a country with frequent droughts and floods. Water demand also varies widely
    between years. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the difference in CLDAS
    ET0 error in different years. The RMSE of CLDAS ET0 in 2017–2020 is shown in Figure
    11. Overall, RMSE in 2019 was lower than that in other years, with more than 85%
    of all stations having a value less than 1 mm d−1. In 2020, stations with RMSE
    less than 1 mm d−1 accounted for 60% of the total stations. Regarding the spatial
    distribution of errors, climate zones 3, 4, 5, and 6 overall performed better
    than other climate zones. Significant errors were in the southern part of climate
    zone 7 and the eastern part of climate zone 1, with RMSE generally more significant
    than 1.5 mm d−1. This may be related to the special geographical location of these
    stations, such as at the boundary of different climate zones. The above results
    further confirmed that the data set had good performance in some regions. At the
    same time, there were also significant uncertainties in other regions, which could
    bring certain risks to the application. Figure 11. Annual RMSE of ET0 calculated
    from CLDAS dataset. Figure 12 shows the PB distribution of ET0 calculated by CLDAS
    in 2019–2020. In 2017, the sites with PBias between 0.1 and 0.1 accounted for
    about 60% of all sites in the country, and the overall forecast stability was
    good. The values of ET0CLD in the southern region of climate zone 1, climate zone
    2, the central and northern regions of climate zone 3, the central region of climate
    zone 4, the central and northern regions of climate zone 5, and the central region
    of climate zone 6 are compared with local weather station data. The bias is within
    10%; the bias of ET0CLD from the local weather station data is larger in the northern
    area of climate zone 1, the southern coastal area of climate zone 3 (overestimated),
    and the southern coastal area of climate zone 6 (underestimated), with a gap of
    10% to 30%. However, the numerical bias of climate zone 7 (underestimated) is
    generally greater than 30%. The prediction of ET0CLD in the junction area between
    climate zone 7 and other climate zones is not very stable, and most of them are
    underestimated. Figure 12. ET0 annual PBias distribution calculated from CLDAS
    dataset. In 2018, the bias of ET0 calculated by CLDAS was similar to that in 2017,
    with about 60% of sites having a PBias between 10% and 10%, and ET0CLD in the
    central region of climate zone 1 and a few in the southern part of climate zone
    3. The coastal areas (overestimated), parts of the southern part of climate zone
    5 (overestimated), and the southern coastal areas of climate zone 6 (overestimated)
    have large biases from local weather station data, with a gap of about 10% to
    30%. The (underestimated) numerical bias is generally greater than 30%. Similarly,
    the prediction of ET0CLD for meteorological stations in the junction of climate
    zone 7 with other climate zones is not very stable, and most of them are underestimated.
    In 2019, about 55% of the sites had PBias between −10% and 10%. The ET0CLD in
    the southern part of climate zone 1, most of climate zone 2, the middle part of
    climate zone 3, small parts of the central region of climate zone 4, the central
    and eastern regions of climate zone 5, and the central region of climate zone
    6 within 10% of the data from local weather stations. ET0CLD is in the central
    region of climate zone 1, the southern coastal (overestimated) and northern regions
    (underestimated) of climate zone 3, the central and western regions of climate
    zone 4 (underestimated), and the southern part of climate zone 5 (overestimated).
    The bias between the southern coastal areas of climate zone 6 (overestimated)
    and the local weather station data is relatively large, about 10% to 30%. The
    numerical bias of climate zone 7 (underestimated) is generally greater than 30%.
    In 2020, the bias of ET0 calculated by CLDAS was generally the smallest, and about
    60% of the sites have PBias between 10% and 10%. ET0CLD is in the southern part
    of climate zone 1 and the southwest of climate zone 2. The central region of climate
    zone 3, the central and southern regions of climate zone 4, most of climate zone
    5, and most of climate zone 6 were within 10% of data from local weather stations.
    ET0CLD is in the central region of climate zone 1, a few southern coastal (overestimated)
    and northern regions (underestimated) of climate zone 3, the central and western
    regions of climate zone 4 (underestimated), and a small number of regions in climate
    zone 5 (underestimated). The bias of local weather station data is large, with
    a gap of about 10% to 30%. The numerical bias of climate zone 7 (underestimated)
    was generally greater than 30%. Similarly, the prediction of ET0CLD for meteorological
    stations in the junction of climate zone 7 with other climate zones is not very
    stable, and most of them are underestimated. Figure 13 shows a boxplot of annual
    PBias calculated for the CLDAS dataset. From the median value of PBias, there
    is a bias in the performance of different years. The estimated bias in 2020 and
    2017 is smaller, and the performance of the other two years is relatively poor.
    From the quartile line, the estimated bias in 2020 is the smallest and more compact,
    and the estimated differences in other years have different degrees of fluctuation.
    From the perspective of extreme values, there was a clear overestimation in 2017
    and a clear underestimation in 2018. Additionally, 2020 had the best performance,
    and the estimated bias was the smallest. In conclusion, from 2017 to 2020, bias
    in 2019 and 2020 was the smallest. The CLDAS dataset performs well in climate
    zones 2, 3, 4, and 5 but not in all seasons in climate zone 7. In addition, the
    coastal areas of climate zone 3 and climate zone 6 also performed poorly except
    in 2020. The performance of the boundary areas of different climate zones was
    also relatively poor. Figure 13. The box diagram of annual PBias of ET0 calculated
    from CLDAS dataset. 3.5. Main Factors Affecting Reference Crop Evapotranspiration
    The evapotranspiration process is affected by many factors [43], and its changes
    are mainly attributed to the changes in meteorological factors. The country’s
    climate is complex and diverse. From a geographical point of view, the eastern
    part is mostly a monsoon climate zone with a complex and changeable climate. The
    air above it is severely polluted, affecting solar radiation and surface wind
    speed. Therefore, the performance of estimated ET0 in coastal areas will decline.
    The northwest region is far from the sea, is a non-monsoon region, and belongs
    to a temperate continental climate. The ground topography in this region (the
    junction of climate zones 2, 4, and 5) is complex and changeable, and the wind
    speed is greatly affected by the roughness of the underlying surface. The direction
    of wind movement is accurately simulated, so the reduction in the accuracy of
    wind speed is likely to lead to a decline in the performance of estimating ET0
    in some areas. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau belongs to the plateau climate zone.
    Due to its complex and changeable terrain, the climate itself on the Qinghai-Tibet
    Plateau will fluctuate depending on the region, which greatly affects the estimation
    of ET0. To sum up, the closer are to inland areas (such as climate zones 1, 2,
    and 3), the higher the accuracy of ET0 estimation will be. The performance of
    ET0 estimation in coastal areas, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the junction of
    climatic zones will be negative effects [44,45,46]. From the seasonal point of
    view, the summer is affected by the warm and humid air from the ocean, with high
    temperature, humidity, and rain. The climate is oceanic, so the estimation error
    in summer is the largest. In winter, affected by the dry and cold airflow from
    the continent, the climate is cold, dry, and less rainy, and the climate is continental,
    and the estimation error will be relatively small [47,48]. In addition, specific
    regions need to be further analyzed according to the actual situation. 4. Discussion
    The calculation of ET0 is affected by a variety of climatic factors. Ma et al.
    (2010) [49] studied the influence of main climatic factors on ET0 in mountainous
    plateau areas and found that the change of wind speed had the most significant
    impact on ET0 at each site. Luo et al. (2010) [50] conducted a sensitivity analysis
    on ET0 and main meteorological factors in the main agricultural areas of Tibet,
    and the results showed that ET0 in the whole region had a declining trend over
    the past 50 years. The meteorological element that had the most significant impact
    on ET0 was Rs. Similar results were obtained in our study, where the accuracy
    of ET0 was affected by the error of Rs. Xie et al. (2017) [51] analyzed the impact
    of changes in meteorological factors on ET0 in China’s main grain-producing areas
    from 1961 to 2013, in which ET0 showed a saw-tooth decline. The changing characteristics
    of main meteorological factors in the study area and the response of ET0 are similar
    to the results of our study, showing regional and seasonal variations. Overall,
    our study suggests that the errors of meteorological factors in the Qinghai-Tibet
    Plateau region and the boundary region of the climate zones are more significant
    than in other regions, with the highest errors observed in summer. Due to the
    incomplete understanding of the physical mechanism of weather changes and limited
    observational data, there is still a specific error in the reanalysis data [52],
    and the magnitude of this error tends to vary with different climatic factors.
    Temperature is a meteorological variable with minor errors, usually less than
    10% [53,54]. Similar results were found in our study, in which the R2 of Tmax
    and Tmin are generally greater than 0.9 in the seven climatic zones. Due to the
    influence of topography, the errors of wind speed and relative humidity are usually
    large [26], and similar results were obtained in our study. It is worth mentioning
    that the weather stations in our study are affiliated with the China Meteorological
    Administration. The ground of the weather station is usually covered with short
    grass under adequate irrigation conditions. However, areas in the grid system
    do not necessarily have lush vegetation. Therefore, there might be some differences
    in the environmental factors between the two types of systems, especially for
    the radiant energy (i.e., R2 < 0.65 in the seven climate zones for the RsCLD estimation
    in our study). This may lead to the problem of overestimating or underestimating
    the reanalysis data, which indirectly explains why the estimated ET0 values in
    some areas fluctuate severely in our study. In addition, the variation of wind
    speed is greatly affected by the terrain and the type of underlying surface, and
    it is not easy to obtain the average wind speed in a specific area. Similar results
    were obtained in our study, where the overall UCLA accuracy is not satisfactory.
    Finally, this study can provide an idea for economically underdeveloped countries
    and contribute to improving the reanalysis data set and the accuracy of ET0 estimation.
    Therefore, when other developing countries establish regional climate models,
    they can consider their own terrain and climate characteristics and establish
    a more local model. 5. Conclusions ET0 data set based on reanalysis products can
    make up for the time discontinuity and spatial insufficiency of surface meteorological
    platform data, which is significant for water resources planning and irrigation
    system formulation. However, a rigorous evaluation of reanalysis products must
    be carried out to see if they have value in application. This study evaluated
    the ability of the CLDAS dataset officially published by the Chinese meteorological
    system for ET0 estimation. Results indicate that the temperature data of CLDAS
    have high accuracy in all regions except the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QTP) region.
    In contrast, the accuracy of the total radiation data is average, and the quality
    of relative humidity and wind speed data is poor. The overall accuracy of ET0
    is acceptable except for QTP, but there are many stations with large errors. Among
    seasons, RMSE is the largest in summer and smallest in winter. There are also
    inter-annual differences in the ET0 of this data set. Overall, the CLDAS dataset
    is expected to have good applicability in the Inner Mongolia Grassland area, Northeast
    Taiwan, the Semi-Northern Temperate zone, the Humid and Semi Humid warm Temperate
    zone, and the subtropical region. However, there are certain risks in other regions.
    In addition, of all seasons, summer and spring have the slightest bias, followed
    by autumn and winter. From 2017 to 2020, bias in 2019 and 2020 are the smallest,
    and the areas with large deviation are in the south of climate zone 3, the coastal
    area of climate zone 6, and the boundary area of climate zone 7. Author Contributions

    1. Introduction Irrigation is by far the largest single water user worldwide,
    accounting for more than 70% of total freshwater withdrawals in most regions of
    the world (Khokhar, 2017) in more than 300 million hectares of irrigated agricultural
    lands (Frenken and Gillet, 2012). Many arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural watersheds
    around the world are projected to experience increasing aridity levels throughout
    the 21st century (e.g., Southwestern North America: Seager et al., 2007, Dettinger
    et al., 2015, Cook et al., 2015; Sub-Saharan Africa: Kotir, 2011; Middle East:
    Chenoweth et al., 2011; Central Asia: Lioubimtseva and Henebry, 2009; Southwest
    Australia: Silberstein et al., 2012). Increasing aridity causes concern about
    water sustainability, which is compounded with growing water demand due to socio-economic
    development and population growth in the face of hotter and drier climatic conditions
    (AghaKouchak et al., 2015). The increase in the frequency and duration of droughts
    and changing precipitation patterns will likely intensify surface water shortages
    (e.g., Tietjen et al., 2017, Mallakpour et al., 2018). Consequently, agricultural
    groundwater prospects are dire in arid/semi-arid regions in vast areas of the
    world (Gleeson et al., 2012, Amanambu et al., 2020) due to scarcity and variability
    of renewable water (Basso et al., 2013). As water availability diminishes, there
    is also a rising concern about deteriorating quality of available water resources
    (Parris, 2011) due to excessive sediment and nutrient pollution (US EPA, 2013)
    and salinity issues (Wurbs, 2002). The widening gap between water availability
    and demand necessitates better understanding of water quantity and quality issues
    in irrigated agricultural areas in arid/semi-arid climates. Watershed models are
    used as a practical tool to investigate hydrological processes in agricultural
    lands of arid and semi-arid watersheds to improve our understanding of the watershed’s
    response to irrigation and other agricultural management practices under changing
    climate (Singh and Woolhiser, 2002, Mirchi et al., 2010). Realistic representations
    of regional hydrologic fluxes, water management, and irrigation practices are
    a prerequisite for meaningful watershed modeling applications (Arnold et al.,
    2015), especially in agricultural regions where irrigated croplands are the dominant
    land use. Reproducing the hydrologic response of arid/semi-arid agricultural regions
    that face increasing aridity is particularly challenging due to complexities related
    to human interventions to modify the availability and flow of water in highly
    regulated irrigated watersheds. Model calibration in these watersheds can be a
    time consuming and costly process that involves expert judgment based on practical
    understanding of the regional hydrology, irrigation and agricultural management,
    quality data, and in some cases, good fortune to set up a representative model.
    A good model requires an accurate model setup with a reasonable level of data
    quality and quantity to represent most of the key watershed processes prior to
    calibration (Faramarzi et al., 2015). Once an accurate model is developed, minimum
    calibration is usually required to improve model performance, otherwise calibration
    will be challenging and subjective as the errors due to the lack of accurate model
    setup are counterbalanced with model parameters (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2016, Faramarzi
    et al., 2017, Marek et al., 2017). A “good” calibration requires identification
    of the parameters that govern the hydrological processes and their interactions
    within the given watershed (Kirchner, 2006, Abbaspour et al., 2015, Daggupati
    et al., 2015), and assigning them appropriate values, known as model parametrization
    (Malone et al., 2015). Application of irrigation to maximize crop production creates
    large inter- and intra-annual variations in water consumption, which in turn affects
    key components of the water budget (e.g., streamflow, ET, and groundwater recharge)
    in arid/semi-arid irrigated lands. Watershed models that are capable of representing
    these complexities offer an advantage when investigating hydrologic impacts of
    alternative climate and management scenarios. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool
    (SWAT; Arnold et al., 1998) is a widely applied public-domain semi-distributed,
    continuous-time watershed hydrology and water quality model (Gassman et al., 2007,
    Douglas-Mankin et al., 2010). It informs adaptive water management by facilitating
    quantitative analysis of different components of the water budget within a watershed.
    The model’s ability to simulate hydrological processes under the impacts of water
    and land management practices, and different climate forcings has made it applicable
    in a wide variety of water resources studies. Some examples representing a latitudinal
    pattern of SWAT applications include high and low flows (Singh et al., 2005),
    floods and droughts (Ahn et al., 2018, Ammar et al., 2020), water quality (Abbaspour
    et al., 2007, Abbaspour et al., 2015, Niraula et al., 2013, Xu et al., 2016, Zarrineh
    et al., 2018, Du et al., 2020), irrigation (Srivastava et al., 2010, Xie et al.,
    2014, Ang and Oeurng, 2018), crop yield (Schierhorn et al., 2014, Wang et al.,
    2016, Heidari et al., 2019), climate impact assessment (Song and Zhang, 2012),
    water availability (Schuol et al., 2008, Ahn et al., 2018), and snow hydrology
    (Grusson et al., 2015), among others. SWAT has a global user community with an
    active technical support forum that facilitates its applications worldwide. The
    model delineates the watershed using a digital elevation model (DEM) of topography
    and divides it into Hydrologic Response Units (HRU) based on slope, land use/cover,
    and soil data (Fig. 1). Other primary inputs include available flow and water
    quality data, hydro-meteorological data, and selection of methods to model biophysical
    processes (e.g., potential ET and channel routing). Further, plant growth characteristics
    and options to introduce agricultural operations (application of fertilizers,
    pesticides, tillage, etc. listed under management data) are provided in various
    built-in databases that can be modified based on specific conditions of a given
    modeling application. Outputs can be reported in daily, monthly, and annual time
    scales for HRUs and sub-basins. Download : Download high-res image (637KB) Download

    review of SWAT applications in arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural watersheds
    from 2000 to 2020. We provide an overview of different modeling applications in
    irrigated agricultural lands under the broad themes of water quantity, water quality
    and a combination of these themes, providing a sub-thematic synthesis of the multitude
    of hydrologic and water resources problems investigated with SWAT. We highlight
    modeling challenges such as data availability and quality issues, accuracy of
    results, and limitations in agricultural dominated watersheds, where irrigation
    is the major water management practice that governs the water balance. Further,
    we present example approaches reported in the literature to address these challenges,
    providing a synthesis of SWAT parametrizations for heavily irrigated arid/semi-arid
    agricultural areas to inform model set-up and calibration in future modeling efforts.
    Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the reviewed SWAT applications, calibration
    strategies, interpretation of results, and a roadmap for future model advancements
    and applications to expand the utility of SWAT for addressing water and food security
    questions. 2. Article selection process for literature review We reviewed SWAT
    applications to arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural watersheds from among >3000
    papers on SWAT published in the last two decades (2000–2020). Papers were selected
    for inclusion in this synthesis if they: (i) were published in peer-reviewed scientific
    journals; (ii) applied SWAT in arid and/or semi-arid climates; (iii) explicitly
    mentioned a focus on the simulation of agricultural watersheds; and (iv) took
    irrigation into account. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the paper selection process
    began with a general online search and targeted search of “water and environmental
    science journals” and determining the climate type and presence of agricultural
    lands. Many papers did not mention the climate type, requiring checking the study
    area’s precipitation and evaporation and other sources of climate information
    to determine aridity (e.g., Köppen climate classification map (Kottek et al.,
    2006)). We initially identified 160 papers based on the first three criteria but
    eventually narrowed down the selection to 102 papers that offered substantial
    discussions about irrigation modeling using SWAT. We subsequently classified the
    papers that were selected for detailed review based on the primary modeling theme,
    including (1) water quantity analysis, (2) water quality analysis, and (3) a combination
    of both water quantity and quality issues. We also synthesized the literature
    in terms of modeling challenges and solutions, calibration parameters, and model
    performance. Download : Download high-res image (727KB) Download : Download full-size

    of SWAT to arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural watersheds The reviewed SWAT
    arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural watershed applications illustrate the global
    distribution and thematic foci of the selected studies (Fig. 3). The majority
    of the applications focused on water availability concerns, especially in East
    Asia, North America, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The second largest
    group of applications focused on a combination of water quantity and quality issues
    (e.g., MENA region, Europe, and North America). Only a few studies applied SWAT
    exclusively for water quality modeling of irrigated agricultural settings in arid/semi-arid
    regions (e.g., East Asia). Download : Download high-res image (594KB) Download

    agricultural regions 11 in 24 countries, showing the global distribution and thematic
    foci of the selected studies. SWAT applications that focused on various water
    quantity issues around the world are summarized in Table 1. A common SWAT application
    is to quantify the water budget components and examine the impacts of different
    watershed attributes (e.g., soil type and land use) on hydrologic processes under
    baseline business-as-usual conditions (Yu et al., 2011, Brouziyne et al., 2018,
    Aouissi et al., 2016, Tarawneh et al., 2016, Worqlul et al., 2018, Luan et al.,
    2018). SWAT has also been applied to investigate water availability (surface water
    and groundwater recharge) under demand growth (Perrin et al., 2012, Reshmidevi
    and Nagesh Kumar, 2014, Faramarzi et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2017, Chen et al.,
    2018a, Luan et al., 2018), climate change (Van Liew and Garbrecht, 2003, Abbaspour
    et al., 2009, Awan and Ismaeel, 2014, Ronco et al., 2017, Naderi, 2020), adaptive
    management (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2016, Ahn et al., 2018, Chen et al., 2019b), mitigating
    groundwater depletion (Hu et al., 2010, Marek et al., 2017), and different combinations
    of these issues (Molina-Navarro et al., 2016, Jordan et al., 2018). Table 1. SWAT

    water use. Irrigating rain-fed farms has a larger impact on flow reduction than
    rainwater harvesting. Iran (Masih et al., 2011) The model and its extentions have
    effectively facilitated the analysis of various water, land, and nutrient management
    practices (e.g., irrigation, cropping change, and fertilizer application) on water
    use and crop production at different scales. Examples include total annual irrigation
    water use in a large, transboundary basin (Cheema et al., 2014) and crop yield
    improvements through fertilization management to alleviate potential water conflicts
    due to the need to increase crop production by changing pasture to croplands in
    a harsh environment in Mongolia (Jordan et al., 2018). The SWAT-SSA model was
    developed for Sub-Saharan Africa to examine the potential for expanding “smallholder
    irrigation” farms in the region (Xie et al., 2014). SWAT-FARS (customized version
    of SWAT model for Fars region), showed water usage decrease by removing rice cultivation,
    and water usage increase by pressurized irrigation (Delavar et al., 2020). SWAT’s
    auto-irrigation function has been applied to estimate optimum irrigation water
    demand irrespective of available water resources to quantify water scarcity (e.g.,
    Mikosch et al., 2020). Masud et al. (2018) used SWAT simulated crop yield and
    crop water consumption to investigate impacts of climate change on waterfoot print.
    Notable SWAT applications focusing on water quality issues and a combination of
    water quantity and quality issues are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
    While modeling watershed hydrology processes is a precursor to applying SWAT for
    analyzing water quality problems, Table 2 provides example SWAT applications that
    focused on water quality simulations as the primary objective of the study. Water
    quality analysis applications were predominantly conducted to investigate the
    impacts of baseline water management and hydrologic budget analysis (Santhi et
    al., 2001, Santhi et al., 2006, Luo et al., 2008a, Özcan et al., 2017), as well
    as water quality implications of future climate and land use scenarios (Records
    et al., 2014, Nguyen et al., 2017, Ba et al., 2020). On the national level, SWAT
    has been used as the backend model for web-based decision support tools such as
    Hydrologic and Water Quality System (HAWQS) to examine potential impacts of climate
    change on water quality (Srinivasan, 2019). Besides these themes, potential vulnerabilities
    to increased demand and climate change have been investigated using combined water
    quantity and quality applications of SWAT (Bouraoui et al., 2005, Setegn et al.,
    2010, Zettam et al., 2017) with the ultimate goal of guiding watershed management.
    Typical water quality concerns included sediment and nutrients (Santhi et al.,
    2001, Santhi et al., 2006, Özcan et al., 2017), pesticides (Luo et al., 2008a),
    and daily nutrient transport patterns (Nguyen et al., 2017). Table 2. SWAT applications

    Assessing the impact of reservoirs on water resources and sediment yield; estimating
    surface water components, and addressing the impacts of demand pressures and prolonged
    dry seasons Estimated the contribution of each water resource; surface runoff
    and lateral flow contributed more to the flow; estimated average annual sediment
    load; reservoirs detained a large amount of water and sediment. Algeria (Zettam
    et al., 2017) The growing number of SWAT applications over the last 20 years have
    contributed to better understanding of various long-standing and trending agricultural
    water sustainability challenges under different drivers of change and associated
    implications for water and food security and environmental quality (e.g., possibility
    of algal growth). Papers that examined the impact of demand increase, climate
    change or different management operations, mainly, pointed to the possibility
    of declining water resources and deteriorating water quality such as increasing
    salinity issues in the future (e.g. Masih et al., 2011, Molina-Navarro et al.,
    2016, Hammouri et al., 2017, Nguyen et al., 2017, Jordan et al., 2018, Zou et
    al., 2018, Masud et al., 2018, Masud et al., 2019). In most cases, model-based
    analysis of water management practices (e.g., BMPs) showed positive impact on
    water quantity and quality, especially for on-farm methods such as long-term fallowing,
    dryland farming, early plant growth, conservation tillage, and reduced phosphorous
    application (e.g. Santhi et al., 2005, Santhi et al., 2006, Ficklin et al., 2009,
    Dechmi and Skhiri, 2013, Garg and Wani, 2013, Chen et al., 2017, Chen et al.,
    2018a, Chen et al., 2018b). Other methods such as crop replacement or increasing
    canal conveyance efficiency had less impact on water conservation (Santhi et al.,
    2005). The simulated management scenarios did not always render promising results
    (Özcan et al., 2017). For example saving irrigation water led to decreased crop
    yield (Hu et al., 2010) or pressurized irrigation methods, despite increasing
    crop productivity, did not result in saving water for downstream lake (Ahmadzadeh,
    et al., 2016). 4. Modeling challenges, solutions, and performance evaluation A
    number of challenges to simulate arid/semi-arid watersheds with highly regulated
    water resources systems prompted analysists to use a number of innovative approaches
    and practical techniques to accomplish their objectives (Table 4). The main reported
    modeling challenges are lack of data (Perrin et al., 2012, Faramarzi et al., 2017,
    Chen et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2018a), poor data quality (Marek et al., 2017,
    Chen et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2018a), concerns about simulation accuracy (Setegn
    et al., 2010, Faramarzi et al., 2017, Marek et al., 2017), and technical limitations
    of the existing versions of the model (Santhi et al., 2005, Santhi et al., 2006,
    Perrin et al., 2012, Sun and Ren, 2014, Wu et al., 2016, Marek et al., 2017, Chen
    et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2018a, Wei et al., 2018) despite numerous advancements

    2011); Coupled SWAT-MODSIM to estimate water productivity of wheat and maize with

    groundwater in MODFLOW to SWAT HRUs, combining surface water and groundwater irrigation
    in SWAT’s auto-irrigation function, and applying MODFLOW-PSB for numerous groundwater
    sources and sinks (Aliyari et al., 2019) *Theoretical method does not fully represent
    the actual condition or simulation algorithms affect results. Data issues are
    a classic challenge in watershed modeling applications. Data availability and
    quality are especially important for arid/semi-arid agricultural watersheds, which
    experience extreme hydrologic events (e.g., droughts and flash floods) and human
    impacts. Successful application of SWAT in such settings requires detailed information
    about management operations such as irrigation, fertilizer application, cultivation,
    harvest, and other agricultural operations (e.g., tillage), as well as good information
    about watershed attributes (curve number (CN), soil hydraulic conductivity, etc.).
    In a number of applications, SWAT’s performance was improved through augmenting
    data availability by combining data from different sources with SWAT’s existing
    databases (Van Liew and Garbrecht, 2003, Perrin et al., 2012, Molina-Navarro et
    al., 2016, Yu et al., 2011, Bressiani et al., 2015). SWAT’s capability to fill
    missing data using weather generator, auto-irrigation, and auto-fertilization
    functions are frequently used to cope with data unavailability issues (Zeng and
    Cai, 2014, Aouissi et al., 2016, Faramarzi et al., 2017, Rahbeh et al., 2019).
    The main issue with using auto-irrigation and auto-fertilization is that these
    functions may not represent on-the-ground operations, significantly simplifying
    the actual conditions. The uncertainty of using auto-irrigation and auto-fertilization
    functions instead of actual fertilization or irrigation practices can be reduced
    by verifying the results against available field data (e.g. Masud et al., 2018,
    Ahn et al., 2018). It is also common to use supplemental tools to estimate missing
    data and evaluate model performance (Luo et al., 2008a, Perrin et al., 2012, Awan
    and Ismaeel, 2014, Nguyen et al., 2017, Ehtiat et al., 2018, Qiu et al., 2019,
    Aliyari et al., 2019), cross-examine data from different sources (Marek et al.,
    2017, Chen et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2018a), or manipulate built-in databases
    and parameters to improve simulation of certain parameters (e.g., ET) in drylands
    (e.g., Marek et al., 2017). In some studies, modelers traded off the accuracy
    of simulation of some parameters for simplicity of application when those inferior
    results did not affect the major aim of the study (Setegn et al., 2010, Perrin
    et al., 2012, Marek et al., 2017). Since SWAT is open source, an active community
    of model developers have continuously contributed to expanding the model’s capabilities
    and improving process representations. This has been done by developing modular
    codes, tools, and algorithms, including model improvements to better represent
    agricultural operations in arid/semi-arid regions (Ouessar et al., 2009, Notter
    et al., 2012, Dechmi and Skhiri, 2013, Wei et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2018).
    Examples of specific technical developments to improve SWAT performance in arid/semi-arid
    irrigated agricultural settings include adding crop rotation simulation capability
    (Marek et al., 2017), developing an algorithm to simulate managed allowed depletion
    (MAD) irrigation in SWAT’s auto-irrigation function (Chen et al., 2018a), using
    the modified plant growth module of winter wheat to estimate crop yields (Sun
    and Ren, 2014), and SWAT-Salt to model the fate and transport of major salt ions
    which is a major concern in irrigated croplands using surface water or groundwater
    sources that are rich in total dissolved solids (Bailey et al., 2019). Furthermore,
    coupling SWAT with other models has allowed taking advantage of the strengths
    of different models. Notably, developing integration frameworks for linking SWAT
    with MODFLOW (Guzman et al., 2015a) or coupling them (Bailey et al., 2016) has
    facilitated the simulation of groundwater characteristics and surface water-groundwater
    dynamics in arid/semi-arid agricultural regions (e.g., Ehtiat et al., 2018). SWAT
    uses numerous parameters to simulate different hydrologic processes within watersheds.
    Some of these parameters are related to physical characteristics such as soil
    type, crop type, climate, etc. (Neitsch et al., 2011). The selection of sensitive
    parameters and determination of possible range of change is critical for calibrating
    the model. Modelers have used different ways to calibrate SWAT, including attempting
    a single parameter value, a range of parameter values, or changing default value
    of model parameters within an interval. The most common parameters extracted from
    the reviewed papers are summarized in Table 5. The parameters were broadly grouped
    under surface runoff, ET, soil water, and groundwater based on parameter definitions
    and their effect. An extensive table of the parameters reported in the reviewed
    literature is available in Supplementary Material (Table S1). Table 5 and Table
    S1 provide useful suggestions about parameter values that can inform the calibration
    process. However, it should be emphasized that the list of parameters and the
    general range of calibrated parameters in these two tables are merely based on
    what has been reported in the literature. The sensitive parameters and their range
    for a particular SWAT application in an arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural
    watershed should be selected based on the characteristics of the watershed, regional
    data, and modeling objectives. Modelers should use caution when defining the range
    of parameter values and they should examine the final values of calibrated parameters
    to ensure that parameter values are physically possible based on the theoretical
    definition, and they are reasonable considering the watershed characteristics.

    et al., 2019b NOTE: The list of parameters, initial ranges, and the range of calibrated
    parameter values are given to provide an idea about initiating model parametrization
    and calibration. Model parametrization and calibration should be performed based
    on region-specific data (if available) and characteristics of the watershed. Readers
    are referred to Table S1 in Supplementary Material for a full list of parameter
    values reported in the literature in different parts of the world. a Initial value
    is based on the range of default parameter values in SWAT documentation. In cases
    where a default value was unavailable (marked with an asterisk), the range is
    based on the lowest and highest values of initial attempts among all applications.
    b Relative change indicates the range over which the parameter values were varied.
    c A full list of papers is provided in Table S1 in Supplementary Material. It
    is recommended that parameter definitions and values be closely compared with
    those published in SWAT’s theoretical documentation to avoid errors of oversight.
    In some instances, differences between the model interface and documentation can
    create confusion for SWAT users. For example, a value between 0 and 100 should
    be used for auto-irrigation efficiency (IRR_EFF) according to SWAT documentation
    but the model interface takes numbers between 0 and 1. Although this may appear
    to be a trivial discrepancy, it can become a source of error if modelers do not
    fully examine the theoretical underpinnings of irrigation representation in SWAT
    to use reasonable parameter values. A common error when using auto-irrigation
    is caused when the irrigation trigger is selected as “soil water content”. According
    to SWAT documentation, the parameter value determining the start of auto-irrigation
    (i.e., AUTO_WSTRS) should be between 0 and 1, if the threshold is defined by “plant
    water demand”, which refers to the allowable fraction of potential plant growth
    before model triggers irrigation. However, when the threshold is based on “soil
    water content” the AUTO _WSTRS parameter value is the amount of soil water below
    field capacity in mmH2O. Yet, the model interface’s pop-up message for AUTO _WSTRS
    only states that this parameter should be between 0 and 1, despite the fact that
    modelers should use much larger values of soil water content if the objective
    is to simulate actual irrigation conditions in arid/semi-arid regions where soil
    water content may drop many millimeters below field capacity between irrigation
    applications. The plant available water below field capacity, a parameter which
    is used in determining irrigation depth through scientific irrigation scheduling,
    could range from 40 mmH2O per meter of crop root zone in coarse sand to 180 mmH2O
    in clay loam (Evett et al., 2008). In addition, except for drip irrigation systems,
    which account for only 10% of irrigated area within the U.S. (USDA, 2019), other
    types of irrigation systems cannot physically apply such a small amount of water.
    Further, if unchecked, unreasonable parameter values may be obtained by automatic
    calibration (e.g., SWAT-CUP). In one application, the calibrated Manning’s roughness
    coefficient (n) for tributary channels was reported to be 5.54 (Rivas-Tabares
    et al., 2019), which is significantly larger than the largest Manning’s number
    in TR-55 (0.8 for sheet flow over dense underbrush (TR-55, 1986)) and other well-known
    references (e.g., Chow, 1959). Table 6 summarizes common calibration components
    and model performances broadly classified as poor, moderate, and good based on
    widely used goodness-of-fit factors. Common calibration methods include manual
    calibration (Jones et al., 2008, Reshmidevi et al., 2018, Ahn et al., 2018, Fallatah
    et al., 2019, Epelde et al., 2016), using SUFI-2 algorithm provided by SWAT-CUP
    (Abbaspour, 2011, Abbaspour, 2015) or dynamically dimensioned search (DDS; Tolson
    and Shoemaker, 2007) for automatic calibration and uncertainty analysis (Abbaspour
    et al., 2009, Masih et al., 2011, Ashraf Vaghefi et al., 2017, Becker et al.,
    2019, Aliyari et al., 2019), and a combination of these approaches (e.g., Ficklin
    et al., 2013). Table 6. Summary of common calibration descriptors, components,

    among all applications and recommended range is based on guidelines in Moriasi
    et al. (2007). The majority (~80%) of the reviewed SWAT applications in arid regions
    calibrated the model only for streamflow and used this parameter for model performance
    evaluation. SWAT has also been calibrated for a combination of hydrologic components
    besides streamflow (e.g., ET, sediment, and nutrients) based on the aim of the
    study (Santhi et al., 2005, Perrin et al., 2012, Pulido-Velazquez et al., 2015,
    Ahmadzadeh et al., 2016, Jordan et al., 2018). Faramarzi et al. (2017) verified
    the model results for ET and groundwater recharge by calibrating it for streamflow
    and crop yield to simulate the regional watershed hydrology. Pulido-Velazquez
    et al. (2015) calibrated SWAT for streamflow, groundwater recharge, crop yield,
    and nitrate leaching. They used previous studies (i.e., soft data) to evaluate
    simulated groundwater recharge rate, stream-aquifer interactions, and nitrate
    leaching, and calibrated the model for irrigation water and crop yield based on
    crop surveys and experimental data (Pulido-Velazquez et al., 2015). Marek et al.
    (2016) concluded that ET simulated by SWAT for irrigated crops in an arid watershed
    was reasonable, although using the default crop growth model and default values
    for parameters controlling plant behavior in some cases like cotton and sunflower
    could introduce inaccuracies (generally underestimation). In another study, SWAT
    was calibrated for recharge based on a groundwater balance equation due to the
    lack of continuous flow time series in seasonal rivers (Perrin et al., 2012).
    Jones et al. (2008) applied a step by step manual calibration procedure to model
    the differences in flow regime and watershed characteristics of Tigris-Euphrates
    River system in mountainous and plain parts. They first adjusted snowpack and
    snowmelt parameters to account for the snowmelt-runoff regime of the river flow.
    In the next step, they calibrated soil water and groundwater parameters for high
    and low flow conditions in downstream gauges, and finally adjusted channel routing
    parameters. Ignoring the snowmelt and frozen soils may weaken the model’s ability
    to simulate low flows in areas where these processes occur (Zhang et al., 2016).
    In an effort to facilitate objective model evaluation, Moriasi et al., 2007, Moriasi
    et al., 2015 summarized a number of quantitative goodness-of-fit factors (e.g.,
    Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and percent bias (PBIAS)) and offered guidelines
    for systematic watershed simulation assessment based on a comprehensive literature
    survey. It is interesting to note how modelers interpret the goodness-of-fit factor
    values using a variety of verbal descriptors to demonstrate simulation quality.
    For example, a model calibration can be deemed “good” over a wide range of NSE
    values for streamflow simulations (0.20–0.99) described as “fairly well”, “very
    good”, and “above satisfactory” (Table 6). This finding is not unique to models
    of irrigated agricultural watersheds as it can be seen elsewhere as well (Douglas‐Mankin
    et al., 2010; Tuppad et al., 2011, Krysanova and White, 2015). 5. Discussion Capturing
    the adaptive nature of agricultural practices in arid/semi-arid regions to cope
    with drastic surface water variability is a formidable modeling challenge (Niraula
    et al., 2012) that involves tradeoffs between data requirement, calibration effort,
    and model performance. As such, simulating arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural
    watersheds with SWAT requires innovative approaches that utilize multi-component
    model calibration, account for irrigation, and report current limitations to guide
    future model advancements. 5.1. The need for multi-component calibration As a
    model that provides numerous parameters to simulate a variety of biophysical processes
    in watersheds, estimating appropriate/realistic parameter values to build SWAT
    models is generally difficult due to equifinality or non-unique parameter values,
    meaning that different sets of parameter values may produce equally good results
    for a particular water budget component (Khatami et al., 2019). In heavily irrigated
    agricultural lands, all the major water budget components should be quantified
    and interpreted with a particular attention to irrigation and land management.
    Multi-component calibration and validation of major hydrologic components can
    improve the reliability of results or pinpoint areas where field data are most
    needed. Deliberate calibration of components such as streamflow, ET, and groundwater
    recharge based on “hard” and “soft” data and knowledge of the watershed hydrology
    can help account for the water budget impacts of agricultural management decisions
    in arid and semi-arid climates (Arnold et al., 2015). Despite a satisfactory streamflow
    calibration (NSE = 0.61–0.91), Acero Triana et al. (2019) recalibrated SWAT based
    on both groundwater recharge and streamflow to avoid coupled SWAT-MODFLOW model
    instability caused by excessive zonal recharge simulated by SWAT in some parts
    of the basin. Although NSE values of SWAT simulated streamflow dropped from 0.64
    to 0.54, the multi-component calibration was necessary to ensure SWAT-MODFLOW
    simulations matched groundwater heads, as well as measured streamflow (Acero Triana
    et al., 2019). Based on our review, the majority of models of irrigated agricultural
    watersheds are typically calibrated and validated for streamflow without checking
    the model’s reliability in reproducing other components, a finding that is consistent
    with other reviews of SWAT to simulate watershed hydrology in general (Wellen
    et al., 2015). Only a very small fraction (5%) of the applications calibrated
    SWAT for more than two water quantity or quality components. While model calibration
    for streamflow only is often practical and time saving, neglecting other important
    natural or anthropogenic hydrologic components can undermine realistic regional
    water budget analyses in irrigated agricultural areas in arid/semi-arid regions.
    In these areas, agricultural evapotranspiration, soil water content, groundwater
    recharge, and return flows are actively managed through irrigation to maximize
    crop production. Representation of these processes and model calibration issues
    in irrigated agricultural settings need further investigation to guide agricultural
    water management at the spatial scales smaller than course regional water budget
    analyses. The argument in favor of multi-component calibration does not mean that
    serendipitous outcomes based on streamflow calibration are impossible. For example,
    in one application, SWAT simulated biomass well although the model was calibrated
    to capture peak flows (Jordan et al., 2018). However, caution should be used in
    evaluating water budget components generated with SWAT models of arid/semi-arid
    irrigated agricultural watersheds that are calibrated based on streamflow alone.
    A good streamflow calibration does not necessarily render realistic results when
    evaluating other important, managed components of the water budget. Thus, additional
    effort to complete a multi-component calibration is recommended when quantifying
    hydrologic fluxes that govern water availability in managed systems such as irrigated
    agricultural watersheds in dry regions. The lack of sufficient observational data
    for ET and groundwater recharge pose a great challenge for multi-component calibration
    to quantify the water budget of irrigated agricultural systems in arid/semi-arid
    climates (Masud et al., 2018, Masud et al., 2019). The ability of SWAT to simulate
    watershed processes using built-in databases is a reason for popularity of the
    model use in data-scarce regions (e.g., Aouissi et al., 2016). Literature values
    and parameter estimates based on expert judgments can provide useful soft data
    for use along with observational records to facilitate multi-component calibration
    of SWAT. Abbaspour et al. (2009) suggest a combination of streamflow and crop
    yield as a more reliable representation for the main water budget components than
    only using streamflow because crop yield represents ET as well as nutrient uptake.
    The combination of reasonable streamflow and ET results should theoretically translate
    into improved soil moisture and GW recharge simulations. Leveraging global databases,
    remote sensing, or models to fill the data gaps can improve the data sets required
    for more accurate model set up and calibration (Luo et al., 2008a, Githui et al.,
    2012, Awan and Ismaeel, 2014, Reshmidevi et al., 2018, Bressiani et al., 2015,
    Qiu et al., 2019, Becker et al., 2019). 5.2. Accounting for Irrigation. The importance
    of irrigation and associated processes (e.g., return flow) that affect water budget
    calculations for arid/semi-arid regions has been documented (Kannan et al., 2011,
    Githui et al., 2012). In arid regions with insignificant rainfall, crop ET and
    groundwater recharge are typically directly related to irrigation. It has been
    shown that incorporating irrigation using groundwater changes streamflow pattern
    (Zeng and Cai, 2014) and including irrigation return flows can improve model calibration
    (Kannan et al., 2011). In another application, recharge was found to be higher
    in irrigated perennial pastures compared to non-irrigated areas (e.g., Githui
    et al., 2012). Often, lack of detailed information on agricultural operations
    (irrigation, planting, fertilizing, etc.) necessitates simplifying the model,
    which requires additional checks (Sinnathamby et al., 2017, Masud et al., 2018,
    Masud et al., 2019). SWAT’s auto-irrigation function is commonly used to simulate
    irrigation based on plant water demand or heat units or soil water content which
    might be quite different from what happens in reality (Luo et al., 2008a, Ficklin
    et al., 2009, Kannan et al., 2011, Bressiani et al., 2015, Faramarzi et al., 2017,
    Marek et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2018a, Jordan et al., 2018,
    Ahn et al., 2018). Inevitably, the auto-irrigation function introduces some uncertainties
    by over-estimating surface water withdrawal in areas where surface water and groundwater
    are conjunctively used for irrigation (Ahn et al., 2018). It is essential to verify
    the simulated irrigation against available observed or soft data (e.g., monthly
    or daily irrigation) or calibrate crop ET as a surrogate for irrigation (e.g.,
    Faramarzi et al., 2017) to ensure reasonable consistency between simulated and
    actual conditions. 5.3. Reporting model limitations, sensitivity, and uncertainty
    While watershed modeling inherently involves some level of subjectivity regarding
    parametrization decisions based on circumstantial considerations (e.g., purpose,
    time, cost, setting, and data availability), objective evaluation of model performance
    in simulating the hydrological fluxes is an indispensable modeling activity that
    is sometimes overlooked. There appears to be a general lenience to interpret model
    performance as “good” (Table 6) with minimal scrutiny of model performance and
    limitations. Details of irrigation simulation, the most important agricultural
    water management activity, are often not discussed in many applications (e.g.,
    Wagner et al., 2012, Gebremicael et al., 2013, Epelde et al., 2016, Fallatah et
    al., 2019). Likewise, there is very limited coverage of regional relevance of
    model parameter values and associated uncertainties in the growing body of literature
    on SWAT applications in arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural watersheds. Of the
    102 reviewed applications, only 5 explicitly reflected on the concerns about the
    adequacy of simulated regional hydrologic fluxes, and used both streamflow and
    crop yield (surrogate for ET) in an attempt to produce regionally meaningful results
    (Faramarzi et al., 2017, Abbaspour et al., 2009, Ahn et al., 2018, Akhavan et
    al., 2010, Acero Triana et al., 2019). Articulating modeling assumptions, simplifications,
    and possible errors (e.g., Masud et al., 2018) contribute to insightful model
    applications by other users. Reporting limitations (e.g., data availability, technical
    capabilities, and model performance) explicitly can help put the watershed modeling
    results in the appropriate context. It can encourage efforts to address the data
    challenges by developing much needed monitoring programs and improving SWAT processes/algorithms
    to better quantify different components of the water budget in arid/semi-arid
    agricultural watersheds. Several factors can impact the calibration and model
    reliability besides model capabilities, data issues and modeler’s knowledge of
    regional natural or managed hydrologic characteristics. The combination of data
    issues, multitude of interactive biophysical processes, and equifinality makes
    parameter estimation of highly managed irrigated watersheds very difficult. Arnold
    et al. (2012) offered the most sensitive parameters in SWAT for different water
    quantity and quality components. Yuan et al. (2015) identified the most sensitive
    parameters for runoff simulation, base flow, and sediment and nutrient transport.
    Neglecting “important processes”, the choice of objective function and optimization
    algorithms when using automated calibration, and model conditionality are other
    factors that affect model reliability (Guzman et al., 2015b, Abbaspour et al.,
    2018). Different objective functions and optimization algorithms might calibrate
    and validate the model well regardless of the reasonable range of the parameters
    (Abbaspour et al., 2018). Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are recommended
    for hydrological models as exploratory and diagnostic tools to support calibration
    efforts and ensure credible results (Abbaspour et al., 2015, Abbaspour et al.,
    2018). 5.4. Remaining challenges and ideas for future development and applications
    Over the last twenty years, SWAT has continually evolved to accommodate the need
    to simulate diverse natural and managed watershed processes in irrigated lands.
    Nonetheless, a number of remaining challenges should be addressed to expand the
    applicability of SWAT to irrigated agricultural settings in arid/semi-arid regions
    to capture management uncertainties during the transition from wet to dry years
    (Table 7). Adaptive agricultural water and land management decisions in these
    areas are closely related to surface water variability and groundwater sustainability.
    The extent and magnitude of water scarcity and associated pumping costs and economic
    value of crops affect agricultural water management decisions such as inter-annual
    changes in pumping, irrigation schedule (frequency and amount) and method (surface
    (gravity), sprinkler, and/or drip irrigation), cropping pattern, and in extreme
    cases land retirement. Advancements such as conjunctive use of surface water and
    groundwater, explicit simulation of different irrigation systems, and dynamic
    land use would significantly enhance the flexibility and applicability of the
    model for arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural lands. The conjunctive use of
    surface water and groundwater resources, a common drought adaptation measure,
    and effectiveness of irrigation technologies (e.g., drip) cannot be simulated
    directly by the current versions of SWAT. Further, the reviewed SWAT applications
    typically used static land use/cover conditions during long-term hydrologic simulations,
    which does not capture hydrologic impacts of drought-adaptive agricultural practices
    despite their significance (Ahn et al., 2018). Recent developments to include
    dynamic land use data is a notable progress that requires testing worldwide (Moriasi
    et al., 2019). Table 7. Remaining challenges and potential solutions for applying
    SWAT to irrigated agricultural settings in arid/semi-arid climates. Remaining
    Challenge Solution Modeling adaptive agricultural water management Updating the
    model source code to: (1) simulate conjunctive use of water from different sources
    for irrigation, including surface water, shallow groundwater, and deep groundwater;
    (2) simulate different irrigation systems (surface (gravity), drip, sprinkler,
    and subsurface irrigation) Modeling adaptive agricultural land management Updating
    the model to simulate dynamic land use to represent changes in cropping patternc
    Expanding the plant (i.e., crop) growth databasea Developing parameter sets for
    crops that are currently not included in the crop database such as nuts (pecan,
    pistachio), fruits (apricot, pomegranate, cherry), cucurbits (pumpkin, squash,
    zucchini) Improving auto-irrigation function Providing options to stop auto-irrigation
    post-harvest or at the end of the growing season Modeling the effects of soil
    and water salinity Updating the model to account for soil salinity and water salinity
    stress on crop growth and yield Modeling the fate and transport of pesticidesb
    Improving the original code to better simulate the fate and transport of pesticides,
    especially for low flows and account for the effect of drift in pesticide application
    a Users can add any plants to the model database. However, including the characteristics
    of common crops in the model database will facilitate the model’s application
    and reduces the possibility of input errors. b See Wang et al. (2019) for more
    information. c See Moriasi et al. (2019) for more information. Future advancements
    can expand the crop database and improve auto-irrigation (Table 7). SWAT’s crop
    database can be expanded through collaborations with agronomists to develop parameter
    sets for crops that are cultivated in arid/semi-arid regions (e.g., apricot, pecan,
    pistachio, pomegranate, etc.). Applying auto-irrigation scheduled by date and
    soil water content threshold in the current versions of SWAT can lead to continued
    irrigation of crops even after the harvest (Chen et al., 2017). As long as there
    is enough water in the source (reach, aquifer, or other watersheds), the auto-irrigation
    function keeps irrigating the fields until soil water content reaches the specified
    water stress threshold below field capacity. This issue can be addressed by providing
    options in the auto-irrigation module to stop irrigation based on the crop maturity
    and harvest time. The problem of continuous irrigation is not the case for setting
    auto-irrigation based on heat units, likely because conditions prompting irrigation
    will no longer prevail once the heat units for crop maturity are met. Our review
    of the applications of SWAT in arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural watersheds
    reveals strict dominance of the model''s use to better understand water quantity
    aspects of water management. While this is to be expected given the reality of
    water scarcity and associated challenges for agricultural production in these
    regions, the capabilities of SWAT to model water quality have been underutilized.
    SWAT can be improved with respect to simulation of water quality aspects of irrigated
    agriculture in arid/semi-arid regions. Representation of salinity issues of irrigated
    agriculture can be advanced by providing capabilities to account for soil salinity
    and water salinity stress on crop growth and yield in SWAT-Salt, the salinity
    module of SWAT (Bailey et al., 2019). There is also a need for improved modeling
    of the fate and transport of pesticides, especially for the prevailing low streamflow
    conditions in arid/semi-arid regions (Table 7). SWAT+, which is the revised version
    of the model aims to improve the model structure for easier code development and
    better spatial representation of the watershed features such as interaction of
    rivers and landscape (Bieger et al., 2017). With mounting concerns about reaching
    the limits of good quality water resources in many regions (Gleick and Palaniappan,
    2010, de Graaf et al., 2019), using SWAT to examine water quality for various
    combinations of agricultural land and water management will be an important area
    of future model applications. 6. Conclusions This paper provided a review of SWAT
    applications in irrigated agricultural watersheds in arid/semi-arid climates in
    the last two decades. The applications fall into three broad categories listed
    as follows in the order of prevalence: (1) water quantity analysis, (2) a combination
    of water quantity and quality issues, and (3) water quality analysis (only a few).
    The main modeling challenges are lack of data, poor data quality, concerns about
    simulation accuracy, and technical limitations of the existing versions of the
    model. Researchers have used a number of innovative approaches and practical techniques
    to deal with the modeling challenges, including augmenting data availability by
    combining data from different sources with those provided in the existing SWAT
    databases, using supplemental tools to estimate missing data and evaluate model
    performance, trading off the accuracy of simulation of some parameters for simplicity
    of application where those inferior results did not affect the major aim of the
    study, and developing modular codes, tools, and algorithms. Simulation of physical
    characteristics of agricultural watersheds in arid and semi-arid climates requires
    insightful model parametrization, model setup, and calibration using soft data
    along with available field measurements (i.e., hard data). While a wide array
    of existing and emerging capabilities make SWAT the watershed model of choice
    in different settings, fine-tuning SWAT to model key hydrologic attributes (e.g.,
    streamflow, ET, and groundwater recharge) of arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural
    watersheds remains time consuming and challenging. We synthesized SWAT parametrizations
    for heavily irrigated arid/semi-arid agricultural areas to inform model set-up
    and calibration in future modeling efforts. It is essential that users carefully
    examine what the model can or cannot provide in relation to the objectives of
    the study based on practical understanding and theoretical underpinnings of simulating
    irrigation to avoid potential errors, especially when using auto-irrigation function
    and auto-calibration tools. Reporting modeling limitations explicitly can help
    put the watershed simulation results in appropriate context. Future advancements
    such as conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater, dynamic annual land
    use, explicit capabilities to model irrigation management interventions, and simulation
    of salinity impacts on crop growth would significantly enhance the flexibility
    and performance of the model for addressing water and food security questions
    in the context of arid/semi-arid irrigated agricultural areas. Declaration of

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract The Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) lacks
    a system for measuring canal inflows, storages, and outflows that is trusted by
    all parties, transparent, and accessible. An earlier attempt for telemetering
    flows in the IBIS did not deliver. There is now renewed interest in revisiting
    telemetry in Pakistan’s IBIS at both national and provincial scales. These investments
    are typically approached with an emphasis on hardware procurement contracts. This
    paper describes the experience from field installations of flow measurement instruments
    and communication technology to make the case that canal flows can be measured
    at high frequency and displayed remotely to the stakeholders with minimal loss
    of data and lag time between measurement and display. The authors advocate rolling
    out the telemetry system across IBIS as a data as a service (DaaS) contract rather
    than as a hardware procurement contract. This research addresses a key issue of
    how such a DaaS contract can assure data quality, which is often a concern with
    such contracts. The research findings inform future telemetry investment decisions
    in large-scale irrigation systems, particularly the IBIS. Keywords: Indus Basin
    Irrigation System; sensors; telemetry; data contract 1. Introduction Pakistan
    hosts the world’s sixth largest population, estimated at 207.7 million according
    to the 2017 census [1]. The country consists of four provinces which share water
    from the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS). The IBIS is the backbone of Pakistan’s
    agricultural economy. The agriculture sector, including crops, livestock, fisheries,
    and forestry, contributed 18.5 percent to the GDP in 2018–2019 and is a source
    of livelihood for 38.5 percent of the nation’s total labor force [2]. The IBIS
    is a large, complex system of hydraulic infrastructure that has been developed
    incrementally over many decades and represents an estimated US$300 billion in
    investment [3]. It consists of 2 large reservoirs, 16 barrages, 2 headworks, 12
    inter-river canals, and 45 canal irrigation systems, and irrigates an area of
    the order of 17M ha. A formal agreement on the apportioning of the surface water
    resources of Pakistan between the four provinces was finally reached in 1991 (herein
    referred to as the Accord) after long deliberations [4,5]. The Accord, ratified
    on 21 March 1991, was heralded to remove the biggest hurdle in the way of national
    unity and cohesion [5]. Unfortunately, the Accord has been unable to deliver this
    national unity and cohesion, which, in turn, has stymied investment and development
    in water resources. Mistrust between the provinces and conspiracy theories abound,
    and at best there is an uneasy peace [4,6]. The lack of trust between the provinces
    of Pakistan is at the heart of the water issues [7]. The Indus River System Authority
    Act 1992 followed shortly after the Accord and paved the way for creating the
    Indus River System Authority (IRSA) as stipulated in Clause 13 of the Accord.
    In 2004 the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), a federal government
    institution of Pakistan, installed an electronic system to measure depth-of-flow
    at various key locations along the IBIS and to transmit these data electronically—referred
    to as the WAPDA Telemetry. The locations where WAPDA installed the telemetry system
    are shown in Figure 1. This system was installed with an investment of US$5.4
    million in 2004 prices [8]. The Government of Pakistan in 2012 commissioned a
    panel of international experts who authored a seminal report on the water challenges
    of Pakistan and the way forward. This report, commonly known as the Friends of
    Democratic Pakistan (FODP) report [6], made the observation that a decade ago,
    the telemetry system was installed to automate the measurement and reporting process,
    but it has not worked [6]. The popular press in Pakistan also report that the
    investment in telemetry has never worked satisfactorily or been accepted by the
    stakeholders, in particular, IRSA (e.g., [9,10]). Figure 1. Location map of telemetry
    locations in the Indus Basin Irrigation System. Briscoe and Qamar in 2005 [11]
    suggested the following requirements to implement the Accord in a transparent
    manner: 1.  “A rigorous, calibrated system for measuring water inflows, storages,
    and outflows be put in place. 2.  The measurement system be audited by a party
    which is not only scrupulously independent and impartial but is seen to be so
    by all parties. 3.  Reporting must be totally transparent and available in real
    time for all parties to scrutinize.” This sentiment has been expressed in numerous
    other reports and studies [12,13,14]. Importantly, the Government of Pakistan
    has acknowledged the need for automated flow monitoring in its National Water
    Policy [15], approved in 2018: “Real-time monitoring of river flows by IRSA is
    to be ensured through inter alia telemetric monitoring to maintain transparent
    water accounting system and to check the increasing trend of unaccounted-for water
    in the Indus System of Rivers. This task should be completed before the end 2021”(sic).
    Some of the clamor for telemetry in the IBIS stems from the fact that IRSA reports
    large volume balance errors (referred to in the vernacular as losses/gains) every
    year. The average (1976–2015) annual surface water resource of Pakistan is 178.461
    Gm3/year. The average unaccounted volume for the same period remained 22.474 Gm3/year;
    hence, approximately 13% of Pakistan’s annual water resource remains unaccounted-for.
    During 2014–2015, the unaccounted-for volume reached 36.082 Gm3/year, which was
    more than twice the national reservoir capacity of Pakistan at that time [16].
    This inability to account for water results in recriminations and mistrust between
    the provinces and in the data and information reported by IRSA [4,6]. The term
    “unaccounted-for water” is commonly used for public water utilities performance.
    Large amounts of water supplies to major cities remain unaccounted-for, e.g.,
    in Asia, Latin America, and Africa [17]. In many cases, the data exist with researchers,
    water users, and local authorities but do not become available to the water accounting
    authority. The water accounting in the IBIS is based upon the system inflows (the
    aggregated river inflows) and system outflows (aggregated canal withdrawals).
    The difference between the system inflows and outflows is referred to as unaccounted-for
    water or, more commonly, losses and gains. IRSA receives disaggregated data from
    various line agencies and then processes this to prepare national water accounts.
    The existing data acquisition, archiving, and reporting system is not robust and
    the inability to account for potential losses (e.g., evaporation, leaks from river
    beds, etc.) gives rise to unaccounted volumes. Principle #5 of the Organisation
    for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principles on Water Governance
    states, “Produce, update, and share timely, consistent, comparable and policy-relevant
    water and water-related data and information, and use it to guide, assess and
    improve water policy.” [18,19]. The Government of Pakistan has re-engaged with
    the issue of water data and information in the recent years. The Government is
    undertaking a project (World Bank Project identifier P110099; closing date 30
    June 2021) that includes an activity for “automation of flow measurement and information
    system for the IBIS using telemetry system and modern techniques” with the objective
    that this will scale up efforts to increase transparency in the inter-provincial
    water allocation system and contribute to water conveyance efficiency in the IBIS
    [20]. Similarly, the provincial Governments have also invested [21,22] in the
    installation of hydro-met and real-time flow monitoring. This paper presents the
    experience of a pilot study instrumenting canals in the IBIS (herein called the
    Indus Telemetry) to demonstrate technological choices and, more importantly, how
    the quality of acquired data can be ensured, particularly when data are supplied
    as a service. A Data as a Service (DaaS) contract in the water sector, as opposed
    to more conventional hardware procurement contracts, requires more careful consideration
    of the data quality. This research offers insight into a data quality process
    by expanding on its various steps and assesses its attributes or dimensions such
    as integrity, timeliness, and accuracy. The authors develop and apply a new statistical
    indicator for data timeliness and also analyze data integrity and accuracy by
    using appropriate statistical indicators. This research also addresses the question
    of what should be the statistical limits (upper or lower bounds) for the indicators
    used to assess data quality. Previous work on this topic is limited; therefore,
    the present research will lead to new knowledge in the quality assurance of water
    data and information that, in turn, will foster trust and confidence in the data
    acquired. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. The Study Area Figure 1 shows a map of
    the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) indicating the four pilot locations.
    The figure also identifies 24 key locations where the Water and Power Development
    Authority (WAPDA) set up a telemetry system in 2004. Notably, many of these key
    locations are barrages where more than one canal take off from the river. Thus,
    WAPDA installed at these key locations multiple water level sensors (non-contact
    ultrasonic range finders): at the rivers, upstream and downstream of the barrage,
    and at canals, downstream of the head regulator. In addition to the water level
    sensors, WAPDA also installed sensors to monitor gate openings of the barrages
    and regulators. To estimate discharge in open channel flow (rivers and canals),
    there is a wide range of techniques and instruments to choose from. Jamitco et
    al. [23] described a system that detects water elevation using an ultrasonic range
    finder. The data from the range finder can be used to estimate depth-of-flow in
    the channel, and using a rating curve the velocity and discharge can be estimated.
    More recently, there has been considerable interest and development in acoustic
    Doppler current profilers (ADCP) [24] that can estimate velocity directly and
    avoid the need/use of velocity rating curves. A number of authors, e.g., [25,26,27],
    among others, have compared the velocity estimates from ADCPs with more conventional
    mechanical or electromagnetic current meters and found good agreement. For automatic
    data acquisition in the present study (i.e., Indus Telemetry), we selected one
    main canal from each of four provinces of Pakistan. This selection scheme was
    deliberate to ensure coverage in all provinces, and the particular canal (and
    the specific location on each canal) was selected on the advice of the respective
    provincial irrigation department to ascertain their ownership in the instruments
    and data. The selected canals originate from three rivers—the Ravi, Swat, and
    Indus rivers—and irrigate around 1.1 Mha of agricultural land (Table 1). Among
    the four selected canals, Pat Feeder and Kirther are inter-provincial canals which
    originate from the Indus River at the Guddu and Sukkur barrages, respectively,
    in the Sindh province, but supply in the downstream reaches around 72% of Balochistans
    annual water share (4.774 Gm3/year). The Lower Bari Doab Canal is a large canal
    selected in Punjab. This canal irrigates 0.688 Mha of land in Punjab. The Upper
    Swat Canal was selected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It originates at the Amandara
    headworks on River Swat and diverts 68 m3/s to irrigate over 107,647 ha of land
    in addition to supplying water for hydropower generation. Table 1. Selected canals
    for Indus Telemetry. The instruments were not installed immediately downstream
    of canal head regulators. High turbulence and surface waves cause fluctuating
    readings at such locations. Stilling wells provide a partial solution to this
    problem by making gauge reading quiescent. However, measuring velocity and discharge
    in highly turbulent water still remains a challenge, and developing a function
    between depth-of-flow and discharge—the rating curve—becomes difficult. The instruments
    were installed at the locations where the provincial irrigation agency reports
    discharge, i.e., either at the discharge measuring structures (e.g., flume or
    weir) or a canal cross section where a depth–discharge function (or rating curve)
    is already available. Pat Feeder and Kirther are inter-provincial canals, and
    there are no discharge measuring structures at these locations. At these two canals,
    rating curves are used to estimate discharge from depth-of-flow, but the provincial
    irrigation agencies do not always agree on the rating curves and the consequent
    discharge estimates. Table 1 also shows the running distances along the canals
    where ultrasonic sensors were installed. The instruments were commissioned at
    these four locations during the second and third quarters of 2018. The data were
    acquired regularly at 15 min intervals since then. We analyze varying lengths
    of time series data in subsequent sections of this paper. 2.2. The Instruments
    and Data Five ultrasonic sensors with ancillary components (data loggers, power
    supply, and modem) similar to those described by [23] were installed at selected
    locations of the four canals to measure depth-of-flow in these canals. The Upper
    Swat Canal splits into two channels at the measurement location; thus, two ultrasonic
    sensors were installed on this canal. The list of main instruments used in this
    work is provided in Table A1 (Appendix A). Data were transmitted using General
    Packet Radio Services (GPRS) technology to a cloud server (Microsoft Azure Data
    Centre) where they were processed, archived, and disseminated to users. 2.2.1.
    Data Sampling Period The data sampling period is the time between samples (measurements).
    Typically, the data sampling periods can be small, i.e., samples can be taken
    at high frequency, but the data sampling period may depend on the “warm-up” time
    of instruments, i.e., some instruments do require a voltage to be applied for
    a short duration first to allow the circuits to reach normal operating temperatures.
    2.2.2. Data Logging Period The data logging period is the time period at which
    data is logged (recorded) at the data logger. Data logging is done typically at
    a higher period—lower frequency—than sampling. Therefore, some aggregate function,
    i.e., average, sum, maximum, minimum, is applied to the sampled data which are
    then logged in the data logger. The logged data are also date–time stamped. It
    is important to note that the date–time stamp is that at which data are logged,
    rather than that at which they are sampled; therefore, the data must be interpreted
    accordingly. Data loggers do not normally store any record of the sampled data
    after they are aggregated. 2.2.3. Data Transmission Period The data transmission
    period defines the period at which data that have been logged are transmitted,
    and this is typically multiples (including one) of the data logging period. In
    this work, data were transmitted using a modem, cellular phone network, and GPRS
    technology. The instrument was powered by a modest solar panel (20 W capacity)
    and a rechargeable battery. 2.3. Calibration and External Parameters The ultrasonic
    sensor measures the range from the sensor face to the water surface. These raw
    data are logged and transmitted to the server where they are post-processed to
    obtain depth-of-flow. This post-processing requires the instrument elevation and
    canal bed elevation. The practice to estimate discharge in the IBIS is to assume
    that the canals behave as wide rectangular channels under uniform flow, and hence,
    the discharge rating curve is of the form Q= CH 5/3 (1) where Q is the discharge;
    C is the rating curve coefficient determined empirically; and H is the depth-of-flow.
    From L’Hôpital’s Rule and the Manning equation, the coefficient in Equation (1)
    is given by C= BS 1/2 𝑛 𝑟   (2) where B is the width of the canal; S is the bed
    slope of the canal; and nr is the Manning roughness coefficient. Equation (1)
    is often generalized to Q= CH m (3) where the coefficient C and m in Equation
    (3) are determined from flow meter measurements and an ordinary least squares
    linear regression of a log transformation of Equation (3). 2.4. Data Post-Processing
    Delay In this work, once the sampled average range was received at the server,
    the depth-of-flow and discharge were estimated. However, to avoid what is known
    in computing as a “race condition” wherein data are being transmitted and processed
    at the same time (a race between two processes which may lead to instability),
    a post-processing delay was introduced to allow the data to be transmitted first
    and then to be post-processed. 2.5. Quality Assurance of Data A six-step data
    quality process was suggested by [28] based on best practices from data quality
    experts. The six steps are definition, assessment, analysis, control, implementation,
    and improvement. This research adopted the data quality process by [28] and expanded
    on the first two steps, i.e., the definition step and assessment step, in relation
    to data from Indus Telemetry. The definition step sets up the foundation of the
    data quality process. It includes clarifying what are the business goals, roles,
    and responsibilities of the parties and data rules in a DaaS contract. Clear,
    specific, and well-documented definitions enable smooth implementation of DaaS
    contracts. For example, the goal of Indus Telemetry is to make canal flow data
    available to the data owner. In Pakistan, the Indus River System Authority (IRSA)
    is potentially the owner of the flow data. IRSA would be the client awarding the
    DaaS contract to the contractor. The contractor would be responsible for supplying
    quality-assured data to the client that comply with the agreed data rules. The
    data rules are the essential conditions which data should fulfill to pass the
    data quality process, e.g., frequency, data integrity, lower bounds of latency,
    etc. Moreover, the data rules would also feature which statistical tests should
    be used to check data accuracy and what will be the lower/upper bounds of these
    statistical tests. We explain the features of data rules in this section and discuss
    their application (i.e., assessment step) in Section 3. The second step of the
    data quality process is the “assessment step” where acquired data are assessed
    in accordance with the defined data rules in the first step. The assessment covers
    multiple dimensions of data quality such as its integrity, timeliness, accuracy,
    etc. To assess data integrity and accuracy, we considered various statistical
    indicators as explained in the subsequent subsections. The application and appropriateness
    of these statistical indicators are discussed in Section 3. We also developed
    a new statistical indicator to assess data timeliness. 2.5.1. Data Integrity Data
    integrity in the context of the DaaS contract explains how complete the data are
    when compared with the agreed frequencies defined in the definition step. Data
    integrity is calculated as shown in Equation (4) and expressed as a percentage.
    The DaaS contract could specify an upper bound for data integrity below which
    the DaaS contractor may incur a penalty. In this research, the sensor data were
    logged every 15 min; hence, the maximum possible number of records per day was
    96. 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦= count 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑑 during a time interval max.
    possible data records during a time interval  ×100 (4) 2.5.2. Data Accuracy Inaccuracies
    in electronic data (flow data) may arise due to any one or combination of the
    following reasons: poor calibration of a sensor; the use of inaccurate parameters
    in programming the sensor or data logger; the post-processing of raw data into
    information. When such inaccurate data are presented to the users, it invites
    critique of the electronic data acquisition methods. This is exactly what happened
    in the past when WAPDA installed a telemetry system in Pakistan. When the telemetry
    data were compared with the manual data, they did not match, which raised questions
    about the accuracy of the electronic data and hampered the ownership of the telemetry
    system [29,30]. The assessment of data accuracy is therefore very important to
    develop confidence in electronic data collection techniques. Conducting an accuracy
    assessment for any data requires an agreed-upon reference dataset with a high
    level of accuracy [31]. In this case, it is not clear which of the two sensors
    has superior accuracy. Therefore, we present our results as a comparison of the
    level of agreement between the data from the two independent sensors, i.e., ultrasonic
    sensor and pressure transducer. The dataset used in the accuracy assessment is
    depth-of-flow collected with an ultrasonic sensor and pressure transducer. For
    this we installed pressure transducers in addition to the ultrasonic sensors at
    the measurement location. Pressure transducers measure liquid levels through a
    sensor submerged at a fixed level under the water surface. We applied various
    statistical tests to assess the data accuracy. In the interest of brevity, we
    present an assessment of the accuracy of data from only one canal (Lower Bari
    Doab Canal), comparing data from the two independent sensors. (i) t-test To assess
    the accuracy of data, we first need to decide whether the data are for a sample
    or a population. In this case, for each measurement with an ultrasonic sensor
    we also have the corresponding check measurement with a pressure transducer, and
    the variable of interest is the difference between the measurement and the check
    measurement. Therefore, we have data for the entire population of measurements.
    This implies we are estimating population parameters rather than sample statistics,
    i.e., population mean, population standard deviation, etc., and not sample mean,
    sample standard deviation, etc. Inferential statistics [32] uses a random sample
    of data taken from a population to describe and make inferences about the whole
    population. This is valuable when it is not possible to examine each member of
    an entire population. Student’s t-test is a commonly used inferential statistical
    method for hypothesis testing about the mean of a small sample drawn from a normally
    distributed population. Similarly, the paired t-test is applied to statistically
    determine whether the mean responses are the same. In a particular time period
    of interest, the count of measurements from both sensors was identical, which
    depends on the frequency at which the sensors were programmed to log the data
    (i.e., 15 min). As we were considering all the measurements from both sensors,
    the data constitute the population rather than a randomly drawn sample. Since
    we already know the population mean, we do not need to try to draw inferences
    (test hypothesis) about the population mean from the sample mean. Furthermore,
    the aim of comparing the two data sets here is to check the data accuracy and
    not to draw conclusions about some unknown aspect of a population based on a random
    sample. Hence, the t-test (or other inferential statistics) is not an appropriate
    method to assess data accuracy; rather, descriptive statistics should be applied.
    (ii) Difference Plot and Normality Borrowing from their wider applications in
    the medical field, difference plots were used in this work to compare the two
    methods of measurement, i.e., the ultrasonic sensor and pressure transducer. The
    detailed procedure of difference plots was first suggested by Bland and Altman
    [33] in 1986. Bland and Altman, in their publications [34,35], explained in detail
    their method and also provided a non-parametric approach which is particularly
    useful in cases when the difference between the methods does not have a normal
    distribution. The non-parametric approach is similar to the basic approach of
    the difference plot as explained in [34,35] up to and including the plot of the
    differences versus the mean values of the two methods. There are then two similar
    ways of describing such data without assuming a normal distribution of differences.
    We can calculate the proportion of differences greater than some reference value
    (such as 3 cm in this case). The reference value can be indicated on the scatter
    diagram showing the differences versus the mean. Alternatively, we can calculate
    the values outside which a certain proportion (say 10%) of the observations fall.
    To do this we order the observations and take the range of values remaining after
    5% of the observations are removed from each tail. The centiles can then be superimposed
    on the scatter diagram. In a DaaS contract, we suggest that when a non-parametric
    approach to the difference plot is used, the reference values should be agreed
    upon by the client and contractor and defined at the definition step. Bland and
    Altman also showed in [35] how a grade can be assigned to a method (sensor in
    our case) based on the proportion of observations in a predefined range of the
    reference values. In this paper, we developed a criterion and applied it to grade
    our sensors. Bland and Altman commented that the “nonparametric method is disarmingly
    simple yet provides readily interpreted results. Perhaps its simplicity has led
    to the belief that it is not a proper analysis of the data”. Bland and Altman
    responded to the critique on their proposed method in their 2003 publication [31]
    and concluded, “…It (difference plot) can be extended to many more complex situations,
    when distributions are not normal, when difference is related to magnitude, when
    there are repeated measurements on the same subject, either paired or not, and
    when there are varying numbers of observations on subjects”. It was further stressed
    in [36] that agreement is a question of estimation, not hypothesis testing. Estimates
    are usually made with some sampling error, and limits of agreement are no exception.
    The common goal usually is to decide whether a new measurement system agrees suitably
    with an existing one and, hence, whether the two can be used interchangeably [37].
    The goal of a comparison of two methods may vary in emphasis by context, as explained
    by [38], who highlighted four possible goals: Calibration problems, which deal
    with establishing a relationship between a new system and an existing one that
    can be used to appropriately adjust the new system’s measurements; Comparison
    problems, which deal with assessing the level of agreement between two measurement
    systems whose measurements are on the same scale; Conversion problems, which deal
    with the comparison of two systems whose measurements are on different scales;
    and Gold-standard comparison problems, which deal with the comparison of a new
    measurement system with a system that is known to make measurements without error.
    The “comparison problem” best defines the goal of comparing two methods of measurement
    (sensors) in our case, for which we plot and discuss difference plots using the
    parametric and non-parametric approaches. (iii) Mean Absolute Percentage Error
    (MAPE) and Symmetric MAPE (sMAPE) We also apply statistical tests to estimate
    the error in the depth-of-flow data collected with the two independent sensors.
    The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a relative measure that expresses
    errors as a percentage of the actual data, as shown in Equation (5). Its advantage
    is that it provides an easy and intuitive way of judging the extent or importance
    of errors. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) =  100 𝑛 ∑ 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 𝑥 𝑖 (5)
    Here, 𝑥 𝑖 are the actual data, 𝑦 𝑖 are the forecasted or estimated data, and 𝑛
    is the number of non-missing data points. However, [39] noted that the formula
    for the MAPE is not symmetric in the sense that interchanging 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝑦 𝑖 does
    not lead to the same answer, despite the fact that the absolute error is the same
    before and after the switch. The cause of this asymmetry lies in the denominator
    of the formula—dividing by 𝑦 𝑖 instead of the actual 𝑥 𝑖 leads to a different
    result. This issue has been discussed by many researchers ([40,41], among others),
    with [41] proposing a variation of the MAPE formula to provide symmetry: this
    is known as the sMAPE (symmetric mean absolute percentage error) and was originally
    introduced by [42]. The formula suggested by [42] and the later modification by
    [43] are given in Equations (6) and (7): 𝑠𝑀𝐴𝑃 𝐸 𝐴𝑟𝑚𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑔  1 𝑛  | 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 |
    ( 𝑥 𝑖 + 𝑦 𝑖 )*0.5  ×100 (6) 𝑠𝑀𝐴𝑃 𝐸 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑠 =  1 𝑛  | 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑥 𝑖 | | 𝑦 𝑖 + 𝑥 𝑖 |  ×100.
    (7) A limitation of sMAPE is that if 𝑥 𝑖 or 𝑦 𝑖 is zero, the value of the error
    will be equal to the upper limit of the error, i.e., 200% for the Armstrong formula
    and 100% for the Flores formula. 2.5.3. Measurement of External Parameters Obtaining
    useful information from telemetry data requires external parameters for processing.
    The external parameters include the information that is not or cannot easily be
    measured through instrumentation and telemetry. In the case of flow measurement
    in the IBIS using ultrasonic sensors, the critical parameters are the bed elevation
    and the rating curve coefficient in Equation (3). We measured these two critical
    parameters for 17 tertiary canals of a typical canal system in the Punjab province
    (i.e., the Hakra Branch Canal system, described in detail in [44,45,46]). The
    measurements included a baseline survey of all the canals (at a cross section
    near a head regulator) in the year 2014 and four subsequent surveys over the year
    of 2015. An acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) was used to measure discharge
    during the surveys. The variations in the bed elevation and rating coefficient
    were then calculated as percent changes from the baseline. 3. Results and Discussion
    In this work, the range to the water surface was sampled (measured) every 60 seconds.
    The data logging period was set to 15 min, and averaging was used as the aggregate
    function. Hence, the data logger logged the average water surface elevation for
    the 15 min preceding the date–time stamp. Data transmission from all canal locations
    was scheduled three times each day at 0745, 1145, and 1545, Pakistan Standard
    Time. This means that all transmissions were made during daylight hours, and the
    datalogger was programmed such that the system does not attempt to transmit data
    if the battery voltage is below a threshold value (in this case set at 11 V).
    Further, if the battery voltage falls below a critical value (i.e., 9 V) the sensor
    stops recording data. Although it is tempting to transmit data frequently, data
    transmission is the most power-consuming process of an automated data acquisition
    system. This is not an issue during daylight hours when the solar panels can generate
    power, but excessively frequent data transmission can drain the battery and lead
    to system shut-down at night-time or during overcast winter days with shorter
    day lengths. A post-processing delay of 10 min was used in this work. The sampling
    period was set through appropriate programming of the data logger which excites
    the sensor—in this work, 1 min. Sampled data points are only stored temporarily
    in a data logger until an aggregate function is applied to the sampled data. In
    a DaaS contract, it would be difficult to specify or validate/verify sampled data.
    However, when the aggregate function is applied to the data, a count of the sample
    size that is aggregated can be recorded. Sample size is given by 𝑁 𝑆 = 𝑇 𝐷 𝑇 𝑆   (8)
    where NS is the sample size aggregated at the data logging period; TD is the data
    logging period; and TS is the data sampling period. Hence, Equation (8) provides
    the maximum or upper bound on the sample size that is aggregated. The actual sample
    size may be less than this due to hardware/software failures. Hence, a DaaS contract
    could specify a threshold value, and a contractor in response could adjust the
    data logging period and data sampling period to exceed the threshold value while
    allowing for occasional hardware/software failures. For the parameters used in
    this work, the sample size was 15. 3.1. Data Integrity Table 2 shows the data
    integrity for all four canals during the reporting period. The table shows that
    data integrity was more than 90 percent in all cases. The Pat Feeder and Kirther
    canals showed the highest data integrity of above 99 percent. A low value of data
    integrity indicates that the data from the sensor were not recorded in the data
    logger. Other than physical damage to the system and/or components, this normally
    happens due to manual power shut down for troubleshooting or low voltage at the
    sensor/data logger. In our experience, during long spells of rain, overcast, or
    fog, the solar panels do not supply enough energy to charge the battery and the
    system shuts down if the battery voltage drops below 9 V. Table 2. Data integrity
    and timeliness. 3.2. Data Timeliness Latency is defined as the time that elapses
    between when a sample is taken and when those data and derived information from
    post-processing are accessible to a user. However as defined earlier, the sampled
    data are not retained in the data logger; rather, only an aggregation is applied
    to the sample. Furthermore, the date–time stamp is that at which the aggregate
    function is applied rather than the date–time at which it is sampled. Hence in
    this work, latency is the time that elapses from when the aggregate function is
    applied to when the data and derived information become accessible to a user.
    Latency is a function of the data logging period, data transmission period, and
    data post processing delay and is given by ℒ= ∑ 𝑇 𝑇 𝑇 𝐷 −1 𝑖=1 (Δ+𝑖 𝑇 𝐷 ) ( 𝑇
    𝑇 𝑇 𝐷 / ) (9) where ℒ is the latency; 𝑇 𝑇 is the data transmission period; i is
    an index (0,1,2,…); and Δ is the data processing delay. The data transmission
    period is expressed as any multiple (including one) of the data logging period.
    The expression in Equation (9) determines the lower bound of latency. The observed
    latency will be equal to or higher than this lower bound if there are hardware
    or software failures. For the parameters selected in this work, the lower bound
    of the latency was 6.21 h. Table 2 shows the observed latency of the data from
    all four canals during the specified reporting period. The data from Lower Bari
    Doab Canal had the highest average latency per day (17.10 h) followed by Kirther
    Canal (13.33 h). Data from Pat Feeder and Upper Swat Canals showed slightly higher
    latency than the lower bound of latency (6.21 h). High latency values indicate
    delays in transmission that are due to any number of reasons, including but not
    limited to poor Internet connectivity and inadequate power to start up the modem.
    Figure 2 provides some further insight into the data integrity and latency for
    the Lower Bari Doab Canal. The figure presents a daily count of records and latency
    for the reporting period. The upper bound of the record count per day was 96 (as
    explained in Section 2.5.1) and the lower bound of latency was 6.21 h. Ideally
    the record count per day should be 96, but if data are lost, the record count
    falls below 96 and, hence, data integrity decreases. Similarly, if the data are
    received without any failure, the latency will be identical to the lower bound
    of 6.21 h, but where there are transmission failure(s), the latency increases
    above 6.21 h. Figure 2 shows that data integrity and latency were not interdependent
    upon each other. Figure 2. Observed data records and latency per day for the Lower
    Bari Doab Canal. In Figure 2, a high fluctuation is observed in the latency (black
    continuous line), but the record count (blue continuous line) remained relatively
    stable over the period 4 September 2018 to 8 October 2018. The high fluctuation
    in latency is primarily due to poor Internet connectivity in the area where instruments
    were installed. The system experienced power issues from 9 to 27 October 2018,
    and hence there was a substantial decrease in the record count (data loss) during
    this period. Interestingly, the Internet connectivity improved in this period,
    resulting in an improvement in the latency. A couple of instances of high latency
    were observed during November and December but with no drop in the record count.
    This occurred due to occasional network failure at the time of transmission. It
    can be inferred from Figure 2 that the average latency and record count were not
    inversely proportional but rather behaved independently. This discussion on latency
    leads into the broader question of what constitutes “real-time” flow data, as
    advocated by Briscoe and Qamar [11]. One interpretation of real time is zero latency,
    which would be near impossible, expensive to achieve, and probably unnecessary.
    It would be more realistic to specify quasi-real-time flow data by specifying
    the latency in a data as a service (DaaS) contract. A pragmatic approach can be
    to specify separate day-time and night-time latency. Hence, a DaaS contract could
    specify an upper bound on latency (the lower bound is a value calculated by using
    Equation (9)). By way of example, if an upper bound of 12 hours is specified,
    then latency must not exceed 12 hours or this will incur a penalty. The configuration
    as shown in Figure 2 does not fulfil the terms of this specification for 15 percent
    of the time, which would incur the penalty and encourage the DaaS contractor to
    find a solution to this problem. Again, a DaaS contract would specify the record
    count, and it would be up to the contractor to program a data logger to ensure
    that the actual record count equals or exceeds the specified threshold. 3.3. Data
    Accuracy To analyze the accuracy of data, we analyzed the depth-of-flow in the
    Lower Bari Doab Canal measured with an ultrasonic sensor and pressure transducer
    at 15 min frequency. Normality tests were applied to the difference between the
    measurements (d-b-m). While plotting the difference plots, limits of agreement
    (LoAs) were calculated using the mean and standard deviation when the data followed
    a normal distribution. If this was not the case, a non-parametric version of the
    difference plot was used to calculate the limits. Table 3 shows the results of
    various normality tests applied on the d-b-m. The results suggest that the data
    were not normally distributed. Table 3. Normality tests applied to differences
    between depth-of-flow measured by ultrasonic sensor and pressure transducer (June
    2019). Figure 3a presents the depth-of-flow measured using the two sensors with
    a line of equality. The correlation coefficient is weak between the data (r2 =
    0.63). Correlation simply measures the strength of a relation between two variables,
    not the agreement between them. We have perfect agreement only if the points in
    Figure 3a lie along the line of equality, but we will have perfect correlation
    if the points lie along any straight line. Figure 3. (a) Depth-of-flow measured
    with two different sensors; (b) Difference plot for depth-of-flow data. Figure
    3b is a difference plot of the d-b-m. The mean of the d-b-m was −1.40 cm and the
    standard deviation (SD) was 1.00 cm. If the d-b-m values were normally distributed,
    we would expect 95% of the d-b-m values to lie between the extreme values or the
    upper and lower LoAs. These LoAs were calculated as (mean + 1.96SD) and (mean
    − 1.96SD). We calculate the upper and lower LoAs as 0.55 cm and −3.35 cm, respectively.
    About 96% of the d-b-m values lie within the LoAs in Figure 3b. With the caveat
    that the d-b-m values are non-normally distributed, the difference plot can lead
    us to conclude that the measurements agree sufficiently. On the other hand, how
    small or large the limits of agreement should be to conclude that the measurements
    agree sufficiently is a contractual, not a statistical, decision. This decision
    should be made in advance of the analysis and clearly defined in the DaaS at the
    definition stage. We have noted in Table 3 that the d-b-m did not pass common
    normality tests. In general, this will not have a great impact on the limits of
    agreement but suggests that we should preferably use the non-parametric approach
    of difference plots [34,35]. In Section 2.5.2 we explained that there are two
    ways to describe data while using the non-parametric approach: (i) We calculate
    the proportion of d-b-m values within the reference values (±1, 2, and 3 cm).
    These reference values are similar to the LoAs used in the parametric approach
    of the difference plot. The region within the reference values ±3 cm is shaded
    in Figure 3b. (ii) The 5th and 95th percentiles of the ranked d-b-m values define
    the reference values, i.e., 5% of the data are removed from each end. The reference
    values thus calculated (0.31 cm and −2.90 cm) are also superimposed in Figure
    3b as a dotted line (brown), and we calculate the proportion of d-b-m values within
    these reference values. When we use various reference values (±1, 2, and 3 cm),
    a grading criterion can be defined for the sensors we used for measurements, similar
    to that suggested for blood pressure devices by [47]. Table 4 shows the conditions
    which the sensor data must meet to receive a grade of A, B, or C. The grading
    again is a decision made for the DaaS contract in advance of the analysis. The
    proportions of d-b-m values within reference values of ±1, 2, and 3 cm were, respectively,
    33.5%, 69.9%, and 96.3%, so based on the selected reference value we get the scores
    and grades for our sensor as shown in Table 4. Table 4. Grading of ultrasonic
    sensors based on differences between depth-of-flow measurements by ultrasonic
    sensor and those by pressure transducers. Table 5 shows the statistical errors
    calculated for depth-of-flow data from the ultrasonic rangefinders (as the x variable)
    and pressure transducers (as the y variable). The results show good agreement
    between the two data sets with MAPE and sMAPE errors of less than 1%. Table 5.
    Statistical errors to assess data accuracy from the Lower Bari Doab Canal. 3.4.
    External Parameters It is apparent from Table 6 that the change observed in bed
    elevation was relatively modest over the months. Therefore, it would be a poor
    use of resources to insist within a DaaS contract that the bed elevation be measured
    very frequently, e.g., every six months. This would make such a contract unnecessarily
    expensive. On the other hand, the rating curve coefficient did change substantially.
    Table 6. Critical external parameters for two irrigation canals. Figure 4 presents
    the change in the rating curve coefficient for all 17 tertiary canals of the Hakra
    Branch Canal system from the baseline value. The change can be quite substantial
    and was up to +50% (based on sediment transport and moving bed load); from Equation
    (1) this implies a +50% change in the estimated discharge. Strictly speaking,
    from Equation (2) the rating curve is a function of the physical properties of
    a canal and should therefore not change substantially. The rating curve coefficient
    is the Achilles’ heel of a telemetry system that relies on measuring the range
    to the water surface and then estimating the discharge using a rating curve of
    the form of Equation (3). In revisiting telemetry in the IBIS, a practical solution
    to this problem would be to construct dedicated measuring structures (typically
    flumes or broad crested weirs) whereby the rating equation can be derived semi-empirically
    and will not need frequent verification and validation. Figure 4. Change in rating
    curve coefficient from baseline. Another alternative may be through direct measurement
    of the velocity and then only using the depth to estimate the area of flow and
    application of the continuity equation to estimate the discharge. Velocity can
    be measured directly using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) or particle
    image velocimetry (PIV); however, this requires more research in the context of
    the IBIS shallow canals with heavy sediment loads and intermittent flows. In the
    absence of using technology, i.e., measurement structures or techniques such as
    PIV and ADCP, the only option is to stipulate in a DaaS contract that key external
    parameters need to be measured periodically, e.g., bi-annually, although this
    period is rather arbitrary. 4. Conclusions This paper presents the experience
    of a pilot study of instrumenting canals in the IBIS, and the experience suggests
    that data as a service (DaaS) contract could be a better model rather than the
    more conventional approach of procuring hardware for investment in a telemetry
    system. A key feature of such a DaaS contract will be to ensure data quality.
    This work offers insight into a data quality process. A six-step data quality
    process was proposed in this research: definition, assessment, analysis, control,
    implementation, and improvement. The authors performed an assessment of data quality
    covering attributes such as the integrity, timeliness, and accuracy of the acquired
    data. The authors developed a new statistical indicator for data timeliness and
    also applied various statistical indicators to assess data integrity and accuracy.
    The results of instrumentation suggest that statistical limits (upper or lower
    bounds) can be set for these indicators in DaaS, beyond which punitive measures
    may be applied. The assessment results show that the ultrasonic sensors installed
    at four canals performed reasonably well. The data integrity during the reporting
    period was in the range of 92.1 to 99.8 percent, showing very little data loss.
    The lower bound of latency per day in this research was 6.21 h. The average latency
    per day was 8.37 h to 17.10 h during the reporting period. This is higher than
    the lower bound, but considering the poor Internet connectivity at these remote
    locations, it is deemed acceptable. The latency can be improved by changing the
    transmission frequency but with the caveat of consuming more power. The data accuracy
    was assessed by comparing data collected independently by two sensors. The statistical
    analysis shows that the data were not distributed normally. The analysis of difference
    plots showed that a non-parametric approach to compare methods is particularly
    useful in this case when the difference between the methods does not have a normal
    distribution. The statistical errors, e.g., the mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) and its symmetric forms, can be good indicators to compare data from two
    sensors. In our analysis, we found statistical errors of less than one percent.
    In a DaaS contract, the results from the assessment step and compliance with the
    statistical limits would then be analyzed by a data quality assurance (third party)
    organization. This will constitute the third step of the data quality process.
    The quality assurance organization can also analyze the root causes for inferior
    data quality (if that is the case). The analysis will help in identifying the
    weak links in the data acquisition, processing, and communication processes. The
    next steps of the data quality process will deal with improvement based on the
    analysis and, finally, implementation and quality control. The authors suggest
    an iterative approach for a DaaS contract based on this pilot study. In the first
    iteration, the data contractor provides only one variable, i.e., depth-of-flow,
    because it involves a lower number of external parameters. In a second iteration,
    the data could be processed with external parameters to obtain further information,
    e.g., discharge, volume, proportions, etc. This would avoid the pitfall of a contractor
    being blamed for errors in the rating curve coefficient, which may be outside
    his/her control and may lead to endless disputes which, in turn, may yet again
    jeopardize the development investment. In a flow measurement system that relies
    on measuring depth-of-flow and then using a rating curve to estimate discharge
    (assuming uniform flow), this rating curve is the weakest link in the system.
    A concerted effort needs to be made in the IBIS to replace this practice by constructing
    dedicated measuring structures (flumes or broad crested weirs) and/or to explore
    new technologies that might allow direct measurement of velocity and avoid using
    rating curves altogether. With the renewed interest of the Government of Pakistan
    in investing in a telemetry system in the IBIS, it is important to learn lessons
    from the earlier investment made in 2004, particularly with respect to the data
    quality. This research exploits developments in technology—particularly in information
    and communication technology—and demonstrates the automation of flow at a few
    canals at key locations of the IBIS. The results from this research can inform
    future investment in a telemetry system. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: In recent years, major south-eastern Australian irrigation companies
    have invested heavily in modernization which includes installation of automatic
    control structures with remote monitoring, the so called total channel control
    technology (TCC). Main objectives of using TCC technology are to supply water
    near-on-demand and to control channel water levels. TCC includes supervisory control
    and data acquisition (SCADA) technology which will result in production of integrated
    databases based on real time measurements of the whole system. This data has the
    potential to be used to identify sections of channel with high rates of seepage
    or leakage. Pondage tests are acknowledged as the best direct method for seepage
    measurement, and the recorded water level data from automated systems during periods
    of gate closure can be treated as pondage test data. The purpose of this paper
    is to report on a preliminary quality analysis of such data during periods of
    shut down in the system in order to investigate the feasibility of using such
    data in seepage rate estimation. Coleambally irrigation district in southern NSW
    was chosen as the case study it being one of the first automated irrigation districts
    in the world and having three years of historical data. The analysis was done
    for all pondage conditions during the 2010 irrigation season and based on criteria
    requirements, accepted samples were categorized in different groups. The analysis
    showed that out of the total number of 1073 possible pondage conditions, 51% of
    them met the 70% criteria requirements and can be used for the purposes of this
    study. Examples of some individual periods of ponding are provided. Furthermore,
    it is concluded that TCC data is suitable for seepage and water loss analysis.

    Metrics Abstract: Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) require
    latency-aware computation for real-time application processing. In IoT environments,
    connected things generate a huge amount of data, which are generally referred
    to as big data. Data generated from IoT devices are generally processed in a cloud
    infrastructure because of the on-demand services and scalability features of the
    cloud computing paradigm. However, processing IoT application requests on the
    cloud exclusively is not an efficient solution for some IoT applications, especially
    time-sensitive ones. To address this issue, Fog computing, which resides in between
    cloud and IoT devices, was proposed. In general, in the Fog computing environment,
    IoT devices are connected to Fog devices. These Fog devices are located in close
    proximity to users and are responsible for intermediate computation and storage.
    One of the key challenges in running IoT applications in a Fog computing environment
    are resource allocation and task scheduling. Fog computing research is still in
    its infancy, and taxonomy-based investigation into the requirements of Fog infrastructure,
    platform, and applications mapped to current research is still required. This
    survey will help the industry and research community synthesize and identify the
    requirements for Fog computing. This paper starts with an overview of Fog computing
    in which the definition of Fog computing, research trends, and the technical differences
    between Fog and cloud are reviewed. Then, we investigate numerous proposed Fog
    computing architectures and describe the components of these architectures in
    detail. From this, the role of each component will be defined, which will help
    in the deployment of Fog computing. Next, a taxonomy of Fog computing is proposed
    by considering the requirements of the Fog computing paradigm. We also discuss
    existing research works and gaps in resource allocation and scheduling, fault
    tolerance, simulation tools, and Fog-based microser... (Show More) Taxonomy of

    Individuals and organizations are increasingly becoming dependent on computers
    and smart devices to deal with daily tasks. These devices are generating data
    via various sensors and applications. As a result, organizations are generating
    and storing huge amounts of data on a regular basis [1]. After the proliferation
    of IoT, data generated by sensors has increased enormously. With this sudden increase
    in the volume of data being produced and inability of conventional databases to
    process various forms of structured and unstructured data, big data analytics
    has attained great attention in recent years. Every organization is now prioritizing
    the analysis of collected data to extract useful insights in order to make important
    decisions [2]. Nowadays, organizations need a dynamic IT infrastructure because
    of the shift to cloud computing due to its accessibility, scalability, and pay-per-use
    features. The most common services provided by the cloud are known as Software
    as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service
    (IaaS), all of which are heading towards Anything as a Service (XaaS) [3]. However,
    data generated from billions of sensors, referred to as big data, cannot be transferred
    and processed in the cloud. In addition, some IoT applications need to be processed
    faster than the cloud’s current capability. This problem can be solved by using
    the Fog computing paradigm, which harnesses the processing power of devices located
    near users (idle computing power) to support utilization of storage, processing,
    and networking at the edge [4]. Fog computing is a decentralized computing concept,
    which does not exclusively rely on any central component like cloud computing
    [5], [6]. It is able to overcome the high latency problem of the cloud by using
    idle resources of various devices near users. However, Fog computing relies on
    the cloud to do complex processing. Unlike cloud computing, Fog computing is a
    decentralized computing concept, where the many devices around us, which have
    computation capacity, are utilized. Currently, even a low- specification smartphone
    has processing capacity, sometimes with multiple cores. Hence, many devices like
    smartphones, switches, routers, base stations, and other network management devices
    equipped with processing power and storage capacity can act as Fog devices. The
    resources of these devices are idle outside of peak hours. Many research issues
    relating to Fog computing are emerging due to its ubiquitous connectivity and
    heterogeneous organization. In the Fog computing paradigm, key issues are the
    requirements and the deployment of Fog computing environment. This is because
    the devices that exist in Fog environments are heterogeneous: therefore, the question
    that arises is how will Fog computing tackle the new challenges of resource management
    and failure handling in such a heterogeneous environment? Hence, it is necessary
    to investigate the very basic requirements for all other related aspects such
    as deployment issues, simulations, resource management, fault tolerance, and services.
    Several reviews [5], [7]–[12] have been done on Fog computing. Here, we present
    the focus and survey domains of these review works in brief. Similar concepts
    of Fog computing, definitions, application scenarios, and numerous issues are
    described by one study [7]. Hu et al. [8] presented the hierarchical architecture
    of Fog computing and technologies like computing, communication, and storage technologies,
    namely resource management, security, and privacy protection that support Fog
    deployment and application. Baccarelli et al. [9] surveyed Fog computing and the
    Internet of Everything (IoE) with an integrated point of view of Fog computing
    and IoE. Varshney and Simmhan [10] reviewed various dimensions of application
    characteristics, system architecture, and platform abstractions of edge, Fog,
    and cloud ecosystems. Perera et al. [11] reviewed the Fog computing domain from
    the platform perspectives of developers and end users towards building a sustainable
    sensing infrastructure for smart city applications. Mahmud et al. [5] presented
    a taxonomy of Fog computing according to the identified challenges and its key
    features. The proposed taxonomy provides a classification of the existing works
    in Fog computing. Mouradian et al. [12] reviewed Fog architecture and algorithms
    based on six different evaluation criteria, namely heterogeneity, QoS management,
    scalability, mobility, federation, and interoperability. However, none of the
    studies had investigated taxonomy based on the requirements of infrastructure,
    platform, and application in Fog computing. Moreover, none of them comprehensively
    investigated fault tolerance, resource management, or microservices in Fog computing.
    We consider the aforementioned current issues and discuss these extensively and
    also highlight how cloud computing-related solutions could be employed in the
    Fog in some cases. The contributions of this review work can be summarized as
    follows: Present the research trends in Fog computing by investigating the number
    of published research works and search occurrences in Google Scholar. Review of
    several Fog computing architectures and presentation of a detailed architecture,
    as most of the previous researchers only presented high-level architecture. Present
    a taxonomy by considering the requirements of infrastructure, platform, and application
    in the Fog computing paradigm. Identify Fog computing research gaps in resource
    allocation and scheduling, fault tolerance, simulation tools, and Fog-based microservices.
    Address the limitations of current research works and some open issues in infrastructure,
    platform, and applications. From this survey, the industry and research community
    will be able to gain insight into the requirements for building a Fog computing
    environment with a better understanding of resource management in the Fog. The
    remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II surveys definitions
    and research trends in Fog computing. A technical comparison between Fog and cloud
    paradigms presents in section III. Section IV discusses computing paradigms similar
    to Fog computing. Section V presents related works on Fog computing architecture
    and discusses the components of the Fog computing architecture. Section VI shows
    the taxonomy of Fog computing by reviewing its requirements. Section VII presents
    various application dimension of Fog computing. Section VIII discusses current
    state-of-the-art Fog computing technology. Section IX presents open issues and
    future research direction. Section X concludes the paper. SECTION II. Overview
    of Fog Computing The term ‘Fog computing’ was proposed in 2012 by researchers
    from Cisco Systems [13]. Processing application logic and data at the edge is
    not a new concept. The concept of Edge computation emerged around the 2000s [14],
    [15] and another similar concept, cloudlets, was introduced in 2009 [16]. Both
    Cloudlets and Fog computing are the advancements of a similar concept, which revolves
    around processing at the edge level. While cloudlets are applied in the mobile
    network, Fog computing is applied to connected things such as IoT, which plays
    into the concept of IoT [17]. Fog is both a virtualized and non-virtualized computing
    paradigm that provides networking, storage, and computation services amid cloud
    servers and IoT devices [4], [13]. However, these services are not completely
    located at the network edge. The Fog is a distributed computing approach that
    mainly focuses on facilitating applications, which require low latency services
    [18], Fog computing also supports non-latency aware services. It is obvious that
    using idle computation resources near the users will improve overall service performance,
    if the volume of processing were not that high. A huge number of heterogeneous
    nodes will be connected to the Fog. These nodes include sensors and actuators
    among others [13]. Computation is performed in Fog devices when necessary and
    storage facilities are also available for a short period of time, at least in
    most Fog devices. Time-sensitive computation in the Fog is done without the involvement
    of third parties, and in most cases, is done by the Fog processing devices. According
    to Yi et al. [7], the Fog computing paradigm supports the running of new services
    or basic network functions and applications in a sandboxed environment similar
    to cloudlets. However, the subject is still a research challenge because the question
    of how the Fog will provide these service still remains. In addition, will the
    Fog have cloud service providers or will it be like a single entity as a whole?
    Figure 1 shows a basic model of Fog Computing. Fog devices, Fog servers, and gateways
    are the basic computation components in the Fog environment. Any device that has
    computation, networking, and storage capabilities can act as a Fog device. These
    devices include set-top boxes, switches, routers, base stations, proxy servers
    or any other computing device. Fog servers that manage several Fog devices and
    Fog gateways are responsible for translation services between heterogeneous devices
    in the Fog computing environment. Fog gateways also provide translation services
    between IoT, Fog, and cloud layers. New challenges in this emerging computing
    paradigm have emerged in the past couple of years. FIGURE 1. A model of Fog computing.
    Show All In this section, we discuss the various definitions of Fog computing
    and define Fog computing from our point of view. In addition, we discuss and analyze
    research trends in Fog computing. Finally, we compare the technical differences
    between Fog computing and cloud computing. A. Definition of Fog Computing Fog
    computing is a distributed computing paradigm where processing is done at the
    edge of the network with seamless integration of the cloud infrastructure. It
    enables a computing facility for IoT environments or other latency sensitive application
    environments. It is estimated that about 50 billion “things” will be connected
    to the Internet by 2020 [19]. Transferring all data from all connected devices
    for processing on the cloud will need massive amounts of bandwidth and storage.
    All devices are not connected to the controller via IP but connected by some other
    IoT industrial protocols. Because of this, a translation process is also needed
    for the processing or storing of information from IoT devices. Various researchers
    have defined Fog computing in different ways. Some examples are as follows: “Fog
    computing is a highly virtualized platform that provides compute, storage, and
    networking services between IoT devices and traditional cloud computing data centers,
    typically, but not exclusively located at the edge of network.” [13] “Fog computing
    is a scenario where a huge number of heterogeneous (wireless and sometimes autonomous)
    ubiquitous and decentralised devices communicate and potentially cooperate among
    them and with the network to perform storage and processing tasks without the
    intervention of third parties. These tasks can be for supporting basic network
    functions or new services and applications that run in a sandboxed environment.
    Users leasing part of their devices to host these services get incentives for
    doing so.” [20] “The term Fog computing or Edge Computing means that rather than
    hosting and working from a centralized cloud, Fog systems operate on network ends.
    It is a term for placing some processes and resources at the edge of the cloud,
    instead of establishing channels for cloud storage and utilization.” [21] The
    first definition of Fog computing was presented by Bonomi et al. [13], where they
    addressed the computing paradigm as a highly virtualized platform. However, some
    IoT devices such as smartphones are not virtualized but could also be a part of
    the Fog infrastructure, as some processing could still be done. According to Cisco
    [22], the Fog computing paradigm provides an ideal place to analyze most data
    near the devices that produce and act on that data instantaneously. The Fog is
    located near things that are able to process and act on the data generated. The
    devices that are within the Fog environment are known as Fog devices. These nodes
    can be deployed at any place with a connectivity to the network: on the power
    pole, on the factory floor, alongside the road, alongside the railway line, in
    a vehicle, inside a shopping mall, on an oil rig, etc. A device that has processing,
    storage, memory, and network capability can act as a Fog device. Although the
    Fog extends the cloud, technically it resides in between the cloud and IoT devices
    and handles processing and storage tasks in close proximity to the user. Yi et
    al. [7] stated that the definition given by Vaquero and Rodero-Merino [20] is
    debatable and a definition that can distinguish clearly between Fog computing
    and other related computing paradigms is still required. The definition given
    by IBM [21] represents Edge and Fog computing as the same computing paradigm.
    According to Shi et al. [23], Fog computing focuses more on the infrastructure
    side while edge computing focuses more on the things’ side. Furthermore, Edge
    computing is not spontaneously associated with any cloud-based services such as
    SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS [5]. In brief, Table 1 summarizes Fog definitions provided
    by various research works. TABLE 1 Summary of Fog Computing Definitions Considering
    the above definitions, we define Fog computing as follows: Fog computing is a
    distributed computing platform where most of the processing will be done by virtualized
    and non-virtualized end or edge devices. It is also associated with the cloud
    for non-latency-aware processing and long-term storage of useful data by residing
    in between users and the cloud. In our definition, we considered all devices with
    computing and storage capacity as Fog devices and also more precisely identified
    the role of the cloud in the Fog computing environment. B. Fog Computing Research
    Trends Growing attention towards processing data closer to the users has been
    observed among industries and the academia in the past few years. Handling IoT-generated
    data at the edge level will help improve overall processing time. In this section,
    we investigate Fog and other related technological trends for the past few years
    in the research community. According to the Gartner hype cycle, in July 2017 [24],
    the peak emerging technology is the smart home, which would perform better with
    the incorporation of the Fog computing environment. A Hype Cycle [24] represents
    common patterns of new trending technologies. Fog computing can also enable latency-aware
    smart home services in a more efficient and convenient way, especially for emergency
    response smart home applications. According to the Gartner hype cycle demonstration,
    some other influencing technologies include virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles,
    IoT platforms, smart robots, edge computing, and smart workspaces, which are required
    to support latency-aware applications. All these mentioned technologies could
    benefit from the support of the Fog computing paradigm due to latency sensitiveness,
    connectivity to the cloud, and edge-level data processing capability. Except for
    the autonomous vehicle technology, all other aforementioned technologies will
    reach the market adoption threshold in the next 10 years. Besides the hype cycle
    analysis, we analyzed the search occurrence of Fog and other related technologies
    in Google Scholar. In addition, the number of papers available in different digital
    libraries related to the Fog was also analyzed. Google Scholar search occurrences
    of various similar technologies to Fog were investigated in the past few years,
    as presented in Figure 2. According to the data, edge computing is the topmost
    searched item in Google Scholar compared to other similar technologies. However,
    the search trend decreased by more than three times in the past eight years for
    edge computing. Mobile cloud computing and mobile edge computing are the other
    two top-searched computing paradigm after edge computing. The lowest trend observed
    was for dew computing and Fog dew computing. While the trend for edge computing
    is decreasing, Fog computing related to scholarly searches is increasing year
    by year, and has increased by 2.5 times from 2010 to 2017. This shows that Fog
    computing is the fastest growing research area in academia and will have a great
    impact on the industry as well. FIGURE 2. Search occurrence of similar technologies
    like the Fog in Google Scholar. Show All Fog computing topic search in the Web
    of Science shows that the number of scholarly articles has more than doubled between
    2015 and 2016, as per Figure 3. The first paper with ‘Fog computing’ in its title
    was published in 2012. Since then, about 564 journal and conference articles have
    been published on this topic in the four major digital libraries (Web of Science,
    Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and ACM), as presented in Figure 4. Cloud computing
    first emerged in 2008 [25]. This shows that Fog computing publications have dramatically
    increased, as no study in this area was seen in the couple of years following
    the introduction of cloud computing research in 2008 (see Figure 5). FIGURE 3.
    No. of Fog computing-related papers in the Web of Science (as Feb 2018). Show
    All FIGURE 4. Number of publications with ”Fog computing” in the title in the
    four major digital libraries. Show All FIGURE 5. Published articles with the title
    cloud computing in the Web of Science. Show All From our observation, it is obvious
    that the interest in Fog computing research is rapidly increasing. Idle resources
    in the form of devices near users can be utilized within the Fog computing concept.
    Thus, a clear direction to market the adoption and technological development of
    Fog deployment has emerged. SECTION III. Difference Between Fog and Cloud Computing
    Paradigm Fog computing architectures are based on Fog clusters where multiple
    Fog devices participate to cooperate with the processing. On the other hand, datacenters
    are the main physical components of clouds. Because of this, cloud computing has
    high operational costs and energy consumption. By comparison, energy consumption
    and operation costs in the Fog computing paradigm is low. The Fog is located closer
    to the user, so the distance between users and Fog devices could be one or a few
    hops, which is also agreed by Hu et al. [8]. However, according to Mahmud et al.
    [26], the distance between users to the Fog is one or two hops. Again, Luan et
    al. [27] argued that the distance should be one hop with wireless connectivity.
    Yet, all agreed with the distance between the users to the cloud, which is a multi-hop
    distance. Due to the distance, communication latency for the cloud is always high
    compared to the Fog. The cloud is a more centralized approach while the Fog is
    a more distributed approach based on geographical orchestration [26]. Real-time
    Interaction is not possible for the cloud due to its high latency, but this problem
    can be easily resolved by Fog computing. On the other hand, the rate of failure
    in the Fog is high because of wireless connectivity, decentralized management,
    and power failure [26], [28]–[30]. Most devices in Fog environments will be connected
    wirelessly since smart gadgets and handheld devices will be participating in Fog
    systems [31]. These devices, and other network management devices, are mostly
    decentralized. These devices could fail when software is not managed correctly.
    Users may not be aware of malicious software that could lead to device failure.
    Moreover, Fog processing could fail in other cases as well, for example, each
    Fog device is responsible for performing its own application processing. So, the
    IoT application processing in a Fog device always takes second priority. If the
    Fog device is fully utilized by the application of the device itself, then it
    will fail to do any Fog processing. Hence, the scheduling of applications and
    resources in the Fog is more complex. In addition, failure handling in the Fog
    is competitive because of power failure, which is only an issue because the devices
    run on battery power. Altogether, Table 2 shows the technical differences between
    the cloud and the Fog. TABLE 2 Technical Difference Between Fog and Cloud Definitely,
    it cannot be said that the Fog can replace the cloud. We cannot even conclude
    that the Fog is better than the cloud either, both contribute differently via
    fulfilling different perspectives and requirements. SECTION IV. Related Paradigms
    and Technologies Fog computing uses computing resources near underlying networks,
    located between the traditional cloud and edge devices, to provide better and
    faster application processing and services [13]. Several similar computing paradigms
    exist besides Fog computing such as Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Mobile-Edge
    Computing (MEC), Edge Computing, Dew Computing, and Fog-dew computing. In cloud
    computing, all IoT devices are directly connected to the cloud and computation
    totally depends on the cloud. However, all the above similar technologies do not
    exclusively depend on the cloud, but depend on some intermediate devices for computation;
    some of them do not even require a connection to the cloud. Figure 6 shows the
    high-level architecture of these technologies. FIGURE 6. High level architecture
    of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Edge Computing (EC),
    Dew Computing (DC), Fog Computing (FC) and Fog Dew Computing (FDC). Show All A.
    Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) Remote execution of offloaded mobile services is
    done with the support of MCC near end users [32], [33]. MCC overcomes the computational,
    energy, and storage resource limitation of smart mobile devices. Generally, a
    lightweight cloud server (cloudlet) is placed at the edge of the network [34]
    to overcome these issues. MCC is a mobile computing technology, which provides
    unrestricted functionality, mobility, and storage facility through heterogeneous
    network connectivity. This technology also provides unified elastic computing
    resources by following the pay-per-use model. It also provides access to data,
    application, and cloud via the Internet for mobile users. It is expected that
    this technology will be applied in education, urban and rural development, healthcare,
    and more realistic social networking in the future [32]. Nowadays, many computation-intensive
    applications are widely available, such as Augmented Reality, computer vision
    and graphics, speech recognition, machine learning, planning and decision-making,
    and natural language processing applications. However, simply designing powerful
    mobile devices will not meet the requirements for these applications [33]. Rather,
    the applications require edge processing as well as collaboration with the cloud
    for complex processing. Thus, mobile computing demands fundamental changes to
    cloud computing, for example, a low-latency middle tier, programming models to
    enable seamless remote execution, basic mobile cloud services such as presence
    services, cloud infrastructure optimization for mobile applications, memcache
    services, and so on [33]. The convergence of mobile cloud computing is predicated
    on a reliable, end-to-end network, and high bandwidth, which isdifficult to guarantee
    in harsh environments. One of the solutions to this deep-rooted problem is the
    VM-based cloudlets located at a closer location to the mobile device [34]. B.
    Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) MEC proposes the co-location of computing and storage
    resources at the base stations of cellular networks [35]. MEC could either be
    connected or disconnected to cloud datacenters in a remote location. Hence, MEC
    supports two- or three-tier hierarchical application deployments along with end
    mobile devices [36]. In a MEC ecosystem, a new device called the MEC server needs
    to be deployed near base station towers to provide processing and storage capabilities
    at the edge. Four participants are involved in this computing paradigm, which
    are the mobile end users, network operators, Internet infrastructure provider
    (InPs),and application service provider. Mobile end users are the main consumer
    of the system and request their service via user equipment (UE). Network operators
    manage and maintain the operation of base stations, mobile core network, and MEC
    servers. InPs maintain Internet connectivity and routers. Application service
    providers host the application services in the content delivery networks (CDN)
    or within a data centers. Processing of requests from the UE will search out the
    closest MEC. The MEC server is capable of processing user request instead of forwarding
    it to remote Internet services. In a case where it is not possible to process
    or complete a request at the MEC sever; the request will be forwarded to remote
    CDNs or data centers [35]. According to Klas [36], MEC is the evolution of mobile
    base stations. It is a natural development. It is a collaborative deployment of
    telecommunication and IT networking. This computing paradigm enables new vertical
    business segments and services to individual end users and enterprise consumers.
    Various services could be delivered through this computing paradigm including
    IoT, location services, augmented reality, caching service, video analytics, and
    local content distribution. It can deliver real-time low-latency access of local
    content or by caching content at the MEC server. However, the main limitation
    of this system is the installation of the MEC server, which is specifically dedicated
    to MEC services. Scaling is another big issue with the increase in resource demand
    over time. C. Edge Computing Edge devices or edge servers provide computation
    facilities in Edge computing. In general, edge computing does not spontaneously
    associate with any types of cloud-based services and concentrates more on the
    IoT device side [23]. One study defined the edge as any network or computing resource
    near the path between cloud data centers and data sources [23]. Any smart device
    or sensor could have data sources but the edge is different. For example, a cloudlet
    and a micro datacenter is the edge of the mobile application and cloud, whereas
    the IoT gateway is the edge between IoT sensors and cloud. Similarly, if a cloud
    application is running on a smartphone, then the smartphone is the edge of the
    application and the cloud [37]. The main motivation of edge computing is that
    the computation should be done at a closer location to the data sources. In the
    edge computing concept, things are not only consuming data but also produce data
    by taking part in processing. Edge devices can perform computation task from the
    cloud besides requesting services and content. Data storage, computing offloading,
    processing, and caching will be done by an edge node. The edge device is also
    capable of distributing requests and providing service on behalf of the cloud
    to the users. In such scenarios, edge devices need to be well designed to meet
    privacy requirements, reliability measures, and security concerns [23]. D. Dew
    Computing (DC) In the current computing hierarchy, Dew Computing [38] is situated
    at the ground level of the cloud and Fog computing environment [39]. DC goes beyond
    the concept of service, storage, and network, to a sub-platform, which is based
    on a microservice concept for which its computing hierarchy is vertically distributed
    [39]. The DC approach facilitates resources such as sensors, tablets, and smartphones
    that are seamlessly connected to a network. Because of this, DC covers a wide
    range of ad-hoc-based networking technologies [39]. Skala et al. [39] argued that
    DC is much more useful in everyday life compared to Fog computing. Fog supports
    IoT-based applications, which demand less latency and real-time capability and
    a dynamic network configuration while DC is microservice concept and thus is not
    dependent on any centralized device, server, or cloud. They provide an example
    in which DC could be integrated into a smart traffic control system, where data
    collection and processing units will be located in between the traffic signals.
    These units generate a collective overview of the current traffic conditions.
    In such a way, a car with low fuel will be notified before entering heavy congestion,
    or a hybrid car will be informed of switching to conventional fuel before approaching
    the congestion. As a result, cars with less fuel will be rescued from unwanted
    situations and hybrid cars could reduce exhaust smoke densities significantly.
    Although the concept is microservice-based, the processing is completed in Fog
    devices. In the Fog computing concept, it is not crucial that applications must
    be dependent on the cloud or require the storing of results in the cloud. On the
    other hand, if such traffic processing information were stored, it would help
    strategic decision-making to improve traffic management. Dew computing is an emerging
    research area and its goal is to use the full potential of cloud and local resources
    [40]. E. Fog-Dew Computing In the architecture of Fog-dew computing, IoT devices
    need not have an active Internet connection while being connected to the community
    server. The community server will interact with the cloud and is responsible for
    providing services to the IoT devices [41]. Cloud computing always needs an Internet
    connection, which is the main drawback of the cloud. While the cloud is unable
    to serve users without an Internet connection, Fog-dew computing facilitates offline
    services without an Internet connection. However, there are some exceptions. For
    example, the navigation app, Waze, allows users to navigate offline. This feature
    was also recently added to Google Maps. In this case, a map information file for
    a specific area is downloaded to the user device and allows users to navigate
    during an offline state. Another example is Google Drive and Dropbox, where users
    can delete, create, and update files and folders in offline mode and then sync
    once the device is connected to the Internet. However, these services are not
    purely offline-we may not rely on the Internet directly but we cannot completely
    ignore Internet connection. The situation becomes more complex when a single user
    uses multiple offline devices alongside the complexity that arises in a multiuser
    environment. Such situations could be mitigated with the help of Fog-dew computing.
    In summary, in the Fog computing paradigm, IoT devices are connected to the cloud
    via Fog devices. Fog devices are connected to the cloud through the core network.
    Fog computing is a combination of MEC and MCC [7] but the main goal of all Fog-related
    paradigms is to perform processing at the edge. These related paradigms differ
    from each other based on Internet and cloud connectivity. Also, the amount of
    processing that needs to be done at the edge differs based on service requirements.
    Furthermore, the type of devices that will be used for computation and storage
    purposes is also another issue. In summary, Table 3 shows the characteristics
    of the above-discussed related computing paradigms along with the Fog computing
    paradigm. TABLE 3 Summary of Similar Technologies Like Fog SECTION V. Architecture
    of Fog Computing For market adoption and deployment, Fog computing must have a
    standard architecture. There is no available standard architecture to date. However,
    many research works have presented Fog computing architectures. In this section,
    we firstly discuss the high-level architecture of Fog computing. Furthermore,
    we summarize some proposed architectures for Fog computing. Finally, we present
    a detailed architecture for Fog computing with a comprehensive description of
    each component of the architecture. A. High-Level Architecture of Fog Computing
    In high-level architecture, the Fog computing paradigm has three different layers,
    as shown in Figure 7. The most important layer is the Fog layer. This layer consists
    of all intermediate computing devices. Traditional virtualization technologies
    can be used at this plane, similar to the cloud. However, considering the resource
    availability, employing container-based virtualization is more appropriate. This
    layer accumulates sensor-generated data from the IoT layer and sends an actuation-related
    request after processing. Although it seems that the big data problem is solved
    by processing generated data at the edge level, billions of devices will create
    big data issue. In fact, it is possible to employ small- and medium-scale big
    data processing at this level. Many research works have been undertaken to process
    big data in the Fog plane [47]–[53]. FIGURE 7. High level Fog computing architecture.
    Show All The bottommost layer is the IoT plane, which consists of all connected
    devices. The devices on this plane perform the sensing and actuation process.
    For time-sensitive applications, processing should be done on the Fog plane exclusively
    while the cloud can perform other processing that is not time-sensitive. However,
    the Fog layer will manage what needs to be sent to the cloud and what should not.
    The users are able to get services from both the Fog and cloud based on their
    request. However, the cloud plane will manage complex processing and storage.
    B. Various Proposed Architectures for Fog Computing Layered representation is
    the best way to represent Fog architecture. Many works have been done to quantify
    the layer-based concept of Fog architecture [4], [27], [54]–[58]. From our review,
    we found that researchers have proposed three [27], [56]–[58], four [55], five
    [4], and six [54] layers in the Fog architecture. Everyone has their own justifications
    for their claims. If we ignored the user plane, it is obvious that Fog architecture
    could be defined as three different levels from the high level. As we proceed
    to the more implementation-type level, the number of layers in the architecture
    would vary, giving rise to five [4] and six [54] levels in the Fog computing layer.
    Aazam and Huh [54] presented six different layers based on specific tasks. On
    the other hand, Dastjerdi et al. [4] defined five different layers based on network
    perspective. Other high-level architectures in Fog computing were also presented
    by various researchers including the hierarchical Fog architecture [59], [60],
    OpenFog architecture [61], Fog network architecture [62], Fog architecture for
    Internet of energy [9], Fog computing Architecture based on nervous system [63],
    and IFCIoT architecture [64]. After reviewing the literature stated above, we
    define the components of Fog computing architecture, which is presented in the
    following subsection. C. Components of Fog Computing Architecture Fog computing
    architecture consists of several layers. Each layer and its components are shown
    in Figure 8. In this subsection, we discuss various components of the Fog computing
    architecture. The components are divided into several groups based on their functionality,
    which is defined as the layer. These functionalities will enable IoT devices to
    communicate with various Fog devices, servers, gateways, and the cloud. A detailed
    explanation of each layer is given below, where a smart transportation use case
    is considered in the explanation. FIGURE 8. Components of Fog computing architecture.
    Show All 1) Physical Layer The basic data source for Fog computing is the various
    forms of data emitted by the sensors [57]. These data could be generated from
    smart devices, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, smart homes, the CCTV surveillance
    system, traffic monitoring system, self-driving vehicles, and so on. For instance,
    if we wanted to implement a smart traffic management and monitoring system, we
    need to get updated traffic conditions of all roads from various sensors, roadside
    devices, and cameras, which will help manage traffic signals. It is also necessary
    to predict future traffic demand by collecting data from various GPS sensors.
    Besides physical sensors, the role of virtual sensors is also important [54],
    if a road accident occurred, it would not be possible to decide using just a single
    sensor whether the road should be blocked or traffic should keep going. The road
    might have one or more lanes- one lane may be affected by this occurrence while
    another lane could enable the traffic flow to continue, but the traffic handling
    capacity will be decreased due to this occurrence. In this case, a virtual sensor
    might help obtain an immediate decision on road conditions, traffic multiplexing,
    and traffic rerouting. Hence, the physical layer consists of physical and virtual
    sensors, where any data generation device could fall into any of these groups.
    2) Fog Device, Server, and Gateway Layer The Fog device, Fog server, or Fog gateway
    could be a standalone device or an IoT device [57], [59], [62]. However, it is
    obvious that the Fog server should have a higher configuration than the Fog device
    and gateway since it manages several Fog devices. Various factors are involved
    so that the Fog server can run. These include its role, hardware configuration,
    connectivity, number of devices it can manage, and so on. Whether the Fog server
    is distinct or part of an IoT device is defined by its role. A group of physical
    and virtual sensors will be connected to a Fog device. Similarly, a group of Fog
    devices will be connected to a Fog server. In this context, the Fog server should
    have higher processing and storage capacity compared to the Fog device. A specific
    cluster of Fog devices, which are connected to the same server, can communicate
    with each other when required. In the smart transportation use case, some application
    processing might depend on other Fog clusters. For example, if an application
    needed to find a fuel-efficient route, it might need information about other sensor
    clusters or Fog device clusters. To reach an appropriate decision, processing
    needs to be done in multiple Fog devices and servers. The Fog server and device
    layer are responsible for managing and maintaining information on hardware configuration,
    storage configuration, and connectivity of device and servers. This layer also
    manages the computation requirements requested by various applications. Computation
    requirements depend on data flow and the total number of IoT devices connected
    to the Fog device, as well as the total number of Fog devices connected to the
    Fog server. The communication between several Fog servers is maintained by this
    layer. For example, a Cisco IOx-supported 800 series router can be used as a Fog
    device and Cisco Fog data service devices can be used as the Fog server [65],
    [66]. 3) Monitoring Layer The monitoring layer always keeps track of the system
    performance and resources [54], services, and responses. System monitoring components
    help choose the appropriate resources during operation. Various applications run
    in smart transportation system scenarios. Therefore, it is obvious that a situation
    could arise when resource availability will be negative for computation or storage
    on a Fog device. A similar case could happen to the Fog server. To tackle these
    kinds of situations, the Fog device and servers will seek help from other peers.
    Thus, the system monitoring component will help decide such things efficiently.
    The resource demand component monitors current resource demand and can predict
    future demand for resources based on current resource usage and user activities.
    In this way, the system will be able to deal with any awkward situations where
    resource outage might occur. Performance prediction monitors can predict Fog computing
    performance based on system load and resource availability. This component is
    required to maintain appropriate QoS requirements in service level agreements.
    If SLA violation occurs frequently, then the cost of the system for the provider
    will be increased because of the penalty. Although performance prediction cannot
    eliminate this issue completely, it will be able to minimize overall SLA violation
    by predicting the performance and usage of the system. 4) Pre and Post-Processing
    Layer This layer contains multiple components, which specifically work on basic
    and advanced data analysis. At this level, acquired data are analyzed and filtered,
    and data trimming and reconstruction are also done when necessary. After processing
    the data, the data flow component decides whether the data needs to be stored
    locally or should be sent to the cloud for long-term storage [59]. The main challenge
    in Fog computing is to process data at the edge and minimize the volume of data
    that needs to be stored; this phenomenon is referred to as stream processing.
    In the smart transportation system use case, data will be generated from many
    sensors. These generated data will be analyzed and filtered in real time to get
    insight into the generated data. All generated data might not have any use. In
    some cases, it would not even be a good idea to store all generated data. As an
    example, if data is generated from a sensor each second, the mean value of data
    within a minute or within an hour may be stored depending on application requirements.
    Data can be trimmed in this way and a vast amount of storage space can be saved.
    In another case, if the difference among data values in some period of time is
    not that big, but might affect performance, then less numbers of reading within
    a minute can be taken. In such a way, it will be possible to filter a vast amount
    of generated data. Although the accuracy may not be 100%, application requirements
    might still be fulfilled to some extent. Data reconstruction is one of the components
    of this layer. This module takes care of faulty and incomplete data generated
    by the sensors. Similarly, if one or more sensors fail during operation, this
    component will reconstruct the data based on the data generation pattern to prevent
    interruption or any other application failure. 5) Storage Layer The storage module
    is responsible for storing data through storage virtualization. The data backup
    component ensures availability of data and mitigates the loss of data. In the
    storage virtualization concept, a pool of storage devices connected by a network
    acts as a single storage device, which is easier to manage and maintain. One of
    the key benefits of storage virtualization is to provide enterprise-class functionality
    using less-expensive storage or commodity hardware. Thus, the storage layer facilitates
    storage virtualization in order to minimize the complexity of the storage system.
    In a system, storage might fail at any point during system operation [67]. Therefore,
    it is crucial to backup important data to mitigate any unwanted situations. The
    data backup module in this layer takes care of periodic or customized data backup
    schemes. 6) Resource Management Layer The components in this layer maintain the
    allocation of resources, and scheduling, and deal with energy saving issues. The
    reliability component maintains the reliability of application scheduling and
    resource allocation. Scalability ensures the scalability of Fog resources during
    peak hours where resource demand is high. The cloud deals with horizontal scalability
    while Fog computing aims to provide both horizontal and vertical scalability [9].
    There are many distributed system resources for network, processing, and storage.
    This is a critical issue for distributed resources, which use application processing.
    Thus, resource allocation, deallocation, and reallocation will happen in which
    the resource allocation component manages and maintains resource allocation related
    issues. Another vital issue is that many applications will run in the Fog computing
    environment simultaneously. Hence, proper scheduling of these applications is
    required. The application scheduling component takes care of these applications
    based on various objectives. This layer also has energy saving components, which
    manage resources in an energy-efficient manner. Energy efficiency also positively
    affects the environment and helps minimize operational cost. Reliability components
    handle the requirement for the reliability of a system based on various reliability
    measures and metrics. Fog computing is a complex system that needs to take care
    of all IoT devices, Fog devices, and the cloud. Therefore, a device or connection
    might fail at any level, so reliability management is an important issue. 7) Security
    Layer All security-related issues such as encryption of communications and secure
    data storage will be maintained by the components in this layer, which also preserve
    the privacy of Fog users. Fog computing is intended to be deployed as a form of
    utility computing like cloud computing. However, in the cloud computing concept,
    the user connects to the cloud for services, but in the Fog computing concept
    the user will connect to the Fog infrastructure for the services while the Fog
    middleware will manage and maintain communications with the cloud. Hence, a user
    intending to connect to a service must be authorized by the provider. Therefore,
    the authentication component in the security layer processes authentication requests
    from users, so they can connect to the Fog computing service environment [27].
    To maintain security, it is crucial to maintain encryption between communications,
    so that security breaches by outsiders will not occur. The encryption component
    encrypts all connections from and to IoT devices and to the cloud. Fog computing
    components are mostly connected via a wireless connection, so security concerns
    are crucial. Some services in a smart city or smart house privacy are also an
    issue because of the involvement of user-related data in these types of systems.
    The Fog computing paradigm should not disclose user information without their
    consent. In the current age, the majority of users normally accept the security
    policy of the provider without reading it. Thus, special consideration of privacy
    should be undertaken for such services that involve user-related critical information.
    8) Application Layer Although the Fog was developed to serve IoT applications
    [58], several other applications based on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and CDN
    also support Fog computing. Any application that has latency-aware characteristics
    will be able to take advantage of Fog computing. This includes any type of utility-based
    service that could fit within Fog computing by providing better service quality
    and cost-effectiveness. For example, Augmented Reality-based applications should
    adopt Fog computing because of its nature. It is clear that Augmented Reality
    will transform the modern world in the near future. The needs of real-time processing
    for Augmented Reality applications can be addressed by Fog computing, which can
    maintain continuous improvement of Augmented Reality-related services. SECTION
    VI. Taxonomy of Fog Computing The Fog computing taxonomy is presented in Figure
    9. This taxonomy is derived by considering existing literature and the overall
    viewpoint on Fog computing. The proposed taxonomy focuses on the requirements
    perspective for infrastructure, platform, and application. FIGURE 9. Taxonomy
    of Fog computing based on the requirements of infrastructure, platform, and applications.
    Show All Firstly, by considering infrastructure, we identify infrastructure and
    network requirements, and the types of devices in a Fog computing environment.
    Secondly, for platform resource allocation and scheduling, security and privacy
    concern, service requirements, management, and multitenancy were determined. Finally,
    we defined application requirements, user requirements, and application modeling
    taxonomy for Fog computing. This taxonomy will help the research community and
    enterprises to gain better understanding and insight into the real-world deployment
    of Fog computing requirements, architecture, and devices. Figure 9 shows the taxonomy
    of Fog computing. A detailed description of each branch of the taxonomy is presented
    in this section. A. Infrastructure Fog computing infrastructure requirements depend
    on the network, devices, and their requirements. All Fog devices, network devices,
    and gateways existing in the Fog environment that participates in computation
    are also part of the Fog infrastructure. Infrastructure denotes the physical components
    of the Fog environment. 1) Infrastructure Requirements The many connected tiny
    devices are the primary elements in a Fog computing environment. These devices
    are located everywhere and help to connect all things around us. It is estimated
    that the world will see 50 billion handheld devices by 2020. Beside these devices,
    a huge number of sensors and actuators will also be put in place. Therefore, a
    proper infrastructural facility is needed to support this vast computing environment
    [20]. An example of how the number of sensors is increasing day by day is given
    in The Economist report titled, “Augmented Business”, which describes the implant
    sensors on cattle ears that could help to monitor their activity, health, and
    movements. This could help increase overall productivity. The implant of sensors
    affixed in one cow produces about 200 MB of information in a year. In another
    example, with sensor technology, Rolls-Royce is able to forecast when engines
    will more likely fail. From such a prediction, customers can plan engine changes.
    Heidelberger Druckmaschinen has huge printing presses equipped with more than
    1,000 sensors. These are the examples of distinct uses of sensors in specific
    domains. However, this phenomenon will change completely when the distinct parts
    are connected to generate more efficient and effective decisions. Therefore, the
    Fog infrastructure must have the capability to provide physical resources for
    computation, networking, storage, and memory to achieve efficient Fog computing
    services. 2) Network Requirements The network is one of the key bottlenecks in
    the Fog computing environment, where billions of connected devices generate and
    consume data at the edge of the network [68]. Most of the sensing and actuating
    devices require low bandwidth but a higher number of devices will be connected
    at the same time. Therefore, existing network connection technologies like LAN,
    MAN, WAN, or PAN need to be investigated further and amendments will be needed
    to cope with the Fog computing environment to facilitate countless IoT devices.
    Network operators are increasingly investing in new wireless access technology
    research because of the number of devices per user is increasing day by day. For
    instance, in the cellular mobile network, base stations have a limited number
    of link points [20]. As the number of things increase, these stations will need
    to support increasing numbers of devices. Fog devices must act as a router for
    neighboring IoT devices and as a primary processing unit for IoT application in
    the Fog environment. Each Fog device should have a resilient connectivity to the
    lower and upper layer devices. Mobile ad-hoc networks could act as a basis for
    the Fog network because of their mobility and lower cost feature [20]. Hence,
    connection and mobility are the main requirements for the Fog network. 3) Fog
    Devices Fog computing is basically intended to support IoT-related technologies
    to perform processing at the edge level. Mine projects [69], [70] at the middle
    of the sea, airline fleets or a ship [70] can be equipped with a huge number of
    sensors, so it is impossible to send and store all generated data in real-time
    into the cloud. Some intermediate computation, processing, and services will be
    done by Fog computing devices. Thus, the Fog layer must have sensor management
    devices, Fog processing, and storage devices and Fog gateway devices. All of these
    devices will work collaboratively to manage and perform tasks in the Fog plane.
    Here, we discuss the devices that are needed for Fog computing deployment. a:
    IoT Devices IoT devices are the devices that have sensing and actuating capability.
    A sensor is able to sense the environment, while an actuator acts on it when necessary.
    One of the most common types of sensor in IoT devices is the temperature sensor.
    The temperature sensor has various functions depending on different domains such
    as at home, in factories, and in the agriculture field. This sensor is also used
    to sense the temperature of soil, water, and plants in order to take proper action
    needed to improve service outcome. Another type of useful sensor is the pressure
    sensor, used especially in agriculture, smart vehicles, and aircrafts. Sensors
    are also used to estimate the volume of water used by the agricultural sector
    for cultivation and other uses. Surprisingly, a huge percentage of this water
    is wasted due to leaky irrigation systems and inefficient use of fresh water.
    Efficient use of the pressure sensor will help solve this problem. The pressure
    sensor is able to determine the flow of water and reduce water waste. The pressure
    sensor is also used in smart vehicles to determine the forces acting on it, and
    in aircrafts to determine altitude. Different groups of sensors are used for different
    IoT environments. For example, in healthcare, the most-used sensors are chemical,
    IR, pressure, and temperature sensors as well as other biosensors. On the other
    hand, in a smartphone, the most-used sensors are the gyroscope, GPS, and proximity
    sensors. One of the applications of the proximity sensor is to determine the presence
    of ear to dim or turn off the phone backlight to improve battery efficiency. This
    sensor is also used to monitor parking space since it can determine the presence
    of an object without touching it. It can also be used in a wide temperature range
    and is not affected by color. Its detection process also is not effected by dirt,
    oil, or water. There are many other sensors out there that enable IoT, which include
    GPS sensors, water quality sensors, level sensors, chemical/gas sensors, smoke
    sensors, IR sensors, humidity sensors, sound and vibration sensors, motion sensors,
    acceleration sensors, and machine vision sensors. There are five main types of
    actuators-magnetic or thermal, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical.
    The actuator has a controlling or moving mechanism, a motor, which acts on various
    inputs. The raw application data comes from various sensors like speed sensors,
    cameras, temperature sensors, vehicle monitoring sensors, or GPS sensors. A typical
    sensor generates 10 data samples every second [71]. Sensors convert environmental
    variables such as smoke, heat, light, temperature, humidity, sound, and so on
    into electrical signals. These sensors are varied and can be micro-electro-mechanical
    systems (MEMS)-based, CMOS-based or LED sensors. Communication among sensors could
    be done by ZigBee, Bluetooth, Z-Wave or 6LoWPAN standards for short distance communication
    [72]. There is a necessity for communication among sensors in some cases where
    one sensing output is dependent on other collective sensor outputs. These sensors
    will be connected to Fog devices through wireless connections. However, Fog devices
    collect and process data based on application requirements. Some example of research
    works based on sensors can be improved by taking advantage of Fog computing. Aziz
    et al. [73] proposed a real-time health monitoring system using particular sensors
    in which the proposed architecture was based on GSM and GPS technologies. The
    system specifically monitors the body temperature and blood pressure of patients.
    The study used an Arduino microcontroller, dfrobot GPS/GPRS/GSM module v3.0.3,
    a heartbeat pulse sensor, and a lilypad temperature sensor for hardware implementation.
    In another study, a web-based application was developed for doctors and nurses
    with SMS functionality, which will be used as an emergency case. The system is
    able to generate GPS location, body temperature, and blood pressure. Butt et al.
    [74] investigated wearable technology such as SensHand, Gloves-based system, electromyography-based
    and hybrid systems, leap motion, and smartwatches. The development of these kinds
    of technology must be integrated with the smart home system and Fog-like architecture
    in order to deal with emergency situations. Some devices such as the smartphone
    can be considered as both an IoT and Fog device. In the same way, if some sensors
    and actuators were installed in the Raspberry Pi, the device could also act as
    both an IoT and Fog device. b: Fog Processing Devices Any device that has computing
    capability, storage, and network connectivity can act as a Fog processing device.
    It could be a network controller, switch, router, server, or a video surveillance
    camera. A Cisco 800 series router can be used as a Fog device where the IoT application
    can be run on the device and the device supporting Cisco IOx. To date, only Cisco
    800 series routers are supporting IOx with Linux kernel with virtualization support
    [44]. Most of these devices have a 266-400 MHz MPC8272 processor with 16 KB Cache,
    64 MB random access memory and 20 MB processor board flash memory. The user can
    host an application on these routers. These routers have two cores-Cisco IOS runs
    on one core and another core is used for running IOx services. Another type of
    Fog processing device is the Fog server. A Fog server can control several Fog
    devices in a specific domain. Cisco offers two flavors of Fog computing server
    deployment. One is the Cisco Fog Director, which can be deployed on any type of
    server with Cisco-recommended server specifications [66]. Another example of a
    Fog device manufactured by Cisco is the Fog data services, which are specifically
    designed for IoT [65]. However, Cisco Fog data services can only be deployed on
    Cisco UCS E and C Series Servers. Both will act as Fog servers; however, Cisco
    Fog data services are especially designed for an IoT environment. However, various
    organizations and bodies need to work beyond the proprietary solutions for fast
    technological advancement and technology adoption with a limited budget. Fog devices
    and Fog servers should be deployed in such a way that any type of network management
    device with storage and processing capability can act as a Fog device. Similarly,
    the usual type of server must be able to act as a Fog server. This could be an
    ordinary PC since Fog is not dedicated to performing very complex processing.
    However, further investigation is necessary to explore the minimum system requirement
    for a device that can act as a Fog device or Fog server. Connectivity between
    Fog devices and Fog servers will be via Ethernet or wireless or a serial connection
    in some cases. As an example, Cisco UCS E and C Series Servers, which are generally
    used as Fog servers, are connected to the network via Ethernet. On the other hand,
    Cisco 800 series routers are connected via serial ports that support Fog computation.
    c: Gateway Devices for Fog Many hardware boards are currently available in the
    market including Arduino Yun, Intel Edison, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone Black, Arduino
    + Shields, Netduino, Tessel 2, and so on. These boards are currently used as IoT
    and gateway devices and can also be used as Fog gateway devices and as Fog devices.
    These boards have a built-in processor, wired and wireless adapter, and a USB
    port. Fog computing supports device heterogeneity, where a gateway could also
    be a part of the Fog computing environment. Constant et al. [75] developed a Fog
    gateway using Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi. Their proposed Fog gateway integrated
    the data conditioning process, smart analytics, intelligent filtering, and transfer
    to the cloud, which needs long-term storage and temporal variability monitoring.
    The IoT gateway supports various data types and communication protocols between
    devices and sensors. It also unifies the data format from various sensors. Current
    IoT gateways provide a solution for communication and do not support fully automatic
    configurations of newly added IoT devices [76]. Guoqiang et al. [77] proposed
    a smart IoT gateway with three key benefits. The proposed gateway has a unified
    external interface and pluggable architecture. It has a flexible protocol to translate
    various sensor data into a uniform format. The study designed a customized device
    with a Samsung S5PV210 mobile application processor as its gateway. However, this
    gateway did not have any fault tolerance or security features. B. Platform The
    platform manages applications and infrastructure in the Fog environment. It takes
    care of resource allocation, scheduling, fault tolerance, multi-tenancy, security,
    and privacy in Fog computing. Based on the taxonomy of the Fog, we discuss the
    requirements of the platform for Fog computing in this section. 1) Resource Allocation
    and Scheduling Heterogeneous devices are the main challenges in developing proper
    resource allocation and scheduling in the Fog. If we wanted to use the computation
    power of idle devices, we need to schedule tasks on these devices efficiently.
    Otherwise, IoT application processing in the Fog will face complex issues, which
    will hinder the fulfillment of the latency awareness goal. Two of the key requirements
    for resource allocation and scheduling are availability and efficiency. Resources
    in the Fog are not dedicated, and thus availability should be ensured. On the
    other hand, lack of efficient resource allocation and scheduling might lead to
    unwanted delays in the overall processing. 2) Service Requirements Fog services
    can be defined as single or multiple user requests, where the user will constantly
    be updated of the outcome of the service until he or she has a subscription to
    that service. This means that the service outcome will not be fixed and will keep
    changing until the end of the service. The Fog device and Fog server perform the
    intermediate processing, which occurs in between user request and service output.
    The Fog server may communicate with the cloud for processing and information retrieval
    when necessary. For instance, if we considered selecting the best path based on
    real-time traffic in a smart transportation system, the Fog service will keep
    updating on the best path until the end of the journey. In this case, we need
    to take into account mitigation of fault, service quality, network latency, and
    power consumption in order to maintain the standard of the service. a: Fault Tolerance
    Fault tolerance allows a system to keep performing even when a part of the system
    has failed. This failure might be software failure, hardware failure, or network
    failure. The solution for fault tolerance will result in a fully operational system
    where the system will continue its operation with a lower capability instead of
    shutting down totally [78]. Fault tolerance is mostly investigated in the cloud
    [79]–[89]. However, it is necessary to investigate fault tolerance in the Fog
    as well. Although many research works have addressed the need to explore fault
    tolerance issues [5], [9], [64] in Fog computing, none have actually investigated
    the issue. We discuss in more detail the issue of fault tolerance in Section VIII-B.
    b: Quality of Service (QoS) QoS is an important service requirement for Fog computing,
    which is based on reliability, network delay, throughput, and energy consumption.
    Besides these, resource management, power-consumption model, scheduling policy,
    and power failure handling are also important to ensure QoS. If some sensors fail
    for any reason, the accuracy of the outcome or action could be affected. Fog is
    intended to work with latency-sensitive systems; hence, it should maintain high
    reliability with a strict QoS assurance. Otherwise, the latency awareness criteria
    will not be fulfilled. Madsen et al. [90] suggested that the availability of different
    methodologies and algorithms work with the reliability of network connectivity
    and information, to ensure accuracy, which is crucial for building Fog computing-based
    projects. 3) Security and Privacy In this technological era, people are inevitably
    sharing personal information when using different applications and web services.
    Our personal information is no longer personal; it now belongs to many tech giants
    because we are using their free services on a regular basis [91]. A simple example
    is that if anyone used an Android phone without any security settings, the built-in
    Android OS will automatically run GPS and map services, for which it can collect
    all location-related activities about the user. Therefore, information about when
    and which country a user has visited, where a user has dined in, which route a
    user uses for going to the office, home, and so on will be made available to these
    companies. However, these tech giants might argue that they do not disclose our
    data to others, as they can only see our data in our timeline only. However, a
    recent Facebook incident fails to convince us of the honesty of these tech giants
    [92]. The Fog computing paradigm is completely distributed and not intended to
    be centrally managed most of the time. Sensitive data might be processed in an
    intermediate device when the application does not have full control of the device.
    On the other hand, the user will not have full control over the Fog applications.
    Users will require more protective and innovative ways to retain their privacy
    and protect it from any potential and very harmful entities [20]. Similarly, Fog
    application providers also need to develop security to protect their application
    from unwanted data theft. Three different types of security need to be ensured:
    network connection security, data security, and user privacy. Network connection
    security and data security are applicable from both the user and provider perspectives.
    Moreover, user privacy is also important because Fog processing is carried out
    on user data in most cases. 4) Multi-Tenancy Multiple tenants for the same services
    with an isolated runtime for each tenant are referred to as multi-tenancy service.
    Multi-tenancy is important for Fog because of the limited resources in a Fog environment.
    By enabling multi-tenancy, one instance will run in a Fog device and will serve
    multiple tenants (users). Multi-tenancy could be container-based or could be the
    usual virtualization-based. Container-based virtualization is a more lightweight
    and powerful virtualization solution, which the Fog can adopt, to provide the
    fastest processing solution. Container-based virtualization does not need to emulate
    the operating system to facilitate virtualization; thus, it will be easier to
    manage and migrate. Multi-tenancy is a requirement for the platform, and needs
    to be defined before deployment. Multi-tenancy may incur performance degradation
    and security issues [29]; thus, adequate and secure isolation is needed. 5) Management
    The management of the Fog can be centralized or decentralized. Since the devices
    in a Fog environment belong to different domains, centralized management is not
    always possible. Alternatively, processing of IoT applications will be done in
    different Fog clusters, so management will follow a distributed nature in this
    case. In summary, the management of the platform in a Fog must be defined. In
    the case of decentralized management, similar processes must be deployed for different
    Fog devices to handle management issues. C. Application Applications have to fulfill
    certain requirements to execute in a Fog environment. Here, we discuss the features
    required by the applications for execution. 1) Application Requirements a: Scalability
    The number of IoT devices are increasing very swiftly day by day all over the
    world, which raises a new issue of scalability. Thus, we need to deal with the
    scaling of devices and services in the Fog computing environment. Dependency on
    cloud computing has been observed for IoT application processing by many research
    works, where trillions of IoT devices are involved, such as that of Li et al.
    [93]. However, implementation of the whole application in the cloud in such an
    environment where IoT devices are generating a huge amount of data is neither
    feasible nor efficient. IoT devices are not only stationary but also mobile in
    most cases. Hence, maintaining frequently changing device states and availability
    in the cloud is not an easy task. Also, with the growing number of IoT devices,
    it would be more critical for IoT applications to query and select IoT devices
    [59]. The Fog computing system must be an autonomous system where application
    execution by the participating device will be done automatically including scalability.
    b: Heterogeneity For any IoT system, the heterogeneous device is a fundamental
    characteristic where device heterogeneity co-exists at any level in the Fog computing
    paradigm. Abstraction of device complexity is also required to some extent. Device
    heterogeneity does not only refer to the diversity of services and protocols,
    but also the assortment of horizontal and vertical levels of the Fog architecture
    [59]. To address this heterogeneity, Giang et al. [59], classified three types
    of Fog devices: compute, input/output (IO), and edge nodes. Edge nodes are the
    sensors and the actuators, IO nodes are the resource-limited devices mostly responsible
    for brokering communications, and computing nodes offer computing facilities.
    Of the three types of nodes, IO and compute nodes are mostly dynamic and customizable
    or programmable as required. It is possible to implement all three nodes in a
    single device based on its capability and design goal. The smart gateway is an
    example of such implementation. In order to use the capability of various types
    of devices in an IoT environment, it is obvious that the application must be designed
    in such a way that it might be able to perform its task execution on multiple
    devices regardless of its capacity and location. More precisely, the application
    should able to use maximum available computation resources through middleware.
    c: Interaction Timeliness The perception-action (PA) cycle is the basic function
    of a nervous system, which maintains circular flow between sensory organisms and
    its actions towards the functionality of that sensing. The PA cycle is also a
    characteristic of IoT applications, where the cloud and Fog infrastructure satisfies
    timeliness requirements and application logic for communication. Giang et al.
    [59] identified four interaction models for the PA cycle in a Fog environment.
    Examples of these models are: (i) in a local network, communication between devices,
    which is considered as an immediate cycle action, (ii) interaction with the cloud
    from a device of a local network, which is generally for time-insensitive actions,
    (iii) an interaction generated by the cloud to a device in a local network, which
    requires semi-immediate actions, and (iv) communication among IoT-related applications
    in the cloud. However, their work considered the role of the Fog server, which
    manages and maintains several Fog devices in a specific cluster. On the other
    hand, PA interaction can be divided into immediate, semi-immediate, and delayed
    action to leverage IoT application requirements more efficiently. Delayed action
    can be performed on the type of processing that does not have any timeliness issues
    and could be processed by the cloud infrastructure. d: Mobility Device mobility
    is a natural probability and is one of the key requirements for implementing an
    IoT platform [59]. From the Fog perspective, it is not only the edge devices that
    will be mobile but also computing and storage devices in the Fog layer. Managing
    mobile devices in two different planes and syncing them with each other is challenging.
    To ensure resource availability and successful task completion, task distribution,
    duplication, and migration is required. This mechanism is already considered in
    the cloud but there is a need to reinvestigate them by considering mobility [94].
    2) User Requirements User requirements can be changed by various constraints.
    First of all, a user may want to complete the submitted task within a specific
    time binding, which is referred to as the deadline. Secondly, the user may set
    some constraints for the budget. Thirdly, in the case of some users, they may
    not care about the budget but the response time is of utmost importance. Fourthly,
    some users may want tolerable accuracy. This means that the user may not seek
    accurate results but rather fast results that could be provided with some reasonable
    errors. Aazam and Huh [54] suggested that pre-allocation and prediction of resources
    rely on user behavior and the probability of future utilization of resources.
    Dastjerdi et al. [4], [95] stated that edge devices perform optimization by considering
    user behavior and network condition. 3) Application Modeling Two types of application
    modeling are possible by considering the requirements of applications in the Fog.
    Most IoT devices generate tuples periodically, which can be considered as a stream.
    These streams need to be processed in real time to get accurate results. Alternatively,
    the application that does the processing based on previously stored sets of data
    could include microservice-based applications. The advantage of microservice is
    that it can bind all functionality and required libraries in a single service,
    which can run above the microservice controller without dependency. Hence, application
    modeling in Fog could be stream-based or microservice-based. SECTION VII. Dimension
    of Fog Computing-Based Applications Several applications require a Fog computing
    infrastructure to provide smooth services. These include smart transportation
    systems, Augmented and Virtual reality, healthcare, video streaming, smart homes,
    and smart cities. Requirements of platform and applications are also needed in
    order to provide services. In this section, we discuss some research works, which
    specifically address the application of Fog computing. We evaluate each work based
    on their contribution on the Fog infrastructure, platform, and applications as
    defined in our taxonomy. It is obvious that all three kinds of services are interrelated.
    However, each researcher only focused on one or more of these aspects. Mapping
    related works with our proposed taxonomy will help in finding the research gaps
    in Fog computing applications. A. Smart Transportation System Several research
    works have been carried out on smart transportation systems that use Fog computing.
    In this section we discuss a few works that have been done on the Fog-based smart
    transportation system and then identify key issues that need to be addressed.
    Truong et al. [96] pproposed a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANETs) architecture
    called Fog Software Defined Networking (FSDN), which combines SDN and Fog together
    to provide a better solution. As SDN has programmability, flexibility, global
    knowledge, and scalability features and Fog has location awareness and time sensitivity,
    the combination of these two will leverage on the key challenges in VANETs. The
    proposed system is able to augment communication among vehicles, infrastructure,
    and base stations via centralized control, besides reducing latency and optimizing
    the utilization of resources. However, the central SDN controller of the proposed
    system is where the bottleneck of the proposed system occurs. The system is focused
    on infrastructure and network requirements. The Fog controller is used for service
    implementation. The work did not focus on platform and application requirements.
    Investigation of VANETs in Fog has also been done in Giang et al. [97], where
    they explored how smart transportation applications (VANETs) are developed using
    the Fog Computing approach. Driving vehicles in an urban area requires immediate
    decision on various activities such as route changing, lane change, slowing down
    speed, looking at obstacles, and so on. Hence, applications need to gather all
    related details to act on these activities. The authors discussed Fog-based smart
    transportation application requirements such as programming abstraction and application
    models. The work explored application modeling but not other application aspects
    nor infrastructure or platform. B. Vehicles as Fog Infrastructure Hou et al. [98]
    proposed the idea of Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC), which will use the vehicle
    as an infrastructure for computation and communication. The VFC architecture utilizes
    vehicle computation resources by providing service to the edge devices located
    near them. It will aggregate abundant resources of each moving car by which service
    quality can be enhanced. Using quantitative analysis on different scenarios, they
    discovered an interesting relationship among connectivity, mobility, communication
    capability, and parking behavior. These four characteristics help us understand
    resource utilization of vehicle resources, which will help achieve better utilization
    of unused resources. C. Augmented and Virtual Reality Augmented Reality applications
    are extremely time sensitive; a small delay can lead to serious errors in user
    experience. Thus, Fog computing-based solutions will have great potential in this
    domain [4]. These statements are also applicable for connected Virtual Reality
    (VR) or VR-based games. Zao et al. [99] proposed an augmented brain computer interaction
    game, which utilized the Fog and cloud infrastructure. The Fog performed real-time
    analysis such as signal processing that needs to classify the brain state and
    other analyses such as model classification updated from the cloud. However, their
    work only focused on the Fog infrastructure but neglected most aspects regarding
    platform and application. D. Healthcare The Fog computing approach also enables
    real-time sensor-based healthcare services. Rahmani et al. [100] proposed a Fog-assisted
    system architecture for the healthcare system. A smart e-health gateway is the
    key component of this architecture, which will process the generated data from
    the sensors and generate an Early Warning Score (EWS) to notify for any medical
    emergency. They considered many aspects of our taxonomy; but it is necessary to
    investigate each aspect extensively, which this study did not. Another Fog-based
    healthcare architecture was proposed by Mahmud et al. [26]. Their work mainly
    focused on network delay, power consumption, and communication optimization in
    Fog-based healthcare service. However, platform, application, and user requirements
    were not investigated. E. Smart City Smart city-related applications need to process
    sensor data on a real-time basis, where Fog computing can play a major role. Giordano
    et al. [101] proposed a Rainbow architecture, which supports various applications
    in a smart city. The proposed Rainbow framework evaluated three smart city applications
    including noise pollution mapping, urban drainage networks, and smart street.
    The work proposed a distributed agent-based approach in the intermediate layer
    in between the physical infrastructure and cloud. However, the work did not focused
    on application and platform aspects except for application modeling. Table 4 shows
    a summary of the above-discussed Fog-based applications mapped to our proposed
    taxonomy. In summary, it can be concluded that most of the works have focused
    on infrastructure and application modeling. There is a research gap on application-
    and platform-related aspects, which need to be explored further. TABLE 4 Evaluation
    of Existing Works on Fog Applications SECTION VIII. State-of-the-Art Fog Computing
    In this section, we focus on some existing research works on Fog computing. We
    discuss research works from four different research areas of Fog computing. These
    areas are resource allocation and scheduling, failure handling, simulation tools,
    and microservices. A. Resource Allocation and Scheduling in Fog Computing Fog
    computing is fast evolving and growing rapidly due to its edge-level computation
    and heterogeneous nature. In this section, we present several research works,
    which have been done in the past couple of years. We also summarize the presented
    research works with a comparative discussion to address research gaps in this
    area. Most of the reviewed works are related to resource allocation and scheduling
    in the cloud and Fog environment. However, some works have only been done in the
    Fog environment. 1) Resource Allocation and Scheduling for Fog-Cloud Environment
    Alsaar et al. [102] proposed resource allocation methods for a collaborative platform
    composed of Fog and cloud paradigms. Their proposed algorithm is grounded on linearized
    decision tree rules by considering three different conditions for managing user
    request and for balancing workload. The conditions are VM capacity, completion
    time, and service size. Each condition has two branches: the VM capacity branches
    out to enough or not enough; the completion time consists of now or later, and
    the service size is divided into small or large. In some cases, this includes
    services in the queue, which will be represented with yes or no. They utilized
    1/m/m/1, with (1)/ representing cloud broker, /(m) for many paths, /(m) for many
    Fog brokers, and /(1) for IoT device users. Using this method, the total overhead
    for big data processing in the system was reduced. In their work, the availability
    of cloud servers and the Fog was guaranteed and a fast response time to satisfy
    QoS was achieved. The SLA for users was also different, where shared and reserved
    resource was provided. However, availability and QoS were not studied extensively.
    Deng et al. [103] presented a framework for workload allocation in the cloud and
    Fog environment to examine power consumption-delay trade-off issues. They defined
    the workload allocation problem into primary and sub-problems, which can be solved
    via related sub-systems. They employed a Hungarian algorithm and Generalized Benders
    Decomposition (GBD) algorithm to solve the problem. Numerical and simulation results
    were presented to prove that the Fog is a complement to the cloud. However, the
    complex nature of workload and resource was not studied in their work. Brogi et
    al. [104] prototyped a tool known as ‘FogTorch ∏ ’ which is capable of fulfilling
    hardware, software, and QoS requirements before deploying a composite application
    in the Fog infrastructure. The proposed tool manipulates Monte Carlo simulations
    and only considers communication link QoS. Resource consumption and QoS assurance
    terms were undertaken for classifying the eligibility of deployments. The proposed
    algorithm was based on the preprocessing phase and backtracking search phase.
    To find eligible deployment, the preprocessing used input from results derived
    by the backtracking search algorithm. However, availability and latency are more
    important in the Fog environment compared to resource consumption and communication
    links. In order to ensure efficient use of resources and network infrastructure
    in the Fog and cloud environment, Taneja and Davy [105] proposed a Module Mapping
    Algorithm, which efficiently deploys IoT Application Modules in the composite
    Fog-Cloud Infrastructure. They employed lower-bound searches and compared function
    algorithms to find an eligible network node in the Fog and cloud. The Module Mapping
    algorithm returned a map with nodes, which are appropriate for completing the
    computation operation. If the application requires faster processing, the application
    will be deployed close to the source device. However, the work considered CPU,
    RAM, and bandwidth to find the best resources. In such a case, the cloud resource
    will always be the best resource, so it will be necessary to consider other parameters
    such as response time and availability of the specified resources. Yin et al.
    [52] studied a Fog-assisted big data streaming scenario, where Fog devices are
    responsible for preprocessing raw data for applications hosted in the cloud using
    the unused resources of Fog devices. In their work, the software-defined network
    (SDN) controller continuously adjusted the volume of data to be sent to the Fog
    device for pre-processing. The collaborative computation problem was defined as
    a social welfare maximization problem and a hybrid alternating direction method
    of multiplier (H-ADMM) algorithm was proposed to minimize computation burden via
    the dynamic distribution of Fog devices, cloud, and SDN using message exchanging.
    The formulation of social welfare maximization problem determined the size of
    data that will be assigned to a Fog device. During the formulation, loss of information
    value by preprocessing and the operation cost of the Fog and cloud were considered.
    The work completely depended on the cloud for post-processing, but pre- and post-processing
    could have been done in the Fog to support time-sensitive real-time applications.
    Aazam et al. [106] proposed a dynamic resource estimation algorithm by integrating
    the historical record of cloud service customer (CSC) in a Fog environment based
    on the relinquish probability. The minimum relinquish probability value is 0.1
    and this value will be increased based on the history of the user. However, for
    fair resource estimation, the relinquish probability will be 0.3 for new customers.
    For existing and returning customers, the characteristics of the customer are
    known, so the probability value can be calculated easily. In this way, resource
    underutilization could be minimized and the chances of profit loss will be low.
    2) Resource Allocation and Scheduling for a Fog Environment A resource allocation
    strategy based on priced timed Petri nets (PTPNs) was proposed by Ni et al. [107]
    for Fog computing. The main idea of this work is that the user can choose the
    satisfying resources autonomously from a pre-allocated resource group. With credibility
    evaluation for both users and Fog infrastructure, their proposed strategy comprehensively
    considers the cost for time and price to complete the tasks. The user that has
    a high credit limit will be able to allocate highly reliable resources to complete
    their tasks. Due to the dynamic nature of creditability of users and resources,
    there will be some deviation in calculating them properly. To maintain QoS, the
    resources will be ordered according to their processing capacity and divided into
    several groups. Moreover, users with similar credibility will be assigned to several
    groups. Pooranian et al. [108] proposed a simple algorithm to find an optimal
    solution for resource allocation. They considered the problem as a bin packing
    penalty aware problem where servers are bins and VMs are the pack. Based on idle
    energy, maximum frequency, and maximum energy, each server will be palatalized
    and rewarded. The method will calculate how many VMs could be allocated in t time
    slot on a server. The VMs will be served based on their frequency and time limitations.
    As a consequence of penalty, a server will be punished in the form of being banned
    from use for a few iterations. Once the server passes the iteration freeze, it
    will return to the stream to perform further computation. The penalty and reward
    methods are applied to minimize exponentially increasing energy consumption. Sun
    and Zhang [63] proposed a crowd-funding algorithm for a Fog environment, integrating
    idle resources in the local network. An incentive mechanism was used to encourage
    resource owners to participate in the computation and enthusiastically perform
    their tasks. Through the comprehensive reward and punishment mechanism, it is
    ensured that the participant will positively perform the tasks. This work is similar
    to the above-described literature proposed by Pooranian et al. [108]. However,
    in this case, the reward and punishment go to the participant rather than the
    physical server. 3) Summary of Resource Allocation and Scheduling in Fog Based
    on the related research on resource allocation and scheduling in the Fog, a summary
    is presented in Table 5. From this table, we can see that most of the researchers
    have focused on resource allocation in the Fog. More research works are therefore
    required to investigate resource sharing and workload allocation. Also, further
    investigation is needed to address energy-efficiency, load balancing, SLA, and
    QoS in the Fog. We identified two major issues in Fog computing research. Firstly,
    researchers tend to use a synthetic workload to validate their methods and algorithms.
    Secondly, most of the researchers used cloud-based simulations, which are not
    that convincing because the Fog is more heterogeneous and dynamic in nature. Thus,
    further investigation into workload generation and simulations in the Fog need
    to be undertaken. TABLE 5 Summary of Resource Allocation and Scheduling Research
    in Fog B. Fault Tolerance in Fog Computing The Fog computing paradigm is a highly
    distributed heterogeneous platform where the probability of device failure is
    very high compared to the cloud. Since the Fog is evolving, no study has yet been
    done on fault tolerance in Fog computing. However, fault tolerance has been mostly
    studied in the cloud computing paradigm. Often, fault tolerance is measured by
    availability. In the cloud, faults are handled by proactive fault tolerance and
    reactive fault tolerance techniques at either the workflow level or task level.
    Reactive fault tolerance techniques are used to reduce the impact of failures
    on a system when the failures have actually occurred. Techniques based on this
    policy are job migration, checkpoint/restart, replication, rollback and recovery,
    task resubmission, user-defined exception handling, and workflow rescue. Proactive
    fault tolerance predicts the faults pro-actively and replaces the suspected components
    with other working components; thus, avoiding recovery from faults and errors.
    Proactive Fault Tolerance uses self-healing, preemptive migration, and software
    rejuvenation, which are the few proactive fault tolerance techniques in the cloud.
    According to Sharma et al. [110], the causes of failure in the cloud varies, and
    include software and hardware failure, service failure, overflow failure, power
    outage, outdated systems, network failure, cyber attacks, and human errors. It
    is crucial to handle faults in Fog computing for which the fault needs to be considered
    at every step, not only for processing but also for the transmit-and-receive process
    [111]. In this section, we discuss some existing research works on fault tolerance
    in cloud computing. We specifically focus on resource and task failure mechanisms.
    Then, we summarize the existing works and present a research direction for failure
    handling in Fog computing. Jiang and Hsu [112] proposed a two-level standby design
    for handling server failure in the cloud system. In their proposed system, cold
    and warm standby of the system is made available. Once any server fails, the warm
    standby system will replace the failed server and the failed server will be sent
    to the repair house. After repairing, the system will be placed in the cold standby
    group. The systems in the cold standby group are in a completely switched off
    mode. The work proposed a model to determine the necessary number of cold and
    warm standby systems in the cloud. However, this type of hardware failure handling
    is not suitable for the Fog because most of the time Fog computing devices will
    not be under the property of the Fog provider. Hence, task migration is the best
    solution for hardware failure and this should be reactive in most cases, except
    where the Fog device belongs to the provider. Latiff et al. [113] proposed a cloud-scheduling
    scheme based on a check-pointed league championship algorithm. They employed a
    task migration method for independent task execution failure. In their proposed
    method, the system state will be saved periodically by check-pointing, so the
    task need not start from the beginning once it fails. When the task fails, it
    will be assigned to an underloaded VM and the league championship algorithm will
    be employed to schedule the failed tasks. Wu et al. [114] proposed a fault tolerance
    technique using migration to the cloud. The failure handling method is proactive,
    which always monitors the host and continuously tries to predict the chances of
    failure. If the prediction becomes true, the system will look up other available
    resources and then migration will be performed. The proposed method will monitor
    CPU temperature, memory usage, and CPU fan speed, etc. To employ such a technique
    in Fog computing, further investigation is needed because the types of device
    in Fog are diverse. A combined method of check-pointing and migration-based proactive
    failure handling was proposed by Egwutuoha et al. [115] for HPC and cloud. In
    the proposed method, the authors used a Lm-sensors open source software tool for
    computer health monitoring. From the monitoring data, they defined rule-based
    monitoring depending on temperature, fan speed, voltage, and processor utilization
    to predict failure. The rules are denoted as 1, 2, and 3, representing normal,
    warning, and critical state, respectively. They employed three different policies
    for migration. The first depends on the necessity lease additional node. The second
    removes the node, which is unhealthy based on the state. In the third, the critical
    state publishes to the head node. Finally, the system administrator is notified
    for further action. This type of approach might increase the overhead in the Fog;
    however, further exploration is essential. A recent study shows that proactive
    fault tolerance is the best solution for the cloud compared to redundant solutions
    [88]. However, failure prediction accuracy is the key factor for these kinds of
    solutions. Their work considered software, hardware, and unstable behavior to
    predict the failure of the infrastructure. More specifically, they defined failure
    based on an error formula err=(ActualTime−PredictedTime)/ActualTime×100% , which
    was derived from [118] and [119]. A combination of the proactive and reactive
    method was applied by Gao et al. [118] to handle task failure in the cloud environment.
    The crash detection method and replication factor were proposed in this work to
    handle failures. Table 6 shows a summary of the investigated literature on fault
    tolerance in the cloud. TABLE 6 Summary of Investigated Fault Tolerance Literature
    in Cloud Because of its unstable nature of failure and heterogeneous characteristics,
    the hybrid failure handling method is more appropriate for the Fog computing environment.
    C. Simulation Tools for Fog Computing Simulation and modeling in Fog computing
    are still in their infancy. However, a few research works have been done on Fog
    computing simulation, which are focused on some specific aspect of Fog computing.
    Aazam and Huh [54] focused on resource prediction and pricing in Fog computing.
    The Proposed Fog-based resource management model is able to estimate the required
    resources based on the probability of user behavior of future resource use. Validation
    and performance evaluation was done using simulation. However, they did not consider
    service heterogeneity, QoS, or device mobility factors. Another work proposed
    by Dastjerdi et al. [4] focused on dag of the query for incident detection in
    a smart city use case. Both of these works used CloudSim [119] to validate their
    method along with an experimental evaluation. The first toolkit for Fog simulation
    was developed by Gupta et al. [120], known as iFogSim. The toolkit is used for
    the simulation and modeling of IoT resource management techniques in the Fog and
    edge computing paradigms. The most challenging problem is the design of resource
    management techniques, which determine analytic application distribution among
    edge devices, which will improve the throughput and reduce latency. The proposed
    simulator is capable of measuring the impact of resource management techniques
    in terms of network congestion, latency, cost, and energy consumption. The simulator
    was validated using two use cases and the authors also proposed a Fog computing
    environment architecture. Challenges in Fog computing deployment are include incorporating
    Fog with Emerging Technologies such as 5G Technologies [121], Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV), and Software-defined Networking (SDN). In this case, a simulator
    with container, SDN, and NFV support is crucial. Table 7 presents the key features
    of these two simulators that are mostly used by various researchers for Fog computing
    simulation. These two simulation tools did not focus on network parameters such
    as bandwidth distribution of the link and round-trip delay of the various media.
    These two parameters heavily affect the simulation results where minimization
    of latency is the key goal in a Fog computing environment. Secondly, both tools
    did not consider container-based virtualization. In a Fog computing environment,
    there are many devices that will participate in computation, where hypervisor-based
    virtualization is nearly impossible to implement due to the lower memory and processing
    power of these devices. TABLE 7 Simulation Tools Used for Fog Simulation and Their
    Key Features D. Fog-Based Micro Services A microservice is an independent process
    and Software-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that interacts by message passing. The
    SOA of microservice does not hinder or favor any specific programming model. It
    provides design and implementation guidelines for distributed applications to
    partition each component independently. Each of the components addresses a specific
    functionality. The functionality of the components can be accessed by message
    passing and is possible to implement in any mainstream programming language internally.
    In this way, this principle helps developers and project managers to develop each
    module independently and test it with a few related functions. Some microservices,
    also known as high-level microservices, are mainly responsible for coordination
    with other microservices [124]. The organizational approach of microservices accelerates
    the development cycle, nourishes ownership, encourages innovation, improves scalability,
    and enhances the maintainability of software applications. Using this approach,
    software becomes a small independent service and interacts over unambiguous APIs.
    These services are preserved via self-contained small teams [125]. The agility
    and independent distributed nature of microservice deployment makes it a good
    solution for Fog-based IoT application development. Independent processes and
    interaction via message passing features has made microservices more convenient
    for IoT applications. In the Fog, there is a limitation of resources, so developing
    microservices in the Fog will minimize the growing complexity of the big system
    by dividing it into a set of small independent services. Microservice is taking
    modularity to a subsequent level by incorporating high cohesion and loose coupling
    of distributed systems. 1) Current Research Aspects of Microservice Recently,
    microservice-based applications have started gaining popularity [124]. Fog-based
    microservices have not been investigated extensively; hence, it is an open research
    area. However, some research works have been done in this emerging research area,
    with most of the efforts being related to IoT. Butzin et al. [126] investigated
    the use of microservices in IoT and claimed that the architectural goal of IoT
    and microservices are similar. However, they actually have different features
    in terms of various aspects. First of all, microservice has a self-containment
    feature where all dependencies and libraries are packed with the application in
    a single image. On the other hand, for IoT, all libraries are not generally wrapped
    with the application. However, both use similar types of virtualization and web
    protocols. Microservice also has a continuous integration and delivery feature
    while in IoT these are not available or only partly exist. Vresk and Čavrak [127]
    proposed a microservice-based middleware for IoT to support device heterogeneity,
    various communication protocols, and services. They presented a data model and
    address model for microservice-based IoT. Brito et al. [128] proposed a service
    orchestration architecture for Fog using microservices. The authors defined the
    resource manager as a microservice. Khazaei et al. [129] proposed a generic programmable
    self-managing microservice-based platform for IoT. In the platform, microservices
    will exist in all layers in a cascading manner and an autonomic management system
    will scale the microservice. A similar type of IoT framework was proposed by Sun
    et al. [130]. In their architecture of nine components, all are microservices
    except for the core service. The work proved that microservices are far better
    than the monolithic approach in terms of scalability, flexibility, and platform
    independence. However, still, microservice-based IoT architecture suffers from
    various issues such as faults in the network, network delay, message serialization,
    cooperative transaction processing, and other distributed computing scenarios.
    Li et al. [131] proposed a cooperative-based model specifically for smart sensing
    devices; it is possible to enhance the performance of such a service by undertaking
    a micro-service based concept. Krivic et al. [132] proposed a management solution
    for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) device communication in an IoT system using collaborative
    microservice. They argued that microservices could act as the agent in an agent-based
    system since each microservice is responsible for performing a specific task and
    acts collaboratively to achieve the system goal. Container-based virtualization
    is the best solution for deploying microservices since the container supports
    OS virtualization and packs all dependencies in a single image. A container is
    able to manage physical hardware resource needed by an application with its OS
    kernel utilities [133]. 2) Microservices and IoT Applications Many research works
    have suggested Fog-based processing for IoT applications in smart transportation
    systems [96]–[98], Augmented and Virtual Reality [99], [134], [135], and healthcare
    [26], [136], [137]. Fog computing is also suitable for video streaming, smart
    homes, smart cities, and CDN. The common characteristics of these applications
    are time-sensitiveness, which make Fog computing a promising emerging computing
    paradigm. The main drawback of the Fog, however, is resource limitation and failure.
    Thus, using microservices for Fog-based IoT applications will minimize these drawbacks.
    Microservices are standalone, lightweight, and easily deliverable. To mitigate
    resource limitation, the microservice-based container is the best solution so
    far. In the same way, it will also minimize the cost of failure by deploying the
    application immediately. Many open research issues can be addressed by implementing
    Fog-based micro services; these include service management, scheduling, monitoring,
    fault tolerance, security, and privacy. E. Fog Based Mobile Computing The number
    of smartphone and mobile device users in urban areas as well as in rural areas
    is increasing day by day. As a result, mobile users are now requesting high-volume
    content collaboratively. Providing service for all requested contents in an area
    where mobile users are densely populated is a really challenging task for service
    providers [138]. The high number of concurrent content requests will only make
    the situation worse. One of the best solutions to cope with this problem is to
    offload content near the users, so that the users could get better service. This
    content offloading process can be supported by mobile Fog computing. In mobile
    Fog computing, content will be offloaded to the Fog device, which is located closer
    to the users. However, content management in Fog nodes is a current research issue.
    Depending on the demand of the contents, offloading should be distributed on the
    Fog nodes. Constant monitoring and efficient cache management is crucial to deal
    with resource-limited Fog nodes. A few research works have been done on mobile
    Fog computing. This section chronologically discusses the research works that
    have been done in this particular research area in the past couple of years. Hong
    et al. [94] proposed a high-level programming model that supports large-scale
    geospatially distributed time-sensitive applications. The proposed Mobile Fog
    programming model has two design goals. The initial goal is to provide a simplified
    application development for an enormous number of heterogenous devices, which
    are distributed in a wide area. The next goal is the dynamic scaling of resources
    based on resource demand. They developed an API for their programming model and
    evaluated it using two application models: vehicle tracking using a camera and
    traffic monitoring using a Mobility-driven distributed Complex Event Processing
    (MCEP) system. However, they did not focus on process placement or process migration.
    Shi et al. [139] proposed a P2P inspired communication model between the mobile
    device cloud and mobile nodes to share resources and computation task among mobile
    devices. In their work, they utilized a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    for implementing microservices. This work introduced the M2M approach in Fog computing
    while the classical Fog is actually hierarchy based. Content offloading in the
    mobile Fog was investigated by Khan et al. [138]. They defined mobile Fog as co-located
    self-organizing mobile nodes, which offer distributed resources at the edge. The
    aim of this work was to collaborate nodes for content caching, which will maximize
    the availability of the content and minimize operational cost. The proposed coalition
    game helps find the best co-located candidates near the users for sharing storage
    and self-organizing. Wang et al. [140] proposed a three-layer hierarchy framework
    using a Fog structure to bridge the communication between WSNs and the cloud.
    They designed a routing algorithm for bridging communication by considering the
    number of hops and energy consumption. They defined the Fog node as a sink, which
    will transfer data from sensor to the cloud. The proposed framework consists of
    routing layer, Fog layer, and sink layer. In the Fog layer, a sink acts as the
    Fog nodes as well to minimize transmission delay. However, there is a lack of
    security and privacy concern being addressed in mobile Fog computing. Roman et
    al. [141] addressed security and privacy for all edge-level computing. This included
    a usual thread in a network system mobile Fog that requires extra measures of
    authentication, trust, access control, protocol, and network security. SECTION
    IX. Open Issues and Future Research Directions A. Infrastructure-Related Issues
    The Fog is an evolving technology, expanding in such a way that it needs to reach
    market adoption to support all kinds of time-sensitive applications. The Fog has
    become an enactment of research efforts by various academies and industries. One
    of the key initiatives is the Open Fog Consortium (OpenFog), which was founded
    by the ARM, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Princeton University in November
    2015 [31]. Foxconn, General Electric, Hitachi, Sakura Internet, ShanghaiTech University,
    and ZTE are the contributing members of this nonprofit consortium. They are accelerating
    digital innovation with the blending of 5G wireless technology, IoT, and embedded
    AI by providing open interoperable architecture. However, many open challenges
    exist for this sprout-level computing paradigm. In this section, we discuss the
    research challenges and address the future directions for Fog computing research.
    Figure 10 shows some important research issues in Fog computing. FIGURE 10. Fog
    computing research issues. Show All 1) Deployment Issues From the deployment viewpoint,
    OpenFog is defined as an N-tier environment. However, the excessive increase in
    number of levels in the Fog layer might cause latency problems in the newly emerging
    Fog computing paradigm. Therefore, the number of tiers based on the use case must
    be determined. Deployment decisions will be undertaken based on requirements such
    as type and amount of task that will be done by each tier, total number of sensors,
    Fog device capability, in between the latency and reliability of Fog devices.
    Still, it is necessary to investigate how these requirements will be fulfilled.
    Application and resource scaling is also an important issue during deployment.
    Based on the requirement of the application and resource, scaling and shrinking
    without interrupting current services could be undertaken. In this regard, placement
    might also affect Fog deployment. 2) Standard Architecture for Fog Computing Up
    until now, there has been no defined standard architecture for Fog computing.
    The OpenFog consortium released two versions of the Fog architecture in February
    2016 [61] and February 2017 [142]. Their first draft was an initial overview of
    the Fog architecture. In their second draft, the Fog architecture was discussed
    in more detail. In their proposed architecture, they considered many key aspects
    of Fog architecture including performance, manageability, security, data analytics,
    and control. However, further research needs to be undertaken to explore and gain
    deeper insight into each layer with proper validation. 3) Interoperability and
    Federation of Fog Because of the Fog, users are able to process their request
    near them, which will minimize latency. However, what will happen if an increasing
    number of multiple latency-aware applications requests are sent in one shot to
    the Fog device and the Fog device is unable to handle that many requests? Will
    it be passed to the cloud for processing? If it is passed to the cloud, then latency
    requirements will not be satisfied. Thus, interoperability and federation among
    Fog clusters and Fog servers are necessary. Hence, if a Fog device is fully utilized,
    it will send requests to peer Fog devices or Fog servers for processing instead
    of sending them to the cloud. B. Platform-Related Issues 1) Resource Management
    Resources are most dynamic and heterogeneous in a Fog environment because of the
    diversity of devices and their available resources. All devices known as Fog devices
    are responsible for performing the computation of their own application. For example,
    a computer that relies on office staff to perform some ordinary email and documentation
    works might be a part of the Fog and might also act as a Fog device. In such a
    case, the amount of resources available for Fog computation is dynamic but predictable
    via the analysis of the long-term activity of its resources. This prediction is
    necessary because once the Fog task execution starts, and over a period of time,
    the status of the resources might change due to the request by the application
    for which the device is responsible for. If we compared this to the cloud, it
    is possible to know how much resources are currently available and whether or
    not they are exclusively used for cloud-based application requests. However, the
    Fog aims to use idle resources available on any Fog device with Fog computation
    always taking second priority. Hence, resource allocation and scheduling in the
    Fog is more challenging than traditional resource allocation and scheduling in
    the cloud. 2) Failure Management Fog device failure probability is always high
    because the devices are distributed and the management of Fog devices is not central.
    Hence, the devices could fail for many reasons; this could be due to hardware
    failure, software failure, or because of user activity. Besides these problems,
    some other reasons include connectivity, mobility, and power source, which also
    play a big role. Most of the devices in a Fog environment might be connected via
    wireless connections; it is obvious that wireless connections are not always reliable.
    The majority of devices that are connected via wireless are mobile, so these devices
    could change location to different clusters frequently. One other characteristic
    of these devices is that they are battery powered and might fail anytime. Hence,
    dealing with the complex nature of failure is very difficult. Also, it is necessary
    to ensure SLA by defining QoS parameters. So, the question is: What are the SLAs
    and how should they be defined? Also: What QoS parameters must be considered,
    so that the consumer and providers can retain a win-win situation? 3) Communication
    Between Different Layers The Fog should ensure uninterrupted connection with the
    devices to ensure application requirements of time-sensitive applications are
    met. If the application were to control an autonomous car or drone and if it were
    responsible for emergency surveillance, then failure in connectivity might cause
    serious harm. Even if connectivity to the cloud fails, the Fog still needs to
    ensure continuous connectivity. Thus, cross-layer connectivity among IoT devices,
    Fog, and cloud are of the utmost importance. The connection type and protocols
    used by IoT devices and Fog devices might be different. Therefore, how these issues
    will be handled is an important research issue. 4) User Participation Management
    Efficient Fog service management depends on the participation of users in Fog
    computation. However, how can user participation be managed? How do we deploy
    minimum resources in the case where no one wants to participate? We need to address
    these problems clearly with a feasible solution. One of the methods to increase
    user participation is through incentive and reward-based policies. With such policies,
    any user that participates in Fog computation will benefit. Even a user, who participates
    to complete his own request, will be rewarded by getting some discount based on
    his participation. However, this area needs to be addressed because the overall
    success of Fog computation depends on the participation of Fog devices, which
    are owned by various people and organizations. 5) Security and Privacy Fog devices
    are managed by different operators based on their location and ownership. Nobody
    would want to contribute to Fog computation if device control were compromised.
    Thus, how the security of a participant device will be maintained if the device
    were to take part in Fog computation is a big question. Another key security issue
    for this scenario is participant user data security. A participant device might
    have critical information. How will safety be guaranteed in such a case? On the
    other hand, critical data might be processed in a device, which is owned by a
    black hat hacker. How will safety and privacy be ensured then? Security issues
    also exist during cross-layer communication. Similar to the distributed nature
    of the Fog, security management should also be distributed, which will not be
    dependent on any central component. C. Application-Related Issues 1) Application
    Service Management Billions of IoT devices will be handled by the Fog paradigm,
    which will handle time-sensitive and time-insensitive applications. The degree
    of service, availability, and quality is most diverse in the Fog. Hence, service
    management is a typical issue for the entire Fog realm. Services should be microservice-based,
    so that agility and management issues can be handled properly. Further research
    is necessary to explore the possibility of Fog-based solutions. 2) Application
    Modeling Modeling Fog applications is complex because the application should collect
    data from different IoT devices, which use different protocols and sets of codes.
    Thus, it is challenging to model generic applications, which can be deployed with
    minimal effort. To solve this issue, a standard form of communication protocol
    is necessary, so that the modeled application can communicate and work with different
    types of IoT devices. SECTION X. Conclusion The Fog computing paradigm is currently
    in its infancy, so an extensive investigation is required for this emerging technology.
    In this survey, we presented and discussed the overview, architecture, state-of-the-art
    and other similar technologies in Fog computing. Based on the literature, we derived
    a taxonomy for Fog computing by analyzing the requirement of Fog infrastructure,
    platform, and applications. We also covered resource allocation and scheduling,
    fault tolerance, simulation tools, and microservices in Fog computing. Finally,
    we presented some challenging and open research issues. We strongly believe that
    this comprehensive survey will bring to light IoT application execution for a
    Fog computing environment as well as point towards the direction for current and
    future research in this rapidly growing research area. In this way, this computing
    paradigm, which is still immature, will be propelled towards achieving market
    adoption in the near future. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors would like to sincerely

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: The immense increase in multimedia-on-demand traffic
    that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted the vision of
    the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to Multimedia Internet of Things (M-IoT).
    IoT devices are constrained in terms of energy, computing, size, and storage memory.
    Delay-sensitive and bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications over constrained
    IoT networks require revision of IoT architecture for M-IoT. This paper provides
    a comprehensive survey of M-IoT with an emphasis on architecture, protocols, and
    applications. This article starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT.
    Then, we discuss the issues considering the characteristics of multimedia and
    provide a summary of related M-IoT architectures. Various multimedia applications
    supported by IoT are surveyed, and numerous use cases related to road traffic
    management, security, industry, and health are illustrated to show how different
    M-IoT applications are revolutionizing human life. We explore the importance of
    Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) for multimedia transmission
    over IoT. Moreover, we explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing
    and present the relationship between the M-IoT and emerging technologies including
    event processing, feature extraction, cloud computing, Fog/Edge computing and
    Software-Defined-Networks (SDNs). We also present the need for better routing
    and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols for M-IoT. Finally, we
    present a detailed discussion on the open research issues and several potential
    research areas related to emerging multimedia communication in IoT. Topic: Mobile

    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,
    “information security”, “information transparency”, “agriculture”, “agricultural”,
    “agribusiness”, “agriculture safety”, “agriculture security”, “agriculture traceability”,

    “food value chain management”, “agriculture value chain management”, “agri-food
    value chain management”, “agricultural trade” Databases ScienceDirect, Web of

    “information transparency”) AND (“agriculture” OR “agricultural” OR “agribusiness”

    OR “food value chain management” OR “agriculture value chain management” OR “agri-food
    value chain management” OR “agriculture trade”) 3.3. Study selection and evaluation
    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    studies. Note: Node size depends on the quantity of connected components. From
    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value

    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. Main challenges Possible solutions

    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.

    With the deep combination of both modern information technology and traditional
    agriculture, the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture,
    has come. Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and
    automation. However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development
    of agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three
    typical development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility
    agriculture, and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and
    11 key applications are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies
    and applications, 6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access
    control, privacy-preserving, blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography
    and key management, physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems)
    are summarized and discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture
    are analyzed and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2)
    information technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural
    equipment as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments
    based on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate
    that agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more
    technologies (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable
    energy management system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented
    reality, and cyber security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the
    future research directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry
    in the world, and it plays an important role in social stability and economic
    development [1]. Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion
    and the limited grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number
    of studies on smart agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both
    the improvement in productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress
    of science and technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is
    used to help readers understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture
    development (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). • Agriculture 1.0: the
    traditional agricultural era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human
    and animal resources, the main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of
    operation. • Agriculture 2.0: the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century),
    the main issue was the inefficient use of resources. • Agriculture 3.0: the era
    of high-speed development of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the
    main issue was the low level of intelligence. • Agriculture 4.0: the era of smart
    agriculture (which is characterized by unmanned operations, begin at 2017) is
    mainly marked by the use of modern information technology to both serve agriculture
    and develop it intelligently. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    diversity of Internet-connected devices raises many challenges for the traditional
    network architecture, which is not designed to support a high level of scalability,
    real-time data delivery and mobility. To address these issues, in this paper we
    present a new model of Internet of Things architecture which combines benefits
    of two emerging technologies: software-defined networking and Fog computing. Software-defined
    networking implies a logically centralized network control plane, which allows
    implementation of sophisticated mechanisms for traffic control and resource management.
    On the other hand, Fog computing enables some data to be analysed and managed
    at the network edge, thus providing support for applications that require very
    low and predictable latency. In the paper, we give detailed insight into the system
    structure and functionality of its main components. We also discuss the benefits
    of the proposed architecture and its potential services. Similar content being

    1 Introduction Advances in wireless communications and micro-electro-mechanical
    systems (MEMS) have enabled the rapid evolution of smart devices connected to
    the Internet. This evolution inspired the idea about the Internet of Things (IoT)—a
    large-scale cognitive system in which wide variety of “things” could contribute.
    The definition of “thing” is very flexible, and may refer to: intelligent machines,
    drones, self-driving cars, sensor nodes measuring parameters such as temperature
    and humidity, actuators that turn on and off devices or make adjustments in real
    time, and much more. Thus, the exponential increase in the volume and variety
    of data is expected, creating a significant burden for the Internet architecture
    [1]. Adding more resources to provide enough capacity cannot be economically justified
    in the long-run. The major scale issue is not the volume of traffic, but the type
    and cadence of data delivery. IoT devices are often configured to send regular
    updates throughout the day, which may cause a tsunami of connections and data
    at periodic intervals. Regular surges of traffic may surpass baseline or average
    traffic by a significant multiple of existing traffic patterns, so high level
    of resource over-provisioning could be required for stable operation. To avoid
    this, service providers need mechanisms that can satisfy the bandwidth demand
    of IoT applications by efficiently utilizing the existing infrastructure. That
    is hard to achieve with distributed control plane in traditional network architectures,
    since a global view of the network state is lacking. Another challenge is low-latency
    handling of time-critical tasks such as analysis and decision-making. For example,
    network latency could badly affect traffic management application which requires
    real-time detection of the congested sites. On the other hand, emerging augmented
    reality applications (e.g. Google Glass, Sony SmartEyeGlass and Microsoft HoloLens)
    have to process real-time video, voice and sensor measurements in order to finally
    output informational content on displays [2]. Without almost deterministic response
    time utility, adoption of this technology is questionable. In general, because
    of a loosely controlled nature of the Internet many QoS (Quality of Service) issues
    are still unresolved. In this paper, we propose the use of SDN (Software Defined
    Networking [3]) to alleviate resource contentions in IoT environment and improve
    overall IoT performance. SDN is a relatively new paradigm for communication networks,
    that implies separation of the forwarding and the control functions. Network intelligence
    is moved to logically centralized SDN controller, which maintains a global view
    of the network, interacts with data-plane devices and provides a programming interface
    for network management applications. The potential of this concept reflects in
    the fact that traffic engineering and resource management can be performed more
    efficiently in centralized system having insight into applications’ requirements
    and all resources available. To address the applications that require mobility
    support and low-delay, the proposed IoT architecture integrates SDN with Fog computing
    [4]. Although the benefits of the both technologies have been widely recognized
    within the research community, there are still many challenges that hinder widespread
    acceptance of them. Therefore, this paper targets to explain how SDN and Fog computing
    could be efficiently combined together to compensate each other deficiencies.
    In particular, the proposed IoT architecture aims to solve the problem of Fog
    orchestration with SDN, as well as scalability issues of SDN with Fog computing.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides brief background
    on traditional IoT architecture and related challenges. Section 3 introduces the
    basic ideas of SDN and Fog computing and then describes the components and operation
    model of the proposed architecture. A few use cases that would especially benefit
    from the proposed architecture are discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes the
    paper. 2 IoT: Current State and Challenges The IoT paradigm is based on various
    kinds of smart devices with communication and networking capabilities, embedded
    in the environment around us. According to CISCO forecasts the number of Internet-connected
    devices overtook the human population in 2010, and will be about 50 billion by
    2020 [5]. Although these devices mostly have low bandwidth demands, the overall
    result is enormous amount of data which have to be stored, processed and presented
    in a seamless, efficient, and easily interpretable form [6]. Figure 1 illustrates
    the common organization of today’s IoT architecture from a high level perspective.
    Four main components involved are: sensing devices (things), the local communication
    network, the Internet Cloud and back-end IoT applications. Sensing devices gather
    data from the physical environment. These data are later used by IoT applications
    (e.g. smart transportation, healthcare, precision agriculture, video surveillance,
    etc.) to provide a desirable service to end customers. Since IoT devices are in
    general characterized by very limited memory and computational resources, IoT
    application usually takes advantage of services offered by the Cloud for data
    storage and processing. To reach the Cloud, sensing devices rely on different
    communication technologies. Those more powerful connect directly to cellular network
    (3G or 4G), or use Wi-Fi/Ethernet connectivity to the Internet gateway. However,
    these communication models require a fair amount of power that myriad devices
    cannot afford (e.g. battery operated devices). For the short range communication
    between energy-deficient devices, some other options are more convenient, such
    as Bluetooth, ZigBee or NFC (Near-Field Communication). Once the raw data generated
    by one or more sensing sources are appropriately processed in the Cloud, the useful
    information are finally delivered to the end user. That may be commercial or an
    industrial user, or another device in M2M (Machine-to-Machine) workflow. Fig.
    1 Traditional IoT architecture Full size image Cloud offers scalable and cost
    effective solution to deal with data produced by IoT. Its virtually unlimited
    resources compensate technological limitation of IoT devices (e.g. storage, processing
    and energy) and enable analysis of unprecedented complexity [7]. Also, “pay-as-you-go”
    Cloud computing model is a more convenient alternative to owning and managing
    private data centres (DCs) if consider deployment and operational expenditures.
    However, existing Cloud services are originally designed for classic Web applications,
    which are not significantly affected by the distance between the edge devices
    and DCs. On the other side, many emerging IoT applications require real-time interaction
    and mobility support (e.g. smart traffic lights and target tracking systems),
    which makes network latency an important limiting factor. Latency introduced in
    the network is not only a consequence of long distance between IoT devices and
    the Cloud. It is also caused by queuing delay, which is non-negligible on the
    congested links. The impact of queuing delay could be reduced if traffic load
    is evenly distributed over the network. Unfortunately, dynamic routing is considered
    rather risky than beneficial in existing Internet architecture characterized by
    the distributed control plane [8]. Moreover, the simple shortest path routing
    model is still dominantly deployed. Dedicated mechanisms for connectivity control
    are also lacking. This must be resolved in order to fully exploit the opportunities
    offered by heterogeneous access networks in IoT environments. 3 SDN-Based Model
    of IoT System In order to address previously discussed challenges, in this Section
    we propose a new model of IoT architecture based on two emerging technologies:
    SDN and Fog computing. We will briefly present basic ideas of these networking
    paradigms, and then explain how they are combined together and envisioned to operate
    in the proposed system model. 3.1 Software Defined Networking In traditional telecommunications
    networks the control and the data plane are implemented in each networking device.
    The control plane carries signalling traffic, performs route calculation, system
    configuration and management. It contains all the logic that controls the behaviour
    of the network. On the other hand, the data plane is focused only on the transport
    of packets towards their next destination. The network itself basically could
    be seen as a distributed entity that connects diverse independent and autonomous
    devices. Network management is done at very low level, and once forwarding policy
    is defined, the only way to make an adjustment to the policy is via manual configuration
    of the devices. This limits ability to introduce new services in the network or
    to adapt the network behaviour to varying application requirements and load condition
    [9, 10]. Novelty introduced with SDN is clear separation of the control and the
    data plane. SDN control plane is placed on a logically centralized controller,
    which maintains a global view of the network, interacts with simple forwarding
    devices and provides a programming interface for network management applications
    (Fig. 2). In this way, SDN allows network managers to configure and optimize network
    resources dynamically via automated programs [3]. The communication between SDN
    controller and the data plane devices is commonly achieved via OpenFlow protocol
    [11]. The controller pro-actively or reactively instructs the data plane devices
    (OpenFlow switches) how to identify and treat different traffic flows in the network.
    When OpenFlow switch receives the instructions for specific traffic flow, it is
    able to handle packets belonging to the flow without further interaction with
    the controller until validation time for the instructions expires. Note that SDN/OpenFlow
    architecture described above is originally designed for DC and WAN (Wide Area
    Network) networks. However, the need for similar technology in 5G mobile networks
    has been widely recognized by the research communities [9, 12, 13]. Fig. 2 SDN
    architecture Full size image 3.2 Fog Computing Fog computing is an emerging technology
    that brings data processing, storage and analytics closer to the network edge.
    It has many mechanisms and attributes in common with Cloud computing, however,
    Fog can be distinguished from Cloud by its proximity to end-users, the dense geographical
    distribution and its support for mobility [4]. Figure 3 illustrates the position
    of Fog computing in IoT systems. It is obvious that Fog cannot substitute the
    Cloud, but complements its services by introducing a new intermediate layer composed
    of geo-distributed Fog nodes. Each Fog node is highly virtualized platform hosted
    on dedicated computing node equipped with communication interface, or resource-poorer
    device such as set-top box, access point, router, switch, etc. Data collected
    by IoT sensing devices are not send directly to the Cloud server for processing.
    Instead, they are sent to nearby Fog node in order to obtain fast and high-rate
    service. However, Fog node can filter out non-actionable data (e.g. regular sensor
    measurements) and send them to the Cloud for long-term storage and batch analytics.
    The Cloud is a natural place to run global analytics on data collected from widely
    distributed devices over long periods (months, years) [1, 14]. Fig. 3 The role
    of Fog layer in IoT architecture Full size image Fog computing does not only enhance
    QoS (Quality of Service) for a large number of IoT applications, but also may
    significantly reduce bandwidth consumption in the backbone network. Consequently,
    the users could be benefited from the reduced service costs [15]. This vision
    has been recently made possible by Cisco IOx platform, which combines open-source
    Linux and Cisco IOS network operating system together in a single networked device
    (router, switch or IP camera). Linux transforms the underlying device to mini-computer
    that can host third party applications on virtual containers and analyse data
    locally in real time [16]. 3.3 The Proposed System Design This section describes
    a model of IoT architecture which takes advantage of SDN and Fog computing paradigms.
    The proposed solution is inspired by recent works on these topics [1, 17–20].
    However, while each of them is either focused only on one of the technologies
    or considers their application in VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork) networks, we
    analyse the generic IoT scenario where features of both technologies are combined
    together in one integrated system. Figure 4 shows the system structure which involves:
    end devices with multiple wireless communication solutions, SDN controllers, heterogeneous
    Fog infrastructure (virtualized servers, routers, access points, etc.) and Cloud
    in the network core. Since IoT applications may be geospatially distributed, we
    assumed hierarchical deployment of Fog network. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, Fog
    nodes expose a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for application
    deployment and development, resource management and control. These APIs allow
    seamless access to hypervisors, various operating systems and service containers
    on a physical machine [1]. Also, they enable remote monitoring and management
    of physical resources such as CPU, memory and network interfaces. Development
    of IoT applications using hierarchically deployed and heterogeneous Fog resources
    could be simplified by adopting Mobile Fog programming model [20]. Mobile Fog
    runs the same application code on various devices of the heterogeneous Fog infrastructure.
    The application consists of multiple processes that perform different tasks with
    respect to the device capabilities and position in the network hierarchy. For
    example, tasks of large-scale video surveillance application may be organized
    in three levels: motion detection at IP camera, face recognition at edge Fog nodes
    and aggregation of identities at Cloud server [20]. It is assumed that each of
    the devices has information about its geophysical location. Thus, although all
    of them run the same code, each one is aware of its particular tasks. Fig. 4 SDN
    architecture for IoT based on Fog computing Full size image A major challenge
    imposed by Fog concept refers to service orchestration. The orchestration involves
    automated instantiation, replication and migration of service instances on a large
    volume of Fog nodes with a wide range of capabilities. As discussed earlier, many
    IoT applications deal with dynamic workload due to periodic or event-driven data
    delivery models. In an ideal case, applications should be transparently scaled
    at the runtime without resource over-provisioning. In order to achieve that, we
    propose logical centralization of orchestration functionality at SDN controller.
    The design of SDN controller is modified compared to traditional one used in DC
    networks. As illustrated in Figure 5b, its role in IoT system is threefold: 1.
    Fog orchestration. 2. Injection of routing logic into SDN-enabled network elements.
    3. Optimal selection of access points for IoT devices (i.e. radio access network
    management). Fig. 5 Structure of the Fog node (a), SDN controller (b) and wireless
    end device [19] (c) in the proposed architecture Full size image To perform above
    tasks efficiently the controller needs an up-to-date view of the system. For this
    reason, it collects and maintains information about: Features of Fog nodes in
    the controlled domain, such as: available RAM, secondary storage, running Operating
    Systems and software applications [1]. Capabilities, state and interconnectivity
    of the network elements, including: wireless technology of the access points (e.g.
    3G/4G, LTE, Wi-Fi etc.), links capacity and residual bandwidth, the flow table
    content and neighbour list of each network node. Characteristics of the connected
    smart devices, such as: supported radio access technologies and types of services
    the devices are requesting. In order to obtain up-to-date information about topology
    of the ad-hoc connected devices, link layer mechanism in each device could be
    used to periodically broadcast beacon messages for learning neighbour’s information.
    Beside neighbour lists, for the purpose of high-mobile vehicular applications,
    the controller may also store road map of the environment and information regarding
    the position and speed of the vehicles involved [19]. The Fog orchestration is
    performed according to business polices defined by application service providers.
    For example, the policies may specify: requirements in terms of computing and
    memory resources, requirements in term of bandwidth and delay for different classes
    of subscribers, thresholds for load balancing, privacy rules etc. [1]. These policies
    are stored in SDN controllers and the Fog nodes hosting the provider’s application.
    The end-device connects to application process running on the Fog computing instance
    that covers the location of the end-device. If the end-device is mobile and enters
    the new region, it will connect to the new Fog node that runs the same application
    process on the same level of network hierarchy as the previous one. SDN controller
    provides dynamic, policy-based management of Fog services. It can track the moving
    devices and predict their potential destinations in the near future. This enables
    seamless handover to a new Fog node at the network edge. Also, there is a possibility
    that the Fog computing instance located in the new region cannot meet QoS requirements
    of the end-user. In that case, new computing instance needs to be instantiated
    on a platform with the matching capabilities. Procedure of creating a new computing
    instance is far from trivial, because it requires: resource reservation, copying
    of application data, setting-up the instance configuration and dissemination of
    the new flow rules in the network. Therefore, the role of SDN controller is crucial
    to timely detect and react to threat of policy violation based on the up-to-date
    view of the system state. High workload can also trigger dynamic scaling of the
    application if that is specified in the business policy. For example, when a load
    balancing threshold in terms of maximum number of users, connections or CPU load
    is reached, new on-demand Fog instances could be created. To distribute the workload
    over them, SDN controller splits the coverage region of the overloaded application
    process in multiple smaller sub-regions. The number of sub-regions corresponds
    to the number of newly created Fog instances of the same process. Similarly, when
    these nearby processes at the same network hierarchy level become under loaded,
    their coverage regions are merged together into a single coverage area, and all
    the processes except one for the merged coverage are terminated [20]. Beside Fog
    orchestration, SDN controller performs traffic control as OpenFlow controller
    and connectivity management for IoT devices. Since IoT application in large-scale
    network environments (e.g. smart city applications) generate enormous amounts
    of data flows, the SDN control plane needs to be partitioned among multiple physical
    controllers to avoid scalability and reliability implications. As can be seen
    from Fig. 5, single SDN controller covers region with multiple Fog nodes because
    it is placed on a higher level of network hierarchy. The network partitions are
    interconnected by OpenFlow switches to enable exchange of data between controllers.
    This is necessary for scheduling traffic flows between IoT devices located in
    different partitions. For robustness reasons, we assumed that some control tasks
    may be delegated to local SDN agents running on Fog nodes and SDN-enabled IoT
    devices, as proposed in [18]. For example, Fog nodes at the network edge may control
    IoT device to IoT device multi-hop wireless communication in their coverage region
    based on their local knowledge and policy rules obtained from the controller.
    On the other side, the controller calculates the other routes in the system, such
    as inter-region routes and routes towards the other autonomous systems for data
    intended for the Cloud. Note that support for time-critical IoT tasks requires
    flow rules installed in advance, which reduces controller’s efficiency in resource
    allocation. However, granular traffic control offered by OpenFlow can be exploited
    to separate emergency traffic and delay-insensitive traffic. Therefore, the first
    class could be scheduled always with the highest priority over the proactively
    installed routes, while the route calculation and resource reservation for the
    other traffic class could be done in a reactive manner. The edge Fog nodes are
    envisioned to regularly inform the SDN controller about the capabilities and position
    of IoT devices that are being served. In this way, controller can build an entire
    connectivity graph and periodically run optimization algorithms to provide better
    utilization of network resources and enhance QoS. For example, if SDN controller
    discovers that the network load had become unbalanced because proactive routing
    results in traffic focusing on some selected nodes, it can start a rerouting process
    to improve network utility and reduce congestion. In addition to routing optimization,
    the controller is supposed to perform connectivity management on the time-window
    basis. Algorithm for optimal access point selection in multi-network IoT environment
    has been proposed in [22]. Such an algorithm can be implemented on SDN controller
    to perform access point assignment for set of newly joined devices based on: the
    current multi-network capacity in the controlled partition, the supported radio
    access technologies and the types of services the devices are requesting. The
    assignment process is triggered at the end of each time-window, and aims to find
    a set of access points that can satisfy bandwidth requirements of the IoT devices
    and guarantee optimal system performance. If the algorithm outputs the assignment
    configuration different than the existing one, SDN controller starts the suggested
    handover procedures between the heterogeneous access networks. An architecture
    of SDN-enabled sensor node is shown in Fig. 5c. Main component introduced in the
    architecture is a software OpenFlow switch. Application traffic always goes through
    this component before being sent, which allows the control plane elements (i.e.
    Fog nodes at the edge and SDN controllers) to identify the access of traffic flows
    into the network [19]. The number of wireless interfaces on the sensor node depends
    on services for which node is intended. Note that we considered only IP addressed
    sensor nodes as the elements of SDN data-plane. However, there are other solutions
    for implementing SDN in WSN networks as well [23, 24]. Beside SDN module, each
    sensor node runs a daemon process which implements some of the traditional ad-hoc
    routing protocols (e.g. AODV—Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector [25]). Both, the
    SDN control entity and the AODV daemon, have access to the node’s flow table.
    AODV process is activated when no route to the SDN control entity is known. That
    is the case when sensor node joins the network or when control communication is
    lost due to bad conditions on the wireless channel. 4 Use-Cases Rapid evolution
    of the IoT brings a number of use cases of interest that could benefit from the
    concepts of SDN and Fog computing. In this Section we chose some of them to illustrate
    the potential of the proposed system architecture. 4.1 Smart Transportation Smart
    transportation represents one of the markets of the primary importance for IoT.
    The rationale for the adoption of IoT in this field are several, from social to
    economic. Some common services refer to traffic management, safety and infotainment.
    Traffic management services analyse traffic behaviour and events in order to optimize
    overall road capacity, reduce travel time and minimize the ecological footprint
    by smartly routing vehicles and coordinating traffic lights. Safety services aim
    to reduce accidents for pedestrians and vehicle occupants. The infotainment services
    are focused on providing classic IP informative and entertaining applications
    like Web browsing, video streaming, e-mail and social networks [20]. Different
    classes of transportation services often use the same data sources (e.g. sensors
    on the roads, traffic cameras, passing vehicles and so on) and networking infrastructure.
    However, importance of each service is not the same for the end user. Therefore,
    when the network is congested traffic flows should not be treated in the same
    manner. Without mechanisms for service differentiation and ability to provide
    real-time delivery today’s IoT architecture limits efficiency of the existing
    services and hinders implementation of new ones. On the other side, with SDN and
    Fog computing both of the mentioned requirements could be met. We will elaborate
    this on the example of STL (Smart Traffic Light) system. STL systems use a large
    number of distributed sensors to measure distance, speed and direction of vehicles
    and detect the presence of pedestrian and cyclist crossing the street. Collected
    sensor measurements are mainly used for three purposes: (a) accident prevention;
    (b) detection and offloading of congested sites; (c) long-term analysis of the
    system efficiency. These three tasks are significantly different in terms of delay-sensitivity.
    The last one can tolerate delays in data delivery, while the first two require
    immediate or near real-time reaction. If all the measurement data are sent to
    the Cloud for processing, support for real-time services is very questionable.
    When STL application detects risk of vehicle collision with pedestrians and cyclist,
    to be effective, the control system has to send notification to the approaching
    vehicles within milliseconds [1]. The need for fast decision making at the network
    edge (i.e. Fog computing) is strongly emphasized in this scenario, and has been
    discussed in detail in [1]. Beside Fog computing, the presented system model can
    also exploit benefits of SDN to dynamically assign higher priority to some traffic
    flows in emergency situations, and hence guarantee low-latency. Fig. 6 Use-case
    of smart transportation Full size image Support for real-time decision-making
    provided by Fog computing could bring autonomous cars soon in reality. Tesla Motors
    and Google are investing a lot of efforts in developing a software that will allow
    “hands free” operation of the car [26]. These cars will not require human involvement
    in control of the primary driving features such as brakes, acceleration and steering.
    With Fog infrastructure at the network edge, the cars and sensing devices deployed
    along the road will be able to interact in real-time [17]. When it comes to delivery
    of infotainment services in VANET networks, it could be greatly enhanced with
    SDN technology. The most popular infotainment applications include various forms
    of audio/video streaming. Delivery of this kind of data is very challenging not
    only due to strict delay requirements, but also due to high level of mobility
    and topology fluctuations [19]. Based on road map and detailed information about
    the vehicle position, speed and moving direction, SDN controller can make timely
    decisions about deployment of new service instances at the Fog nodes. In this
    way, impact of mobility on application performance could be minimized. On the
    other hand, the proposed system architecture can help in reducing duplication
    of the streaming traffic. For example if blue and red car in Fig. 6 are requesting
    the same data stream, SDN controller has enough knowledge to make optimal routing
    decision, i.e. to use only one traffic flow from the streaming server to the red
    car, and then to serve blue car from the red car. 4.2 Video Surveillance Video
    surveillance is an important component of smart cities. Largely-distributed cameras
    in a city or along the road bring security services on a higher level, providing
    strong sense of assurance to the public. There are two advantages of using the
    proposed IoT architecture for video surveillance. The first is that SDN controller
    can make resource allocation and routing decisions based on QoS requirements.
    Thus, it will always seek for routes that can meet bandwidth requirements of video
    flows. The second advantage is that local, resource rich Fog nodes, can provide
    real-time processing of video frames and send notification to end-user when some
    event is detected. This significantly reduces bandwidth consumption in the network,
    while increases application efficiency (e.g. detection of criminal activity).
    In [21], authors proposed the hierarchical design of Fog application for vehicle
    tracking. Their application is organized in three processes which take place at
    different levels of the network hierarchy. IP camera runs the first process. If
    the camera is capable to perform motion detection, it will not send the video
    to the parent Fog node unless motion is detected. The parent Fog node is placed
    at higher level of network hierarchy, and hence have much wider scope. It runs
    process that identifies vehicles in the video scenes and detects their position
    and licence plates. If a police had issued a search for the detected vehicle,
    information about vehicle location is recorded into database and notification
    is sent to application process at the highest level of hierarchy. However, if
    the video image is not clear enough to enable detection of the licence plate number,
    the Fog node may send pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) command to camera. Interaction with
    PTZ module requires very low latency, which cannot be provided if video processing
    is done at remote Cloud server. 4.3 Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture
    takes advantage of advanced information and communication technologies to address
    today’s agricultural issues such as the need to balance productivity with environmental
    concerns. The applications of this scenario are facilitated by ad-hoc wireless
    sensors and actuator networks (WSANs), deployed to measure/monitor specific parameters
    of the environment and enforce control decisions. The data obtained from sensor
    nodes are used by the Cloud application to make intelligent control decisions
    that should yield better and more crops through optimal application of water,
    pesticides and fertilizers. With Fog node deployed at the network edge, the local
    application instance can process the collected data, control the measurement process
    itself, the stability and the oscillatory behaviors and issue commands to actuators
    (e.g. to irrigation valves) in real-time. The Fog application can also decide
    to reject packets carrying redundant information, and send the aggregated data
    to the Cloud for long-term analysis. Local SDN controller could be run as one
    of the application on the Fog node. This application would be responsible for
    automatic configuring of WSN and optimal management of energy constrained sensor
    nodes with limited communications abilities [27]. Need for processing at the network
    edge has been more pronounced with the recent emergence of UAVs (Unmanned aerial
    vehicles) at farm market. So far, UAVs has been mostly used in agriculture to
    collect sensor data, scan plants for health problems, and locate disease out brakes.
    These information are than used by farmers to provide only the needed pesticide
    or nutrient to each plant. However, modern trends go towards multi-UAV deployment.
    Beside UAVs that perform monitoring of the crops, special types of UAVs are designed
    that can apply pesticides with very high accuracy according to spraying logistic
    [28]. Multiple simultaneously operating UAVs impose the need for centralized coordination
    of the individual tasks. In the proposed IoT architecture Fog node could play
    role of Internet gateway and UAV coordinator in the same time. It could process
    various types of multimedia and scalar data collected by UAVs, recommend optimal
    crop treatment and send control commands to aerial (UAVs robots) and ground actuators.
    5 Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed the architecture for IoT, which relies
    on two emerging technologies: SDN and Fog computing. The proposed architecture
    is designed in the way to support a high level of scalability, real-time data
    delivery and mobility. Fog computing platform is considered as the appropriate
    platform for IoT due to its capability to resolve problems related to latency
    for services that require fast analysis and decision-making. On the other hand,
    SDN introduces logically centralized control plane, which allows the implementation
    of sophisticated mechanisms for traffic control and resource management. Such
    a network design could be of vital importance to address increasing capacity demands
    in IoT environments where an enormous number of Internet-connected devices is
    expected. While the mentioned benefits have been widely recognized by the research
    community, this paper discusses the main challenges that hinder widespread adoption
    of each of the two technologies individually. The proposed IoT architecture addresses
    these challenges by combining SDN and Fog computing together in one system and
    adapting them to each other. In particular, the functionality of Fog orchestration
    is delegated to SDN controller in order to achieve higher efficiency, while SDN
    scalability issue is relaxed by delegating some controller’s tasks to Fog nodes.
    Benefits of using our proposed architecture have been illustrated by several use-cases
    that range from theoretical visions to existing services. Plan for future work
    is to design centralized control logic for orchestration of Fog services and to
    evaluate performance of the proposed solution in the appropriate simulation environment.

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ years, under the impetus of organizations such as Internet Protocol for Smart\
    \ Objects \n(IPSO) Alliance, resource-constrained intelligent goods and sensing\
    \ nodes can access the internet \nthrough the IP protocol and become devices that\
    \ can be directly addressed in the network space \n[18]. Based on the service-oriented\

    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\
    \ Supply Chain Traceability \nNowday, agricultural products/food safety issues\

    \  can ensure food safety and quality at each \nlink of the production, from the\
    \ cropland to the consumer (Figure 6), which could help consumers \nestablish\
    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\
    \ proposed a food safety pre-warning system \nbased on association rules mining\
    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    \ make use of IT infrastructure that is similar to the\none required by smart\
    \ cities, which take advantage of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing\n\
    solutions to monitor and actuate on the multiple systems of a university. As a\
    \ consequence, smart\ncampuses and universities need to provide connectivity to\
    \ IoT nodes and gateways, and deploy\narchitectures that allow for offering not\
    \ only a good communications range through the latest wireless\nand wired technologies,\
    \ but also reduced energy consumption to maximize IoT node battery life.\nIn addition,\
    \ such architectures have to consider the use of technologies like blockchain,\
    \ which are\nable to deliver accountability, transparency, cyber-security and\
    \ redundancy to the processes and\ndata managed by a university. This article\
    \ reviews the state of the start on the application of the\nlatest key technologies\
    \ for the development of smart campuses and universities. After deﬁning the\n\
    essential characteristics of a smart campus/university, the latest communications\
    \ architectures and\ntechnologies are detailed and the most relevant smart campus\
    \ deployments are analyzed. Moreover,\nthe use of blockchain in higher education\
    \ applications is studied. Therefore, this article provides\nuseful guidelines\
    \ to the university planners, IoT vendors and developers that will be responsible\
    \ for\ncreating the next generation of smart campuses and universities.\nKeywords:\

    1. Introduction\nSmart campuses and universities require an IT infrastructure\
    \ similar to the one needed by smart\ncities, smart buildings, or smart homes,\
    \ which make use of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions [1–4] to\ninteract with\
    \ the sensor and actuation systems of a university. Similarly to smart cities,\
    \ but in contrast\nto most smart homes and buildings, smart campuses must provide\
    \ long-distance communications,\nas many university campuses cover an area that\
    \ can reach thousands of square meters. For instance,\nthe campus of the authors\
    \ of this article (Campus of Elviña, University of A Coruña, Spain) occupies a\n\
    26,000 m2 area. Nonetheless, such an area can be considered small when compared\
    \ with the largest\nuniversity campuses in the world: Berry College (Floyd County,\
    \ Georgia, United States) covers 109.26\nkm2 of land [5], Duke University campuses\
    \ (Durham, North Carolina, United States) are deployed on\n37.83 km2 [6], and\
    \ the campus of Stanford University (Stanford, California, United States) occupies\
    \ 8180\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479; doi:10.3390/app9214479\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n2 of 24\nacres (33 km2) [7]. These ﬁgures mean that\
    \ smart campuses should make use of speciﬁc long-distance\ncommunications infrastructure\
    \ that provides indoor and outdoor connectivity to the deployed IoT\ngateways,\
    \ sensors and actuators, while guaranteeing reduced energy consumption and thus\
    \ optimized\nIoT node battery life.\nA smart campus and university is managed\
    \ according to its strategic plan (a framework of its\nmain priorities and commitments).\
    \ As a result, universities devote ﬁnancial resources to implement a\nbroad range\
    \ of actions (e.g., related to digital transformation, services, applications,\
    \ events, facilities,\nhuman resources, governance, educational programs, or innovation)\
    \ that are fundamentally designed\nto meet their institutional objectives. The\
    \ strategic plan is driven by the university mission, vision, and\ncore values\
    \ (further detailed in Section 2). For instance, a number of universities around\
    \ the world\nhas committed to make tangible contributions to the United Nations\
    \ Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs). Note that the provided smart campus services\
    \ may be similar to the ones of a smart city,\nbut adapted to the needs of a university\
    \ (e.g., mobility/transport services, energy/grid monitoring,\nresource consumption\
    \ efﬁciency, user behavior monitoring, or guidance applications). However, there\n\
    are other services that are speciﬁc for a university environment, such as the\
    \ services for analyzing the\nbehavior of students in certain outdoor activities\
    \ or their attendance to lectures.\nIn addition, there are other relevant differences\
    \ with respect to smart cities regarding the\narchitectures and technologies that\
    \ can be applied to smart campuses and universities:\n•\nSmaller size. Although,\
    \ as it has been previously mentioned, there are really large campuses, most\n\
    of them are not as large as cities and, in fact, there are many urban universities\
    \ with buildings\ninside a city. Such a smaller size enables using certain communications\
    \ technologies that do not\nneed to reach very long distances. In addition, since\
    \ often less devices require to be deployed than\nin a smart city, architectures\
    \ can be less complex and need less routing layer devices, what usually\nreduces\
    \ response time and infrastructure deployment cost.\n•\nInfrastructure management.\
    \ Frequently, in a smart campus/university all buildings and related\ninfrastructure\
    \ are managed by the same organization (i.e., the university), often making it\
    \ easier\nto take certain measures to ease the deployment of the required infrastructure\
    \ communications\nand architecture than in a smart city. In contrast, in a city\
    \ most space is occupied with private\nbuildings that are managed by people that\
    \ do not work for the city council, so certain infrastructure\ndeployments can\
    \ be difﬁcult when having to deal with the different necessities of multiple people.\n\
    •\nHomogeneity.\nA smart university can enforce the use of certain technologies\
    \ and speciﬁc\narchitectures, while a smart city in general will have to deal\
    \ with a greater heterogeneity in\nsuch areas, which usually require complex solutions\
    \ to integrate the numerous previously existing\ncomputational systems.\nDue to\
    \ the previously mentioned differences, it is essential to study speciﬁcally\n\
    the most\nappropriate architectures and technologies for developing smart campuses\
    \ and universities.\nIn contrast to previous reviews and surveys on smart campuses/universities,\
    \ which are presented\nas systematic literature reviews [8,9], are focused on\
    \ deﬁning certain generic concepts/applications [10],\nor are centered on speciﬁc\
    \ technologies [11–16], this article provides a holistic review that analyzes\
    \ the\napplication of the latest key technologies and architectures for the development\
    \ of smart campuses\nand universities, including the following contributions,\
    \ which have not been found together in the\nprevious literature.\n•\nAfter deﬁning\
    \ the essential characteristics of a smart campus and a smart university, the\
    \ most\ncommon communications architectures are detailed together with their evolution:\
    \ from traditional\ncloud-based to the latest ones based on edge computing.\n\
    •\nThe application of blockchain to such architectures is studied as a tool to\
    \ create a distributed\nimmutable log that provides transparency and cybersecurity\
    \ to higher education and smart\ncampus applications.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n\
    3 of 24\n•\nThe characteristics of the most relevant smart campus deployments\
    \ and initiatives are analyzed.\n•\nThe latest smart campus deployments are enumerated\
    \ and multiple examples of their applications\nare described.\n•\nThe most recent\
    \ communications technologies for outdoor and indoor smart campus applications\n\
    are studied.\n•\nThe main challenges that will be faced by university planners,\
    \ IoT vendors, and developers\nare listed.\nThe rest of this paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 deﬁnes the concept of smart campus and\nits main features.\
    \ Section 3 details the latest communications architectures for smart campuses\
    \ and\nsmart universities. Section 4 analyzes the potential applications of blockchain\
    \ for deploying higher\neducation and smart campus applications. Section 5 describes\
    \ the most relevant smart campuses that\nhave been already deployed, emphasizing\
    \ their main applications and communications technologies.\nFinally, Section 6\
    \ indicates the main challenges for university planners, IoT vendors, and developers,\n\
    and Section 7 is devoted to the conclusions.\n2. Deﬁnitions of Smart Campus and\
    \ Smart University\nIt must be ﬁrst clariﬁed that the term “smart campus” has\
    \ been used in the past to refer to digital\nonline platforms that manage university\
    \ content [17,18] or to the set of techniques aimed at increasing\nuniversity\
    \ student smartness [19–21]. However, in this article, the concept of smart campus\
    \ refers\nto the hardware and software required to provide advanced intelligent\
    \ context-aware services and\napplications to university students and staff. In\
    \ addition, the term smart university refers to the\nhardware and software used\
    \ to develop tools to fulﬁll the key dimensions of the university mission:\n•\n\
    Improve the teaching, learning, and assessment processes involved in higher education.\n\
    •\nFoster research and innovation.\n•\nEmpower community-based knowledge transfer\
    \ and a shared vision among the various\nuniversity stakeholders (e.g., teachers,\
    \ students, administration, non-proﬁt organizations, research\ninstitutions, citizens,\
    \ industries, and governments).\nSuch characteristics make smart campus and universities\
    \ unique and enable differentiating from\nother concepts like smart cities. Nonetheless,\
    \ smart campuses/universities are similar to smart cities\nin the way they are\
    \ organized, which revolves around six smart areas [22]:\n•\nSmart governance.\
    \ It allows university staff and students to take part in different decisions\
    \ that\nneed to be made on a university or on a speciﬁc campus.\n•\nSmart people.\
    \ It is related to the engagement of the university users in teaching and learning\n\
    processes or their attendance to certain events.\n•\nSmart mobility. In the case\
    \ of a smart campus, this ﬁeld deals with the different issues related\nto the\
    \ available transport systems, which should be efﬁcient, green, safe, and may\
    \ provide\nintelligent services.\n•\nSmart environment. This ﬁeld is related to\
    \ smart solutions able to monitor, protect, and actuate on\nthe environment while\
    \ also managing the available resources in a sustainable way. For instance,\n\
    smart environment systems provide solutions for monitoring waste, water consumption,\
    \ or air\nquality. In addition, this ﬁeld is usually related to the deployment\
    \ of systems to control and\nmonitor the energy consumed, generated and distributed\
    \ throughout a campus.\n•\nSmart living. It is responsible for monitoring the\
    \ multiple living factors involved in the daily\ncampus activities, including\
    \ the ones related to health, safety or user behavior. Thus, smart living\nservices\
    \ can perform the following [23,24]:\n–\nEstimate room occupation and determine\
    \ student classroom attendance.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n4 of 24\n–\nControl\
    \ the access to classroom/lab equipment.\n–\nProvide teaching interaction services\
    \ and context-aware applications.\n•\nSmart economy. This smart ﬁeld deals with\
    \ the productivity of a campus in relation to concepts\nlike entrepreneurship\
    \ or innovation.\nAs a summary, Figure 1 illustrates the main ﬁelds and technologies\
    \ related to the deployment\nof a smart campus/university. The inner circle contains\
    \ the six previously mentioned smart ﬁelds.\nThe contiguous outer circle references\
    \ some of the most relevant technologies required to provide\nsolutions for such\
    \ six smart ﬁelds, including IoT, Augmented Reality (AR), Cyber-Physical Systems\n\
    (CPSs), or UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). Note that some of such technologies\
    \ are the same as the\nones proposed by Industry 4.0 [25], so commercial and industrial\
    \ deployments are already available in\nother ﬁelds outside smart campuses [26,27].\
    \ Moreover, there are also vertical ﬁelds like cybersecurity\nthat affect several\
    \ of the cited technologies, since their contribution is key to avoid potential\
    \ issues [28].\nFinally, the most external circle of Figure 1 indicates speciﬁc\
    \ smart areas that are usually involved\nin the daily activities carried out in\
    \ a smart campus/university. For example, smart plug-and-play\nobjects [29] may\
    \ be involved in many university activities, whereas certain environmental sensors\
    \ are\nessential for actuating on smart buildings [30]. There are also other ﬁelds,\
    \ like smart agriculture, that\nmay be speciﬁc for smart campuses that include\
    \ in their premises areas for growing certain crops that\nmay require the use\
    \ of autonomous decision-support systems [31].\nRobots \nand UAVs\nBig Data\n\

    Figure 1. Main ﬁelds and technologies of a smart campus.\n3. Smart Campus/University\
    \ Communications Architectures\nSeveral authors have previously proposed different\
    \ smart campus architectures, but it\ncan be stated that, in general, they can\
    \ be classiﬁed as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n\
    5 of 24\narchitectures [32,33] that revolve around two main paradigms (IoT and\
    \ cloud computing [34]), which\nare usually helped by Big Data when processing\
    \ and analyzing the collected information.\nAn example of smart campus architecture\
    \ based on cloud computing is presented in [35], where\nthe authors deployed a\
    \ smart campus platform in three months by using Commercial Off-The-Shelf\n(COTS)\
    \ hardware and Microsoft Azure cloud services. With respect to IoT, its use has\
    \ been proposed\nfor easing the deployment of architectures that allow for implementing\
    \ learning, access control, or\nresource water management applications [10,36].\n\
    Some researchers have also proposed alternative paradigms for creating smart campuses.\n\
    For instance, the authors of [37] propose an opportunistic communications architecture\
    \ that allows for\nsharing data through infrastructure-less services. The main\
    \ novelty behind the proposed architecture\nis the concept of Floating Content\
    \ node, which is a computing device that produces data that can be\nshared among\
    \ users located in nearby areas. Similar architectures have been proposed, but\
    \ they have\nbeen focused on improving certain aspects like security [38].\nSome\
    \ of the latest smart campus architectures have suggested the use of the different\
    \ types of\nthe edge computing paradigm (e.g., mobile edge computing or fog computing),\
    \ which have already\nbeen successfully applied to other smart ﬁelds [39]. The\
    \ main advantage of edge computing is its\nability to ofﬂoad part of the processing\
    \ tasks from the cloud, delegating such tasks to the so-called\nedge devices,\
    \ which are physically located close to the IoT nodes. Thanks to this approach,\
    \ the amount\nof communications transactions with the cloud and latency response\
    \ are reduced, while also being\nable to provide location-aware services [40,41].\n\
    For example, the authors of [42] make use of edge computing devices to improve\
    \ their smart\ncampus architecture. Such devices are focused on delivering services\
    \ related to content caching and\nbandwidth allocation. A similar approach is\
    \ presented in [43], where the researchers provide smart\ncampus services through\
    \ edge computing devices embedded into street lights. In the case of the work\n\
    detailed in [44], the authors propose a smart campus platform called WiCloud that\
    \ is based in mobile\nedge computing, which allows for accessing the platform\
    \ servers through mobile phone base stations\nor wireless access points. Finally,\
    \ it is worth mentioning the smart campus system presented in [45],\nwhich makes\
    \ use of fog computing nodes to enhance user experience.\nTo clarify the previously\
    \ mentioned architectures, Figure 2 illustrates their evolution. In this\nﬁgure,\
    \ at the top, the traditional cloud-based architecture is depicted, which is composed\
    \ by two main\nlayers:\n•\nNode layer: it consists of multiple IoT nodes and computing\
    \ devices, whose data are collected\nthrough IoT gateways and routers in order\
    \ to send them to the cloud where they are stored.\n•\nCloud layer: it is essentially\
    \ a central server or a group of servers where the main processing tasks\nare\
    \ carried out. In addition, the cloud allows for interacting with third parties,\
    \ it presents the\nstored data to remote users and enables interconnecting the\
    \ multiple IoT networks that may be\nscattered through different physical locations.\n\
    The architecture depicted at the bottom of Figure 2 on the left represents a fog\
    \ computing\narchitecture. In this case, besides the node layer and the cloud,\
    \ there is a third layer (the fog layer),\nwhich is made of fog devices. Such\
    \ devices provide different local fog services to the IoT nodes and\nare also\
    \ able to exchange data among them to collaborate in certain tasks. A fog computing\
    \ device is\nusually implemented on a Single-Board Computer (SBC), which is essentially\
    \ a reduced-size low-cost\ncomputer (e.g., Raspberry Pi and Orange Pi PC) that\
    \ can be easily deployed in the campus facilities.\nFinally, the third and more\
    \ evolved architecture of Figure 2 is the one at the bottom, on the right,\nwhich\
    \ illustrates a typical edge computing smart campus architecture. Such an architecture\
    \ is basically\nan enhanced version of the previously mentioned fog computing-based\
    \ architecture, but through its\nedge computing layer it provides more computing\
    \ power, thanks to the use of cloudlets. A cloudlet is\noften a high-end computer\
    \ that is able to perform compute-intensive tasks, like the ones related to\n\
    complex data processing or image rendering.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n6 of 24\n\

    4. Blockchain for Smart Campuses and Universities\nBoth academia [11–13] and public\
    \ entities like the European Commission [46] have recently\nconsidered the improvement\
    \ of the architectures described in the previous section by using Distributed\n\
    Ledger Technologies (DLTs) like blockchain. Such a technology can be used for\
    \ implementing higher\neducation and smart campus applications, due to their ability\
    \ to provide data exchanges among entities\nthat do not necessarily trust each\
    \ other [47]. In addition, the use of blockchain enhance smart campus\napplications\
    \ that need transparency, data immutability, privacy, and security. Furthermore,\
    \ blockchain\nallows for developing Decentralized Apps (DApps) based on Peer-to-Peer\
    \ (P2P) transactions whose\nprocesses can be automated through the use of smart\
    \ contracts, which can execute pieces of code in an\nautonomous way [48].\nNowadays,\
    \ there are many blockchain platforms, like Ethereum [49], Hyperledger Fabric\
    \ [50],\nor the popular Bitcoin [51], that can be used in multiple practical applications\
    \ [52–55]. However, it is\nimportant to emphasize that blockchain is not the best\
    \ technology for every application that needs to\nperform trustworthy data exchanges.\
    \ For example, in many cases where smart campus applications\nare deployed in\
    \ a private network, a traditional database is powerful enough and usually provides\n\
    faster transactions than a blockchain. Therefore, to decide whether a blockchain\
    \ is necessary, smart\ncampus developers may use a decision framework [56] and,\
    \ thus, detect certain necessary features,\nlike the need for decentralization,\
    \ transaction transparency, cybersecurity (e.g., data redundancy and\nprotection\
    \ against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks), or the lack of trust among entities\
    \ (including\nrespect to government agencies and banks).\nDue to the previously\
    \ mentioned beneﬁts, different authors have proposed the use of blockchain\nand\
    \ other DLTs for developing applications for smart campuses and universities.\n\
    Speciﬁcally,\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n7 of 24\nblockchain has been suggested\
    \ for guaranteeing education certiﬁcate authenticity [57,58], managing\ndigital\
    \ copyright information [59], verifying learning outcomes [60,61], or enhancing\
    \ e-learning\ninteraction [62]. More potential smart campus applications and a\
    \ deeper analysis on their characteristics\ncan be found in [11–13,46].\n5. Analysis\
    \ of Recent Smart Campus and University Deployments\n5.1. Relevant Deployments\n\
    In the literature, there only a few papers that present descriptions on actual\
    \ smart campuses.\nAn example of such a paper is [63], where the authors detail\
    \ the development of the smart campus of\nToulouse III Paul Sabatier university\
    \ (France). Speciﬁcally, the smart campus is called neOCampus and\ninvolves multiple\
    \ projects able to run on an open data platform that, for instance, can use collaborative\n\
    WiFi. Similarly, in [64], the authors describe a smart campus based on cloud computing,\
    \ SOA, and\nIoT that has been deployed in the Moncloa Campus of International\
    \ Excellence of the Universidad\nPolitécnica de Madrid (Spain). In the mentioned\
    \ article, two applications are detailed: one for\nmonitoring diverse environmental\
    \ parameters, and another for determining people ﬂows inside the\ncampus. A similar\
    \ smart campus is described in [65], where the authors propose an IoT and cloud\n\
    computing based architecture for the Wuhan University of Technology smart campus\
    \ (China) that is\naimed at supporting diverse applications.\nIoT is also key\
    \ in the West Texas A&M University smart campus [66], which is deployed in a\n\
    176-acre land that includes 42 different buildings. Such a smart campus is focused\
    \ on providing\nIoT-related and secure services, and has tested systems for smart\
    \ parking or environmental monitoring.\nAnother interesting work can be found\
    \ in [33], where it is detailed the Birmingham City University\nsmart campus (United\
    \ Kingdom). The aim of the proposed smart campus is essentially to create a\n\
    scalable and ﬂexible SOA architecture where service integration and orchestration\
    \ can be carried out\neasily through the use of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).\n\
    Finally, it is worth mentioning the work presented in [67], where it is described\
    \ from a theoretical\npoint of view the smart campus of Sapienza (Rome, Italy),\
    \ including the author’s approach for\nproviding services in a scalable way.\n\
    As a summary, Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the most relevant smart\
    \ campus\ndeployments, including details on their location, size, used hardware,\
    \ and their explicit support\nfor advanced architectures (fog and edge computing\
    \ enabled architectures) and blockchain-enabled\napplications.\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\

    \ Applications\nBoth indoor and outdoor applications can be deployed in a smart\
    \ campus/university [8], but such\nsmart applications differ in their requirements.\n\
    The most relevant difference is that, in indoor\nenvironments, IoT nodes can be\
    \ usually powered through the electrical grid and can make use\nof ﬁxed communications\
    \ infrastructure (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi access points). In contrast, outdoors,\
    \ IoT\nnodes usually depend on batteries and need to exchange data at relatively\
    \ long distances (at least\nseveral hundred meters, up to 2 kilometers). The following\
    \ are some of the most relevant applications\nfor both scenarios:\n•\nSmart mobility\
    \ and intelligent transport services. This kind of applications require outdoor\n\
    communications coverage from traditional Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)\
    \ or speciﬁc\nvehicular networks [71,72].\nFor instance, researchers of Soochow\
    \ University proposed to\nuse in their campus an automatic gate access system\
    \ and diverse services for smart parking,\nbus positioning or for renting bicycles\
    \ [68]. Similar services have been suggested by other\nuniversities for providing\
    \ a smart parking service [73], electric mobility [74,75], smart electric\ncharging\
    \ [76], the use of autonomous vehicles [77], or for locating the campus buses\
    \ [78,79].\n•\nSmart energy and smart grid monitoring. These applications are\
    \ used for controlling and\nmonitoring the generation, distribution, and consumption\
    \ of the campus energy sources (e.g.,\nphotovoltaic systems or wind generators).\
    \ Speciﬁcally, in the last years, multiple authors focused\ntheir research on\
    \ the study of smart campus microgrids [80–82], smart grids [83,84], and smart\n\
    energy systems [85,86].\n•\nResource consumption efﬁciency. The use of the resources\
    \ of a campus can be monitored\nthrough speciﬁc systems for garbage collection\
    \ [87], water management [69], power consumption\nmonitoring [88,89], and other\
    \ solutions aimed at preserving sustainability [16].\n•\nInfrastructure and building\
    \ control and monitoring. The state of certain buildings and assets that\nare\
    \ scattered throughout the campus can be monitored and controlled remotely. For\
    \ instance,\nsolutions have been suggested for monitoring campus greenhouses [90],\
    \ for controlling the\nHeating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems\
    \ of the campus buildings [91] or for\nautomating critical infrastructure supervision\
    \ through Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) [92].\n•\nGreen area monitoring. The\
    \ health of the trees of campus can be monitored remotely through IoT\nsensor-based\
    \ systems [93].\n•\nUser pattern and behavior monitoring. The smart campus services\
    \ and infrastructure can be\noptimized thanks to the analysis of the user patterns\
    \ and behaviors. For instance, mobility\npatterns, user activities, or social\
    \ interactions can be determined through smartphone apps [94,95],\nby monitoring\
    \ WiFi communications [96,97] or by collecting data from smartphone sensors [98],\n\
    wearables, or even garments [99].\n•\nGuidance and context-aware applications.\
    \ These applications often depend on sensors and\nactuators spread across the\
    \ campus and can help people by giving useful contextual information\nand indications\
    \ on how to reach their destination. For instance, there is interesting research\
    \ on\nguidance systems to aid hearing and visually impaired people [100] or for\
    \ navigating the campus\npaths [101,102]. There are also augmented reality applications\
    \ that provide relevant contextual\ninformation on the campus or that are able\
    \ to guide the users through it [103–105].\n•\nClassroom attendance. Different\
    \ student monitoring systems have been proposed, which make\nuse of IoT and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence to control student classroom attendance [106] and their access\n\
    to sport facilities [107].\n•\nRemote health monitoring. Some of the latest smart\
    \ campus applications are aimed at monitoring\nthe health of certain campus users\
    \ in real-time [108] or at measuring student stress [109] and\nhealth consciousness\
    \ [110].\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n11 of 24\n•\nSmart card applications. Although\
    \ smart cards have been used for a long time by universities [111],\nthey can\
    \ still provide useful services for a smart campus, like information retrieval,\
    \ mobile\npayments, library usage, access control, or e-learning [112–114].\n\
    Instead of a smart card,\nthe latest developments suggested the use of the Near-Field\
    \ Communications (NFC) interface of\na smartphone to provide the mentioned smart\
    \ campus applications [115]. Due to the multiple\npotential applications of smart\
    \ cards, some authors also proposed to mine the data collected from\nthe student\
    \ transactions to infer their behavior [116,117].\n•\nTeaching and Learning applications.\
    \ The technologies embedded into a smart campus/university\ncan also help students\
    \ to learn through their mobile phones [118] or have an ubiquitous\nuser-centered\
    \ personalized learning and training experience with advanced analytics [119,120].\n\
    These technologies also allow teachers to make use of speciﬁc learning services\
    \ (e.g., online\nprogramming contests [121]), sophisticated online teaching platforms\
    \ [122], and to implement\nnovel teaching paradigms like Flipped Classroom [123]\
    \ or ampliﬁcation [124].\n•\nResearch and innovation activities.\nSmart campus/university\
    \ technologies can be used to\nencourage collaboration and cooperation among people\
    \ (e.g., international networks of living\nlabs). For instance, crowdsourcing\
    \ can be used to collect data of people with different proﬁles\n(e.g., students,\
    \ teachers, researchers, and administrative staff) and create large-scale datasets\
    \ for\nfurther research and novel applications [125].\n•\nCommunity-based knowledge\
    \ transfer applications. Smart campus and university technologies\ncan be explored\
    \ to beneﬁt the global community [126], either by increasing their awareness about\n\
    sustainability issues [127] or by making citizens actively involved as central\
    \ players of smart\nenvironments [128].\n•\nLocation-aware applications. In many\
    \ situations the information given to smart campus users\ndepends on their location.\
    \ Such a location-aware data may include information on content,\nactivities,\
    \ projects, services, tools, knowledge, or events [129–132].\n•\nSecurity services.\n\
    Smart campus managers can make use of the multiple sensors and\nrecording devices\
    \ to monitor the campus status and increase physical security through video\n\
    surveillance [133] and location-aware applications [134]. In addition, it is essential\
    \ to protect the\nprivacy of campus user data when making use of wireless communications\
    \ [135] and preventing\ncyber-attacks [66].\n5.3. Communications Technologies\n\
    In the past, researchers have used diverse technologies for connecting remote\
    \ outdoor IoT nodes\nwith smart campus platforms. Note that such technologies\
    \ may differ a great deal from one scenario\nto another, as the distance to be\
    \ covered and the kind obstacles found in the environment (especially,\nmetallic\
    \ objects [136]), severely condition signal propagation.\nFor instance, in [35],\
    \ the authors propose the design of an IoT-based smart campus that makes\nuse\
    \ of BLE and ZigBee for providing short and medium-range communications. Nonetheless,\
    \ note\nthat ZigBee nodes can act as relays in a ZigBee mesh, so that the exchanged\
    \ information can reach long\ndistances [137].\nWiFi (i.e., the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac\
    \ standards) is another popular technology that has already\nbeen suggested for\
    \ providing indoor connectivity for smart campuses [64].\nBluetooth beacons\n\
    can be also used in smart campus applications [138,139], but they usually are\
    \ restricted to indoor\nenvironments, as their outdoor use requires the deployment\
    \ of dense networks whose management is\ncomplicated [140].\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 4479\n12 of 24\nDue to the popularity of mobile phones, the main cell phone\
    \ communications technologies (i.e.,\n2G/3G/4G) have been suggested for providing\
    \ smart campus services [141,142]. 5G technologies are\nstill being deployed worldwide,\
    \ but their use has already been proposed due to their ability to provide\nfast\
    \ communications and reduce response latency in smart campus applications [122].\n\
    Despite the good perspectives of 5G for the next decade, nowadays, Low-Power Wide\
    \ Area\nNetwork (LPWAN) technologies are arguably one of the best alternatives\
    \ for smart campus applications\nthat require low-power and long-distance IoT\
    \ communications [143]. Some of the most popular\nLPWAN technologies are SigFox\
    \ [144], LoRaWAN [145], and NB-IoT [146], existing other emerging\ntechnologies\
    \ like Ingenu Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA) [147], Weightless-P [148], or\n\
    NB-Fi [149].\nLoRaWAN deﬁnes the communication protocol and the system architecture\
    \ for the network\nand uses LoRa as the physical layer. Although there are several\
    \ recent works on the application of\nLoRa/LoRaWAN to multiple scenarios [150],\
    \ only a few of them are focused on the deployment of\nsmart campuses services\
    \ [66,70,151–153]. For example, the authors of [152] analyze the indoor and\n\
    outdoor performance of LoRaWAN on a French smart campus. In addition, other researchers\
    \ [153]\nproposed a smart campus air quality system whose communications were\
    \ carried out by LoRaWAN\nnodes. Another example can be found in [70], where the\
    \ authors make use of a radio planning\nsimulator to determine the optimal location\
    \ of LoRaWaN nodes that provide smart campus services in\noutdoor applications.\n\
    There are also short-distance communications technologies that can be useful in\
    \ smart campus\napplications. For instance, ANT+ transceivers are often embedded\
    \ into chest straps to monitor\nperformance and health in sports. Another example\
    \ of popular short-distance communications\ntechnology is Radio Frequency IDentiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID), which is commonly used in university access\ncontrol and payment systems\
    \ [28].\nTable 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the latest and most popular\
    \ communications\ntechnologies for smart campus applications.\nMoreover, Table\
    \ 3 compares the communications\ntechnologies of the most relevant smart campus\
    \ solutions. Such a Table also indicates whether the\nprovided references detail\
    \ the network planning of the proposed solution and, as it can be observed,\n\
    only a couple of works give details about it.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n13 of\

    6. Future Challenges\nDespite the evolution of smart campuses and universities\
    \ in the last years thanks to the\ntechnological advances achieved in ﬁelds like\
    \ IoT, cloud computing, and certain communications\nparadigms, future university\
    \ planners, IoT vendors, and developers will still face relevant challenges\n\
    in the following areas.\n•\nScalability. As a campus can cover a large area, where\
    \ a large number of users can request smart\nservices, it is essential for applications\
    \ to be easily scalable in order to adapt its performance to\nthe number of simultaneous\
    \ users.\n•\nService ﬂexibility. A smart campus/university should be able to provide\
    \ multiple services, which\nmay differ depending on the physical area where they\
    \ are provided (e.g., depending on the\nfaculty), on the speciﬁc user that request\
    \ them (e.g., access privileges may differ between a student\nand a professor),\
    \ or on the speciﬁc goal (e.g., advancing to more effective teaching and learning\n\
    services may differ substantially from the design of smart environment applications).\n\
    •\nLong-distance low-power communications. Since campuses usually cover areas\
    \ of thousands\nof square meters that often involve monitoring outdoor smart IoT\
    \ objects (e.g., street lights,\nirrigation systems), it is key to consider in\
    \ the smart campus architecture the use of long-distance\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9,\
    \ 4479\n15 of 24\nwireless communications technologies whose energy consumption\
    \ should be as low as possible\nto maximize IoT node battery life.\n•\nNew communications\
    \ technologies. Although this article has analyzed the currently most relevant\n\
    communications technologies, smart campus designers should be aware of the latest\
    \ advances on\ncommunications in order to include them in the designed architecture.\
    \ For instance, some authors\nare already suggesting potential applications for\
    \ 6G technologies [155,156].\n•\nBlockchain integration. DLTs like blockchain\
    \ can be really useful to guarantee operational\nefﬁciency, data transparency,\
    \ authenticity, and security. This aspect is a key enabler to develop\nnovel decentralized\
    \ smart applications (i.e., DApps) and to leverage new artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    paradigms such as big data, machine learning, or deep learning. These paradigms\
    \ need to rely\non trustworthy datasets in order to reach their full potential\
    \ and produce new data model-based\napplications.\nNevertheless, smart campus\
    \ designers have to use blockchain with caution,\nconsidering their advantages\
    \ and disadvantages. In addition, the incorrect use of smart contracts\ncan be\
    \ a problem, since they are able to trigger certain automatic behaviors that can\
    \ have serious\neconomic or personal consequences.\n•\nLack of smart campus standards\
    \ and public initiatives. Although, in the last years, smart city\ninitiatives\
    \ have proliferated worldwide, there are only a few speciﬁcally related to smart\
    \ campuses\nand universities. In addition, there is not a common framework for\
    \ designing or deploying them,\nso future developers will have to keep compatibility\
    \ and interoperability issues in mind.\n•\nSeamless integration of outdoor and\
    \ indoor smart campus applications.\nDue to their\ncommunications needs, outdoor\
    \ and indoor applications may differ in the underlying\ntechnologies, so it is\
    \ necessary to design architectures and devices that allow for switching between\n\
    communications transceivers. This means that, although the lower layers of the\
    \ communications\nprotocol may differ, the upper layers are compatible so that\
    \ they are able to provide seamless\ncommunications among users, IoT objects,\
    \ and the computing devices scattered throughout\na campus.\n7. Conclusions\n\
    This article examined how higher education can leverage the opportunities created\
    \ by the latest\nand most relevant IT technologies. After analyzing the basics\
    \ on smart campuses and universities, this\nwork has focused on studying the potential\
    \ of IoT, blockchain, and the most recent communications\narchitectures and paradigms\
    \ (e.g., fog/edge computing) for developing novel smart campus and\nsmart university\
    \ applications. In addition, the latest key deployments as well as their communications\n\
    technologies have been detailed and analyzed. Finally, the main future challenges\
    \ are listed in order to\nallow future university planners, IoT vendors, and developers\
    \ to create a roadmap for the design and\ndeployment of the next generation of\
    \ smart campuses and universities.\nAuthor Contributions: T.M.F.-C. and P.F.-L.\

    Cited By Index Terms Recommendations Comments ABSTRACT Born from a need for a
    pure “pay-per-use” model and highly scalable platform, the “Serverless” paradigm
    emerged and has the potential to become a dominant way of building cloud applications.
    Although it was originally designed for cloud environments, Serverless is finding
    its position in the Edge Computing landscape, aiming to bring computational resources
    closer to the data source. That is, Serverless is crossing cloud borders to assess
    its merits in Edge computing, whose principal partner will be the Internet of
    Things (IoT) applications. This move sounds promising as Serverless brings particular
    benefits such as eliminating always-on services causing high electricity usage,
    for instance. However, the community is still hesitant to uptake Serverless Edge
    Computing because of the cloud-driven design of current Serverless platforms,
    and distinctive characteristics of edge landscape and IoT applications. In this
    paper, we evaluate both sides to shed light on the Serverless new territory. Our
    in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge
    Computing. It also issues major challenges for Serverless to be met before entering
    Edge computing. References Paarijaat Aditya, Istemi Ekin Akkus, Andre Beck, Ruichuan

    the pressure on the agriculture sector. With the advent of technology, this decade
    is witnessing a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed both the quality and quantity of
    the agriculture sector. Hybridization of species along with the real-time monitoring
    of the farms paved a way for resource optimization. Scientists, research institutions,
    academicians, and most nations across the globe are moving towards the practice
    and execution of collaborative projects to explore the horizon of this field for
    serving mankind. The tech industry is racing to provide more optimal solutions.
    Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless
    sensor networks can provide sufficient scope to predict, process, and analyze
    the situations and improve the activities in the real-time scenario. The concept
    of heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices by providing flexible, scalable,
    and durable methods, models are also opening new domains in this field. Therefore,
    this paper contributes towards the recent IoT technologies in the agriculture
    sector, along with the development of hardware and software systems. The public
    and private sector projects and startup''s started all over the globe to provide
    smart and sustainable solutions in precision agriculture are also discussed. The
    current scenario, applications, research potential, limitations, and future aspects
    are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of IoT a precision farming framework
    is also proposed in this article. A graphical abstract for Recent developments

    is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’ means ‘Cultivation’.
    It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one of the benchmark areas.
    This field is the withstander of the economies of various nations. According to
    the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), more than
    60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival and around 12%
    of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted by FAO,
    the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year 2025
    and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of this
    data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of 70%
    in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is also
    the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based fertilizers,
    biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations, the agriculture
    sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution in the
    growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture
    for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained
    from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study,
    the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided
    by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions
    of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual,
    and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has
    been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices
    like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been
    discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been
    discussed. The significance and key differences of MIoT in agriculture have been
    discussed along with related studies. Studies limited to a specific domain has
    been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in
    agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe
    for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions
    to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements,
    future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper
    has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for
    the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into
    the deep insight of the various concepts, theories, and devices related to the
    implementation of Internet of Things has been discussed, followed by Section 4
    which gives the various related studies concerning different applications of Internet
    of Things in Agriculture, findings like challenges, limitations, improvements,
    future work, etc. with a short description of our proposed work has been given
    in Section 5, and finally, at last, the article ends with a conclusion. Table
    3 gives the detailed nomenclature used throughout this article. TABLE 3 Nomenclature
    SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going
    through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies
    for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the
    overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly
    based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015
    to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact
    of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers
    have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining
    the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has
    been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to
    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture

    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different
    models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like
    a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc,
    it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino
    Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers.
    Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and
    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.
    It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost
    open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in
    the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments,
    it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75
    mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of
    power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks
    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
    as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware
    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE
    5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT
    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7
    Sensors Based on Their Fields of Application FIGURE 6. Sensors and their types.
    Show All SECTION IV. Related Work The advancement and role of the Internet of
    Things in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is
    being conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections. Various studies are performed and put forward by various
    academicians and authors concerning the evolution of agriculture relating to the
    incubation of the concepts of the Internet of Things. Kim et al. [64], reviewed
    different articles related to the induction of unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture.
    The authors highlighted the recent trends, controls, perspectives, and platforms
    of UAV for agriculture. The study focused on what are the different platforms
    used for UAV and how those platforms can be designed. The hardware components
    related to the design of UAVs were also discussed. Sensor types compatible with
    platforms such as fixed-wing, helicopter, quadcopter, etc. were also discussed.
    A study on critical technologies for communication, modeling, and control was
    also presented. Various applications of UAVs in crop monitoring, spraying, and
    mapping, etc. were also presented. The authors concluded their study by providing
    the data on the latest technology trends and applications of UAVs in agriculture.
    Ayaz et al. [65], studied the latest trends and technologies in the field of agriculture.
    The potential sensors, IoT devices, communication techniques, used for soil, crop
    irrigation, insect, pest analysis were studied and discussed. Also, how this technology
    is redefining the agriculture system and boosting farmers to work, is portrayed.
    Authors studied the recent developments of IoT and how it is helping in providing
    the solutions while designing an IoT system for agriculture, what strategies and
    policies need to be considered. The advanced agricultural practices such as greenhouses,
    vertical farming, hydroponic farming, and phenotyping are also explained. All
    the crop stages and potential challenges are also discussed. Farooq et al. [66],
    presented many aspects of IoT in agriculture. Authors discussed all the recent
    technologies associated with IoT along with big data analytics for the development
    of precision agriculture systems. Various network topologies, architectures, layers,
    and protocols are also presented. In context to the development of a smart farm,
    all the major components and relevant technologies were discussed. Also, the regulations,
    standardizations, and policies used by several countries to standardize IoT methods
    for agriculture have been discussed. Elijah et al. [67], gave an overview of IoT
    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios
    were also presented. Misra et al. [68], discussed the concepts and role of IoT,
    AI and big data in the field of agriculture. In the review, focus was laid on
    green- house monitoring, disease detection, usage UAV machines and drones agriculture
    and supply chain modernization, social media in food industry, food quality assessment
    and modernization for food traceability. Thakur et al. [69], reviewed articles
    of repute in the context of the employability of WSN in agriculture. The authors
    highlighted the different communication technologies and WSN technologies adopted
    for precision agriculture. The authors also discussed various sensors and their
    role in agriculture. The influence of various techniques for designing the models
    is also discussed at length. Damos [70], presented a review on the pest control
    in precision agriculture. The author discussed the various computer-aided technologies
    employed for forecasting and designing decision support systems. The challenges
    and constraints of designing the decision support system were highlighted. The
    most available and published data present online in terms of pest management was
    also discussed. A differentiation between the documented and existing decision
    support systems was highlighted. The advancement and role of the internet of things
    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their
    study, authors used the concepts of AI, blockchain technology, edge computing
    and IoT concepts for designing the platform. The architecture named Global Edge
    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.
    Variable length time series data captured from IoT devices and sensors were used
    to generate crop health maps. Deep neural networks were implemented for classification
    and provided the optimal classification. Some studies of the articles incorporating
    IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary
    of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play
    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.

    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,
    firstly the agriculture sector along with its challenges and economic importance
    is presented. The domain of IoT along with the communication technologies and
    goals, protocols, architectures are studied and put forward. The various IoT OS,
    their specifications and features with respect to agriculture are discussed. An

    articles focusing especially on crop monitoring, irrigation, disease detection,
    and farm management is offered. The articles considered for study range from the
    time frame of the year 2015 to 2020. From the studies, certain issues are put
    forward that demand research and experimentation in the future. Various existing
    public and private sector platforms or start-ups which work for precision farming

    and future research directions are also highlighted. As a whole, the in-depth

    scenarios. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Metrics Abstract: Smart agriculture techniques have recently seen widespread interest
    by farmers. This is driven by several factors, which include the widespread availability
    of economically-priced, low-powered Internet of Things (IoT) based wireless sensors
    to remotely monitor and report conditions of the field, climate, and crops. This
    enables efficient management of resources like minimizing water requirements for
    irrigation and minimizing the use of toxic pesticides. Furthermore, the recent
    boom in Artificial Intelligence can enable farmers to deploy autonomous farming
    machinery and make better predictions of the future based on present and past
    conditions to minimize crop diseases and pest infestation. Together these two
    enabling technologies have revolutionized conventional agriculture practices.
    This survey paper provides: (a) A detailed tutorial on the available advancements
    in the field of smart agriculture systems through IoT technologies and AI techniques;
    (b) A critical review of these two available technologies and challenges in their
    widespread deployment; and (c) An in-depth discussion about the future trends
    including both technological and social, when smart agriculture systems will be
    widely adopted by the farmers globally. A Deep Learning Framework using Convolutional
    Neural Networks to detect and classify plant diseases using labeled training images

    recent report by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Program (WWAP), the world’s
    population will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food and water
    [1]. This will have serious consequences for the whole world, especially the developing
    nations. Amongst the ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart agriculture
    is one the most important emerging application, as shown in Fig. 1. Smart Agriculture
    Techniques [2], [3] have recently seen widespread interest by farmers and researchers
    alike to meet increased food demands. FIGURE 1. Block diagram showing IoT based
    emerging smart applications. Show All Smart Agriculture Systems (SAS) are driven
    by several key factors, which include the adoption of IoT technologies for remote,
    unmanned monitoring of the agriculture fields and taking corrective actions to
    make the environment most conducive for crop growth. SAS depends on a combination
    of hardware and software technologies for optimum benefits. The hardware side
    is now well supported by the availability of inexpensive, portable, power-efficient
    hardware with wireless connectivity, which enables their deployment in large numbers
    across vast indoor and outdoor agriculture fields. Rugged hardware modules may
    be installed underground to measure soil conditions, while others may withstand
    harsh climate conditions such as sunlight, rain, and extreme humidity. Other specialized
    hardware includes Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), which can process large amounts
    of data gathered by these modules as dictated by software-based Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) frameworks. On the software side, the recent boom in AI and Big Data technologies
    supports not only the managing of large amounts of data accumulated by hardware
    modules but also to give this data as input to state-of-the-art, AI-based predictors,
    which can give more well-informed decisions to the farmer. They can efficiently
    analyze the latest trends in the data and provide several insights to the farmer.
    These benefits range from greater crop productivity, saving of tightly managed
    resources such as water for irrigation purposes, and minimization of the use of
    toxic chemicals such as those used in fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides.
    Such a level of control over agriculture not previously possible gives the farmer
    greater flexibility and insight to plan his activities, such as determining what
    crops will result in optimum yield under existing and predicted climatic conditions.
    It keeps him well informed about his current and projected use of permissible
    fertilizer and pesticide use. It also helps him regulate the usage of tightly
    managed resources such as water for irrigation purposes. This paper presents a
    detailed review of the architectures of first-generation smart farms relying on
    various wireless sensors and communications technologies around which IoT technologies
    in SAS are based. We then discuss how recent advancements in AI-powered algorithms
    based on Deep Learning (DL) can use the collected data from diverse sources. This
    data can be collected from a large number of IoT sensors and imagery from unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) in different geographically diverse smart agriculture fields
    to make more accurate and informed decisions for pest detection, plant diseases,
    smart irrigation, limited use of herbicides, and other harmful substances. We
    then review the current state-of-the-art technologies, implementation challenges
    associated with them, and future trends and direction in SAS. In terms of significant
    contributions, this paper has presented 1) A detailed tutorial on the available
    advancements in the field of SAS through IoT technologies and AI techniques; 2)
    A critical review of these two available technologies and challenges in their
    widespread deployment; and 3) An in-depth discussion about the future trends including
    both technological and social, when SASs will be widely adopted by the farmers
    globally. The roadmap of this paper is as follows: Section II discusses the related
    work. Section III discusses the state-of-the-art wireless sensor network (WSN)
    technology and use-cases of IoT in SAS. Section IV discusses the smart irrigation
    technologies used currently in the world. Section V presents an overview of the
    use of UAVs, which is a current driving force behind AI-powered solutions for
    SAS. Section VI discusses these solutions in detail, which are possible via DL
    applications. Section VII discusses the challenges in SAS, and Section VIII discusses
    the future trends in the area of smart agriculture technology. Finally, Section
    IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Work IoT-based smart farming has actively
    been in development for the last two decades, ever since the boom in wireless
    sensor technology. A comprehensive survey on the role of IoT in SAS has been provided
    by Farooq et al. [2] and Ayaz et al. [3]. Li et al. [4] presented an actual working
    smart greenhouse (SGH) with remote monitoring option using the WSN technology.
    With the advent of smart lower-powered wireless sensor technology enabling deployment
    in high densities, micromanagement ideas for SAS have started to evolve quickly.
    As soil parameters could be monitored closely, water conservation strategies such
    as smart irrigation technologies were developed. Hydroponics [5] and Aeroponics
    [6] are two such cutting-edge, soil-less medium based water management technologies.
    Nalwade and Mote [5] described a hydroponics-based smart irrigation system in
    which plants are suspended into a nutrient solution instead of soil for direct
    application of water to crop roots as per requirements. Idris et al. [6] implemented
    an aeroponics-based water irrigation system for crops in which water is directly
    sprayed at crop roots as per need. Special hardware design for sensor nodes was
    actively developed especially for use in smart agriculture applications [7]. IoT-based
    SAS studies have also been a popular topic amongst researchers [8]. These have
    been practically implemented for efficient monitoring and controlling of the agriculture
    systems remotely, sometimes with the option of saving data to the cloud for the
    benefit of other farmers working in similar domains, e.g., crops and climatic
    conditions. Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new emerging concept [9].
    Monitoring soil factors and climatic conditions are two major contributors to
    the well-being of the crops. Like IoT, it represents an internet of wireless sensors
    and actuators which are located below ground to monitor and control soil conditions
    such as moisture, nutrients, acidity, pH levels, and soil electrical conductivity.
    Wireless signal propagation loss and protection of sensitive electronics inside
    wireless sensor nodes is a challenging issue for the IoUT technology. Single-hop,
    wireless, underground sensor networks have been discussed in detail by Tiusanen
    et al. [10]. UAVs for smart cities surveillance in real-time have been proposed
    previously [11], [12]. The use of UAVs in smart farming is also being explored
    by researchers [13]. UAVs equipped with specialized smart camera applications
    capture aerial images of the field, which, combined with advanced DL-based AI
    tools, can predict crop diseases, phenotyping, plant growth monitoring, weed detection,
    and used for irrigation pesticide spraying. Architecture of a neural network.
    In current circumstances of acute water shortages for agricultural purposes, it
    is crucial to devise smart strategies for water conservation. Advanced irrigation
    concepts centered around IoT-based precision agriculture include the techniques
    of hydroponics [19] and aeroponics [20]. Zahid et al. [46] present a novel TeraHertz
    (THz) waves based method to estimate water content in living plant leaves to maximize
    water conservation via smart irrigation strategies. The concept of greenhouses
    [17], [18] is not new and has been around and utilized for agriculture for a few
    decades now. However, with the advancement in IoT and wireless sensor nodes technology,
    the SGH concept is rapidly emerging [47], [48]. SGHs enable farmers to maintain
    micro-climate conditions, enhance irrigation and fertilizer use. Similar to SGHs
    is the concept of Tunnel Farming [19]. Plastic tunnel farming is successful in
    developing countries due to its low cost, having off-season crops, and better
    productivity [49]. Traditional tunnel farms use drip irrigation, overhead irrigation,
    or sprinkler irrigation methods for better results. This type of irrigation is
    better than normal flooding methods. Various irrigation methods provide various
    levels of water and energy efficiency. Semi-Circular cross-section tunnels are
    used, which are usually 14 to 28 feet wide and 7 to 12 feet tall at the center
    (depending on width), and 48 to 96 feet long. It is usually recommended that tunnels
    should be no wider than 30 feet for cross ventilation and to avoid snow accumulation
    on the roof. Like SGHs, it is also lined with IoT sensor technology to constantly
    monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity and take corrective
    actions accordingly through appropriate actuators. The use of Machine Learning
    (ML) and DL has also been actively researched for improved crop yields [50], agriculture
    advisory systems [51], [52], detection of crop diseases, weed detection [53],
    and pests [38]. Zeynep et al. [21] have carried out an exhaustive literature survey
    on the use of DL techniques in smart agriculture. The use cases of DL in smart
    agriculture include detection of plant diseases, pest recognition, plant classification,
    smart irrigation, and weed detection. Table 1 summarizes the topics related to
    SAS covered in various research papers and compares them with the contributions
    we presented in this survey article. TABLE 1 Comparison of Recent Topics Covered
    in Research Literature and its Comparison With This Survey Paper SECTION III.
    Use of IOT in Smart Agriculture A. Wireless Sensor Technologies for Smart Agriculture
    1) Temperature Sensors Ambient temperature monitoring is vital for crops growth
    in indoor as well as outdoor smart farms. Some crops are susceptible to changes
    in temperature, e.g., wheat. Even for a short period, high temperature affects
    the growth of shoots and, in turn, reduces root growth. Similarly, the high soil
    temperature is more crucial as damage to the roots is severe, resulting in a substantial
    reduction in shoot growth. 2) Humidity Sensors Humidity monitoring is essential
    for crops to estimate water losses due to evaporation, which is vital for the
    process of photosynthesis. Other complications related to humid conditions are
    that it may promote the growth of mold and bacteria that cause plants to die and
    crops to fail, as well as conditions like root or crown rot. Humid conditions
    also invite the presence of pests, such as fungus gnats, whose larva feed on plant
    roots and thrive in moist soil [23], [24]. 3) Soil Sensors Multiple types of soil
    moisture sensors are in use in SAS to study parameters like pH and conductivity.
    Soil conductivity maps help to predict crop yield as they indirectly deduce soil
    organic matter and soil texture. These two parameters are indicators of available
    water content and the presence of potential weeds. Thus, soil electrical conductivity
    measurement is also used for the estimation of quantities of soil-applied herbicides.
    Similarly, soil pH is essential to have healthy crops as strongly acidic soils
    having pH in the range of 4.0-5.0 can have high concentrations of soluble aluminum,
    iron, and manganese, which may be toxic to the growth of some plants. A pH range
    of approximately 6 to 7 identifies the ideal level of plant nutrients. 4) Fluid
    Level Sensors Level sensors are used to detect the level of substances, including
    liquids, powders, and granular materials. Level sensors find their use in SAS
    to monitor the nutrient solution level if the hydroponics method is used for smart
    irrigation. B. How do Sensors Communicate? Physical Layer Wireless Communication
    Technologies Fig. 2 shows the smart agriculture architecture from the viewpoint
    of wireless communication strategies to communicate between field devices and
    Internet Gateways at various abstraction levels. The capabilities of these wireless
    technologies vis-a-vis their practical use cases are discussed in different sections
    below. FIGURE 2. Wireless physical layer standards for communication between IoT
    based sensors and smart farming machinery at edge to agriculture database servers
    at core. Show All 1) LoRa AND LoRa-WAN Kontogiannis et al. [54] and Ray et al.
    [55] have proposed Low Power Long Range (LoRa) and LoRa-Wide area network (LoRa-WAN)
    technology at the physical layer for data communication between the IoT transceivers.
    Both LoRa and LoRa-WAN technologies are used in sensor nodes to implement their
    AI-based irrigation systems, Open Watering System (OWS), and LoRa-Agri, respectively.
    LoRa is a low-power, long-range spread spectrum modulation technique enabling
    IoT sensors to communicate at a distance of up to 12Km [47]. It also provides
    the highest scalability (5-20K nodes) but low data-rates of about 100Kb/sec. 2)
    Rfm69 Besides LoRa, another physical layer technology to connect IoT-based sensor
    nodes proposed in recent literature includes the RFM69 standard. RFM69 [88] supports
    a communication range of up to 0.5Km and data-rates of up to 100Kb/s for up to
    65K nodes. RFM69 transceivers can operate over a wide frequency range, including
    the 433-, 868-, and 915MHz license-free industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM)
    frequency bands. 3) Zigbee Zigbee technology [36], also referred to as IEEE 802.15.4,
    is another low-powered wireless communication technology for sensor nodes. It
    has a moderate communication range of up to 1Km and supports data-rates of approximately
    1Mb/s for up to 65K nodes. Like RFM69, Zigbee operates in the ISM radio band,
    most popularly in the 2.4GHz band, though some devices also use 784MHz in China,
    868MHz in Europe, and 915MHz in the US/Australia region. Chikankar et al. have
    demonstrated the use of ZigBee technology in their automatic irrigation system
    [14]. 4) Bluetooth Bluetooth [49] is another low-power wireless connection solution
    for the sensor nodes. It has the least supported range of 50m for up to 7 nodes,
    for the maximum data transmission capacity of 1Mb/s. Bluetooth transceivers require
    the least power out of the technologies mentioned above. 5) Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)
    NB-IoT [48] is a low-power WAN technology (LPWAN) developed through the long-term
    evolution (LTE) standards, which support direct communication of wireless sensor
    nodes with the existing generations of cellular networks from 2G to 4G. It supports
    data-rates of up to 150Kb/s. 6) SigFox SigFox [48] is another LPWAN technology
    like NB-IoT. Sigfox employs the differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK)
    and the Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) modulation techniques that enable
    communication using the ISM radio bands. Sigfox technology works at 868MHz in
    Europe and 902MHz in the US. It utilizes a wide-reaching signal that passes freely
    through solid objects, called “Ultra Narrowband” and requires little energy. The
    network is based on a one-hop star topology and requires a mobile operator to
    carry the generated traffic. It supports low data-rates of 100bits/sec. 7) Wireless
    Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Wi-Fi belongs to the IEEE 802.11 family of IEEE standards. This
    technology is suitable for wireless sensor nodes where power consumption is not
    an issue, and higher data transmission rates are required. Thus, it may only be
    suitable for high data-rates such as video transmission in indoor settings like
    indoor farms. The transmission distances are lower in the range of 100ft only.
    For IoT use in SAS, such high data-rates are rarely required. Two Wi-Fi standards
    that have been developed, or are being developed, specifically for IoT are Wi-Fi
    HaLow (802.11ah) [48] and HEW (802.11ax) [49]. It can support up to 290Mb/s in
    the upstream. Wi-Fi based sensor connection has been used in a practical system
    by Buendia et al. [56]. 8) WiMAX Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
    (WiMAX) is IEEE 802.16 standard [2], [48]. It is sometimes regarded as long-haul
    Wi-Fi due to its similarities with Wi-Fi standards. It supports up to 380Mb/s
    data-rate in the upstream. It has the same limitation as Wi-Fi and may be suitable
    when the wireless sensor nodes are present at an indoor location. 9) Cellular
    Technologies Cellular technologies will be used to connect IoT-based sensors and
    smart farming machinery in large fields that otherwise communicate only over a
    short distance, as depicted in Fig. 3. Future smart agriculture machinery like
    drones will frequently be having flights covering huge areas, and real-time communication
    with such drones/UAVs could only be with the help of cellular networks [11]. Newer
    cellular technologies such as 4G LTE, 5G, and B5G are not only facilitating large
    communication ranges but also permit large data transmission capability, which
    will be suitable for applications like real-time video transmission from agriculture
    drones [12], [104]. Another alternative benefit of using the cellular technologies
    is to create an Internet Gateway as these systems have connectivity to packet
    data networks as their core. This will enable the use of Internet-driven applications
    such as making the system “weather aware” in real-time, deciding against irrigation
    if rainfall is expected or predicted by real-time weather updates etc. Available
    cellular technologies include 2G/3G/4G and 5G. All previously mentioned physical
    layer, one hop wireless technologies are either directly compatible with cellular
    technologies like NB-IoT, SigFox, and WiMAX, or they may be linked to cellular
    technologies using a gateway. Jawad et al. [57] presented a comprehensive comparison
    of the different wireless technologies discussed above with technical quantifications.
    It was suggested by the authors [57] that LoRa and ZigBee wireless technologies
    are most suitable for SAS because of their low latency and power consumption,
    easy implementation, smaller size, simplicity, scalability, and most importantly,
    the communication range (typically small for ZigBee and long for LoRa). Although,
    as discussed that 5G and B5G technologies [104] with low latency, large communication
    ranges, high data transmission capabilities that allow real-time video transmission
    using UAVs/drones will dominate future SAS with higher reliability. FIGURE 3.
    Use of cellular network for real-time monitoring in large fields using smart agriculture
    machinery. Show All C. How Sensors and Actuators Coordinate - Microcontroller
    Platforms for IOT Based Smart Agriculture Systems Microcontroller-based platforms
    popularly used by researchers in IoT based SAS include ATMEGA328P [54] (sometimes
    used in conjunction with Arduino development boards), 18F458 PIC microcontroller
    [14], and ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller [58]. Most of these microcontroller
    platforms provide an integrated Wi-Fi module having TCP/IP protocol that can able
    to access any Wi-Fi network. These platforms are cost-effective, power-efficient,
    and require minimal external circuitry. They also feature moderate storing capability
    and on-board processing. On-board processing is required to define the logic that
    how corrective action will be taken according to the sensor reading. All smart
    irrigation algorithms (described later) can be implemented as a logic program
    running on the microcontroller. These platforms also allow the integration of
    different sensors through General Purpose IO (GPIO) pins with minimal run time
    giving these platforms to scale up to multiple sensors in a single platform. For
    example, ATMEGA328P having a limit of 8 sensors per actuator [54]. Jawad et al.
    [59] have presented a practically implemented ZigBee-based system interfaced with
    ATMEGA 328p microcontroller, which uses energy harvesting techniques and sensor
    sleep/wake cycles to reduce the power consumption of the WSN network. SECTION
    IV. Smart Irrigation Strategies A. Soil-Based Irrigation Techniques 1) Drip Irrigation
    Drip Irrigation [60] is the concept in which the surface irrigation method is
    substituted by a channel of pipes laid into the land for irrigation. Pinpointed
    locations are selected at various depths for placing water closest to the plant
    roots and thus minimizing excess water loss in the soil surrounding the plants.
    Using drip irrigation, farmers can save up to 95% of the water. However, the upfront
    cost of this irrigation system is high as farmers need an initial investment in
    purchasing and laying the network of pipes underground through the agricultural
    land and provisioning of expensive power to drive water pumps for circulation
    of water in these pipes. Using a renewable form of energy, e.g., solar power,
    for meeting the power requirements, has a high initial cost but is generally lower
    in the long run. B. Soil-Less Irrigation Techniques 1) Hydroponics Hydroponics
    is a branch of hydro-culture, where plants are grown in a soil-less environment
    using a nutrient solution [14], exclusively. A mechanical structure using coir
    or coconut fiber may be used for the support of plants. The nutrient solution
    parameters such as pH and electrical conductivity have to be monitored constantly
    [7]. There are two variations of this technique where water is continuously circulated,
    or nutrient solution is supplanted with a new solution to maintain the parameters,
    the latter method results in power savings. 2) Aeroponics Like Hydroponics, Aeroponics
    is also a technique where plants are grown in a soil-less environment, but instead
    of placing the plants in a nutrient solution, the roots are sprayed with a nutrient
    solution based on the data of root chamber moisture levels [20]. Presently several
    crops have been successfully undergone experimental cultivation using the aeroponics
    technique [6]. C. Smart IOT Based Irrigation Control 1) Fuzzy Logic Algorithms
    This is a class of algorithms based on a pre-defined set of rules and degree of
    membership calculations based upon sensor values [37]. Fuzzy algorithms are fast
    and smart adaptive algorithms and include error-control capabilities [61]. Practical
    systems implemented using Fuzzy control algorithms for smart irrigation control
    have been developed by several researchers [17], [37]–[54], [61]. 2) Majority
    Vote Algorithms In this type of algorithm, if the majority of the sensors report
    a reading greater or less than a pre-specified threshold value to trigger the
    irrigation process, then the irrigation is started. 3) Time-Controlled Algorithms
    In this type of algorithm, the actuators are activated at a particular time of
    the month and for the pre-specified duration. For this duration, they stay on
    as per pre-set or pre-programmed conditions by the farmer. This algorithm can
    sometimes use sensors as a feedback mechanism for adaptive actuator control. 4)
    Exponential Weight Moving Average Algorithms In this type of algorithm, the immediate
    sensor reading is multiplied by the weighting factor and then added to an average
    of previous n readings, again multiplied by a second weighting factor to generate
    a moving average as per the equation given below: S=a S c +(1−a) S n,avg (1) View
    Source where, the coefficient value a is between 0 and 1, S c is the current sensor
    reading, and S n,avg is the average over previous n sample readings. This mechanism
    is resilient to instantaneous sensor noise. 5) Proportional Integral, Derivative
    (PID) Control Algorithms This is an advanced control loop feedback process, as
    shown in Fig. 4, in which a setpoint set by the farmer is tracked by the system,
    using a function of the error to follow it and achieve it. The setpoint may be
    a control process variable such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, or humidity.
    The output of the system response is provided in Fig. 5. It can be seen that a
    proportional controller achieves fast control action in reaching the setpoint
    but may result in an overshoot in the process. The integral controller achieves
    low steady-state error while the derivative controller reduces system overshoots.
    The use of a PID controller in a solar-based irrigation system has been discussed
    in [62]. FIGURE 4. Depiction of a PID controller to control a process variable.
    Show All FIGURE 5. Depiction of process control variable evolution with respect
    to target point using PID control. Show All 6) Neural Network Algorithms These
    belong to an advanced class of ML algorithms in which the system is trained using
    training data composed of sensor values and the level of irrigation required.
    Training requires setting system weights to make the output, a weighted linear
    sum of input sensor values. An activation function is used to model non-linearities
    in the system to avoid getting negative output values and cater for situations
    not covered by an exclusively linear response, as shown in Fig. 6. Once the system
    weights are tuned in the training stage, the testing stage uses these leaned weights
    to derive an optimum irrigation requirement based on the input sensor value. These
    algorithms require an immense amount of training data to be able to give superior
    results. As the number of layers increases in the neural networks, so does the
    training complexity, which sometimes requires expensive GPUs. Recently, Al-Naji
    et al. [63] have developed a system using input RGB images to a pre-trained, feed-forward
    back propagation artificial neural network (ANN) and claimed high system accuracy
    in determining soil conditions and water requirement for irrigation. FIGURE 6.
    Architecture of a neural network. Show All SECTION V. Use of UAVs in Smart Agriculture
    UAVs are primarily used for crop monitoring through aerial images being acquired
    by the UAV and crop spraying owing to the ease offered by its aerial mobility
    and maneuverability. Velusamy et al. [44] provide an excellent taxonomy of the
    type of UAVs being used in precision agriculture being classified as fixed-wing,
    vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) based on their flight patterns and other
    architectural design such as the number of rotors, being classified as single
    rotor, multi-rotor (tri-copter, quad-copter, hexa-copter, octo-copter). These
    UAVs are equipped with multiple camera types: RGB, multi-spectral, and hyper-spectral.
    Different UAV architectures and mounted cameras may be suited for specialized
    applications. For example, fixed-wing may be better for broad surveillance and
    monitoring of the agriculture field, while VTOL-based multi-rotor design may be
    suited for pesticide spraying. Similarly, an RGB camera may be suited for low
    altitude UAV operation for close-range detection of different pests and plant
    diseases through real-time manual monitoring or DL-based automated monitoring,
    while hyper-spectral imagery is useful for high altitude UAV monitoring to monitor
    and assess the extent of plant disease or pest infestation spread across a large
    agriculture field through inspection of broad foliage. Often farmers will have
    to use one UAV type for monitoring of the field and another type of UAV for spraying
    purposes, as several factors come into play like UAV flight time, flying altitude,
    flight speed, camera, and other sensors’ limitations and on-board hardware processing
    [64], [44], [65]. Jawad et al. [65] have implemented a practical solar-powered
    wireless power transfer (WPT) based drone field-landing platform for drone battery
    recharging; authors claim 97% battery saving and flight endurance time increase
    from 25 minutes to 850 minutes on the specific X525 drone used in their study,
    when this system is augmented with a specialized sleep-wake strategy of WSN sensor
    nodes communicating with the drone. Crop Monitoring is enabled through special
    aerial images acquired by UAVs based on thermal, multi-band hyper-spectral, multi-spectral,
    and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology. This allows farmers to identify
    crop conditions and plant diseases through the use of advanced image data analytics
    along with exact geolocation data through GPS measurements [23]. The use of UAVs
    in modern SAS makes use of thermal, LIDAR, hyper-spectral and multi-spectral imaging
    technologies together with advanced image processing software to solve a variety
    of farmers’ issues. LIDAR technology has been used to detect crop/plant volumes
    to predict expected yield and areas with problems. Since, LIDAR is still a very
    expensive technology, similar parameters such as normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) [66] and crop water stress index (CWSI) [67] can be obtained using
    aerial images acquired using hyper-spectral and multi-spectral cameras. The NDVI
    and CWSI parameters can help identify crop biomass levels and provide predictive
    information such as crop diseases, water stress levels, nutrient deficiencies,
    and pest infestations. Yang et al. [29] designed a deep Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN) to estimate rice grain yield using images acquired by the UAVs. This framework
    can make estimations at the ripening stage. Dyson et al. [31] integrated a radiometric
    index with terrain height images for segmenting crops and trees using high-resolution
    UAV images. Nevavuori et al. [28] apply CNNs to crop yield prediction using RGB
    image analysis and NDVI data collected by the UAVs. An interesting combination
    of fusion of multi-spectral imaging and RGB images through UAVs in the detection
    of weeds was presented by Barrero and Perdomo [68]. Similarly, Lottes et al. [26]
    present a crop and weed classification system using a UAV-based application. Crop
    spraying is made possible through UAVs after identifying problematic locations
    which require spraying of pesticides through GPS-enabled UAVs. Deployed systems
    have claimed UAV payload capacities of up to 2 Kg and flight endurance times of
    up to 15 minutes [25]. Interestingly, some researchers have preferred the use
    of hybrid systems using both ground-based nodes and UAVs to achieve greater efficiency.
    An example is a system proposed by Faical et al. [24] in which UAVs are guided
    through ground nodes having information about wind direction and speed. The UAVs
    then incorporate their own flight parameters (position, current velocity, and
    direction of travel) so the spraying process is optimally planned and executed
    inside targeted areas where it is most required. The commercial supplier DroneFly
    estimates that drones can spray fertilizer 40 to 60 times faster than doing so
    by hand [69]. The use of UAVs is not limited to conventional SAS, but they are
    now also being used for aquatic farming of plants, e.g., lotus and other aquatic
    organisms, e.g., fish [45], where human monitoring is exceedingly difficult. SECTION
    VI. Use of Deep Learning in Smart Agriculture Z. Unal et al. [25] have compiled
    a comprehensive bibliography on the recent trends of DL-based CNNs in the area
    of Smart Agriculture, as shown in Fig. 7. The main feature by which DL networks
    are distinguished from neural networks is their depth, and that feature makes
    them capable of discovering latent structures within unlabeled and unstructured
    data. DL is a computationally expensive algorithm and practically requires powerful
    GPUs for the proper training of algorithms using large training datasets. Ma et
    al. present an approach where training could be speeded up using multiple GPUs
    in parallel [70]. FIGURE 7. A deep learning framework using convolutional neural
    networks to detect and classify plant diseases using labeled training images of
    affected plants with pre-known disease. Show All A. Plant Diseases In order to
    detect plant diseases in crops, current research has been focusing on image-processing
    based DL systems instead of the conventional practice of using RNA analysis for
    timely identification of any crop diseases saving the farmers from huge economic
    losses. The most popular image-based DL framework, shown in Fig. 7, uses a multi-layer
    CNN framework that initially self-learns features present in the labeled training
    image data. These learned features are then fed to an ANN in the second stage.
    Neural weights, bias functions, and non-linear activation functions are used to
    make the classification accuracy high. Gobalakrishnan et al. [27] present an exhaustive
    review of various systems development and in progress. Types of infectious diseases
    that can destroy the yield are fungal, bacterial, and viral. Similarly, types
    of non-infectious diseases result from non-ideal farming situations like improper
    soil acidity, mineral toxicities, and deficient nutrients. Efficient image processing-based
    ML systems have been developed by researchers [71]. Most notable of these include
    work by Mahlein et al. [72], who devised a technique based on the generation of
    spectral disease indices (SDIs) and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) for sugar
    beet plants. Using hyper-spectral signatures, the plant diseases in sugar beet
    plants could be classified with accuracy in the range of greater than 85%. The
    advantage of this technique is that it is not affected by noise from other sources
    in the imaging process such as camera flash. Other techniques in the domain of
    image processing include genetic algorithms for image segmentation [73], pattern
    recognition techniques based on Gabor Transform [74], [75], CNN based DL frameworks
    [34]. Almost all of these claim accuracies of between 90 to 95%. Other specialized
    image-based techniques are developed keeping in view the detection of plant diseases
    in targeted crops like citrus fruits [76], mango trees [77], apples [38], and
    rice [78]. B. Agricultural Advisory Systems Niranjan et al. [51] discuss a chat-bot
    based farmers’ query answering system through which they can get specific answers
    to their queries. The system uses online web resources like documents as training
    data and Natural Language Processing to develop a DL-based Recurrent Neural Network
    (RNN) framework. The queries could range from crop types grown in particular geographical
    regions to the use of pesticides and fertilizers. Several ontology-based knowledge
    bases exist today, like ADANS [79] and AGRI-QAS [52], which can be queried using
    SPARQL queries. C. Edaphic Parameters Estimation Many researchers have devoted
    attention to the estimation of soil parameters [80], [81], which play a dominant
    role in other factors such as prevention of non-infectious diseases and increasing
    crop yield. Many soil-based factors are essential for maintaining healthy crops,
    such as moisture, air, temperature, mineral matter, organic matter, organisms,
    etc. While external climatic factors such as temperature, humidity, precipitation
    can only be controlled when crops are grown in an indoor environment, soil factors
    could be controlled when crops are grown in both indoor and open fields. Many
    studies using ML algorithms have investigated the soil properties to develop Digital
    Soil Maps [82]. Jia et al. [83] present the idea where comprehensive ML-based
    soil models could be applied to nearby land areas where less training data is
    available. D. Real-Time Pest Detection Pest detection has been investigated by
    some researchers. The most notable of these works is that of Brunelli et al. [38].
    The researchers claim that although many ML algorithms exist for the detection
    of plant diseases using images of damaged crops, there is no provision for real-time
    pest threat detection. It is due to the fact that ML algorithms are run on powerful
    hardware, physically distant from the wireless sensor nodes collecting the data
    from many vantage points, so detection is done after the damage has been done.
    They give a framework for real-time detection of codling moth pest detection,
    using AI at edge solution. The solution comprises of readily available and moderately
    expensive hardware like Raspberry PI-3, Intel Movidius neural compute stick (NCS),
    and Intel Myriad X neural accelerator as a vision processing unit (VPU) for real-time
    pest detection after the training of the deep neural network (DNN). Using this
    solution, pest detection accuracy was greater than 90%. E. Phenotyping Plant phenotyping
    is an emerging science that links the impact on functional plant body development
    from the dynamic interaction between its genetic background and the physical world.
    Using image-based DL methods such as CNN [21], as shown in Fig. 7, this is possible,
    as this problem is not too different from other problems such as detection of
    plant diseases and pest detection. Uzal et al. [33] have developed a DL technique
    to predict the number of seeds per pod. Similarly, grapevine phenotyping using
    the DL technique has been implemented using only a consumer-grade camera is carried
    out by Milella et al. [84]. Feng et al. [85] have fused multi-spectral imaging
    with ML for plant salt stress phenotyping. F. Weed Detection Like the nuisance
    of pests and plant diseases, weeds are other unwanted plants growing within the
    agriculture field and reduce the productivity of the farming lands. Ferriera et
    al. [86] and Moshia and Newete [32] have devised CNN-based DL approaches for the
    detection of weeds in soybean and cornfield. Bah et al. [87] have done the same
    with images acquired via UAVs. Kounalakis et al. [22] have used the transfer learning
    approach for the detection of weeds through the DL algorithm. Partel et al. [88]
    have developed a smart sprayer for real-time weed management using NVIDIA GPUs
    and CNN. Chang and Lin [53] developed a computer vision-based, robotic watering,
    and weed detection system. SECTION VII. Challenges for Smart Farming A. International
    Regulations on Use of Pesticides - a Case for Organic Farming According to a recent
    report of the World Health Organization (WHO), around three million cases of pesticide
    poisoning occur globally each year, leading to nearly 220,000 deaths in developing
    countries, making the case of pesticide-free organic farming [89]. Restrictions
    have already been implemented by the European Union (EU) and other regulatory
    bodies on the use of harmful pesticides. For example, the EU has indicated a zero-tolerance
    policy on the use of Tricyclazole chemicals in rice [90]. This makes a case of
    organic farming inside contained indoor environments where the climate can be
    maintained closely without the threat of pests as encountered in agriculture farms
    in open fields. B. Reduction of Arable Land Amid Drought-Like Situations - a Case
    for Vertical Farming Recently, we have seen several problems hampering the growth
    of agriculture. These problems include acute water shortages for proper irrigation
    of lands, reduction of farming lands due to rapid urbanization and industrialization,
    widespread crop diseases decreasing productivity, and harmful effects of pesticides/insecticides
    on human populations. Currently, researchers have begun giving a lot of attention
    to vertical farming techniques [5], [6], [15], [91], [92]. Vertical farming techniques
    solve all of the problems mentioned above by using water-based solutions and lightweight
    porous aggregates, e.g., coconut coir [16] instead of soil, giving the possibility
    of lightweight vertical stacking of plants/crops over a small area of land such
    as rooftops of buildings which have weight limitations. This also gives numerous
    other benefits such as the possibility of confining the vertical farming space
    in a green-house like an environment for controlled supply of water and nutrients
    using a variety of smart sensors connecting via IoT concepts [35], and increased
    crop productivity with minimal requirement of water over the small footprint.
    This is especially suitable for agro-based economies like the Middle East, Africa,
    and the Indian Sub-continent, which are facing increasingly drought-like situations
    and have a dire shortage of water for suitable irrigation. By using the IoT technology
    for intelligent vertical farming, new types of crops, genetically superior crops,
    or yield of certain crops may be increased tremendously with minimal use of water
    and creation of an artificial climate if the natural climate is not favorable.
    C. How Will Farmers Meet the Increased Technological Costs Associated With Smart
    Farming Yet Expect Food Prices to be Low? Smart farming has huge upfront and operational
    costs to build up the required infrastructure. The farmers could meet the upfront
    costs through the availability of loans on easy installments by government bodies
    to support Smart Agriculture practices. Similarly, Farmers may offset the operating
    costs through increased productivity than conventional farming methods. For example,
    farming inside closed spaces or earlier detection of crop diseases through advanced
    AI-based Agricultural Advisory systems may give timely prediction and protection
    from airborne and soil-borne crop diseases. Similarly, with smart irrigation strategies
    such as aeroponics, crops may grow up to 3 times faster [92]. There is also the
    potential possibility that food prices will again be lowered through the reduction
    of food-miles as smart indoor vertical farms will typically be located in urban
    locations such as rooftops or buildings or large warehouses. D. Global Consortium
    for Development of Seamless Wireless Sensor Technologies and Data Aggregation
    Focussed on Smart Agriculture Use Currently, researchers have been able to piece
    together available wireless sensor technologies and platforms for the development
    of Smart Agriculture infrastructures. Almadani and Mostafa [93] have developed
    a SAS using multi-vendor devices using a data distribution service (DDS) middleware.
    However, there is a need for a consortium specially dedicated towards the development
    of Wireless sensor development for Smart Agriculture use cases. Currently, this
    need is felt at various levels. For example, LoRa EU radio frequencies are in
    the ISM bands of 868MHz and 433MHz. The 868MHz band is mainly used in urban areas;
    for agricultural applications, the 433MHz band can achieve better distances with
    less attenuation over distance. However, existing devices in the market utilize
    only the 868MHz band for the LoRa Mac layer and infrastructure [54]. Similarly,
    WSN nodes deployment in underground situations to study soil parameters needs
    dedicated efforts by the researchers to study the behavior of wireless waves propagation
    through the soil [94]. Similarly, the issues of the development of standard communication
    protocols for seamless integration of different types of sensors and advanced
    security mechanisms are required to protect information transfer in the fields
    to preserve the privacy of growers [9]. Similar to the problem of heterogenous
    communication protocols of wireless sensors, the data being collected by them
    at application layers can suffer from similar problems. The diverse wireless sensor
    manufacturers use different data formats, which results in reduced syntactical
    and semantic interoperability among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded
    in binary, or represented in formats such as json, xml, text (e.g., csv), shapefile,
    or even proprietary formats. The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also
    affect the performance of a protocol employed for communicating the information.
    To cater to this problem Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming,
    has developed a standard ISO 11783 [95]–[97]. Similarly, AgroXML developed by
    the Association for Technologies and Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) [98]–[100].
    E. Hacking Attacks on Smart Machinery and Cyber Threats to Agro Databases An imminent
    threat to smart farming will be from computer hackers who may attack smart self-driving
    farming machinery like smart tractors and UAVs. Self-driving cars already face
    several types of cyber threats like Denial-of-Service (DoS) and its sub-types
    (Sybil, Grayhole, Wormhole, Rushing attacks) [85]. IoT sensor node communication
    using several IEEE wireless communication standards, e.g., 802.11p used for autonomous
    cars and eventually autonomous farming machinery, are especially vulnerable to
    jamming/DoS attacks [110]–[112]. Similarly, DoS attacks on servers hosting smart
    agriculture historical data logs and other agricultural advisory systems will
    keep smart farmers ill-informed about timely measures against natural disasters
    (pest infestation). Robust counter-attacks techniques for these cyber threats
    will need to be present at the core (Servers) as well as the edge (Smart farming
    machinery and IoT field nodes) for the protection of smart farmers’ interests.
    SECTION VIII. Future Trends for Smart Farming A. Paradigm Shift from Cloud-Based
    to Edge AI Applications for Smart Agriculture As with other applications, AI-based
    SAS applications will undergo a paradigm shift in which edge devices like wireless
    sensors will become intelligent enough to make autonomous decisions independently
    without relying on powerful central servers running AI algorithms. With the recent
    advancements in electronics, embedded systems with increased processing power
    and memory, labeled as System on Chip (SoC) [27], [77], have the ability to provide
    a complete solution without reliance on other external entities. Smart AI-based
    embedded systems running computer vision algorithms have been developed using
    portable architectures as used for real-time pest detection by Brunelli et al.
    [38]. Similarly, Gia et al. [15] have developed an experimental framework in which
    CNN-based image compression is implemented inside the sensor node due to low data
    transmission rates of current WSN networks based on LoRa and NB-IoT. Thus, there
    will be a shift from cloud-computing solutions to edge-computing based solutions.
    These solutions will also be able to provide farmers with real-time threat detection
    and its timely prevention. Alsamhi et al. [101] propose using drones with B5G
    physical layer wireless technologies to perform federated learning and edge AI
    processing for smart environments. Intensive ML is possible over B5G networks
    due to its high data-rates and low latency [102]. B. Open Source Smart Agriculture
    Solutions for Farmers As there is a shift from cloud-based solutions to edge-computing
    based solutions, there will also be a shift from proprietary to open-source based
    solutions from the farmers. Farmers may not be technologically equipped to program
    AI-based algorithms from scratch [30]. Many of the edge AI-based solutions of
    the future will already be using open source based AI-algorithms such as OpenCV
    libraries [103] for computer vision or other publicly available software frameworks.
    This will bring down the cost of SAS. Similarly, the farmer will not have to design
    new systems from scratch each time; consultancy firms will provide plug-and-play
    based hardware plus software solutions to farmers alongwith aftersales support.
    Open-source software solutions would also mean that farmers’ measurements could
    be shared openly with other farmers enabling farmers to build a strong knowledge
    base. C. Huge Yields Will no Longer be Due to Farmers’ Laborious Efforts Rather
    His Intellectual Abilities In the future, most of the farming equipment will be
    self-driven, like smart cars [104]. These include smart farming tractors and UAVs
    using computer vision technologies to manage everything from sowing, irrigations,
    fertilizer application, weed removal, herbicides applications, and pest detection.
    In these situations, tech-savvy farmers could only survive amidst fierce competition
    through their knowledge of AI, big data analytics to fully understand the conditions
    of their crops. Many Smartphone software-based services owing to big leaps in
    Edge AI applications, will be available to identify crop conditions, e.g., conditions
    of fruits, detections of pests, etc. D. Rise of Blockchain Technology in Smart
    Farming Sector to Counter Cyber Threats Like other emerging areas in the IoT technology
    [104], Smart Agriculture will also be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Hence, there
    would be a growing need to protect the farmer’s privacy as well as the data of
    his crops if it will be shared for cloud applications. Future threats to SAS will
    be in the form of control systems intrusion, secure key management for encryption/decryption.
    There could also be a potential threat to physical Smart Agriculture equipment.
    For example, GPS spoofing attacks causing incorrect positioning of UAVs/drones
    working in the crops field or a smart tractor could be given incorrect waypoints
    leading to physical damage. In addition, the delay caused by long-distance signal
    transmission from IoT sensors deployed at great distances in the field also increases
    the risk of Sybil attacks in which malicious data is spread through virtual nodes
    [18]. Additionally, it is found that the threat was not only in the form of software
    but also hardware threats were equally likely. In one instance, it was found that
    high voltage pulses emitted from solar-based insecticidal lamps interfered with
    the ZigBee based communication of other IoT nodes. Future Open Source smart farming
    technologies would also warrant this free sharing of possibly compromised or corrupted
    information to other smart farmers. BlockChain technology would be used to secure
    the data received for onward transmission from wireless sensors to cloud servers.
    E. Future Crops Will Not be Farmers Choice Rather Dictated by Data Driven Smart
    Farming Currently, farmers mostly depend on a combination of guesswork, estimation,
    and past experience when deciding about the crop to be grown and the fertilizer
    that should be used for optimum crop yield. In the future, ML models will be used
    to study long-term climate patterns in particular geographical locations, and
    these will be a guide to farmers on which crops to target at particular sites
    in the future. Villa-Henriksen et al. [105] review the impact of data-driven decisions
    on smart farming and identify six different stages of data flow which are: sensing/perception,
    communication/transport/transfer, storage, processing, analytics, and actuation
    and display. The data processing/analytics stage may differ in position according
    to architecture, e.g., fog/edge computing or cloud computing. Data processing/analytics
    typically has an AI-based prediction framework and forms the heart of data-driven
    agriculture. Chakrabarty et al. [113] have studied the climate patterns and other
    man-made factors such as fertilizer use in parts of Bangladesh and its effects
    on crop yields. These data points are used as input to a DNN for prediction framework.
    Similarly, Jin et al. [114] have studied a climate predictor that can predict
    weather conditions for the next 24 hours. Thus, in the future, crop production
    decisions will be heavily guided by the output of advanced predictor systems fed
    with climate and crop yield data from the past. F. 5G Wireless Technologies Will
    be Used for Always Connected Smart Farming Machinery It is increasingly evident
    that 5G wireless technologies [104] will dominate smart agriculture. This is because
    of the advantages of 5G technologies, such as higher data-rates, larger coverage
    areas, and adaptability to heterogeneous communication environments. These are
    essential for real-time crop monitoring in large farmlands [106]. 5G [104] also
    provides excellent support for the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I) due to its low latency and new frequency bands, which will be the requirement
    in the future for always connected farming machinery like smart tractors and swarms
    of smart drones [107]. G. Rise of Green(ER) IoT Future IoT networks, including
    those deployed for SAS, will be energy efficient. Almalki et al. [108] present
    a comprehensive review on the greening of IoT networks in future smart cities
    by reducing their carbon footprint. Several techniques have been proposed for
    this, which include energy harvesting techniques, sleep/wake modes for IoT sensors,
    efficient routing protocols, cognitive WSN, and 5G-based mobile communication
    networks. Alsamhi et al. present a comprehensive survey on the use of B5G technology
    for green IoT [109]. SECTION IX. Conclusion A comprehensive review of existing
    research literature and recent state-of-the-art developments in the area of Smart
    Agriculture Systems was presented. The significant contributions of this paper
    are: 1) A detailed tutorial on the available advancements in the field of SAS
    through IoT technologies and AI techniques; 2) A critical review of these two
    available technologies and challenges in their widespread deployment; and 3) An
    in-depth discussion about the future trends including both technological and social
    when SASs will be widely adopted by the farmers globally. In this paper, we first
    discussed the importance of smart agriculture practices with the growing gaps
    in global food demand versus current food generation, the growing shortage of
    arable land for agriculture, stricter regulations by International organizations
    on the use of toxic pesticides/herbicides, and global shortage of water resources
    for irrigation purpose. Clearly, all of the challenges cannot be met through traditional
    agricultural practices. We then discussed in detail the current hardware building
    blocks of the smart agriculture system, which is primarily based upon a large
    number of IoT nodes deployed in the field with suitable sensors to monitor the
    current situations of crops. The monitored parameters are transmitted wirelessly
    through various available technologies for the farmer to take remedial actions
    manually or automatically through pre-programmed instructions to actuators. We
    discuss the automated control algorithms and strategies along with their advantages
    and limitations for one particularly important application, smart irrigation,
    in view of recently depleting water resources. We also discussed the currently
    available and implemented hardware, wireless communications technologies, and
    software aspects of the smart agriculture systems in terms of implementation with
    their use-cases and limitations. These use-cases will define their potential roles
    in newer Smart Agriculture standards and specifications as they evolve. Next,
    we presented a detailed insight into the emerging trends of applications of AI
    and DL in smart agriculture and the architectural building blocks for smart agriculture
    systems. We discussed at length practical prototype implementations and their
    effectiveness for applications in automated plant disease or pest detection. We
    also briefly discussed the impact of these technologies on future advancements
    in smart agriculture, such as the use of UAV/drones and other smart farming machinery.
    Finally, we discussed the challenges of smart agriculture systems to support the
    paradigm shift of adopting the latest technological advancements for mainstream
    systems. The foremost is the social implication of these technological advancements
    on traditional farming methods. These advanced techniques may redefine the way
    the farmers will practice agriculture in the years to come. Farmers will have
    to be tech-savvy to keep themselves abreast with these technological advancements,
    and traditional farming practices will become obsolete and impractical. Other
    technical challenges include standardization aspects of commercially available
    smart agriculture systems solutions to make them compatible across several manufacturers,
    make them backward compatible and lower costs associated with the wide adoption
    of smart agriculture systems. In the end, we also discussed the future directions
    of advancement in smart agriculture systems and the technological difficulties
    and challenges they will bring with them. These future directions primarily focus
    on bringing more AI-based solutions towards edge devices from the core for real-time
    threat detection and quick remedial actions, making the availability of more open-source,
    customizable solutions for farmers, and incorporating measures for cyber security.

    The Internet of Things (IoT) offers a lot of benefits for building smart cities.
    Such cities will be able to utilize a huge number of heterogeneous IoT devices
    that can generate a sheer volume of data. So, considering this heterogeneity,
    one of the major challenges in smart cities is how to process this data and identify
    different situations for decision-makers on the basis of this data. The traditional
    cloud computing approach can provide enormous computing and storage facilities
    to support data processing. However, it requires all the data to be moved to the
    cloud from the edge devices of the user endpoint, thus introducing a high latency.
    In this paper, we used the edge computing approach to minimize such latency. Besides,
    as major portion of data is generated from the user endpoint, processing this
    data in the edge can significantly improve the performance. Our experiment shows
    that processing raw IoT data at the edge devices is effective in terms of latency
    and provides situational awareness for the decision makers of smart city in a
    seamless fashion. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet
    of ThingsSmart citySituation awarenessEdge computing 1. Introduction Today, most
    people use the Internet [22] for communication and content sharing, which has
    also become a global platform for communication between connected objects and
    smart devices, introducing a concept called the “Internet of Things (IoT)”. IoT
    is expanding at a unprecedented rate and according to the International Data Corporation
    (IDC), an estimated 50 billion connected objects will be in use by 2020 (Fig.
    1). This brings about the challenge of how to efficiently process the huge volume
    of IoT data and use it for human benefit. Nowadays, IoT has become a part of smart
    city [41], [36], [6]. IoT-based smart cities has the potential to bring a number
    of benefits in the management and optimization of traditional public services,
    such as transport and parking, surveillance and maintenance of public areas, preservation
    of cultural heritage, garbage collection, and salubrity of hospitals and schools.
    Data from the IoT-embedded city infrastructure can be collected and processed
    to understand the situation of the city and offer new services in future [18]
    in addition to taking necessary actions. A situation [19] is a condition at a
    moment in a particular location. In other words, a situation is a set of things
    that happen and the conditions that exist at a particular time and place. In the
    IoT, a situation is an abstraction for a pattern of observations made by a distributed
    system, such as a sensor network. With the expansion of cities, lots of events
    will likely occur and any inefficient approach to process and handle those situations
    will hamper timely decision-making. In order to address this challenge in the
    smart city context, different projects that couple the IoT with cloud technology
    to reap the benefits of cloud storage, processing, and infrastructure are already
    underway [42], [1], [5], [24]. In cloud-based processing, all the sensor data
    are processed through a remote cloud server, but it is costly in terms of processing
    and storage to send all data to the cloud. In this aspect, the emerging edge computing
    [3] can help save a lot of bandwidth and may increase the processing speed. Edge
    computing, also called fog computing, is a method of optimizing cloud computing
    systems by performing data processing at the edge of the network. Download : Download

    services, the data that needs to be moved to the remote server significantly decreases.
    This method mainly has three benefits: it can work with large data sizes, it guarantees
    a low latency, and it focuses on location awareness. Fig. 2 illustrates a typical
    edge computing approach where the edge is the closest processing unit of the data
    sources (the sensors), it processes the data and sends the filtered data to the
    cloud server. Here, the main functionality of edges is data offloading, storage,
    processing, and privacy protection. This paper contributes by providing an edge
    computing framework to process situations in a IoT smart city that would help
    the decision makers to be situation aware and provide relevant services to city
    residents. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we comment
    on some research works on edge computing, situations, and IoT smart cities that
    are related to our approach. Section 3 depicts the proposed situation detection
    mechanism. In Section 4, we show the architecture of our proposed framework. Section
    5 presents the implementation issues, development challenges and the outcome that
    we found from our examination. At the end, we provide the conclusion and discuss
    future work directions of the paper in Section 6. 2. Related works Situation awareness
    (SA) has previously been studied in different domains, as composite events in
    distributed event based systems, service composition in multi-agent systems, and
    macro-programming in sensor networks. The term was first used by Endsley [19]
    in the military field. Although many extensions were developed by Endsley from
    his original SA idea, the combination of SA with sensor networks was missing.
    Recently, researchers took this into consideration and published several work.
    Among them, one of the promising works was developed by Oliver et al. [11]. They
    reviewed three different algorithms for recognizing situations, and finally they
    introduced a distributed commitment machine algorithm for situation understanding.
    Like all event-driven systems, the speed of situation understanding depends on
    the data volume: when the data volume grows, the speed decreases significantly.
    Although existing works try to minimize the problem using the Service Oriented
    Architecture paradigm [16] and fog computing [35], among others, no complete framework
    for SA in the IoT and cloud be highlighted properly. Among different works that
    leverage the combination of clouds and the IoT to provide real-time SA, the authors
    of [8] paid attention to merging cloud computing technologies in order to offer
    new location-aware services and reduce the latency. Based on this idea, several
    academic prototypes [20], [26] as well as commercial services (ThingWorx [40]
    and SmartThings [38]) have recently emerged. At the urban scale, SmartSantander1
    introduced a city-wide experimental research where around 20,000 sensors have
    been deployed in three different locations. These sensors monitor different situations
    like parks and gardens irrigation, parking management, traffic monitoring, weather
    conditions monitoring, and others. By persuasion from SmartSantander, S. Chakrabarty
    et al. [14] depicted protected IoT engineering for keen urban communities. They
    introduced a design containing four essential IoT engineering obstacles that empower
    a protected smart city to mitigate digital assaults starting at the IoT hubs themselves.
    The authors concurred that the IoT is in its underlying stage and parcel of research
    are necessary. For SA, millions of sensors need to send a stream of data (a collection
    of unbounded data objects that may have multiple data attributes in a particular
    order) to the cloud server for storage or processing. But this is a very inefficient
    process. Instead of this approach, the data may be processed in the edge of the
    network. Inspired by this efficient approach, researchers recently proposed several
    methods of data processing in the IoT. Among them, in [15], an infrastructure
    for the IoT using fog computing, called Indie fog, was proposed. In that paper,
    the authors highlighted two types of Indie fog deployment: (1) integrated form
    and (2) collaborative form. In the integrated form, all the functionalities are
    provided by a gateway device that is integrated into the Indie fog server. On
    the other hand, in the collaborative form, all the functionalities are provided
    by a workstation as a data source. Another work is [33], where the authors used
    an existing mobile phone network as an edge node to process the data. They used
    mobile phones as they can be used as an important data source in an IoT environment.
    Other researchers [27], [21] also focused their attention on optimizing the IoT
    data processing using mobile phones. In these works, mobile data are sent to the
    fog servers, and then the fog servers send the filtered or processed data to the
    cloud servers. Data pre-processing is an important task in IoT environments, as
    data come from noisy environments that require pre-processing before analysis.
    Real-time pre-processing is necessary in many cases like stream data processing,
    and its main target is to produce high-quality data. This is a mandatory step
    that many well-known techniques like normalization, transformation, integration,
    and cleaning use. As the number of sensor data streams is large, in stream data
    pre-processing, we need an efficient solution. There are many existing pre-processing
    methods for data streams. Those techniques can be grouped into three main categories:
    instance reduction, dimensionality reduction, and feature space simplification.
    There are many kinds of instance reduction pre-processing mechanisms available.
    Of those techniques, the following three are the most popular: 1. Instance-Based
    learning Algorithm (IB) [2]: this method is good for static-type data. It works
    on the basis of a confidence interval test, and it distinguishes whether a case
    is added in the database or needs to wait until its appropriate insertion. 2.
    The Locally Weighted Forgetting (LWF) [34]: this method works on the basis of
    the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and it filters the data by discarding data whose
    weights are below the threshold. 3. Salganicoff [28]: this method can work in
    both static and dynamic environments. This method is similar to the IB method,
    but the difference is that in IB all the data are considered, but in Salganicoff
    only the newest data from the stream are considered. The main problem of this
    method is that, in order to detect new data, it stores old data in a queue, which
    requires a lot of memory. There are also different well-known techniques in dimensionality
    reduction pre-processing. Some of those techniques are as follows: 1. Katakis
    et al. [23]: in this method, a feature filter method is proposed to detect relevant
    features. This method is suitable for online data ranking (filtering). 2. Carvalho
    et al. [12]: in this method, the weight is computed by an online classifier to
    identify the feature and the feature is scored on the basis of the difference
    between the positive and the negative weights of each feature. 3. Masud et al.
    [29]: in this method, a deviation weight measure is used to distinguish the features.
    It uses an unsupervised technique like the highest frequency in the data. The
    last type of stream pre-processing is feature space simplification. In this method,
    the main target is to normalize the feature space. This algorithm returns nominal
    features that can be used for any data processing purposes. After pre-processing,
    the IoT devices that are in the environment must be discoverable so that they
    can be queried for data. An efficient look-up mechanism is necessary, but real-world
    objects are difficult to look up. So, instead of the physical look-up, it is better
    to use a virtual table where device insertion and removal can be managed dynamically.
    One of the promising works in this direction is Snoogle [43]. Our preference for
    Snoogle over more recent works like Context-Aware Dynamic Discovery of Things
    (CADDOT) [31] or agent-based discovery [13] stems from the fact that Snoogle is
    more lightweight, in addition to its security and privacy protection features
    for sensitive data. In addition, Snoogle allows the indexing of arbitrary kinds
    of terms, not just numeric ones. Snoogle assigns keywords to sensors as well as
    links with the associated descriptions of the sensors. Then, it stores the keyword
    with the description in storage with appropriate indexing. Each Index Point (IP)
    is linked with all the sensors that are connected to it as every sensor in the
    same area will be assigned the same IP. This way, a two-tier hierarchy is used
    to maintain two types of IPs. In the top tier, it keeps the key IP, and in the
    bottom tier, it maintains all the IPs that are associated with the key IP. Here,
    the user may perform two types of queries: (1) a local query, which is performed
    in a specific IP, and (2) a global query or distributed query, where the user
    search is placed in the key IP. For this search every IP needs to be flooded to
    find the specific sensor object (see Fig. 3). From the above study, we found that
    IoT-based SA has become the cornerstone of smart city development with a push
    for connected objects, connected devices, and connected everything. So, with the
    aim of overcoming the disadvantages of the systems mentioned above and inspired
    by [27], [44], [37], we introduced Edge computing framework for SA in IoT-based
    smart cities. Download : Download high-res image (251KB) Download : Download full-size

    Proposed framework for situation detection The primary purpose of the proposed
    framework is to detect the current situation that represent the state of transportation,
    healthcare, security and other aspects in a smart city. Efficient situation understanding
    allows the city officials to provide services to the citizens and perform actions
    accordingly. The process of situation detection and awareness lies in the understanding
    of how the raw IoT data is propagated from the distributed deployment sources
    to the application level for the decision makers. We propose a layered approach
    to demonstrate this data propagation, as shown in Fig. 4. The figure shows that
    the data propagation is accomplished in four steps, which are described in the
    following: Download : Download high-res image (292KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Proposed situation detection steps from sensor data. 3.1. Raw data
    stream capture/processing The first step of situation detection is to capture
    and process the raw IoT data. However, if the raw data are sent directly to the
    remote cloud server for processing, the battery life will be reduced drastically.
    For this reason different on-line and off-line mechanism like data compression,
    aggregation and query modeling is applied to reduce the energy consumption cost.
    In our proposed approach, IoT data is annotated with its location and frequency
    of creation. We used ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) model
    [9], which we will explain in later section, sufficiently matches our case where
    we have a large set of data that we want to split and process into separate processing
    units, i.e. in the edge servers. Fig. 5 demonstrates how the sensors are connected
    to the edge server. According to this figure, let us consider we have total number
    of sensors that have the common objective as represented in the function . In
    our proposed technique each sensor has an identity with the format [ ]. We use
    this kind of format for two reasons: one is for effective lookup from large collection
    of sensor and another is for mobility. Also this type of naming is human friendly.
    In smart city many of the sensors are mobile so traditional static IP or GUID
    (global identifier) will not work as we may need to update the sensor dynamically.
    To illustrate, we provide an example as: say a mobile sensor like a cell phone
    GPS (phone having id and GPS having id ) is tracking and currently it is in a
    building called then our system will generate a dynamic id for the mobile device
    as . It should be noted here that for every communication, we need IP or other
    protocol so this dynamic name will be mapped with IP address/MAC address/URI.
    As many of the sensors in a smart city are mobile, all the connection between
    the sensors and edge will be logical connection. All the streams that are produced
    by IoT devices are splitted into data objects which are called edge objects (see
    Fig. 5). These edge objects are sent to the edge servers for further processing.
    The structure of this edge object and the data distribution process are described
    in the following sections. Download : Download high-res image (220KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Proposed distributed IoT data processing through
    the edge servers. 3.1.1. Edge object structure In order to make the edge objects
    each node samples the sensor stream data with a fixed window size. Each edge object
    is constituted with ID, data and properties. ID is an identifier (that we described
    earlier), data contain the IoT data and properties contain functional or control
    information that are necessary to perform the operation in the edge. Each edge
    server extracts the data from the edge object and performs operation based on
    the control message that is in the properties segment in the edge object. Fig.
    6 represents the XML structure of all the properties like , etc. of edge object.

    Fig. 6. Edge object properties as a xml format. 3.1.2. Data distribution As there
    are lot of devices, distributed processing is required for data analysis. Processing
    multiple data streams in a centralized cloud server is inefficient. Instead of
    this if the data is processed through the edge server the overall performance
    will be improved significantly. And this way a decentralized and parallel processing
    of IoT data can be achieved. But the question is how to send the data to decentralized
    processing units without significant loss of performance? We found that ADMM [9]
    provides a technique that is used to solve classical convex optimization problem.
    In this approach it breaks a problem into some smaller problems so that each smaller
    task can be handled in an easier way. We can represent our distributed processing
    of data through ADMM. We have N number of IoT devices that have a common objective
    function and our target is to minimize (Eq. (1)) the data or filter through the
    edge server so that only the refined data can be sent to the cloud server for
    further storage or situation visualization. (1) where is a global variable that
    is unknown and refers to the term with respect to the th sensor. Now let be a
    local variable and be a common global variable then the above equation can be
    rewritten as: (2) where which is originally called the global consensus problem
    [10], since the constraint is that all the local variables should agree, i.e.,
    should be equal. The augmented Lagrangian of problem Eq. (2) can be further written
    as: (3) The resulting ADMM algorithm from Eq. (3) is: (4) ≔ (5) ≔ where represents
    closest neighbor set of the th devices. (6) ≔ The first step (Eq. (4)) and last
    step (Eq. (6)) are preformed individually in each edge, and the second step (Eq.
    (5)) is completed in the cloud server. 3.2. Unified representation The second
    step of data propagation is to convert the processed IoT data to a uniform representation
    before storing them in the off-line storage. This is important as the result of
    processed IoT data of many sensors needs to overlap and needs to give a combined
    output. For example, consider the processing of weather condition for a given
    area. Here we need to merge the result from many sensors that are producing data
    in different pattern, format etc. So before sending the data to the cloud server
    we can pass the data to a model to extract a unified representation. In our proposed
    model the edge server output data is converted to a unified format such as ‘what–when–where’
    structure. For the unified representation we used the concept  [7], which is actually
    a series of questions that extract appropriate result from a problem. This approach
    is popular in software process and project management. Table 1 demonstrates the
    list of questionnaire and the data type it will produce in each of the case of
    principle. Table 1. Principle used to uniform the sensor data. Principle Data
    type Example data data is generated Sensor specific data Temperature, wind_direction,
    wind_speed data is taken Date time 10/10/2016 10 am, yesterday 1 pm the data is
    coming Sensor location Indoor, Outdoor, Home, Office, Bed Room1 is generating
    the data Sensor id 1, 2, tempS1, humidityS1 (in what condition) Sensor state/activity
    Motion, Hot weather long data is generating How long Ten minutes, one hour much
    resources is needed Meta data Data length, data type 3.3. Aggregation All the
    unified represented data are stored in the cloud server and are fed to a visual
    display or control center to trigger any event. The unifiedly represented data
    is aggregated to produce the situation. In the aggregation step the unified data
    is converted to a 2-dimensional spatial representation for easy visualization
    and mapping at the situation level. It combines data and represents in an image
    like representation, which we call Situation Image (S-image). Each S-image has
    mainly 2 parts: S-image element and S-image set. Each S-image element is a collection
    of key–value pair where key is the state or factor name (i.e. temperature, humidity,
    sound etc.) and the value is the cumulative value for the key that is calculated
    from the edge server. It should be noted here that in a real world environment
    besides the and the system needs to store more information like location ( , ),
    meta data ( , ) etc. In the real scenario continuous Situation Image will be generated
    over a period. The continuously generated finite set of situation images is called
    situation image set or S-image set. Fig. 7 demonstrates the structure of a S-image
    set. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. S-image set. 3.4. Situation representation We know that situation
    is a set of information of an environment over a period of time. So our S-image
    set that we described in earlier section can actually be used to produce the situation.
    This process is actually a classification task where each cell of the situation
    image represents a particular event. We can model the situation modeling through
    the classical situation calculus [25]. According to situation calculus a situation
    is a series of actions which is started with a special situation called initial
    situation . In our case is the situation that is generated from the first S-image
    over a period of time. According to situation calculus a new situation will be
    created from the initial situation when an action is triggered. In our S-image
    set continuous S-image is created. This does not mean that all the S-image will
    be used for situation generation. The next situation will be generated if any
    action is triggered or if the value of some S-image element crosses certain threshold,
    . Sometimes actions may have some preconditions. For example if we say open the
    camera if the location is free. This task can be written as , here is a special
    function that is used for the execution of an action. The process of data capture
    to situation representation is illustrated in the following Algorithm 1. Download

    a simplified view of all the 4 steps that we just described. Consider a sound
    sensor (microphone) data is being partitioned into edge object and is being sent
    to the edge network, the edge server processes the data based on the properties
    and finally applies and sends the result to the cloud server. The cloud server
    aggregates the data that it receives from edges and finally the S-image is created
    by proper placement of the situation elements. The situation image is stored in
    the cloud storage to calculate the situation. Download : Download high-res image

    architecture. 4. System architecture In this section we present different components
    of our proposed architecture and their functional descriptions. The components
    of the system are depicted in Fig. 9 as a block diagram. The architecture has
    four main components: Device Module, Edge network, IoT Cloud Middleware and Subscribers.
    The device module includes sensors and other objects that may sense the environment.
    In reality things that can produce time dependent data series may be considered
    as a sensor. Edge network is the network of servers that will work as a processing
    unit for the sensors. IoT Cloud Middleware is responsible to publish the message
    and subscribe the clients to receive the messages. This module is also responsible
    for message routing. Finally the subscribers receive the services from the system.
    In our case the display devices where the situation for the city will be presented
    are considered as the subscribers. Generally any object that wants to receive
    data from the platform may be considered as a subscriber. It is also possible
    for an object to be both a publisher and subscriber. We provide the functional
    description of each of the four components in the following sections: Download
    : Download high-res image (66KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10.
    MQTT topic. 4.1. Device module This module is responsible for all the physical
    or logical linkage between the IoT device and the edge network. Usually by using
    different standard communication technology like NFC (Near Field Communication),
    GSM, WLAN, GPS and sensor networks together with SIM-card technology etc. are
    used to connect the device module to the physical sensors. For every connection
    mechanism it is important to save the bandwidth. The data from the sensors to
    the edge network may be transferred either asynchronously or synchronously. The
    main functionality of the device module is to send data but these modules also
    sense control message that are generated by the IoT middleware (i.e it act as
    a publisher). The control message is important in many cases to control the sensors.
    For example zoom, pan, tilt and resolution functionality control of a camera sensor,
    precision, accuracy, sensitivity, range, calibration control of temperature, humidity,
    accelerometer, IR, distance sensors. 4.2. Edge network In the traditional IoT
    the sensor data is sent to the cloud server for processing. But in this centralized
    approach has lot of scalability problem. A better solution if we process the data
    in the edge of the network and send the refined data to the cloud the overall
    performance will be enhanced significantly. In the previous section we presented
    our technique about how to process the data in the edge server. We found that
    today a huge number of WSN based multi-interface cellular base station is using
    in cellular network. Using this WSN the IoT devices can be connected, may be moving
    and send data to the edge server at any time. Edge node can be directly connected
    with the WSN or may connect with the core switch. Cellular core network has two
    main components one is the data plane and the other is the control plane. The
    data plane is responsible to route the data to its destination and control plane
    is responsible to control the network. 4.3. IoT cloud middleware In our proposed
    architecture we introduced a cloud based IoT middleware that controls and processes
    IoT data. IoT cloud Middleware has the following three modules: 4.3.1. IoT cloud
    controller The main functionality of this module is to coordinate synchronized
    communication with other modules as well as to perform system management services.
    The controller sends or receives messages from the Distributed Message Broker
    to create message route between subscribers and IoT devices. The controller also
    maintains a repository of IoT data and different meta-data information that are
    necessary to discover, filter and manage the different services. In our architecture
    we prefer to use Apache Cassandra [4] for storage management. Our preference on
    Cassandra over other NoSQL database (like MongoDB) or other HDFS based cloud storage
    is due to its ability to scale while still being reliable. It is possible to deploy
    Cassandra across multiple servers without lots of overhead. A distributed processing
    engine is responsible to process unbounded streams of data specially in case of
    real-time processing. Finally as the IoT devices are developed by different manufactures
    without following a common standard, interoperability becomes a big issue. In
    our architecture we achieved interoperability between the devices and the platform
    by using SOAP based Web Services [39]. 4.3.2. Distributed message broker Generally
    a message broker is a program that can receive message, translate it and finally
    can send. As we already discussed in earlier section that pub/sub based message
    delivery is the most popular in IoT scenario, we used MQTT [30] based pub/sub
    distributed message delivery mechanism for asynchronous messaging. Unlike REST’s
    GET/POST method of data send MQTT clients publish and subscribe to a dynamic or
    predefined topic. A topic is a string and consists of one or more topic level.
    Using this kind of structure we can create a user friendly and self descriptive
    naming structure. For example in Fig. 10 we can group all the temperature sensors
    that are located in the ground floor living room of my house. So when any subscriber
    subscribes to my home ground floor living room, temperature sensors will receive
    all the temperature sensors update that are located to this location. In this
    way all the subscribers exchange asynchronous messages using a simple and light
    weight topic level. 4.4. Subscribers Subscribers are those who want to consume
    service, which can be a user or a device or any other source that are sending
    the message. In the architecture, clients can discover and subscribe to the system
    through the cloud controller. It should be noted here that a single software program
    may have both sensor and client role in the system. For example a face detection
    subscriber may produce face video data as well as may look face image inside the
    video through appropriate subscription to the system. 5. Implementation and result
    This section describes the implementation details of the prototype system that
    reflects the architecture presented in Section 4. 5.1. Experimental setup A prototype
    implementation of our framework is developed using JDK version 8 and Laravel Framework
    5.6. The goal of our implementation is to test the performance of our approach.
    In order to test the performance we used two well known open IoT dataset (CityPulse
    [32] and City of Chicago [17]). Several dataset exist in the web for IoT but we
    selected those two for our experiment because of its availability in different
    formats and real-time access through api. In our setup we used Amazon AWS2 cloud
    based elastic computing infrastructure and for the edge server we used eight personal
    computers (specification: 2.9 GHz Core i5, 8 GB RAM, Windows 10). All the edge
    computers were connected to the Amazon AWS through Gigabit Ethernet. We performed
    our test in two cases (off-line and real-time) one is in batch mode and another
    is in the real mode. In the off-line mode we programmed a special component in
    our system that can take the data from the dataset and pass it to the edge modules.
    For our test we created total four EC2 instances and S3 storage in Amazon AWS.
    For the real scenario we setup a set of sensors as listed in Table 2 on some predefined
    locations in our city. We selected the location in a manner that we can freely
    access the environment. The area is approximately . Fig. 11 shows a map view of
    the deployment. In this map view different pin in the map is representing the
    different nodes. We installed nodes to detect light level, environment noise level,
    temperature of the environment, traffic presence specially car presence. After
    selecting the test bed location our main challenge was to place the sensor nodes
    in appropriate locations as well as to provide uninterrupted power. Practically
    it is more convenient to use solar energy for battery charges; we used small solar
    panel to charge the node batteries. Solar power has the main problem the battery
    power may be finished during the night but we placed our nodes in the road side
    lamppost (as illustrated by the picture in Fig. 12.a) which is powered at night
    by the municipality authority. Some of our nodes need more power we connected
    those nodes in the lamppost so that it can be functional at night. We developed
    a multi-modal sensor node as shown in Fig. 12.b). Each sensor node contains camera,
    distance, motion, and temperature sensor. Finally we used a metal box to protect
    the sensor node from weather or human access. In this scenario we consider the
    mobile phone as an edge processing unit. If any specific event is currently occurring
    in the city the system will alert the city officials that are subscribed to that
    service. User also can report the occurrence of such events and it will automatically
    be propagated to other eligible subscribers. Table 2. Sensors used for our testing.

    to evaluate the performance of our prototype we conducted several measurement
    studies. All those studies can be used to justify the acceptability of our approach.
    At first we test the performance of our system with the datasets that we listed
    in the previous section and then we test the processing time and situation detection
    performance by using the real test environment. Download : Download high-res image

    space free during the six month period. 5.2.1. Processing time in off-line scenario
    We run our prototype in off-line mode with some predefined cases. In the first
    case we selected the parking data from CityPulse [32] dataset, in this subset
    8 parking lots information from City of Aarhus was recorded that was taken 6 months
    duration and contains total 55,264 data points. We developed a thread hook that
    will fetch the data from the dataset and split to Edge object and finally send
    to the edge servers and after processing the result will combine and send to the
    cloud server, the cloud server then annotate the data for situation processing.
    Through this test the system will show the situation of each parking lot (average
    percentage of busy) during the 6 month period. We calculate the same operation
    with and without our edge processing technique. The situation result is demonstrating
    in Fig. 13. According to this figure we see that most of the time the parking
    was free and to calculate this result our approach required 102 ms whereas the
    non edge version of the system consumed 3.5 s to produce the result. The Chicago
    park management authority maintains different sensors (humidity, pressure, wind
    speed, temperature etc.) to monitor the public space. Using this open data3 we
    test the performance of our prototype. The dataset contains total 66,111 samples;
    each sample contains different sensors data (Air Temperature, Wet Bulb Temperature,
    Humidity, Rain Intensity, Interval Rain, Total Rain, Wind Direction, Wind Speed,
    Barometric Pressure, Solar Radiation etc.). Among this data we used Temperature,
    Humidity, Wind Speed and Pressure data for our experiment that are plotted in
    the graph representing in Fig. 14. We passed this data to our prototype with objective
    function , by this objective function it take the data and average the data points
    and finally send the filtered data to the cloud server for situation, we compared
    the system result with the graph. Our result is almost identical as shown in Fig.
    14 and for the test it consumed total 400 ms where as the non edge version of
    the system consumed 10.5 s for the operation. Download : Download high-res image

    system. 5.2.2. Processing time in real-time scenario In order to measure how our
    system is performing in terms of time we embedded monitoring hooks in the system
    and recorded the response time. Finally we analyse the processing time from the
    sensor node to the subscribers by using the following Eq. (7). (7) In this equation
    and are the processing time of the edge and cloud platform respectively. and are
    the transmission delay to send the data from the sensors to the edge and from
    edge to the cloud servers, is the sensor’s average sensing time from the environment,
    and is the user receiving time. As the edge devices are with close proximity with
    the sensors, the time is approximately zero, so the actual delay will be . After
    any event occur in the environment the system approximately requires  ms to finish
    the task. In our test the sensor processing time is 352 ms, network delay from
    edge to cloud is  ms and total processing time in edge and cloud is  ms respectively
    and delay in the user is  ms. In Fig. 15 the performance of the sensor and cloud
    platform modules is depicted. 5.2.3. Situation detection In order to test the
    situation detection performance we monitor the environment approximately 4 weeks
    and calculated the number of events occurred versus the event detected by our
    method. Out of approximately 181 different events like high temperature, low humidity,
    hot sunny day our prototype can able to detect 176 events perfectly. Sometimes
    our algorithm shows misleading information due to the communication delay as well
    as the server load. Fig. 16 demonstrates the situation detection performance over
    temperature sensors that we used in our prototype test case. There are total 5506
    temperature raise or drop during the measured days. As we performed our test during
    sunny day we consider the threshold temperature as 25 °C. So a separate sensor
    is placed in the same location where the nodes are located to calculate the actual
    temperature raise or fall from the threshold. From this analysis we found that
    our cloud system produced almost identical result as the actual data. It should
    be noted here that sometimes our system shows more raise or drop than the actual
    because sometime for a continuous run or direct sunlight the temperature sensor
    shows out performance. 5.3. Qualitative results We have performed usability tests
    to qualitatively measure the proposed system. The usability test consists of ten
    volunteers of different age groups and academic backgrounds. The users were requested
    to use the developed prototype. Based on their situation observation they were
    asked to answer several questions. The answers to the questions are in the range
    of 1–5 (the higher the rating, the greater the satisfaction) on a Likert scale.
    Fig. 17 shows the users’ responses in percentages. The responses show the suitability
    of the proposed system. 6. Conclusion SA ensures that the right information goes
    to the right people for faster and more efficient communication, especially in
    the event of an emergency. The question is, given the huge volume of data generated
    by different IoT devices, is it an important issue to know which data need to
    be selected and processed? For SA, it is important to process raw low-level IoT
    data at different levels and generate high-level abstract information for decision-makers.
    In this paper, we presented an edge computing framework for SA in an IoT-based
    smart city environment. We performed several quantitative and qualitative studies
    with our implemented prototype. Our study shows that processing raw IoT data at
    the edge devices is effective in terms of latency and provides situational awareness
    for the decision makers. In future we want to evaluate the system further to measure
    the performance in more real world scenario. We believe that the proposed edge
    computing framework for SA in an IoT-based smart city environment will bring new
    direction in the IoT research. Acknowledgment This work was supported by the Information

    in high demand with the increase of network devices. With the development of technologies
    such as 5G, machine learning, edge computing, and Industry 4.0, the Internet of
    Things has evolved. This survey article discusses the evolution of the Internet
    of Things and presents the vision for Internet of Things 2.0. The Internet of
    Things 2.0 development is discussed across seven major fields. These fields are
    machine learning intelligence, mission critical communication, scalability, energy
    harvesting-based energy sustainability, interoperability, user friendly IoT, and
    security. Other than these major fields, the architectural development of the
    Internet of Things and major types of applications are also reviewed. Finally,

    of Things” (IoT) was first coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 [1]. The International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU) has formally defined IoT as, “A global infrastructure
    for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical
    and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and
    communication technologies [2].” This definition can be viewed as the basis of
    IoT technologies. There is an increasing demand for the IoT applications and technologies
    worldwide. It is predicted that networked devices will increase from 18 billion
    in 2017 to 28.5 billion in 2022, and Machine to machine (M2M) connections will
    reach 15 billion in 2022 [3]. With recent advancements in the fifth-generation
    of mobile telecommunications technology (5G), high speed and low latency networks
    will further facilitate the development of IoT technologies and applications [4].
    However, with the recent advancement of other technologies and application such
    as, machine learning, edge computing, and Industry 4.0, there is a need to update
    and redefine the concept of IoT towards IoT 2.0 [4]–[6]. There are many industry
    and public mentions of IoT 2.0 visions. Many of them focus on improving IoT application
    productivity and service quality with the vision of users [7]–[9]. AI-driven service
    development is viewed as a way to enhance service quality [10]. IoT interoperability
    is another field that attracted attention for IoT 2.0 [11]. Other than these fields,
    security and privacy vulnerabilities are also mentioned as issues to be solved
    in the next generation IoT systems [12]. A potential solution to reinforce IoT
    security and privacy could be blockchain [13]. At the Samsung Developer Conference
    2019, interoperability, security, connectivity, and automation of IoT applications
    are major fields of further development in the IoT 2.0 vision [14]. Other than
    this conference, a report [15] from the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European
    Commission concluded that IoT 2.0 should utilize machine learning technologies
    to enhance the generated intelligence and knowledge available to users. In this
    process, interpolation is an issue that limits the advancement of specialized
    edge services. Therefore, approaches toward integration and standardization are
    inevitable for the evolution of IoT and further development of IoT applications.
    Compared to the enthusiasm in the industry, academic works on the concept of IoT
    2.0 are limited. In [16], an IoT 2.0 platform is proposed. This platform integrates
    application development, deployment, and sharing. Interoperability is featured
    as a key function of the IoT 2.0 platform [16], [17]. The authors of [18] demonstrated
    the “Identity of Things” as an IoT 2.0 component. IoT applications should also
    be identified by their manufacturers to avoid security issues generated by any
    criminal parties [18]. In [19], an IoT 2.0 conceptual framework is developed to
    emphasize the usability of IoT and systems for end-users. Distributed intelligence
    powered by artificial intelligence (AI) is discussed in [20] and recognized as
    an aspect of IoT 2.0. The above works only describe one or a few aspects of advancement
    in IoT. Also, the authors of [21] concluded that very few existing survey papers
    had connected different aspects of IoT. Therefore, the primary objective of this
    article is to provide an in-depth analysis of recent IoT advancement and define
    the concept of IoT 2.0. This article surveys the recent development of IoT technology
    over the period 2015–2020 in seven dimensions as IoT 2.0. These dimensions include
    machine learning intelligence, mission critical icommunication, IoT scalability,
    IoT sustainability, IoT interoperability, user friendly IoT, and IoT security
    shielding the previous six aspects from external attacks (Figure 1). The contributions
    of this article are: Discussion of recent IoT architectures. Identifying challenges
    and limitations on practical IoT applications. Conclude and analyze recent research
    trend. Establishing visions of IoT in future sixth-generation of mobile telecommunications
    technology (6G) environment. The rest of this article is structured as follows.
    Section II provides an overview of related technologies and concepts. Section
    III examines the IoT architectures. Sections IV and V elaborate on the usage of
    machine learning techniques and the requirements of mission critical applications.
    Then, Section VI describes different types of scalability and scalability enabled
    by software defined networks (SDN). Sections VII and VIII establish the security
    and performance requirements of IoT 2.0. After that, Section IX focuses on energy

    existing standards. Section XI illustrates user friendly IoT as the final dimension
    of IoT 2.0. Section XII addresses the recent development of IoT applications.

    followed by Section XIV the conclusion. FIGURE 1. IoT 2.0 concepts. Show All SECTION
    II. Technologies and Concepts Underlying IoT 2.0 A. 5G The authors of [22] revealed
    the requirements of 5G-based IoT as high data rate, highly scalable and fine-grained
    networks, very low latency, reliability, resilience, security, long battery lifetime,
    connection density and mobility. Therefore, 5G grants IoT applications the capability
    to provide better services by gathering more data in a faster and more secure
    channel. Furthermore, 5G networks could support the development of next-generation
    IoT applications. In this subsection, the 5G enabling technologies are reviewed.
    Wireless Network Function virtualization (WNFV) is a major part of 5G networks.
    It not only enables network services to be run through software, but also enables
    wireless networks to be managed more efficiency and provide better Quality of
    Service (QoS). Network slicing is key technology within 5G which is built on top
    of the WNFV to create logically separate networks and provide end-to-end QoS guarantees
    [23]. 5G Heterogeneous networks have evolved to improve the speed of data transmission.
    To reduce latency, multi-tier cell architectures are deployed to offload data
    from higher tier centralized cells to lower-tier distributed cells. Lower tier
    cells are closer to the end users. Hence, latency is reduced [24]. Advanced spectrum
    sharing and interference management enable wider coverage area and higher traffic
    load balance [24]. To further improve spectral efficiency, device to device (D2D)
    communication technology is also included in 5G networks. This technology allows
    users in close distance to communicate without a base station. Therefore, D2D
    communication improves not only spectral efficiency but also provides high throughput
    and energy efficiency [22]. One key enabler of real-time applications is edge
    computing. As edge computing enables low latency data transmission, real-time
    smart applications can be developed to provide high quality services [25]. Therefore,
    in a 5G network age, integration of AI and edge computing enhanced IoT will significantly
    enhance the quality of user experience [22]. B. Tactile Internet The authors from
    [26] highlighted that Tactile Internet includes human to machine interactions
    through haptic devices. They view Tactile Internet on the same level as IoT and
    5G. Therefore, revealing the common properties of Tactile Internet, IoT and 5G
    as low latency, ultra-high availability, Human to Human (H2H)/M2M co-existence,
    data-centric technologies and security. However, the authors from [27] interprets
    Tactile Internet as another domain addressed by the low latency requirement of
    5G and actuated by the wireless communications of IoT. Based on the properties
    of Tactile Internet from [27], the authors of [28] further categorized the challenges
    of Tactile Internet into communications, haptics, artificial intelligence, and
    computation. Communication challenges are higher data rates, ultra-low latency,
    high reliability, and support of cloud/fog network overheads. These requirements
    are almost identical to the properties of 5G networks. Therefore, communication
    requirements can be resolved under the environment of 5G. Low latency services
    also require artificial intelligence and computation power. Artificial intelligence
    can be leveraged to predict future actions to compensate for latency. Furthermore,
    artificial intelligence is also the basis of intelligent services. Similar to
    artificial intelligence, faster computation also reduces the impact of latency.
    It also supports computation for artificial intelligence and real-time haptic
    services. The authors of [29] provided six use cases of Tactile Internet applications.
    The first use case is health care. An example of a health care application is
    exoskeletons for disabled people. The exoskeleton can detect changes in human
    muscle to perform certain movements. However, tactile latency is required to ensure
    safety. Exoskeletons can also be used for education and sports. It can be used
    in virtual training centers so that students can train in any location. Another
    use case is traffic. Tactile Internet enables fully autonomous traffic, where
    vehicles can react instantly to incoming humans on the street. Therefore, this
    system aims to prevent any injury or death from traffic accidents. This also enhances
    the performance of monitoring. The usage of free-viewpoint video provides multi-perspective
    monitoring for users [29]. In the industrial sector, Tactile Internet enables
    mobile robots for production, reducing any human injuries during production. The
    last use case is the smart grid. Using Tactile Internet, low latency networks
    can synchronize the usage of power to the suppliers. This allows the suppliers
    to precisely adjust the reactive power, preventing wastage of power. C. Edge Computing
    The aim of edge computing is to reduce bandwidth usage and latency for an IoT
    network. From Figure 2, as a major task of edge computing, machine learning is
    highly deployable on edge devices [30]. Edge computing is an enabler of low latency
    and real-time AI applications. In this subsection, the major architectures of
    edge computing are discussed. FIGURE 2. Major tasks of edge computing [30]. Show
    All There are three significant architectures of edge computing: fog computing,
    mobile edge computing (MEC) and cloudlet computing [30]. Fog computing is an extension
    of traditional cloud computing with fog computing nodes [30]. These fog computing
    nodes are placed between the end devices and a centralized cloud. The function
    of these fog computing nodes is to aggregate heterogeneous data from different
    sources. Furthermore, the fog computing nodes act as an interface to access these
    heterogeneous data, protecting any user from the heterogeneity of data. In the
    second architecture, MEC, is designed for cellular networks [30]. Unlike fog computing
    nodes, MEC nodes utilize both computational and storage capabilities. The functionality
    of these nodes can be modified through virtualization interfaces. Hence, MEC nodes
    can provide flexible, low latency, and real-time services to mobile end users.
    Finally, cloudlet computing is implemented with a cloudlet, which is a virtualized
    server that is one hop away from the end user [30]. Cloudlets are able to store
    provisional resources. Therefore, this architecture also can provide end users
    with flexible, low latency, and real-time services [31]. Based on these major
    architectures, there are also further enhancements in IoT networks improving energy
    efficiency [32], [33] and data reliability [34]. In conclusion, the major edge
    computing architectures are implemented with extended servers or nodes near the
    end users. The common purposes of these nodes are reducing latency, providing
    computation or storage capabilities, and delivering real-time services to end
    users. In a 5G environment, these node properties are the basis of intelligent
    services pushed by big data transmission and processing. Tactile Internet and
    Industry 4.0 also drive potential application requirements for IoT 2.0. D. Industry
    4.0 The authors of [35, p.835] defined Industry 4.0 as “the fourth industry revolution.”
    The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is the basis of this revolution. The authors of
    [5] revealed that “CPS are industrial automation systems that integrate innovative
    functionalities through networking to enable connection of the operations of the
    physical reality with computing and communication infrastructure.” This definition
    shows that CPSs require heterogeneous data from multiple sources. As a result,
    data analytics techniques are suitable for implementing intelligence as part of
    the CPS service. The authors of [5] also pointed out that methods for processing
    data remain a challenge for these CPS applications. Hence, the implementation
    of big data analytics and machine learning are essential for the development of
    Industry 4.0. The amount of data generated by intelligent CPSs is difficult for
    a centralized cloud architecture to process. Inevitably, edge computing is used
    to distribute the load for data processing. Also, edge computing devices are closer
    to the end users. Therefore, it ensures lower latency of a service [36]. E. Machine
    Learning IoT data processing is a challenge due to the 5V (volume, velocity, variety,
    veracity, and value) features of these data [37]. Data analytics techniques like
    machine learning can process data with complex 5V features [38]. Furthermore,
    applying machine learning on heterogeneous IoT data ensures intelligence to IoT
    applications, providing better and efficient services. The major types of machine
    learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning
    [39]. The supervised learning methods use input data with expected outcomes to
    lead the learning process of a machine learning model. On the other hand, the
    expected outcome is not provided when training an unsupervised learning model.
    An unsupervised learning model is built through clustering and other statistical
    methods [40]. Reinforcement learning models perform actions with input features
    or state of the current environment. This model learns from the return reward
    of the action and improves through trial-and-error [41]. SECTION III. IoT Architectures
    In this section, technical improvements of current IoT architectures are revealed
    through a detailed analysis of novel IoT architectures under the environment of
    5G, Tactile Internet, and Industry 4.0. There are many different IoT architectures
    [42]–[50]. The authors in [42] aggregated the conventional IoT architectures into
    a layered architecture of six layers. From Figure 3, this architecture consists
    of the physical layer, the perception layer, the network layer, the middleware/cloud
    layer, the application layer, and the business layer. With the assumption that
    end devices have limited power, memory and computational resource, the perception
    layer or the end devices in the perception layer are only responsible for data
    collection and transfer. Therefore, all data is transmitted to the middleware/cloud
    layer for further processing. For applications with extensive data flows like
    virtual reality and augmented reality, the throughput and latency of data transmission
    cannot meet the requirements of real-time, perhaps mission critical service. Therefore,
    novel IoT architectures are needed in this new era of 5G, Tactile Internet, and
    Industry 4.0 [43], [51], [52]. FIGURE 3. Layered conventional IoT architecture
    [42]. Show All Similar to conventional IoT architecture, the recent IoT architectures
    reviewed in this paper also contain end-devices and cloud layers. On the other
    hand, the most significant difference is the utilization of an edge/fog layer
    in the recent IoT architecture to provide real-time services, data analytics,
    and data processing functionalities near the end devices. The combination of machine
    learning models for data analytics services is one of the drivers for these recent
    architectures [43]–[50]. Figure 4 shows the layers with the functions of these
    recent IoT architectures. As an architecture providing basic edge computing, the
    authors followed a three-layered design. This design consists of the IoT end device
    layer, the fog/edge layer, and the cloud layer. The IoT end device layer is similar
    to the perception layer of the conventional IoT architecture. This layer also
    contains IoT sensors, actuators, and end devices for data collection and transmission.
    Data is passed to the fog/Edge layer to perform analytical procedures and processed
    for a higher-level layer. The final layer of the three-layered architecture is
    the cloud layer, providing a platform for centralized data analytics, storage,
    and decision making [44]–[46]. Comparing the above recent architectures with conventional
    IoT architectures, the involvement of the edge computing layer is the root of
    the changes between architectures. FIGURE 4. Recent IoT layered architectures.
    Show All The authors of [47] separated the cloud layer into a cloud layer and
    a new network core layer. This layer connects the cloud layer with the fog/edge
    layer. Also, it provides a flexible and scalable interface for controlling the
    fog/edge layers [47], [50]. This interface is also developed between the data
    edge/fog layer and the IoT end device layer. More specifically, the network domain
    and the communication layer have similar functions to the network layer of the
    conventional IoT architecture. These layers create a link between the end devices
    and the fog/edge level devices. Also, as a 5G process, the communication layer
    facilitates advanced spectrum sharing and interference management for D2D communication
    [43], [49]. The application layer is above the cloud layer. For different IoT
    applications, the application layer is different. However, in the recent IoT architectures,
    the application layer commonly acts as a software interface to control lower layers.
    Services could be deployed on the cloud level and the edge/fog level to provide
    centralized high-level services and distributed, real-time services, respectively
    [43], [48]–[50]. The authors of [43] proposed an eight-layer IoT architecture.
    Different from the previous architectures, the data storage layer, the collaboration/process
    layer, and security aspects are added to consider the security and performance
    requirements under the 5G environment. The data storage layer stores raw data
    from the edge/fog layers. This expands the limited memory of edge devices and
    prepared for services with high volume traffic. The second layer, collaboration/process
    layer, is designed for modern business settings. It allows collaboration from
    different personnel. Finally, security is recognized as a concept applied to all
    layers to protect them against possible external attacks. SECTION IV. Machine
    Learning Intelligence This section presents the machine learning intelligence
    applications. As a start, the relevant supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement,
    and other relevant machine learning algorithms are introduced. Then, the usage
    of machine learning on the physical layer, the network layer, the edge computing
    layer, and the cloud layer are introduced. On the physical layer, machine learning
    helps end devices perform energy preservation scheduling and physical layer communication.
    Then, this section demonstrates the usage of machine learning to improve network
    layer performance and reduce management overhead. After that, edge layer devices
    and motivations of applying machine learning on edge are described. Finally, this
    section focuses on the collaboration between the cloud layer and the edge layer.
    A. Machine Learning Algorithms 1) Supervised Learning Algorithms In supervised
    learning, the model learns through reducing the output of the cost function, which
    usually represents the model prediction and the true value. The major supervised
    learning methods are linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines
    (SVM), Naïve Bayes classifiers, and k-nearest neighbors. Some deep learning algorithms,
    including artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN),
    and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are suitable for supervised learning [53].
    There is a wide range of applications of supervised learning. For example, in
    the field of computer vision, many CNN-based applications are established in smart
    healthcare [54], smart home, smart city, smart energy, agriculture, education,
    industry, government, sports, retail, and IoT infrastructure [55]. The rest of
    this subsection explains some of the supervised learning algorithms. a: Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) SVM is created to solve binary classification problems [56].
    The aim of SVM is to create a hyperplane over a multidimensional space to separate
    the data points of this space into two classes. The SVM model can be represented
    by Equation (1) [56]. In this equation y is the output class as a sign of positive
    and negative, ω is the weight vector, x is the input vector and b is the scalar
    bias factor. y=sign(ω⋅x+b) (1) View Source From Figure 5, the distance between
    the two classes can be represented by Equation (2) [56], where ||ω|| is the Euclidean
    distance. D= 2 ||ω|| (2) View Source FIGURE 5. Support vector machine. Show All
    The parameter ω is obtained through maximizing the distance D with minimum classification
    error. Therefore, the optimization problem can be defined as Equation (3) [56].
    Φ(ω)= 1 2 ||ω| | 2 (3) View Source As indicated by [56], optimization of Equation
    (3) is a quadratic optimization problem, which could be solved through constructing
    a Lagrangian function as Equation (4), where α i are the Lagrange multipliers.
    L(ω,b,α)= 1 2 ||ω| | 2 − ∑ i=1 l α i { y i (ω⋅ x i +b)−1} (4) View Source The
    SVM described above are only suitable for linearly separable datasets. However,
    extensions as soft margin SVM and kernel SVM are all capable of handling non-linear
    datasets. Another form of SVM is the multiclass SVM, which is capable of classifying
    between more than two classes [56]. b: Support Vector Regression (SVR) SVM can
    also be extended to solve regression problems [56]. The generic SVR function is
    defined by Equation (5) [56], where Φ transforms non-linear inputs of x into a
    higher dimension, the vector w and scalar b should be optimized to minimize the
    regression risk function defined by Equation (6) [56]. In Equation (6), C is a
    constant that represents penalty to errors and Γ represents the cost function.
    Equation (7) [56] defines this cost function with ϵ as the least-modulus loss.
    f(x)= Rreg(f)= Γ(f(x)−y)= w⋅Φ(x)+b C ∑ i=0 l Γ(f( x i )− y i )+ 1 2 ||w| | 2 {
    |f(x)−y|−ϵ, 0, if |f(x)−y|≥ϵ otherwise (5) (6) (7) View Source Finally, similar
    to the SVM, the optimal parameters can also be found by constructing the Lagrangian
    function as Equation (8) [56]. In this equation, function k is the kernel function
    to transform inputs into high-dimensional vectors. The variables α i and α ∗ i
    are the solutions for this optimization problem. L= 1 2 ∑ i,j=1 l ( α ∗ i − α
    i )( α ∗ j − α j )k( x i , x j ) − ∑ i=1 l α ∗ i ( y i −ϵ)− α i ( y i +ϵ); Where,
    ∑ i=1 l α i − α ∗ i =0,AND ∑ i=1 l α i , α ∗ i ∈[0,C] (8) View Source c: Linear
    Regression Linear regression provides an approximation of the relationship between
    different data domains. In an example of one-dimensional input, the linear regression
    model is created in the form of the line of best fit (Figure 6). The authors in
    [57] gave a generic model of linear regression with multiple outputs. However,
    to simplify the process of demonstration, a single-output model is given by Equation
    (9). x and β of Equation (9) represent the input vector and the weight vector
    respectively. f(x)=β⋅x (9) View Source FIGURE 6. One-dimensional input linear
    regression. Show All The mean squared error (MSE) is computed to be utilized as
    the loss function (Equation (10)). The variable n is the number of data in the
    training set, x i represents the i th input vector and y i represents the i th
    real output. MSE= 1 n ∑ i=1 n (f( x i )− y i ) 2 (10) View Source d: Logistic
    Regression The logistic regression solves the binary classification problem. The
    output of logistic regression is a value between 0 and 1. Thus, providing the
    confidence level of the prediction. Equation (11) demonstrates the logistic regression
    model, which is based on the Sigmoid function [58]. Similar to the linear regression,
    β and x are the input vector and the weight vector, respectively. f(x)= 1 1+ e
    −β⋅x (11) View Source In order to find the optimal β , the method of maximizing
    likelihood is leveraged [58]. Equation (12) is the loss function. Similar to the
    linear regression, x i is the i th input vector and y i is the i th real output.
    g= ∏ i=1 n f( x i ) y i (1−f( x i ) y i ) (1− y i ) (12) View Source However,
    to ensure this loss function can be processed with an optimization algorithm such
    as gradient descent, the problem is converted to maximizing the logarithm of the
    likelihood. This function is presented by Equation (13) [58]. log(g)= ∑ i=1 n
    y i log(f( x i ))+(1− y i )log(1−f( x i )) (13) View Source The authors of [58]
    also provide the general form of the logistic regression using the Softmax function,
    which incorporates the ability to solve multi-class classification problems. e:
    K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) KNN is mainly used for classification tasks. The model
    is built by plotting all training dataset in the feature space. When a new data
    point is inputted for inference, the model finds K nearest data points in the
    training set and provides an output based on the majority label of these nearest
    data points [38]. In order to calculate the distances, distance metrics such as
    the Euclidean distance, L-infinity norm, angle, Mahalanobis distance, and Hamming
    distance can be adopted [38]. Figure 7 demonstrates KNN with three nearest neighbors.
    The major label of the neighbors is class 1. Therefore, the new input data point
    is also labeled as class 1. FIGURE 7. KNN inference with three neighbors. Show
    All f: Decision Tree (DT) The authors of [59] emphasized that the main objectives
    of DT classifiers are to limit the classification error to an insignificant level,
    to classify with high accuracy beyond the training dataset, to achieve incremental
    updates with new training data, and to structure in a simple form. To achieve
    the above objectives, algorithms are required to build a DT. Here the ID3 algorithm
    is used as an example to illustrate DT. ID3 uses the concept of entropy to construct
    the DT. Equation (14) describes the calculation of entropy, where A is a vector
    of input features, x 1 and x 2 represent the two classes [60]. Entropy is calculated
    with all vector A in a tree node. H(a)= ∑ A [−P( x 1 |A)lo g 2 P( x 1 |A)−P( x
    2 |A)lo g 2 P( x 2 |A)] (14) View Source New tree nodes should be created with
    minimal entropy [59]. Therefore, the first step of ID3 is to find an attribute
    within the input vectors to produce child nodes with the minimal entropy. Then,
    the input vectors in the root are split according to the attribute to produce
    the child nodes. Next, if a child node contains input vectors with only one class,
    the splitting process is terminated for this node and continued with the next
    child node. On the other hand, if the child node contains input vectors with more
    than one class, the algorithm repeats the first step with the child node recursively
    [60]. g: Ensemble Learning The authors of [61, p.1] defined ensemble learning
    as “methods that combine multiple inducers to make a decision…” Therefore, as
    an advantage, models compensate errors of other models. The authors of [61] also
    divided ensemble methods into the dependent framework and the independent framework.
    In the dependent framework, the construction of the current model depends on the
    output of the previous model. An example is the AdaBoost algorithm, where the
    current model considers the error in the previous model. Gradient boosting machines
    also adopts a similar concept [61]. The independent framework includes multiple
    models, which are built independently from each other. Some examples of these
    methods are bagging, random forest, random subspace methods, error-correcting
    output codes, rotation forest, and extremely randomized trees [61]. Random forest
    is described in the next part of this subsection. h: Random Forest The random
    forest is an ensemble learning method based on DT [61]. It consists of multiple
    DTs. Each DT is trained by a random subset of the training data. Also, another
    random subset of the attributes is produced for the creation of new child nodes.
    Therefore, the algorithm only examines part of the attributes for an attribute
    of the best split. Furthermore, this randomness provides a low correlation between
    trees, avoiding the domination of a few strong attributes [62]. i: Naïve Bayes
    Classifier (NB) NB is a supervised learning algorithm based on the Bayes rule
    (Equation (15)). The Bayes rule provides a model of the conditional probability
    of a result Y with the given input or the condition X . This algorithm is generally
    applied to classification problems. In classification problems, Y is from a discrete
    set of classes. Moreover, an input X belongs to the Y giving the greatest P(Y|X)
    [63]. P(Y|X)= P(Y)P(X|Y) P(X) (15) View Source The NB model consists of the probability
    of a class Y and the joint probability of attributes (Equation (16)). Therefore,
    the model is constructed by estimating P(Y) for every class Y in the training
    set and the conditional probabilities of each attribute P( X i = a i |Y) for every
    class. P(Y= y i |X= a 0 , a 1 ,…, a i ) = P(Y= y i )P(X= a 0 , a 1 ,…, a i |Y=
    y i ) P(X= a 0 , a 1 ,…, a i ) (16) View Source j: Bayesian Network (BN) NB models
    assume that all attributes are independent of applying the Bayes rule. However,
    in the real world, the correlation between attributes is inevitable [63], [64].
    BN is a classifier that is not limited by the assumption of attribute independence.
    A BN can be represented by Equation (17), where G is a directed acyclic graph,
    where nodes represent the different events and the edges represent the dependency.
    The symbol Θ contains the Conditional Probability Table (CPT) for all possible
    values of the attributes and their conditions [64]. B=<G,Θ> (17) View Source The
    learning process is divided into two phases. During the first phase, the graph
    structure is determined and then in the second phase, the CPT is constructed [65].
    The structure can be determined by an expert or learned by data with score-based
    structure learning methods and constraint-based structure learning methods [66].
    The goal of score-based methods is to find a structure that provides the maximum
    score of a score function. For example, the Bayes Dirichlet equivalent uniform
    and the Bayesian Information Criterion. In the first step of score-based methods,
    the algorithm provides a score of suitable parents for every node. Then, parents
    are assigned to nodes to maximize the scores and to avoid cycles. On the other
    hand, constraint-based methods use conditional constraints to update the model.
    An example is the PC algorithm. When using the PC algorithm, the graph starts
    as a fully connected undirected graph. Edges are removed according to the result
    of CI tests. This method is repeated until no edges can be removed [67]. After
    obtaining a graph structure, CPT can be constructed to obtain a full model. k:
    Kernel Bayes Rule (KBR) The KBR extends the Bayes rule by applying kernels to
    represent probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the prior
    and likelihood can be expressed by data, which does not require a distribution
    model [68]. l: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) GPR is a non-parametric regression
    method as the complexity is determined by the data [69]. GPR utilizes the Gaussian
    Process (GP) to model the function between the input X and output Y . GP is an
    infinite dimension version of the multivariate Gaussian distributions [69]. GP
    can be defined by a mean and covariance function. The mean value is usually set
    as zero and the covariance function can be modeled by a kernel function representing
    the dependence between different function outputs for different input X [69].
    The GPR learning process adjusts hyperparameters of the kernel, such as the length-scale,
    signal variance, and noise variance [69]. m: Collaborative Filtering (CF) CF algorithms
    provide recommendations to a user from experiences of other users [70]. CF operates
    under two assumptions: Opinions of users do not change over time; Users with similar
    characteristics provide similar opinions. With these assumptions, CF can be implemented
    to provide a decision basis for product promotion, social media recommendations,
    e-commerce reputations, and even strategy [70]. n: Feedforward Neural Network
    (FFNN) A sample model of the FFNN is demonstrated by Figure 8. An FFNN contains
    an input layer, an output layer and one or multiple hidden layers [71]. FIGURE
    8. Sample feedforward neural network architecture. Show All f(X)= f output ( f
    hidden2 ( f hidden1 (X))) (18) View Source Equation (18) [71] provides the general
    form of the sample model. In these layers, the input layer consists of the input
    vector, and the hidden layers can be represented in the form of (19) [71], where
    W is a matrix of coefficients, X is the input vector, B is the bias vector, and
    g is the activation function. W and B can be learned through the backpropagation
    algorithm. Whereas, g is chosen by the data analyst to provide nonlinearity [71].
    Some candidates of g are the ReLU function, the Sigmoid function, and the Tanh
    function. Finally, the output layer defines the output type of the model. If the
    output layer is a Softmax function similar to logistic regression, the FFNN provides
    the output of discrete values, which solves classification problems. On the other
    hand, if the output layer provides continuous values like linear regression, the
    FFNN solves regression problems. f(X)=g(WX+B) (19) View Source o: Convolutional
    Neural Network (CNN) CNN is a special type of FFNN. CNNs also process input data
    in a layer-by-layer style. The major motivation of CNN is to reduce the number
    of parameters to be trained [72]. Figure 9 demonstrates the general architecture
    of CNNs. A full convolutional layer group consists of the convolutional layer,
    the detector layer, and the pooling layer. In the convolutional layer, the input
    data is processed by a convolutional filter. This filter is in the form of a vector
    for one-dimensional data and matrix for two-dimensional data. The filter sweeps
    through the input data as a moving window, and during each iteration, the dot
    product of the filter matrix and the current region is calculated. Figure 10 provides
    an example of the first iteration and the final iteration of convolutional layer
    calculation with 4×4 input and a 2×2 filter. FIGURE 9. General convolutional neural
    network architecture. Show All FIGURE 10. 2D convolution filtering. Show All After
    the convolutional layer, the detector layer processes the data as a hidden layer
    with the ReLU activation function. The ReLU function provides nonlinearity to
    the network [71]. Finally, a filter is also used in the pooling layer. Similar
    to the convolutional layer, the filter in the pooling layer also sweeps through
    the input. However, the filter only represents the area for the current iteration.
    Pooling calculation could be simply obtaining the average or the maximum of the
    filter area [72]. CNN is widely used for image processing. p: Recurrent Neural
    Network (RNN) Unlike the basic FFNN, which only accepts one input a time, RNNs
    accept several inputs [73]. In terms of time-series data, individual data points
    are processed at once in the sequence of time [73]. As shown in Figure 11, the
    output of the current hidden state H t is generated from the input X t of the
    current time state and the output X t−1 of the previous time state, recursively
    [73]. Finally, if only one output is required (for classification or regression),
    the output Y is calculated from the final hidden state [73]. FIGURE 11. RNN layer
    at time t. Show All q: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Since gradient propagates
    through multiple stages in RNNs, issues such as gradient explosion and gradient
    vanishing arise [73]. To address these issues, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is
    proposed as variants of the RNN [73]. The LSTM incorporated an additional cell
    state to enhance long term memory [74]. Also, the additional forget and input
    gates are utilized to forget and insert information into the cell state [74].
    r: Random Neural Network (RandNN) The RandNN is a type of RNN. Excitatory impulse
    signals of “+1” and inhibitory impulse signals of “−1” are transmitted between
    the neurons of RandNN [75]. The neuron state or potential at a certain time is
    represented by a non-negative integer. This potential increases when the neuron
    receives an excitatory impulse and decreases when the neuron emits a signal. The
    neuron emits signals when its potential is positive. Also, the acceptance of an
    inhibitory signal outside of the network decrements the neuron potential [75].
    The RandNN can be applied in multiple fields such as associative memory, optimization,
    texture generation, magnetic resonance imaging, function approximation, mine detection,
    and automatic target recognition [75]. 2) Unsupervised Learning Algorithms The
    two major types of unsupervised learning models are principal component analysis
    (PCA) and K-means clustering. PCA is used as a technique to compress data. This
    is important for IoT applications, such as wireless sensor networks (WSN), with
    limited throughput and energy [76]. The K-means algorithm is used for the clustering
    of multiple sensors. By dividing the monitored field into areas using the unsupervised
    K-means clustering, the complexity of data gathering and processing are reduced
    [76]. Some other unsupervised learning algorithms are also explained further in
    this subsection. a: K-means The K-means algorithm produces a classification model
    through clustering [77]. It aims to generate multiple K centroids from the dataset.
    Data points close to a centroid forms a cluster [77]. The centroids are initialized
    by choosing random data points from the dataset. Then, data points are assigned
    to the cluster of the nearest centroid. Next, the new K centroids are calculated
    by averaging the assigned data points within their clusters. The above steps are
    iterated until the centroids are stable, or the algorithm reached a preset number
    of iterations [77]. With the centroids calculated, a data point can be classified
    by computing the distance towards the centroids. The new data point belongs to
    the cluster of the closest centroid [77]. b: Density-Based Spatial Clustering
    of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) DBSCAN is another clustering method similar
    to K-means. However, compared to K-means, DBSCAN does not require a predefined
    number of K centroids. Also, DBSCAN can identify noises. Moreover, the shape of
    the cluster can be arbitrary [78]. DBSCAN has two hyperparameters the minimum
    number of neighbor points minPoints within the distance R [78]. To construct the
    clusters, DBSCAN iterates through all points in the dataset [78]. If an unvisited
    data point has more than minPoints neighbors within R , the data point is marked
    as a core point, and a new cluster is created. After that, recursively, all previously
    unvisited neighbors of the core point are visited and added into the cluster.
    Also, if the neighbor point is another core point, the two clusters would merge
    [78]. If a data point has less than minPoints of neighbors within the range R
    , the data point is classified as noise [78]. c: Hierarchical Clustering Analysis
    (HCA) HCA is a clustering method, where the data sample is recursively merged
    or split to form a tree diagram [79]. HCA methods can be divided into agglomerative
    hierarchical clustering and divisive hierarchical clustering. Agglomerative hierarchical
    clustering is the bottom-up approach, where each data point forms its own cluster,
    and similar clusters merge until the desired architecture is obtained. On the
    other hand, divisive hierarchical clustering is the top-down technique as it starts
    with a huge cluster containing the whole data sample. Then, the cluster is divided
    to form the tree [79]. Merging and division decisions are made with similarity
    criteria. The three different sets of criteria are single-link clustering, complete-link
    clustering, and average-link clustering. For the three clustering methods, the
    distance between two clusters is calculated as the shortest distance between any
    two members from different clusters, the longest distance between any two members
    from different clusters, and the average distance between any two members from
    different clusters, respectively [79]. d: Expectation Maximization (EM) The EM
    algorithm computes maximum likelihood estimations for latent variables [80]. The
    algorithm consists of the Expectation (E) and Maximization (M) steps. The E step
    computes the missing data from current function parameters. During the M step,
    the function parameters are updated to maximize the log-likelihood of the estimated
    latent variables [80]. The E and M steps are repeated until the model converges
    slowly to a local maximum [80]. e: Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) The superposition
    of multiple Gaussian distributions can approximate any continuous density through
    the adjustment of their means, covariances, and coefficients [81]. Unlike the
    parameters of a single Gaussian model that can be determined directly by the maximum
    likelihood method, GMM is trained using EM in an iterative way [81]. GMM can be
    applied to solve clustering problems [81]. f: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    PCA reduces the number of attributes in a dataset by transforming the original
    inputs into another set of vectors with low information loss [82]. Dimensionality
    reduction is achieved by eliminating components with a lower variance. These components
    are detected through the computation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a
    covariance matrix from the original dataset [82]. A component with a higher eigenvalue
    indicates more information contained. Therefore, features can be extracted by
    choosing the corresponding components or eigenvectors with higher eigenvalues
    [83]. g: Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) MDS is another dimensionality reduction
    technique. However, unlike PCA, MDS preserves the distance or difference between
    sample cases instead of the variance [84]. Stress, the loss function of MDS is
    defined as Equation (20), where d ij is the difference between sample cases i
    and j in the original data space, and D ij is the distance between i and j in
    the lower dimension or projected data space [85]. MDS consists of four steps [86].
    In the first step, a squared distance matrix is computed from the data points
    in the original data space. Then, the matrix B is computed by applying double-centering
    to the squared distance matrix. After that, the eigenvalues V and eigenvectors
    Q of matrix B can be obtained. V m is a matrix of the first m eigenvalues greater
    than zero, and Q m is a matrix of corresponding eigenvectors. Finally, the coordinate
    matrix can be calculated by multiplying Q m and V 1 2 m [86]. Stress= ∑ i=1,j=1
    ( d ij − D ij ) 2 ∑ i=1,j=1 D 2 ij (20) View Source h: Diffusion Maps (DM) DM
    is also an algorithm for dimensionality reduction [87]. In contrast to PCA and
    MDS, DM unravels the potential manifold structures in the dataset [87]. The DM
    algorithms initiate by defining a kernel and a kernel matrix. Through normalization
    of the kernel matrix, the diffusion matrix can be acquired. Finally, DM utilizes
    n numbers of the most dominant eigenvectors from the diffusion matrix to project
    the dataset from the original data space to n -dimensional diffusion space [88].
    i: Window Sliding with De-Duplication (WSDD) WSDD is used to mine patterns from
    system events sorted in chronological order [89]. WSDD utilizes a sliding window
    over the training dataset to learn patterns in a brute force approach. The algorithm
    is capable of detecting both frequent sequential patterns and periodic sequential
    patterns [89]. To increase efficiency, the algorithm stores mined patterns in
    a hashmap and avoided mining duplicate patterns. The pattern itself is stored
    as the key in the hashmap, and the count of the pattern is stored as the value.
    Finally, only patterns detected over a minimum count are returned as the output
    of WSDD [89]. j: Autoencoders (AE) The AE is a neural network consisting of the
    encoder, code, and decoder components [90]. The encoder maps the raw input to
    the output of the code component, and the decoder reconstructs the raw input from
    the output of the code component. AEs can be used for feature reduction as the
    output of the code component from a trained AE holds near lossless information
    of the raw input [90]. k: Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) The HNN is a type of RNN
    for solving optimization problems [91]. Each neuron provides non-linear outputs
    through a sigmoid function. All neurons are interconnected with each other to
    restrict and revise the outputs of each other. Each connection includes an interconnection
    weight. Each neuron contains a user adjustable input bias [91]. The neurons update
    according to the energy function (Equation (21)), where T i j is the weight of
    the connection between neurons i and j , V is the output of a neuron [92]. The
    HNN neurons evolve until a local minimum of the energy function is reached [92].
    E=− 1 2 ∑ i≠j T ij V i V j (21) View Source i: Self-Organizing Map (SOM) The SOM
    is a type of neural network that can perform clustering similar to the K-means
    [77]. In each iteration, the neuron closest to a randomly selected data point
    moves towards the data point by a preset learning rate [93]. Neurons within the
    preset neighbor range of the first neuron also move towards the data point. The
    learning rate and the neighboring radius delays over the number of iterations
    [93]. 3) Reinforcement Learning Algorithms The goal of reinforcement learning
    is to solve the problem of Markov decision processes (MDP). MDP is a sequential
    decision problem. As demonstrated in Figure 12, any action made by the agent will
    influence the environment and generate a reward. The goal of reinforcement learning
    is to maximize long-term rewards [41]. Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning,
    is used to solve routing problems in IoT networks. Unfortunately, most of these
    algorithms are based on wired networks [94]. In WSNs, energy, processing power,
    and storage might become a bottleneck for distributed reinforcement learning routing
    algorithms [37]. Reinforcement learning algorithms aim to provide high-level intelligence
    to IoT applications. FIGURE 12. Agent-environment relationship [41]. Show All
    a: Temporal-Difference (TD) TD learning includes various model-free reinforcement
    learning algorithms, which require no model of the environment [95]. TD algorithms
    bootstrap or update the estimates based on current estimations. The value function
    is updated at every step of TD [95]. There are three fundamental types of TD-based
    learning algorithms mentioned in the sections after. The on-policy TD algorithm
    SARSA learns the action values from the current policy, while the off-policy algorithm
    Q-learning learns from the optimal policy [95]. Finally, a third type of TD learning,
    the Actor-critic learning learns both a policy (Actor) and value function (critic)
    [96]. Actor-critic learning is always on-policy as the “critic” needs to learn
    from and correct the TD errors from the “actor” or the policy. b: Least-Squares
    Policy Iteration (LSPI) LSPI is a model-free off-policy reinforcement algorithm
    [97]. LSPI is also an approximate policy-iteration algorithm, where the value
    function and policy representation are approximated. Therefore, compared to tabular
    methods, the policy search process is more efficient for LSPI [97]. Also, LSPI
    is based on least squares temporal difference learning [97]. Thus, as TD learning
    methods update incrementally, data efficiency of LSPI can be preserved [95]. 4)
    Other Relevant Machine Learning Techniques a: Transfer Learning By adopting transfer
    learning techniques, a model trained to solve one problem can be transferred and
    adapted to solve a different problem [98]. This prevents time-consuming labeling
    processes. Transfer learning can be categorized into inductive transfer learning,
    transductive transfer learning, and unsupervised transfer learning [98]. In the
    inductive transfer learning setting, the domains can be the same or different,
    but the tasks are different for the two problems. Whereas in transductive transfer
    learning, the tasks are the same, and the domains are different. Finally, in unsupervised
    transfer learning, similar to inductive transfer learning, the tasks are different.
    However, unsupervised transfer learning performs unsupervised learning tasks in
    the target problem [98]. b: Federated Learning Federated learning is a technique
    of multiple users training a common machine learning model without leaking their
    local dataset to other users [99]. There is the horizontal federated learning
    technique, where different datasets share the same features, but different sample
    cases [99]. On the other hand, vertical federated learning can be applied to datasets
    with more overlapping sample cases and different features [99]. Finally, federated
    transfer learning is suitable for datasets with different sample cases and features
    [99]. B. Physical Layer Applications One major application of machine learning
    influencing IoT end devices is communication control. The authors in [100] used
    Q-learning for transmission power control to reduce the unnecessary waste of power
    due to interference. This model is only tested under the scenario of one-to-one
    transmission. A scenario of multiple sources toward multiple receivers should
    be tested. The authors of [101] explored the usages of deep learning in end-to-end
    communication systems. The authors adopted the AE to replace different compensation
    techniques during the transmission of data. Data is encoded between transmission
    and decoded after transmission to protect the payload during transmission. Another
    application is the implementation of CNN for modulation classification. This is
    a prerequisite for developing an intelligent receiver. Machine learning algorithms
    increase the energy consumption of IoT devices. Therefore, it is important to
    apply energy preservation techniques. The authors of [102] concluded that the
    two major energy preservation methods are energy saving and energy harvesting.
    Most of the energy saving techniques are implemented through the estimate and
    control of the uptime of end devices [100], [103]–[108]. The rest of this subsection
    focuses on machine learning-based energy saving techniques. The authors of [103]
    established ARIIMA or A Real IoT Implementation of a Machine-Learning Architecture
    for reducing energy consumption. This is an IoT architecture that uses machine
    learning to forecast end device usage to control the up and downtime of IoT end
    devices. The aim is to reduce energy consumption. The authors compared different
    methods of calculating the loss of the predicted outcome. However, the authors
    did not link energy efficiency improvement to any specific machine learning algorithms.
    The authors of [105] utilized the Naïve Bayes Classifier for calculating the optimized
    uplink period for IoT data collectors. The goal of this work is to optimize the
    uplink time for power efficiency and preserve the accuracy of data. The authors
    from [107] used a single hidden layer feedforward neural network to predict the
    power usage based on smart meters. With these predictions, the power suppliers
    can balance the power production with consumption to avoid power wastages. Also,
    individual home devices can be controlled to relieve the grid pressure at power
    peaks. The authors of [106] used logistic regression, KNN, and Naïve Bayes algorithm
    to increase the power efficiency of smart buildings. Light, temperature, and motion
    data of a room are fed into the models to determine whether if people are present
    in a room. In conclusion, this work only determines the existence of people. Nevertheless,
    further work needs to be done on the development of an energy efficient device
    control scheme based on the predictions of these machine learning models. The
    authors of [108] extended the model for predicting human presence in smart buildings.
    A random neural network model is applied with inputs of carbon dioxide level and
    temperature readings to predict the number of occupants in a room. This model
    is used to control the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
    HVAC devices will be turned off to save power if no occupants are detected in
    the room. The authors from [104] pointed out that the manual labeling of training
    data is time consuming in supervised learning algorithms. Therefore, the authors
    proposed an energy saving scheme based on unsupervised learning. The WSDD algorithm
    is used to extract patterns of device behavior from historical data. C. Network
    Layer Applications The authors of [109], [110] summarized existing network layer
    applications using machine learning algorithms. These applications are IoT device
    identification, network routing, traffic profiling, traffic prediction, traffic
    classification, congestion control, resource management, fault management, QoS
    and Quality of Experience (QoE) management, and network security. Table 1 links
    these applications to implemented machine learning algorithms. However, these
    applications alone might not be feasible to deal with the complexity of networks
    such as 5G, Tactile Internet, and Industry 4.0 requirements. Furthermore, an autonomous
    network structure is required. TABLE 1 Network Applications and Related Machine
    Learning Algorithms [109], [110] 1) Self-Organizing Networks The increasing network
    complexity and device numbers for 5G and beyond networks are inducing conflicting
    demand over network resources and routing decisions. Therefore, self-organizing
    networks (SON) are required to reduce the complexity of managing these networks
    [111]. Management functionality of SONs consists of self-configuration, self-optimization,
    and self-healing. Self-configuration processes automate network design, network
    planning, and network deployment. After that, the self-optimization functionalities
    maintain the network performance and conduct routine network operations [112].
    Finally, self-healing functionalities focus on fault detection and recovery [113].
    The authors of [114] organized machine learning in SONs into four modules: sensing,
    mining, prediction, and reasoning. Sensing involves the detection of network anomalies
    and routine events. Therefore it contains functionalities of self-optimization
    and self-healing. Mining aims to classify services to help the network to optimize
    its performance. Moreover, mining belongs to the self-configuration functionalities.
    Finally, reasoning could apply to the offline parameter tuning during self-configuration
    and the online parameter tuning for self-optimization during network runtime.
    The authors of [115] categorized machine learning applications on SONs according
    to the three functionalities. In Table 2, the self-configuration applications
    are operational parameters configuration, neighbor cell list configuration and
    radio parameters configuration. In Table 3, the self-optimization applications
    consist of backhaul, caching, coverage and capacity, mobility, handover, load
    balancing, resource optimization, and coordination. In Table 4, the self-healing
    applications include fault detection, fault classification and outage management.
    Table 2, 3 and 4 only include the algorithms that are relevant to supervised learning,
    unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Therefore, controller models,
    Markov models, and heuristics algorithms are out of the scope of this article.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Applications in Self-Configuration [115] TABLE 3 Machine
    Learning Applications in Self-Optimization [115] TABLE 4 Machine Learning Applications
    in Self-Healing [115] The authors from [116] promoted self coordination as a fourth
    functionality group of SONs. Their work demonstrates that the current design of
    standalone management functionalities of SONs could lead to conflicting parameter
    adjustment between distinct functions. This work also concludes that DT, Q-learning,
    actor-critic learning, and SVM can be solutions for self-coordination. The authors
    from [117] proposed another method to avoid collision between different functionality
    results. Their distributed Q-learning model considers both base station power
    allocation and user quality of service. Q-learning consists of a list of actions,
    a list of states, and a list of rewards. The actions are the power allocation
    for the base stations. The states are the ring that the agent is covered with
    current power allocation. Finally, the rewards are calculated considering the
    higher capacity of the base station and better user quality of service. The network
    applications for traditional networks in Table 1 could be applied to support the
    SON functionalities. The authors of [118] emphasized that the result of traffic
    forecasting and prediction can increase the performance and accuracy of all other
    SON functionalities. The authors tested three types of machine learning models
    for traffic forecasting. The first type of model is autoregressive algorithms.
    This includes linear or polynomial regression. The second type of model is neural
    networks and finally, the authors used GPR for traffic forecasting. The authors
    also mentioned that this application can be further extended for QoS management
    and congestion control, providing possible use cases for models in the traditional
    networks. To improve the current management scheme in 5G and beyond networks,
    the implementation of SDN and Network Function virtualization (NFV) architectures
    in SONs fulfills the intelligence, automation, management, and optimization requirements
    [119]. In this architecture, machine learning works at the core to enable intelligent
    network management. This work also demonstrates that traffic classification as
    an essential application provides results affecting consecutive decision making
    processes. D. Edge Computing Applications 1) Edge Computing Hardware The development
    of edge computing hardware enables machine learning on the edge level. Table 5
    includes some of the representative edge computing devices. These devices can
    be classified into three device types. The first type is the board devices. Board
    devices are standalone embedded computers that run machine learning algorithms
    independent of external devices. The second type is the accelerator devices. These
    devices cannot operate alone. Accelerator devices often act as an add-on to provide
    extra machine learning capabilities to embedded boards, personal computers, and
    other devices. The final type is smartphone chips. Smartphone chip manufacturers
    like Qualcomm, Hisilicon, Samsung, and MediaTek are pushing machine learning processing
    to mobile devices. Most of these chips rely on an AI accelerator to provide real-time
    machine learning processing capabilities. TABLE 5 Machine Learning Edge Computing
    Hardware 2) Machine Learning on the Edge Machine learning applications on the
    edge layer can be separated into two major types. The first type aims to offload
    part or all of the existing functionality to the edge layer. This type of application
    is defined in this article as process offloading applications [46], [130]–[132].
    The second type of application is referred to as sole functionality applications
    in this article. Sole functionality machine learning models often perform subtasks,
    which assist the main task on the cloud. The machine learning model of these subtasks
    is different from the model of the main tasks [133]–[136]. Table 6 summarizes
    all the works with different motivations for applying edge computing. TABLE 6
    Motivation of Edge Computing The motivation for process offloading applications
    is the limited resources of devices. The authors from [130] pointed out that low
    latency is essential for vehicle-to-everything applications. This work classifies
    vehicle-related applications into critical applications, high priority applications,
    and low priority applications. Critical applications include vehicle control systems,
    system monitoring, and accident prevention. These applications must be deployed
    on the very edge to the vehicle for a near-instant response. High and low priority
    applications include navigation and entertainment. These applications should be
    deployed on edge servers to enhance the computational capability of end user devices.
    This also ensures a relatively low latency. The authors of [131] applied a similar
    offloading scheme to general machine learning web applications. The aim of this
    work is to offload computation power demanding machine learning tasks from embedded
    devices to an edge server. To achieve this, the edge device transmits a snapshot
    of the execution state before processing a machine learning task to the edge server.
    This method is independent of the type and model of the machine learning algorithm.
    However, the size of a snapshot is still enormous for embedded devices. The authors
    from [46] further revealed that edge computing could also be used to protect user
    privacy. Their application uses a neural network to recognize certain objects
    from live streaming video. To protect user privacy, the first few layers of the
    neural network are offloaded to the edge servers. This also reduces energy consumption
    for the whole system, since processing is distributed among the network. However,
    as the users still need to send raw information to edge servers to be processed,
    privacy leakage remains an issue. This issue can be solved by directly deploying
    these first layers of the neural network to the end device. As a result, users
    only send processed intermediate data to the network. All the works above only
    use edge computing primitively to offload computation requirements. However, machine
    learning by edge computing should leverage some unique properties of edge devices.
    The authors of [132] proposed a collaborative edge-centric learning method to
    train machine learning models. Each sensor contains a model that is trained locally
    using only data from that sensor. Training locally allows sensors to utilize contextual
    parameters to improve model accuracy. After training the local models, only the
    parameters of the models are sent to the sink from the sensors. This method reduces
    network overhead and energy consumption during training. Different from the previous
    process offloading applications, sole functionality applications improve the performance
    of the system by performing a different subtask of the major task in the cloud.
    Earlier motivations are also related to the limited resources of devices. The
    authors of [135] utilized multiple filters, including CNN and SVM, to drop blurry
    and unwanted image data at the edge layer. The usage of filters reduces the processing
    power required on upper layers to create a training dataset for other applications.
    Similarly, The authors from [133] also applied data cleansing on the edge layer
    to filter blurry images. Data cleansing is done by K-means in their food recognition
    system. Image segmentation is further applied as a data preprocessing method to
    reduce the load of the cloud server. However, the significance of this work is
    the utilization of locational data as a unique data type provided by edge devices.
    Furthermore, the authors used the locational data as a basis for collaborative
    recognition on the cloud layer. To enhance localized service, the authors of [136]
    implemented network traffic prediction via LSTM on the edge cloudlets of a healthcare
    system. The purpose of this machine learning model is to predict bidirectional
    traffic between the cloud and the cloudlet to control data transmission rate and
    data caching frequency. These improve the quality of service and the reliability
    of data. As the LSTM model is deployed locally on cloudlets, the control decisions
    of the model are different between different cloudlets due to the different local
    network traffic. Similarly, the authors from [134] also used machine learning
    to predict future sensor data. This is based on multi-variable regression and
    LSTM in their traffic monitoring system. These models are implemented on the edge
    servers to provide parameters for determining the quality of the video to be sent
    from the edge servers to the cloud. Therefore, this application aims to reduce
    network traffic by control data transmission from edge servers during non-critical
    events. The origin of these advantages is the increase of connectivity by introducing
    more edge servers to the system. As machine learning applications on the edge
    attract much attention, the emergence of TinyML provides further advancement of
    these applications. TinyML combines embedded IoT technologies with machine learning
    [137]. It has the advantage of low bandwidth usage and latency like other edge
    computing applications [30]. On the other hand, TinyML applications aim to minimize
    energy consumption (below 1 mW). To deploy a machine learning model on such a
    low consumption device, model size also needs to be minimized. Balancing between
    model size and accuracy is a challenge for implementing TinyML applications [137].
    E. Edge-Cloud Collaboration In the traditional IoT architecture, machine learning
    algorithms on the cloud layer usually perform analytical tasks. However, novel
    applications are proposed utilizing the collaboration between edge and cloud layers.
    Table 7 includes some edge-cloud collaboration methods. TABLE 7 Applications Involving
    Edge-Cloud Collaboration A most common type of edge-cloud collaboration is the
    sole functionality applications from the subsection above. The healthcare system
    from [136] is an example. The system aims to classify and store data at different
    nodes of the cloud server. Data is collected from mobile devices and passed to
    the cloudlet layer. In the cloudlet layer, LSTM is implemented to predict network
    traffic. The prediction results are used for data transmission rate control and
    caching frequency control. Then, data is transmitted to an upper network layer.
    This layer utilizes a FFNN to classify traffic. Finally, these data are stored
    on the cloud according to the classified traffic types. In this application, the
    edge layers support upper cloud layers by completing subtasks. The result of the
    subtasks helps the cloud layer to perform the main task. Edge assisted training
    is another type of edge-cloud collaboration. The authors from [135] used CNN and
    SVM to filter out images on the edge layer. This filter is to prevent corruption
    of the training on the cloud. Hence, it decreases the time required for an expert
    to create a training set. The authors from [138] used federated learning to create
    an AE model for anomaly detection. A local version of the AE model is trained
    on every edge device using its local datasets. Then, the weights of these local
    models are transmitted to the cloud server and aggregated to form one AE model.
    This cloud level AE model is redistributed to the edge devices for local anomaly
    detection. As less data is sent from the edge to the cloud, this method reduces
    bandwidth demand during training and ensures that the training dataset is not
    corrupted due to data transmission. However, this method only considers one model
    across the system. The authors of [139] extended training to multiple models.
    This is achieved with a machine learning model management module on the cloud
    server. This module accepts sensor data from the edge layer and uses these data
    to train different machine learning models. Then, the machine learning model selector
    selects and distributes a suitable model for every edge platform based on device
    performance and characteristics. This method optimizes network performance as
    the most suitable model is deployed for every device. Another edge-cloud collaboration
    method is process offloading scheduling. The authors from [46] addressed that
    edge servers have limited bandwidth. Thus, scheduling of cloud process offloading
    should be implemented to avoid network congestion. The authors of [140] implemented
    a similar scheduling method on 5G networks. They use deep Q-learning to schedule
    server app migration on mobile edge servers. This method aims to provide users
    with an optimal quality of service. The authors from [141] incorporated cross-layer
    communication into process offloading decisions. In this work, end IoT devices
    can communicate both with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) edge servers and satellite
    cloud servers. If the IoT devices loose connection with UAV edge servers, the
    IoT devices could offload their computation tasks to the satellite cloud. A deep
    actor-critic learning method is proposed considering energy consumption and network
    delay to solve this scheduling problem. This section summarizes many machine learning
    algorithms, hardware and applications. The usage of machine learning from a network
    perspective are described. Machine learning applications in the physical layer
    and network layer are elaborated. Scheduling and management of different network
    resources and process are major applications of machine learning on these two
    layers. Then, for the cloud layer, the applications of machine learning that enable
    edge-cloud collaboration are illustrated. Edge computing aids cloud applications
    through process offloading and edge-only functions (sole functionality). However,
    this only shows collaboration in the application layer (Edge-Cloud). Collaboration
    between lower layers or cross-layer machine learning applications are still limited.
    The need of cross-layer machine learning models and other limitations of current
    applications are further discussed in Section XIII. SECTION V. Mission Critical
    Communication An important dimension of IoT 2.0 is the mission critical communication
    based systems, which address the situations where human life and any form of infrastructure
    can be at risk. Mission critical communication currently takes the form of mission
    critical machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, or machine type communication
    (MC-MTC), where machines need to communicate with each other to perform various
    tasks such as coordination, sensing, and actuation. Mission critical communication
    systems put stringent requirements of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications
    (URLLC) and system availability [142]. The M2M communication systems which do
    not involve the mission critical element are referred to as low-cost M2M or massive
    MTC (mMTC) with low-power consumption and massive connectivity [143]. In this
    section, we review important use cases of mission critical communication systems
    and recently proposed physical (PHY) and higher-layer mechanisms to meet the desired
    requirements of URLLC in these mission critical communication networks. A. Important
    Applications of Mission Critical Communication Networks In order to protect citizens
    and infrastructure during disasters and emergencies, different public safety organizations
    are put in place [144], [145]. The emergency first responder is the most important
    entity in all emergency management agencies. Public safety communication (PSC)
    systems used by these agencies for coordinating teams and providing quick emergency-response
    are regarded as mission critical because they need to be ultra-reliable, resilient,
    and secure while meeting other stringent network functionalities [146]. Public
    warning systems (PWS) also come under the umbrella of PSC systems as they share
    many of the characteristics of mission critical communications. An important use
    case of PWS is the earthquake and tsunami warning system. During the last few
    years, there has been a significant increase in the interest of advancing the
    PSC systems. The authors of [144] presented a detailed survey on wireless communication
    technology while covering the different aspects related to regulatory, standardization,
    and research activities in PSC systems. The main focus in this work is on Europe
    and the USA. In [145] a comparative analysis of legacy and emerging technologies
    for PSC is presented. The authors of [146] discussed the use of broadband technologies
    for public safety, considering existing LTE specifications. The authors from [147]
    proposed a software architecture design as well as a set of distributed protocols
    to meet the strict requirements of PSC networks. The use of wireless networks
    in the mining industry for mobility support, rapid deployment, and scalability
    within dynamic environments is another use case of the PSC system. The authors
    of [148] discussed the mission critical requirements of PSC systems for open-pit
    mining, and a framework is proposed that integrates mine and radio network planning.
    Automated transportation systems are meant to provide mission critical services
    to self-driving vehicles, connected cars, road safety, and traffic management
    systems. These intelligent transportation systems can increase the efficiency
    of traffic management agencies and provide numerous benefits, including a considerable
    reduction in the road-accidents rate. However, to get these systems realizable,
    the stringent requirements of MC-MTC networks should be fulfilled. Vehicular connectivity
    or Vehicle-to-everything (V2X), is another important use case of MC-MTC in which
    time-critical data exchange takes place under three different scenarios: vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-personal device moving
    at pedestrian speeds (V2P) [149]. UAVs, also known as drones, have potential usages
    in many mission critical communication systems due to their inherent features
    of mobility, flexibility, and adaptive altitude [150]. Such UAVs assisted MC-MTC
    networks can be used in the transportation of important goods in emergency situations
    being handled by the public safety and rescue systems. UAVs can be part of existing
    cellular networks as new types of user equipment (UE) and flying base stations.
    UAVs as flying base stations can help increase the coverage, spectral efficiency,
    and QoS in the MC-MTC supported cellular networks [150]. The authors of [151]
    presented a comprehensive survey of different types of promising solutions for
    the smooth integration of UAVs into cellular networks. Industrial automation involving
    time-critical processes requires highly reliable data transfer links between sensors,
    actuators, and controllers, and thus is an important application of MC-MTC networks.
    Detailed performance requirements of different MC-MTC network applications are
    listed in [152]. Health monitoring systems for remote patients and remote robots
    for surgeries are potential applications of MC-MTC networks. Similarly, both augmented
    reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) systems require very low end-to-end latency.
    Another important use case of mission critical communication networks is found
    in the smart grid, which is an advanced form of conventional power grid having
    capabilities of automation, monitoring, and communication. The key features that
    distinguish smart grids from the conventional electrical power grid are two-way
    communication, demand-side management, and real-time billing. All these features
    require mission critical communication infrastructure for smart grids [153]. 1)
    PHY Layer Considerations for Mission Critical Communication Networks Table 8 summarizes
    works related to PHY layer considerations for mission critical communication networks.
    For both licensed and unlicensed bands employing URLLC, many promising PHY and
    medium access control (MAC) layer techniques are discussed in [154]. The following
    techniques are among the PHY layer mechanisms proposed specifically for MC-MTC
    networks to meet the associated URLLC requirements. TABLE 8 Summary of Recent
    Works Addressing Mission Critical Communication a: Short Packet Transmission In
    contrast to the conventional wireless communication systems, the traffic in MC-MTC
    networks generated by different types of devices and sensors contains short packets
    where the size of metadata (control information) is comparable with that of the
    actual information payload. Thus, new principles are required to design wireless
    protocols supporting short packets. The authors of [155] reviewed information-theoretic
    principles developed for communication systems generating short packets. These
    principles are applied in different communication scenarios such that the control
    information is optimized for short packet transmission. The probability that a
    network provides the required level of QoS is called the network availability,
    and in the context of MC-MTC networks, QoS is the set of desired reliability and
    latency levels [156]. To meet the stringent requirements of URLLC in MC-MTC networks,
    high SNR is required at the receiver, and SNR of the received signal depends upon
    the range between the transmitter and the receiver. The authors of [156] proposed
    a framework to optimize the available range and transmission duration in MC-MTC
    networks employing short packet transmission. To enhance network availability,
    the base station is equipped with multiple antennas, while the end nodes have
    only one antenna. This framework can be used in different transmission modes,
    including device-to-device, amplify and forward, and decode and forward. b: Physical
    Layer Authentication (PLA) Although, the use of short packets in mission critical
    communications systems can lead to the satisfaction of the stringent requirements
    of URLLC; the impact of finite block-length coding can cause serious physical-layer
    security issues. PLA is another promising way of meeting the reliability requirement
    in MC-MTC systems employing short packet transmission without using cryptographic
    methods. A common model considered in this regard is composed of three nodes.
    One node called Bob needs to exchange information with the other node called Alice
    in a secure way. There is a third node called Eve, physically distanced in the
    network which can sniff information being exchanged between Bob and Alice, and
    thus can send wrong information to the communicating parties. PLA aims to provide
    information security at the physical layer such that the interference from the
    undesired nodes can be avoided. A PLA based mechanism is proposed in [157] as
    a lightweight authentication in reliable MC-MTC systems. In this work, the receiver
    employs a GMM to make two clusters of the channel estimates, and based upon this
    clustering, it predicts the actual transmitter. The authors of [158] presented
    a queuing theory based detection and delay performance analysis of a PLA protocol
    for single-input multiple output (SIMO) MC-MTC networks. This protocol is investigated
    under different possible attack cases. The authors of [159] analyzed the secrecy
    throughput of MC-MTC networks while considering single and multiple antenna access
    points (AP) in the presence of an eavesdropper equipped with multiple antennas,
    and presented the corresponding latency-reliability tradeoff analysis. 2) Programmable
    Mission Critical Communication Networks 5G is envisioned to provide many heterogeneous
    services. By using network slicing, we divide a single physical network into multiple
    isolated virtual networks such that each virtual network takes care of a specific
    service [160]. Network slicing help manage these diverse network services efficiently.
    Thus, the design and implementation of MC-MTC networks supported by 5G can take
    advantages offered by the network slicing techniques. In [160], different aspects
    of network slicing are discussed in the context of 5G. A network slicing based
    logical network architecture for 5G systems is presented in [161], which covers
    all the fundamental aspects of a cellular communication system. The authors of
    [162] presented a mathematical model of network slicing for three main service
    groups of 5G, such that each group of services is provided with a dedicated set
    of policies. The authors of [163] proposed a network slicing design customized
    for different time mission critical vehicle-to-everything services. The authors
    of [164] discussed non-orthogonal slicing of the radio access network (RAN) resources
    among enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), mMTC, and URLLC devices communicating
    in the uplink to a common base station. Because of the heterogeneous services
    being addressed, this RAN slicing is termed as non-orthogonal multiple access
    (H-NOMA), which is different from the conventional NOMA techniques which share
    radio resources among devices of the same type with homogeneous requirements.
    SDN and NFV are promising techniques to implement network slicing. SDN opens new
    ways to implement MC-MTC networks, and some recent studies provide insight regarding
    the potential usage of SDN in the design of future MC-MTC networks. In [165] an
    SDN and NFV based solution is presented and evaluated for critical infrastructure
    use cases. The authors of [166] presented a software-based framework for 5G systems
    and its hardware implementation MC-MTC networks. The authors also presented a
    practical framework for an experimental study that uses different types of network
    traffic to prioritize mission critical traffic. This framework is used to evaluate
    the end-to-end performance of the proposed systems. The authors of [167] proposed
    an SDN based architecture for 5G to address critical communications. Two important
    switching paradigms named Bare-Metal and fully virtualized switching, are used
    to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The authors of [168] proposed
    a multi-controller architecture that provides a dynamic load balancing scheme
    for SDN based MC-MTC networks. This mechanism reduces the communication overheads
    by allowing the controller to send the load status to the load balancer only when
    the load exceeds a prescribed threshold. This helps reduce the communication overheads
    in MC-MTC networks employing SDN. Communication in smart grid systems is an important
    use case of MC-MTC networks. In this regard, the authors of [169] presented a
    comprehensive survey on the utilization of SDN architectures in smart grid systems.
    While addressing the mission critical communication design challenges at the PHY
    and MAC layers, it can be observed that the current approaches are primarily base
    station-centric and lead towards centralized decision-making strategies. Although
    these works aim to reduce latency and target to achieve ultra-reliability, the
    centralized control strategies may cause additional latency, which might not be
    avoided in these methods [170]. This triggers the need to design new solutions
    that involve less control signalling and employ distributed decision-making approaches.
    Moreover, in the current literature, mission critical communication network design
    considers the heterogeneity caused by three primary services of 5G, namely: URLLC,
    eMBB, and mMTC. However, different mission critical applications may have different
    latency-reliability criteria, and this type of variation in the QoS requirement
    creates another level of design complexity that needs to be addressed accordingly.
    Hence, these gaps in the literature can open new avenues for the research community.
    SECTION VI. IoT Scalability Universal scalability is discussed in this section.
    Universal scalability is separated into hardware scalability, network scalability
    and service scalability. Table 9 defines these different scalability concepts.
    TABLE 9 Applications Involving Edge-Cloud Collaboration Hardware scalability is
    the ability of a piece of hardware to be extended to cope with different environmental,
    network, and service requirements. A common method for implementing hardware scalability
    is offloading part of the device functionality to a server [171], [172]. The authors
    of [171] proposed an architecture that extends device functionality through device
    virtualization. Additionally, this work demonstrates device virtualization in
    the case of a multi-protocol scenario. As a solution, virtual gateways are deployed
    on fog servers to process the packets received by the end devices. However, adding
    functions of another functionality group (for example, adding image sensors to
    a transceiver device) still requires modification from the hardware level. To
    avoid modification from the hardware level, the concept of synthetic sensors is
    proposed [172]. Synthetic sensors can be separated into the device level and the
    server level. The device level is assembled by sensor tags capable of sensing
    data from multiple sensing dimensions. These sensing dimensions are low-level
    data types include vibration, audio, camera, temperature, humidity, air pressure,
    illumination, color, motion, magnetic field, and Received Signal Strength Indicator
    (RSSI). Then, low-level data is transmitted to the server level. On the server
    level, machine learning algorithms process these low-level data and convert them
    into valuable results to users. In conclusion, synthetic sensors create a platform
    with all the raw data types required and extend its functionalities through server-based
    machine learning analytics. Network scalability is the ability to dynamically
    scale resources up and down to process the incoming IoT traffic. A common method
    to ensure network scalability in wireless sensor networks is clustering. The authors
    of [173] reviewed common clustering algorithms. Their work outlines clustering
    into processes of cluster head election and cluster formation. Cluster head election
    is the process of choosing cluster heads from wireless devices, and these cluster
    heads gather data from other members of its cluster and transmit it towards the
    base station [173]. After the cluster heads are elected, other wireless devices
    advertise themselves to the cluster heads and form clusters around these cluster
    heads to join the network [173]. Therefore, new devices can easily join the network
    with the cluster formation process. As a result, scalability is achieved with
    clustering. The clustering techniques assume devices in the network are homogeneous.
    However, in an IoT scenario, devices are heterogeneous [173]. As a solution, intermediate
    fog devices are utilized [174]. Similar to the cluster heads, these fog devices
    gather information from the end IoT devices and transmit it towards a centralized
    server. Different to the wireless sensor network scenario, fog devices are not
    chosen by algorithms. These devices are specialized as an intermediate server.
    The authors of [174] pointed out that as a new IoT device joins the network, the
    device drivers and services can be distributed on the fog devices to achieve a
    simpler integration process. Therefore, fog servers increase the scalability of
    IoT networks. The extensibility of network coverage affects the availability of
    network services to mobile users. The authors of [175] explored antenna-based
    coverage and capacity optimization in cellular networks. Their work is based on
    two major phenomena. The first phenomenon is that the tilting of mobile network
    antennas affects network coverage and capacity. The second phenomenon is that
    there is a tradeoff between coverage and capacity. These phenomena are caused
    by an increase in the power of the received useful signal in a cell and the reduction
    of signal coverage due to antenna tilting. On the other hand, the authors of [176]
    addressed energy efficient parent selection of mobile IoT nodes. To ensure further
    coverage, scalability induced by antenna tilting, online and dynamic antenna configuration
    using reinforcement learning can be applied to cellular networks [177]. This method
    also belongs to the SON self-optimization functionalities [115]. Finally, to further
    extend network coverage, satellites are incorporated to provide network backhaul
    for IoT networks. The usage of satellite backhauls provides advantages of cost
    efficient, ease of deployment, avoidance of damage from natural disasters, seamless
    coverage, and reliability [178]. This could be part of the universal coverage
    solution. Service scalability emphasizes the ability to incorporate new services
    into the existing IoT system. The authors of [179] defined scalability requirements
    of IoT applications as explicit control flow, decentralized interactions, the
    separation between control and computation, and service location transparency.
    This work also categorized IoT service interaction types into direct interactions,
    indirect interactions, event-driven interactions, and exogenous interactions.
    After the evaluation of the service interaction types with the scalability requirements,
    exogenous interactions are the only service interaction type, which satisfies
    all scalability requirements. Exogenous interactions incorporate a coordinator
    to manage all service interactions with different devices and services. Therefore
    control is always managed by coordinators and is separated from service computation.
    From [179], this type of interaction is controlled with explicit control flow
    as the control flow is defined by the coordinators. Also, as a definition of exogenous
    interaction, the control is always separated from service computation. Furthermore,
    exogenous can be decentralized in a hierarchical manner. Finally, location transparency
    is provided by exogenous interaction because coordinators are controlling the
    service interactions, and location data is encapsulated during the process. A.
    SDN Induced Scalability SDNs bring programmability into traditional networks.
    Forwarding devices such as switches and routers can be virtualized in SDNs. This
    is achieved through the separation of control plane and data plane. As a result,
    SDNs simplify network management, minimize the limitation from hardware, and are
    easier to extend network functionality [180]. The advantages of SDNs could also
    be beneficial to manage D2D communication in 5G networks [181]. From Figure 13,
    an SDN architecture consists of the application layer, the control layer, and
    the data-plane layer. The application layer consists of software applications
    communicating with the control layer, the control layer process requests from
    the application layer and manage network devices, and the data-plane layer is
    network infrastructure such as switches and routers [180]. NFV is another technique
    that leverages service virtualization to increase network scalability. European
    Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) defines a standard for NFV architecture
    (Figure 14) [182]. This architecture is assembled by the virtualized network functions
    (VNFs), the NFV infrastructure (NFVI), and NFV management and orchestration. NFVI
    includes the physical resource, which hosts VNFs as virtualized software implementations
    of network functionalities. Both NFVI and VNF are all managed by the NFV management
    and orchestration module. The advantages of the NFV architecture are reduction
    of hardware implementation costs, increasing flexibility and scalability by hosting
    VNFs on hardware, faster service modification due to software-based deployment,
    improved operational efficiency due to possible automation and operating procedures,
    improved power efficiency by planning and offloading workloads. NFV architecture
    is also able to create software interfaces to associate elements from different
    vendors. FIGURE 13. SDN architecture [180]. Show All FIGURE 14. NFV architecture
    [182]. Show All The authors of [183] pointed out that SDN and NFV can benefit
    each other. SDN controllers can be treated as a VNF on the cloud providing flexibility
    to controller distribution. On the other hand, SDN provides its programmability
    to NFV, allowing communication between different VNFs. The combination of SDN
    and NFV further increases scalability. The authors of [183] also provided a software-defined
    NFC architecture that consists of the forwarding devices, the controller module,
    and the NFV Platform. From Figure 15, the forwarding devices are switches and
    routers from the data-plane layer of SDNs. These forwarding devices store forwarding
    tables to process a particular data packet. The forwarding tables are defined
    by the SDN controller. The SDN controller also controls NFV orchestration on the
    control module. Another function of NFV orchestration is to assign functions to
    the NFV platform, where servers host hypervisors supporting virtual machines running
    with the network functions [183]. FIGURE 15. Software defined NFV architecture
    [183]. Show All The authors from [184] identified that in the environment of SDN
    and NFV, connecting and modification of virtual functions are complex due to multiple
    heterogeneous end-user demands and network parameters. Service function chaining
    could be a solution to reduce this complexity and optimize the use of resources.
    The authors from [184] also categorized existing service function chaining models
    into six optimization types as follows: network latency minimization, resource
    utilization optimization, cost minimization, power/energy minimization, service
    level agreement based optimization and quality of service based optimization.
    Finally, the authors of [183] provided a vision of implementing service function
    chaining on the software-defined NFV Architecture. The optimal path of service
    chains is coordinated with the SDN controller fulfilling user requirements and
    resource constraints. Then, service chains are created from multiple VNFs, and
    data packets flow through the path of the service chains. In this section, network
    and service scalability achieved with SDN and NVF are reviewed. The authors of
    [185] indicated the emerging network scalability issues trigger by the network
    management overhead in current networks with increasing size and dynamism. Autonomic
    or self-management of the networks (SONs) [185] could be a solution for these
    issues. On the other hand, IoT interoperability could be another solution to resolve
    scalability issues [186]. SECTION VII. IoT Security The diversified and ubiquitous
    use of IoT systems in foreseeable future necessitate the need of evaluating security
    and privacy requirements for various IoT technologies and applications. In this
    context, due to constrained resources of IoT end-devices, lack of host-based security
    measures, and data-enabled services, numerous threats emerge at different layers
    of IoT architecture. A. Physical Layer Some of the noteworthy threats at physical
    layer include: Eavesdropping: Attackers can introduce devices similar to the end
    nodes in an IoT system to sniff wireless traffic and capture sensitive user data.
    Hardware Failure: IoT device hardware may fail due to manufacturing faults or
    as a result of a cyber-attack. This failure may lead to substantial damage to
    the IoT system as a whole or it may cause physical impairment to the users [187].
    An example of such a successful cyber-attack is Stuxnet [188], that caused physical
    damage to a critical equipment installed at Iranian Nuclear Enrichment Facility.
    Malicious Data Injection: Any persistent attacker can introduce a forged device
    to eavesdrop on the radio traffic, inject fabricated messages or flood the radio
    channels with fake messages to render the system unavailable to the legitimate
    users [189]. Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM): There is always a possibility that
    an attacker can tap and listen to the unprotected communications links between
    the end users and the network/applications servers. Such an attack is often called
    as (MITM) attack. A successful MITM attack may enable the attacker to eavesdrop
    the communication channel or to inject forged malicious data. Sybil Attack: In
    this attack, a malicious node may present multiple identities by generating fake
    new identities or by impersonating other nodes. In the worst case scenario, multiple
    identities may be generated using a single physical device [190]. The attacker
    has the option to present all the Sybil identities simultaneously or one by one
    at different instances. A Sybil attack may affect the outcome of a voting-based
    fault tolerance system or a routing protocol. Loss of Power: In order to abnormally
    drain the battery of an IoT device an attacker can bombard the node with a large
    no of requests (mostly legal) thus preventing it from going to sleep or energy
    saving mode. Disclosure of Critical Information: It is not always the case that
    a communications channel is unprotected. Currently, most of the communications
    protocols especially the wireless protocols such as 802.15.4, LoRaWAN, SigFox,
    ZigBee, and WiFi, encrypt data during transmission. However, still a smart attacker
    may continuously monitor the wireless sensors traffic, for example, of a smart
    home and analyze the pattern of data traffic to differentiate between an idle
    mode or when an event occurs. Hence, even if the data is encrypted, the frequency
    of data traffic may infer critical information to the attacker that the house
    is empty. Therefore, he can plan a robbery. Side-Channel Attacks: Other than intercepting
    the plain text or cipher text messages, attackers may resort to gather and analyze
    side-channel information about the IoT device hardware components. This information
    may include, data about processing time or power consumption while encrypting
    or decrypting data packets of varying lengths generated from different sensors/end
    nodes [191]. Such an analysis may help the attacker to identify the duty cycle
    of various IoT devices based on the frequency of particular messages being transmitted.
    Device Compromise. Most of the IoT devices designed for a particular application
    such as environmental monitoring, temperature, and pressure sensing, etc., are
    not security hardened, thus have weak authentication mechanisms or open debugging
    ports. Hence, these devices can easily be compromised by the malicious attackers.
    In an effort to demonstrate such an attack, security researchers in [192] exploited
    an open Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) interface of a home
    automation system controller. The sequence of actions adopted by the researchers
    to compromise an IoT device is shown in Figure 16. Once the attacker gains access
    to the device, he is able to view the start-up sequence. Hence, he can modify
    the boot parameters and gain low-level access to the device. Attacker may also
    brute force the root password and launch network layer attacks such as port scanning.
    In addition, the attacker may perform network traffic analysis. Attackers also
    have the option to fetch and analyze device firmware, find weaknesses and launch
    further attacks. In another endeavor, security researchers compromised a smart
    meter device through an unsecured Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) interface and
    modified the identity of the device. The researchers also modified write permissions
    to an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-only Memory (EEPROM) that stored
    the device ID. As a result of such a successful attack in real-world malicious
    users can use the spoofed device identity to feed altered power consumption data
    to the controller/gateway device [193]. Similarly, researchers also successfully
    compromised a Google Nest Learning Thermostat and Nike+ Fuelband SE fitness tracker
    by exploiting vulnerabilities in the boot process and some weaknesses in the physical
    design. The attack was successful despite the availability of secure transmission
    protocols such as Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WAP2) and Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) 1.2. In addition, the smart devices also had fairly strong authentication
    mechanism in terms of OAuth authentication tokens and Public Key Cryptography
    Standards VII (PKCS 7) certificates. Node Cloning: Due to cost-effective solutions
    most IoT devices are developed without any hardware tamper-proofing. Therefore,
    it is very easy for a persistent attacker to forge and replicate these devices
    for malicious objectives. Such a replication is called “node cloning” [194]. An
    attacker can clone the devices either in manufacturing phase, or during the operational
    phase. During device manufacturing, an inside attacker can target and substitute
    a particular legitimate device with a similar, pre-programmed one for unauthorized
    purposes. Whereas, during the operational phase attacker has to resort to a carefully
    planned attack to compromise and clone an IoT device. Invasive/Semi-invasive Intrusions:
    Invasive and semi-invasive intrusions are significant threats to IoT devices.
    By using invasive intrusion methods, attackers can steal the cryptographic primitives
    stored on the chip and may compromise any protocol utilizing that secret information.
    In a practical manifestation of such an attack, security researches in [195],
    successfully extracted the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Key from the internal
    memory of Actel ProASIC3 FPGA, by launching “Bumping Attacks” [196]. FIGURE 16.
    Sequence of a device compromise attack. Show All B. Network Layer Most of the
    attacks are anticipated at network layer because it not only links multiple Local
    Area Networks (LANs) but also enables a connection to the Internet. Some of the
    threats that affect data security at this layer include unfairness, impersonation,
    Sybil, and interrogation attacks [197]–[199]. Similarly, numerous Denial-of-Service
    (DoS) attacks that threaten the availability of network services include; channel
    congestion, collision and battery exhaustion attacks [200], [201]. The battery
    congestion attack may be launched by increasing the frame counter value and spoofing
    of acknowledgment frames [202], [203]. Correspondingly, hello flood attack, selective
    forwarding, wormhole attack, blackhole attack [200] and storage attacks [187]
    also threaten availability of network services. Some other DoS attacks may include
    exploitation of Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) protocol by transmitting
    on multiple channels [201], [202] and initiation of fake Previous Access Network
    Identifier (PANId) conflicts. DoS Attacks can also be launched by sending fake/false
    messages to a node, server [204] or a gateway device [205]. In addition, some
    of the threats to the security and integrity of the system include MITM, eavesdropping
    [189], spoofing [200], message fabrication/modification/replay attacks [189],
    unauthorized access to network, compromise of a device (done remotely using malware)
    [187], node replication [197] and insertion of rogue devices [206]. C. Fog/Edge
    Layer The introduction of fog/edge computing with IoT to reduce latency, decrease
    bandwidth, enhance computing power, increase storage and augment security is a
    paradigm shift from centralized cloud-based infrastructure [207], [208]. However,
    as fog/edge is believed to be a nontrivial extension of the cloud, hence certain
    new security and privacy issues have been identified in addition to the existing
    ones. Some of the significant security and privacy challenges include: IoT device
    authentication. Lack of trust measurement mechanism. Absence of IoT device integrity
    check technique and detection of rogue devices. IoT device security and user data
    security and privacy. Non-availability of IoT-centric access control and intrusion
    detection system to avoid insider and external attacks. Key management at end
    devices. D. Security and Privacy Issues During Data Storage and Analytics on Cloud
    Today, the reliance on Big Data analytics to provide valuable business intelligence
    has paved the way for the integration of IoT and cloud computing. No doubt, cloud
    infrastructure has relieved IoT systems from issues involving scalability, constrained
    processing power, limited memory and power to run heavy applications [209]. However,
    like other IoT layers, the vulnerabilities in cloud interfaces can also become
    attack vectors. Therefore, the cloud gateways should be equipped with requisite
    security controls to restrict malicious actors from compromising security and
    privacy of user data [210]. Some of the major security issues in cloud-supported
    IoT systems include: Cloud services are provided under the centralized control
    of one trusted entity. Hence, the cloud is vulnerable to the single point of failure
    concerning security and privacy issues [189] including data manipulation [211],
    [212], and the availability of cloud services. Moreover, cloud also has trust
    issues, as the users have to put their trust in the entity that is providing cloud
    services and handling their data. Hence, users have no control over their data
    assets. Further concerns for user data include: Users do not know where their
    data is stored and what is happening to it. Who has access to it, and is there
    any unauthorized disclosure to the third parties. In regard to data manipulation,
    the cloud service provider has to be a trusted party as it has control over the
    data stored in the cloud and related services. Therefore, the cloud provider can
    manipulate user data [212]. Correspondingly, single point of failure also concerns
    the availability of services when the cloud servers are down because of software
    bugs, cyber-attacks, power problems, cooling and other issues, users find it difficult
    to access the cloud services [211]. Cloud is also vulnerable to un-authorized
    data sharing. For example, in the recent past, private data of 87 million users
    was provided by Facebook to a British political consulting firm “Cambridge Analytica”
    without user permission [213], [214]. Such a data breach results in irreversible
    data security and privacy issues. E. Application Layer Most application developers
    focus more on efficiency and service delivery rather than security. As a result,
    applications remain vulnerable to numerous threats. Lack of application security,
    and weak authentication and authorization mechanisms enable attackers to compromise
    IoT devices using various attack vectors such as malicious code, and brute force
    attacks to guess the hard coded login credentials. The device compromise can then
    result in unwanted disclosure of sensitive information, elevation of privileges
    and data tampering. The attacker can also turn the infected devices into bots
    to launch further attacks on other end devices or network applications [187].
    Moreover, once an adversary gains an initial foothold on the IoT device through
    an insecure application he can also do the exploitation via binary patching, code
    substitution or code extension [215]. Correspondingly, some significant security
    risks to web-based IoT systems have been ranked by OWASP (Open Web Application
    Security Project) [216]. These risks include: Injection flaws in SQL/noSQL Databases,
    Operating Systems (OS) and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This
    vulnerability not only affects traditional Information Technology (IT) systems
    but also poses an equal threat to the IoT applications and database servers. In
    a practical manifestation of such an attack, researchers in [217] successfully
    compromised a smart home device, i.e., a Belkin WeMo Switch. As shown in Figure
    17 firstly, the attacker discovers an SQL injection vulnerability in the IoT device.
    The adversary also discovers that the data is not encrypted during transmission
    between the Belkin WeMo Android Application and the Belikn device. He also finds
    that the authentication mechanism is lacking. The attacker then sends a malicious
    SQLite file to the device and resultantly gets root level access. Once inside,
    the attacker can alter the functionality of the device or he has the option of
    launching a DDoS attack. For example, The lamp is kept on for a long time irrespective
    of the rules defined by the user. It is imperative to mention here that once an
    attacker gains root level access to the device; he can even kill the firmware
    update process initiated remotely by the vendor. Hence, the device can be kept
    in the compromised state for as long as desired by the attacker or until the device
    is updated on site [218]. Malicious actors can steal user identities and compromise
    passwords, cryptographic keys, and session tokens due to incorrect session management
    and incorrect implementation of authentication in applications. For example, a
    user does not change the default username and password or the wireless router
    has hardcoded credentials for the admin account. Hence, researchers in [219] were
    able to hijack the session using ARP poisoning and gain access to the camera feed
    of the Withings Smart baby Monitor. Security misconfiguration is one of the most
    common weaknesses. It implies insecure default configurations, open cloud storage,
    mis-configured Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) headers, and overblown error
    messages that may contain sensitive information. An IoT device is insecure without
    secure configuration and timely upgrades of its OS and applications [218]. XSS
    (Cross Site Scripting): By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can run an
    arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of target systems [217], [220]. Resultantly,
    it can lead to the hacking of the smart devices and ultimately the theft of private
    data. Security Issues in Application Layer Protocols: Security researchers have
    shown concern over the security issues in various application layer protocols
    such as HTTP, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing
    Protocol (AMQP), and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [221].
    These protocols rely on TLS and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for the
    security during communication especially in a client-server environment. However,
    these protocols are vulnerable to plain-text recovery attacks, as demonstrated
    by the researchers in [221]. Moreover, another significant issue with these protocols
    is that they were not designed to be used for resource constrained IoT devices.
    Subsequently, these protocols add additional traffic overheads with every connection
    establishment that ultimately drain the computing and power resources of IoT devices
    [222]. FIGURE 17. SQL injection attack on Belkin WeMo switch. Show All F. Business
    Layer Data received from IoT devices through web/application servers is stored
    and processed mostly in the cloud. The processed data is then used to provide
    various data-enabled services to the users, and third parties. This big data analytics
    is no doubt beneficial, but at the same time various security and privacy issues
    emerge. Users that are basically the data owners do not know where their data
    is stored and who has access to it. Moreover, cloud service providers may share
    some private information of the users with third parties without de-anonymization.
    Most of the tools currently being used to store and compute big data, such as
    Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and MapReduce framework lack adequate security
    to protect sensitive user data [223]. Hence, there is a need to develop a comprehensive
    defense strategy to protect IoT systems from various security and privacy threats.
    G. Application Specific Security Requirements There are myriad of IoT applications
    that have significant impact concerning safety, security and privacy of people,
    in case of any security breach. All of these applications cannot be discussed
    here; however some of the critical ones are highlighted in the subsequent paragraphs.
    1) IoT in Healthcare IoT has revolutionized healthcare domain by connecting wearable
    healthcare devices, smart homes, hospitals, medical staff, and other processes.
    Such an integration is no doubt beneficial. However, being interconnected and
    remotely accessible, these services are vulnerable to major cyber-physical security
    risks [224]. Some of the significant security and privacy issues concerning Healthcare
    IoT infrastructure, and services include: Weaknesses in network access control
    mechanisms and threats to data authentication, integrity and availability [225].
    Due to the interconnections, a failure in one infrastructure can cause cascading
    failures among its dependent systems/processes [226]. Unauthorized access to user
    data by third parties. Lack of role-based controlled access to patient data. Existing
    single party owned centralized systems to store and process user data provide
    single point of failure. Vulnerability to ransomware attacks [227]. 2) Industrial
    IoT The development of first Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) in 1968 by Modicon
    laid the foundations of classical industrial automation. This automation pyramid
    comprise of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) layer, Manufacturing Execution
    System (MES), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) layer, PLC layer
    and sensing layer comprising sensors and actuators [228]. For a longtime the security
    of industrial systems was based on the principle of obscurity, i.e., by hiding
    the details about internal network and related technologies. However, with the
    increase in the level of automation, and reliance on remote access for ease in
    monitoring and control, the industrial systems have become a lucrative target
    for the cyber-attackers/hackers. In this context, Stuxnet was the game changer,
    that made the world realized that the security of critical infrastructure is a
    necessity [218]. Stuxnet is believed to be a targeted computer worm that was designed
    to sabotage CPS installed in Iranian Nuclear Enrichment Facility. It exploited
    four zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows-based systems to gain an initial foothold
    [229]. Stuxnet specifically targeted personal computers running WinCC/PCS-7 control
    software used for programming the PLCs [230]. It could act as a MITM attacker
    and mask the malicious code execution by replaying twenty one seconds of legitimate
    process input signals. The malware payload comprised rootkits which could hide
    its presence and was also equipped with stolen digital certificates to appear
    legitimate. The payload altered the speed of frequency converter drives (from
    specific vendors Fararo Paya from Iran and Vacon from Finland) to cause physical
    damage to over 900 centrifuges [188]. Other than malware attacks, the industrial
    systems are also vulnerable to numerous threats including: DoS, DDoS, ransomware,
    message spoofing, data integrity and non-repudiation, information disclosure,
    and elevation of privileges. 3) Smart City Security Requirements The advances
    in IoT technologies and related smart gadgets have given birth to a new paradigm
    called “Smart Cities.” That aims to dynamically optimize the use and availability
    of numerous tangible and intangible resources. However, due to reliance on IoT
    devices for sensing and initial processing of perceived data, and vulnerability
    of IoT devices to numerous cyber attacks, the attack surface for a smart city
    also increases. Hence, authors in [231] highlight certain necessary requirements
    to design a secure smart city. These requirements include: secure communication
    [232], secure booting of IoT devices [233], security monitoring and incident response
    strategy [231], secure software/firmware update and patching [234], authentication,
    identification, and access control [235]–[237], and data and application security.
    SECTION VIII. Security Measures Figure 18 shows a defense-in-depth approach that
    acts as a guideline to protect IoT systems against threats at all the layers of
    IoT architecture. Not all the IoT applications may require all these measures.
    Depending upon the nature of IoT application, a combination of these guidelines
    may suffice. Risk Assessment and Threat Modelling: For the development of an effective
    defense mechanism firstly, there is a requirement of carrying out the risk assessment
    for all processes, equipment (both hardware and software), stakeholders and information
    assets at each layer of IoT architecture. The aim of such an assessment is to
    identify the assets that are deemed critical for the business. Failure of any
    of which may cause significant security, privacy, financial and safety issues.
    It is followed by an appropriate risk treatment/mitigation process to minimize
    the damage of such events. Correspondingly, most of the information security standards
    such as International Standards Organization (ISO)-27001 [238], and National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication 800–30 [239] enforce risk management
    as an integral part of the overall controls. Any such standard can be followed
    until there are some IoT specific standards on board. Preventive Measures: The
    primary objective of preventive measures is to mitigate the weaknesses which attackers
    can exploit to initiate a security breach. These measures include: Security by
    design: IoT solution architects should consider a non-zero likelihood of security
    breaches while planning, designing and developing an IoT system. It is very important
    that security should be enabled by design and users should have the option to
    change the security settings as per their personal requirements [240], [241].
    Certain practices that help achieving security by design are: trusted environment
    for secure computing, security of all open/debugging ports, preserving integrity
    of the firmware/code, multi-factor authentication, and by default block all traffic
    at the ingress. Identity Management: An effective identity management mechanism
    not only protects against identity spoofing, and device replication attacks but
    also compliments network layer security protocols such as Transmission Layer Security
    (TLS), and IPSec [242]. Tamper-Proofing: IoT device tamper-proofing is considered
    to be a potent defense against physical device compromise, unauthorized access,
    firmware modifications and device cloning [243], [244]. Moreover, complimented
    by a secure execution environment, it can protect against code modification and
    malicious payload execution attacks [242]. Use of Pseudonymous Identities: Use
    of pseudonyms protects the users against most of the privacy threats by de-linking
    user identities from the Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It can be
    achieved by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), i.e., by issuing public keys
    to the users of an IoT system for authentication and authorization of various
    services. These public keys can be issued in the form of X.509 certificates by
    a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) [245]. Identity-based Authenticated Encryption
    and Mutual Authentication Scheme: Such an authentication and data security technique
    not only protects against impersonation, MITM, and eavesdropping threats but also
    from data forgery, data modification, and message replay attacks [246]–[248].
    Homomorphic Encryption: To avoid privacy issues in a cloud environment where user
    data is processed, analyzed and shared with third parties, homomorphic encryption
    is considered to be an effective tool [249]. Blockchain Technology: Since the
    success of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency [250], blockchain has disrupted conventional
    IT industry. The inherent cryptographic security of blockchain protects against
    most of the data forgery, modification, replay and authentication threats. It
    also provides a transparent log of events that facilitates system audit at any
    time [251]. Role-based Access Control: Issues related to the security and privacy
    of data and unauthorized access to the network services can be prevented by deploying
    role-based access controls [206]. Secure Remote Access: Not only in private sector
    but in public organizations as well, sometimes the users are required to work
    from home. Hence, there should be a mechanism of remotely connecting users at
    their homes with the organization networks and systems. For example, use of a
    Virtual Private Network (VPN) service can protect against attacks on corporate
    networks and threats to sensitive Business Intelligence (BI) [252]. Key Management:
    Secure management of cryptographic keys including generation, distribution, storage,
    revocation, and update is an essential requirement to protect against masquerading
    attacks and exposure of critical information. Network Segmentation: To curtail
    the effects of network or a node compromise using network segmentation is recommended
    to be an effective approach. Network segmentation can be achieved by defining
    de-militarized zones, physical isolation, VLANs, software-defined perimeter, application
    firewalls, and content-based filtering [253]. Software-defined Networking (SDN)
    based Virtual Security: Network Virtualization using SDN can augment IoT device-level
    protection by implementing security at the network level, hence, reducing cost
    and add-ons for low-end devices [254]. Use of self-encrypting drives/devices:
    Data privacy is one of the fundamental issues in this age of internet and smart
    technologies. Therefore, it is believed that use of self-encrypting drives and
    on-chip flash memories may provide requisite security by design against unauthorized
    disclosure of private user data [243]. Security Awareness: In the tech savvy world,
    it is very crucial that organizations should invest in educating their employees
    on security concerns. It can be achieved through various workshops, seminars and
    periodic lectures on cyber threats and requisite precautionary measures. Detective
    Measures: As the name suggests, even if an attacker is successful in gaining an
    initial foothold into any IoT system, the detective measures will help in identifying
    any malicious activity. Some of these measures may include: Secure Log Management:
    Most of the attackers/hackers try to wipe off their footprints after an unauthorized
    intrusion into a critical system. Hence, keeping a secure log of all activities
    in the network helps to expose any unusual activity or a security breach. Network
    Security Analysis: CISCO [255], and IBM [256] have developed various network security
    analysis tools that are helpful in detecting numerous anomalies, malfunctions
    and security breaches. Edge Security Analysis: In addition to the network security
    analysis, edge security analytics facilitates isolation of security events at
    the source and limit attack spectrum [242]. Network-level Security Measures: Network-level
    security measures to enforce cross-device security policies can easily detect
    manipulation of actuator actions based on malicious/modified sensors data [257].
    Device Attestation: If possible, there should be some mechanism of performing
    runtime IoT device code attestation to check for the presence of any malicious
    payload or modification in the original code. The successful code verification
    is expected to shrink the attack surface [258]. Penetration Testing and Vulnerability
    Assessment: Periodic network penetration testing is always helpful in detecting
    weaknesses in all the layers of IoT architecture, web UI/APIs, and servers to
    initiate respective counter/response measures. Responsive Measures: The best way
    an organization can respond to a cyber security incident is by preparing an effective
    incident response plan. Mostly, these plans are rolled out by a team usually called
    as Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT). These teams comprise skilled professionals
    including cyber security experts, information security auditors, legal experts,
    IT administrators and other specialized members. The primary objective of CERT
    is to develop and practice a diligent response plan against any security breach
    so that all the team members are clear about their responsibilities. The response
    measures are often termed as after-incident reactive measures, which include:
    Disconnect the affected system from the Internet. Isolation of the compromised
    devices/parts of the system allowing rest of the system to continue uninterrupted
    operation. Revocation and blacklisting of malicious nodes. Initiation of anti-tamper
    mechanism, in which, as soon as the hardware of the node is interfered with, the
    memory of the node that contains firmware and code should immediately be wiped
    off, and the node should only join the network after being physically activated
    instead of OTAA (Over-The-Air-Activation). Recover important business and personal
    data from the backup. Corrective Measures: Once a security event has occurred
    and the compromised devices/parts of the system are identified and isolated, they
    need to be recovered to operational condition. There are two known methods of
    node restoration, i.e., self-recovery and remote attestation. In self-recovery,
    the faulty device performs integrity check of the code running on it and the last
    best configuration stored in read-only memory. If the validation fails, the device
    deletes the current code and re-installs the last best configuration. The device
    then restarts and performs validation of all its modules. Whereas, in the later
    method, the compromised/faulty device sends integrity report to the controller/gateway
    device for remote validation [243]. If the validation fails, a secure firmware
    update process is initiated by the verifier. To conclude, Table 10 summarizes
    threats at different layers of IoT architecture, including physical, network,
    fog/edge, data orchestration/cloud, application, and business layer. Similarly,
    Table 11 highlights the essentials of defense-in-depth approach to secure IoT
    systems. TABLE 10 Threats to IoT TABLE 11 IoT Defense-in-Depth Approach FIGURE
    18. Defense-in-depth approach. Show All SECTION IX. IoT Sustainability While IoT
    technology has gone through a significant level of advancements in recent years,
    there are still a number of constraints associated with battery dependency, limited
    lifetime, and environmental pollution of these portable devices. Until now, energy
    has been one of the barriers to large-scale adoption and deployments in IoT devices.
    Integrating EH systems with IoT devices extend their lifetime, decrease energy
    costs, and reduce environmental pollution by using green energy sources [259].
    Hence, self-powered IoT devices that can operate autonomously are an emerging
    topic of interest among researchers [260], [261]. Energy harvesting is a sustainable,
    cost-effective, green energy solution to provide an alternative energy source
    for remotely deployed IoT devices and sensors. Energy harvesting or scavenging
    is the process of collecting energy from freely available ambient sources, and
    EH is a device that converts ambient energy into DC power to supply Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSNs), biosensors and IoT devices [262]–[266]. Depending on the type
    of energy available, there are a number of techniques for energy scavenging from
    ambient sources such as solar, thermal, mechanical sources (for example, wind,
    kinetic, vibration) and radio frequency (RF) waves. These sustainable sources
    are all in abundance and are produced in a pure form on our planet [266]. Harvested
    energy is often used for WSN, wearable electronics, and portable IoT devices [259],
    [267]. However, not all ambient sources are appropriate for energy harvesting
    in IoT applications. Basically, the energy harvester (EH) integrated with IoT
    devices should produce at least milliwatts of power from the environment. Figure
    19 shows generated DC power of different energy harvesting technologies and the
    power consumption of different electronic devices to demonstrate the usefulness
    of energy harvesting techniques for these devices [259]. FIGURE 19. Generated
    power using various energy harvesting technologies and typical power consumption
    of devices. Show All A. Energy Harvester Systems in IoT Devices EH system converts
    ambient energy, such as solar energy, thermal, vibrational, or RF energy into
    usable electrical energy. According to Figure 20, an EH consists of three main
    components: power transducer, storage (battery/ supercapacitor), and power management
    unit (interface) [268]. FIGURE 20. General block diagram of an energy harvesting
    system. Show All Transducers convert ambient energy into electrical DC power and
    commonly referred to an “energy harvester.” In addition, the battery/supercapacitor
    collects cumulative DC power over a period of time, and the power management unit
    transfers maximum energy from the battery/ supercapacitor to the IoT device. Since
    energy supply and demand may come at different times, in practice, a temporary
    energy buffer (for example, supercapacitor) and power management unit are necessary
    to deliver harvested energy to the IoT device effectively. Therefore, the power
    interface (power management unit) makes the produced energy feasible to the load
    using various adjustments such as voltage regulation (DC/DC convertor) and power
    management functions [269]. Supercapacitors have been investigated as an alternative
    green energy storage due to their advantages compared to batteries [270]. They
    have quicker charge time (~1000 times over batteries), larger operating temperature
    range (−40~+85°C), ability to withstand millions of charge/discharge cycles, nearly
    infinite shelf life and lack of toxic heavy metals [271]. Although nearly perfect
    for IoT applications, a supercapacitor has its own disadvantages such as lower
    energy density (10 times smaller than batteries) and unstable output voltage over
    long time-span. To address the quick charging and long-lasting requirements of
    IoT systems, and to overcome the inherent disadvantages of supercapacitors, an
    overall power management solution is proposed using supercapacitor management
    integrated circuits (ICs) [272], [273]. Recently, supercapacitors with very low
    equivalent series resistance (ESR) much less than 0.1 ohm have been presented
    which are capable to work efficiently over a wide temperature range of −40° to
    85°C [274]. Further, they can be discharged at high current level up to 10 A which
    make them a suitable candidate for IoT applications and large-scale WSNs in precision
    agriculture (for example, plant and soil sensors) [275]. In addition, supercapacitor
    has an excellent reliability in comparison with battery in the market. High durability
    guarantees less degradation and a longer working time under high temperature condition
    [274]. Table 12 exhibits key benefits of supercapacitor relative to battery. The
    application of supercapacitors in micro-satellites has been also investigated
    [276] as supercapacitor cells are capable of surviving in harsh environments (for
    example, space applications). TABLE 12 Comparison Table of Supercapacitor vs.
    Battery Finally, supercapacitors are ideal storage candidate when a quick charge
    is required to address a short-term power need; whereas batteries are chosen to
    provide long-term energy storage. Therefore, combining supercapacitors with batteries
    in a hybrid mode provide an optimum solution which satisfies both requirements.
    This reduces battery stress, resulting in a longer service life [277]. EH systems
    for IoT devices should fulfill certain requirements, such as power range, cost,
    and dimension. A low profile, compact, maintenance-free, low-cost, and highly
    efficient EH is suitable for IoT devices. Recent advancements in integrated circuit
    architecture have created the potential to integrate multiple features into one
    chip (for example, monolithic microwave integrated circuit technologies). Hence,
    IoT size is not a bottleneck anymore. Moreover, employing RF technologies has
    allowed for size and cost reductions in integrated IoT devices with EH [278].
    Sustainable IoT devices driven by EH have been attracting significant interest
    from different sectors such as smart cities, health care, and precision agriculture
    [259]. Table 13 presents an overview of different sensor types and their maximum
    power demand. Moreover, in each sensor type, a typical sensor and its power consumption
    are presented. Table 14 and 15 present some examples of industrial IoT devices
    powered by integrated EH systems. TABLE 13 Overview of Different Sensor Types
    and Their Power Demand TABLE 14 Overview of Embedded Energy Harvester Used in
    IoT Applications TABLE 15 Overview of External Mounted Energy Harvester Used in
    IoT Applications 1) RF Energy Harvesting RF energy scavenging has experienced
    rapid development recently due to the increasing number of RF transmitter sources,
    which are producing an abundant ambient electromagnetic energy [267]. A prominent
    advantage of RF harvesting is the capability to transform dissipated microwave
    energy into usable electrical power during day and night, both indoor and outdoor.
    Further, penetrations of RF signals inside structures (for example, walls, bridges,
    tunnels) and underground allow for RF energy harvesting and wireless power charging
    where other energy sources (for example, solar, wind) are not available [268],
    [278], [301]. RF energy harvesting offers a novel approach to develop environmentally
    sustainable IoT devices by employing ambient energy and converting electromagnetic
    resources to electricity. To this end, receiving antennas is integrated with rectifying
    circuits (rectifying antenna or rectenna) to harvest RF energy from a focused
    beam (Wireless Power Transfer/ WPT) and other freely available sources in the
    environment (Ambient RF Energy Scavenging). RF energy harvesting system eliminates
    the need for returning IoT devices to base for recharging. These devices could
    be powered through ambient energy sources or wireless power transmission. This
    is of paramount importance for autonomous systems in remote or harsh areas where
    accessibility is a problem [262]. From a practical perspective, efficiency, sensitivity,
    and compactness are key factors of EH, as RF energy harvesting in free space suffers
    from a large propagation loss [302]. Enabling simultaneous multi-band and multi-tone
    signals in the input of an EH system and taking advantage of the RF combining
    method, the rectifier sensitivity and generated output power can be enhanced [261],
    [262], [303]. Further, RF technology allows for size reduction using metamaterials
    in applications where miniaturization is required [303]–[305]. 2) Spaceborne Energy
    Harvesting Another method of generating an alternative energy source for ground-based
    IoT devices is using Sun-synchronous satellites. Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) is
    a particular kind of polar orbit. Satellites in SSO, traveling over the Polar
    Regions, are synchronous with the Sun. This means they are synchronized to always
    be in the same “fixed” position relative to the Sun. Hence, the satellite will
    always observe a point on the Earth at the same time of the day, which creates
    a number of applications [306]. One of the key applications of this system is
    providing DC power for ground-based IoT devices, as depicted in Figure 21. FIGURE
    21. Block diagram of an energy harvesting system. Show All Space satellites collect
    sunlight using solar cells which transform the absorbed energy into DC power (Figure
    21). Subsequently, the high voltage DC power is supplied to RF generators, i.e.,
    magnetron generates RF power which can be transferred to a ground station or IoT
    devices, directly [307]. The receiving ground-based antenna integrated with rectifier
    (RF to DC convertor) regenerates DC power from RF power. In this method, energy
    is directed from space to the Earth to support large-scale WSNs with sufficient
    power sources. B. Simultaneous Wireless Information and RF Power Transfer High
    data rate, small dimension, and low-cost are important metrics in the next generation
    IoT devices and communication technologies. Hence, the use of simultaneous wireless
    information and power transfer (SWIPT) is investigated to improve energy efficiency
    as well as information transfer of the network [308], [309]. It has been proven
    that RF power transfer allows wireless nodes to recharge their batteries from
    receiving RF signals, leading to the fifth-generation green communication technologies
    [259], [310]. Moreover, conventional forms of SWIPT systems such as time splitting,
    power splitting, antenna switching, and partial switching are suitable for IoT
    networks [308]. In [311], a new concept and design of a three-dimensional antenna
    array is addressed. The purpose of this paper is to enhance efficiency of SWIPT
    systems when integrated into WSN architectures. Using 3D antenna, an omnidirectional
    radiation pattern can be achieved with considerable gain and low power losses
    [312]. Consequently, 3D arrays prove to be a reliable solution to feed low power
    WSNs that are placed over the 360 azimuth angles in a smart grid farm. Moreover,
    several pioneers working on SWIPT have attempted to focus the energy of the electromagnetic
    wave as much as possible in order to increase the efficiency of power and data
    transfer [313], [314]. Nevertheless, the most interesting aspect regarding the
    architecture of SWIPT is how to concentrate electromagnetic power based on the
    location of the sensor. Simple beam scanning approach is suggested to identify
    the location of wireless sensors and concentrating microwave power using beam-steering
    method according to a preset look-up table [315]. Recently, a novel analog real-time
    spectrum analyzer (RTSA) was suggested and experimentally tested on the basis
    of the spectral-spatial decomposition property of the composite right and left
    handed (CRLH) leaky wave antenna (LWA) [316]–[318] which can be used as a beam-steering
    configuration to feed sensors in a smart grid field (for example, large-scale
    farms). According to Figure 22, a leaky wave antenna array is used to feed a variety
    of agriculture sensors in each beam direction. FIGURE 22. Beam-steering configuration
    for feeding sensors (SWIPT application) in a smart grid field. Show All SECTION
    X. IoT Interoperability A. Interoperability Between Standards IoT networks are
    created with massive heterogeneous devices. The communication of these different
    devices is a key problem. To solve this problem, different standards are created
    to standardize the information exchanging process within IoT networks. The authors
    of [319] summarized all these standards and categorize them into communication,
    RFID, Data content and encoding, electronic product code, sensor, network management,
    middle, and quality of service. Apart from these protocols, there are also standards
    designed to fit the IoT use cases, such as, IoT6 [320]. With all these standards
    and protocols aiming for different scenarios, inter-communication between standards
    is an issue. This introduces interoperability problems of IoT. In Table 16, the
    authors of [186] classified interoperability problem into device interoperability,
    network interoperability, syntactical interoperability, semantic interoperability,
    and platform interoperability. The authors from [186] also aggregated different
    works and form seven approaches tackling the problem of interoperability. As the
    first approach, adapters and gateways are utilized as an intermediate bridge between
    different standards and specifications [186]. The intermediate device is compatible
    with multiple standards and specifications. Therefore, such a device can communicate
    with different IoT devices by converting messages between different protocols.
    However, this method assumes TCP/IP support on devices and does not account for
    the limitation of resources of IoT devices. Also, scalability is a problem as
    the message conversion process needs to be defined between all IoT protocols.
    The second approach is using a virtualized network overlay layer above physical
    networks. This approach supports end-to-end communication using different protocols.
    Unfortunately, scalability issues induced by different protocols persist. TABLE
    16 Types of IoT Interoperability [186] The third approach in [186] consists of
    four different network technologies. The first technology is TCP/IP. Interoperability
    is implemented by embedding the TCP/IP stack on smart devices. Therefore, these
    devices can communicate with standard network protocols. The second technology
    is SDN. This programmable network technology provides intelligence, efficiency,
    security, and scalability to IoT networks. This can also be achieved with NFV,
    where virtual networks separate network functions with the physical equipment.
    Furthermore, physical equipment can be shared between different network functions.
    The final technology is fog computing. Fog computing relies on fog servers to
    preprocess raw data from the end devices and preparing these data to be interoperable
    for other applications [186]. The fourth approach is using open APIs [186]. A
    commonly used example is the REST API. Open APIs provide standard methods to access
    data or services. This provides cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability.
    A future direction is a generic API for uniform resource access. A service-oriented
    architecture is implemented above the network layer as the fifth approach to achieve
    interoperability. The aim of this architecture is to package the IoT device resource
    as standard services. Therefore, device data can be standardized into services,
    providing syntactic interoperability [186]. The IoT6 standard is an example of
    this approach. IoT6 is an IPv6-based service-oriented architecture that provides
    interoperability between heterogeneous system components [320]. The last two approaches
    to achieving IoT interoperability are semantic web technologies and open standards.
    Both of these approaches require a recognized organization to provide common definitions
    [186]. Semantic web technologies define a common understanding of the various
    entities. Once a common vocabulary of standard, data and format is agreed, semantic
    interoperability can be achieved. The final approach is the establishment of open
    standards. These standards are provided by recognized organizations to achieve
    interoperability with IoT networks implementing these standards. An example is
    the AllSeen Alliance, defining the AllJoyn for device interoperability and the
    oneM2M for platform interoperability [186]. The ISO also developed a framework
    (ISO/IEC NP 21823) for IoT interoperability [321]. They established standards
    on semantic interoperability and network connectivity. SECTION XI. User Friendly
    IoT This section provides insights into the usability of IoT 2.0. The purpose
    is to create a vision of future IoT that aims to lower the entry barrier of IoT
    services for non-expert users. This vision starts with exploring the previous
    technologies of lowering entry barriers for non-expert users. These technologies
    are cloud computing-based services, which are infrastructure as a service (IaaS),
    platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). The usability
    of these technologies is created by increasing accessibility, increasing scalability
    and flexibility, the use of virtualization, reducing cost on maintenance, and
    standardization [322], [323]. Accessibility is created by the feature of the cloud,
    where users can easily access the services through the Internet. Scalability and
    flexibility are induced by the virtualization of hardware and software resources
    [323]. Therefore, users do not need to directly configure these resources, as
    a standardized interface can reduce the complexity of resource configuration [322].
    Finally, as maintenance is mostly done by the service providers, the cost of maintenance
    is reduced on the user side [322]. The authors of [324] offered the five features
    to ensure the usability of IoT systems. These features are Plug & Play, interoperability,
    the ability for remote control and monitor, cost effectiveness, and open source,
    open architecture. Also, by deduction from the cloud computing services, a standardized
    interface can increase the usability of systems and fulfill the features of remote
    control and interoperability. However, due to the heterogeneity of IoT devices,
    a solution is to adopt modularization. The authors from [325] proposed Internet
    of Things as a service (iTaaS). iTaaS utilizes service oriented architecture,
    which is built with modular and reusable service modules. Thus, this architecture
    reduces the time of service development, service deployment, and service configuration.
    iTaaS only reduces complexity and interoperability issues for software deployment.
    Different from cloud computing services, IoT devices are heterogeneous and deployed
    in complex environments. Therefore, the customization of IoT devices is important
    to support different use cases [326]. The authors from [326] also emphasized that
    the modularization of IoT devices can reduce cost and complexity for non-technical
    personnel. Therefore, modularization increases the cost effectiveness and usability
    of IoT systems. To reduce the cost of maintenance, IoT devices must operate in
    a self-organized, secure manner and avoid extra human intervention. The authors
    of [327] mentioned that self-organized IoT networks should contain the following
    features: cooperative communication model to support communication across different
    layers with suitable resource control, situational awareness to monitor neighbor
    devices and faults, and automated load-balancing to extend the overall lifetime
    of the whole system. A possible solution is the SONs mentioned in the sections
    above. SONs provide machine learning-driven self-configuration, self-optimization,
    and self-healing functionalities [111]. Finally, as a vision towards the future,
    industry level standardization and efficient device deployment method is required
    for IoT systems. The authors from [328] pointed out that standardization drives
    standard testing and manufacturing procedures. Thus, this provides end users with
    more trust and confidence in IoT products. Another problem with current IoT systems
    is device deployment. Most work on IoT deployment focuses on software deployment
    and topology [324]. However, most devices are still deployed by humans. Novel
    device deployment methods should be invented to automate this process. SECTION
    XII. IoT Applications This section starts with presenting some existing applications
    of IoT systems. These applications are categorized into smart home applications,
    smart city applications, healthcare applications, and smart farm applications.
    Then, a vision of possible applications of Industry 4.0 and Tactile Internet is
    revealed. A. Smart Home Applications Smart home applications leverage IoT devices
    and sensors to provide people convenience. The majority of smart home applications
    are home automation systems, which use the result of analyzing sensor data to
    automate a certain activity [329]. In [329] Healthcare system for elders and people
    with disabilities is a type of home automation system. These systems collect data
    from CCTV, motion sensors, and body sensor networks to perform analytics and push
    medical reminders. Another application is the pet care system. Temperature sensors
    are attached to a pet dog to monitor its body temperature. When the temperature
    sensor detects any anomaly, the air conditioner is automatically switched on to
    comfort the pet. The authors of [330] explored the smart grid as another major
    field of smart home applications. This field of applications leverages smart meters,
    smart appliances, and smart power outlets. The aim of smart grid applications
    is to monitor and control power production and consumption to achieve a balance
    between production and consumption. Furthermore, it reduces the waste of power
    induced by overproduction. Applications under the smart grid field are real-time
    generation monitoring, power plants controlling, alternative energy source controlling,
    and residential production controlling [330]. B. Smart City Applications Smart
    city applications solve problems and issues in the public sector. The authors
    of [331] and [332] both summarized smart city applications in their works (Table
    17). In their work, smart home applications are viewed as a part of the smart
    city applications. Other applications include smart parking, augments maps, logistics,
    smart water supply, smart cars, smart grid, weather monitor, pollution monitor,
    surveillance systems, traffic monitor, and healthcare. TABLE 17 IoT Smart City
    Applications [331], [332] C. Healthcare Applications Compared to traditional and
    manual health monitoring systems, IoT healthcare systems have a few advantages
    [333]. First, IoT devices are relatively portable. These devices can be worn by
    the patients to provide constant monitoring [333]. Also, with IoT devices, voluminous
    data can be accessed remotely in a quicker pack compared to the traditional methods
    [333]. These advantages attracted the development of different IoT healthcare
    applications. The authors of [334] classified IoT healthcare applications into
    home healthcare, mobile health and electronic health, and hospital management.
    Home healthcare IoT applications move the setting from a hospital to the homes
    of people. It is achieved through remote monitoring through IoT devices [334].
    Similarly, mobile health and electronic health also rely on remote monitoring
    of patients. However, it focuses more on wearable sensors [334]. The above two
    types of applications involve single condition applications such as diabetes glucose
    level sensing designed for specific diseases; and cluster condition applications
    such as rehabilitation systems that can help treat different diseases together
    [335]. As the final type of IoT healthcare applications, hospital management applications
    are responsible for the management and improvement of various hospital services
    [334]. For example, safety and violence detection systems using cameras and biometric
    sensors could track staff, patients, and visitors, and detect signs of aggression
    or stress [336]. Equipment tracking and maintenance systems can manage scarce
    shared equipment, and remind staff for requirements of equipment refill or calibration
    [336]. D. Smart Farm Applications The two major types of smart farm applications
    are crop monitoring and animal monitoring. The authors of [337] reviewed several
    different crop monitoring systems. These monitoring systems usually trigger actuator
    actions. In [337], one example is the irrigation system. Humidity, temperature,
    and weather data are collected to make the decision of irrigation. Another example
    is weed detection. In the application of weed detection, images are passed through
    a CNN model to detect weed. If weed is detected, a smart herbicide sprayer robot
    is activated to spray herbicide. Animal monitoring applications aim to use sensors
    data to monitor and predict animal behavior. The authors from [337] described
    a smart beehive application. The smart beehive monitors oxygen, carbon dioxide,
    pollutant levels, temperature, and humidity to determine the health status of
    the bee colony. The authors of [338] reviewed machine learning-based animal monitoring
    applications. This work focuses on animal welfare. The first application of this
    work detects dietary changes and mating periods of cattle using ensemble learning
    based on data from magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. The second application
    identifies and classifies chewing patterns in calves with DT leveraging optical
    sensor data. The authors from [339] created a full system of smart animal farm.
    This smart animal farm consists of four major applications. The first application
    detects biogases with a gas sensor. When the gas reaches a certain level, it emits
    the gas to prevent harm to the animals. The second application is auto-feeding.
    This application uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the level of food in storage
    and automatically add food using a valve. The third application is water level
    detection. Similar to auto-feeding, a water level sensor is used to open the water
    pump if the water is below a certain level. Finally, the incubator control system
    reads data from the humidity sensor and temperature sensor to control environmental
    parameters using a heater and a fan [339]. E. Industry 4.0 Applications Industry
    4.0 applications focus on CPSs in production and manufacture. The authors of [340]
    determined three important characteristics of industrial applications. The first
    characteristic is cycle time determined by the round-trip time between the control
    center and end device. The second characteristic is the number of nodes determined
    by the size of the system. The final characteristic is reliability determined
    by the quality of information transmission. The authors of [340] also separated
    Industry 4.0 applications into process automation and factory automation. Process
    automation is characterized by an industrial process operated by sensors for data
    collection, controllers for controlling, and actuators for actuating the controller
    decision. The cycle time of process automation should be 100 ms with medium quality
    of information transmission. A more critical scenario is factory automation, which
    is the automation of the manufacturing process [340]. Therefore, it requires frequent
    collaboration between multiple robotics and assembly line machinery. Hence, a
    short latency of 1 ms with high reliability is required [340]. F. Tactile Internet
    Applications The feature of low latency and ultra-high reliability of Tactile
    Internet attract applications like self-driving vehicles and industrial automation.
    For example, V2X communication requires real-time communication with latency less
    than 10 ms, and CPSs with mobile robot collaboration requires high reliability
    and real-time communication in manufacturing applications [341]. However, the
    core of Tactile Internet application should be based on haptic communications.
    The authors from [342] defined haptic architecture into the master domain, the
    network domain, and the slave domain. The master domain is usually a haptic device
    controlled by a human. The haptic device can control the slave domain through
    the network domain. Then, the slave domain returns environmental data and responds
    through the network domain back to the haptic device. Finally, the haptic device
    receives the data and simulate a virtual environment of the slave domain for the
    human to touch and feel. The authors of [341] explored four domains of haptic
    communication applications. The first domain is Tele-medicine. Robust and reliable
    networks allow physicians to perform telesurgery and tele-diagnostic using a remote
    slave robot. The second domain is AR and VR. Haptic communications could provide
    extra reality with the sense of touch. The third domain is serious gaming. This
    requires real-world simulations to solve a certain problem. Haptic communications
    could induce real-world experiences for problem solving within serious gaming.
    Finally, unmanned autonomous and remotely controlled systems provide safety for
    operations in dangerous and difficult-to-reach environments. These operations
    usually involve high precision. Utilizing Haptic communications could perform
    these operations remotely without any delays. SECTION XIII. Research Challenges
    of IoT 2.0 This section summarizes the possible future development of IoT 2.0.
    Some of these development are IoT global connectivity, IoT security architecture,
    ubiquitous IoT devices, energy harvesting-based energy efficiency, IoT reliability,
    and considerations in usability. A. IoT Global Connectivity As current IoT architectures
    evolved with edge computing layers, future IoT architectures focus with IoT global
    connectivity. We believe that the development of 6G networks provides a platform
    for IoT global connectivity. In [343], the 6G networks evolve in the space, time,
    and frequency dimensions. In the space dimension, more transceivers will be deployed
    to increase multipath communication [343]. In the time dimension, there will be
    more fine-grained time slot units to satisfy latency-sensitive applications [343].
    Finally, in the frequency dimension, 6G will operate in a higher frequency spectrum
    to fulfill higher data rate requirements [343]. Also, the increase of frequency
    range is a basis of integrating the satellite system into mobile networks to create
    a space-air-ground integrated architecture [343]. As completion of a network providing
    full coverage, the authors of [344] extended the space-air-ground architecture
    with the vision of underwater networks and specified four tiers within the space-air-ground-underwater
    networks (Table 18). On the commercial side, ground to satellite communications
    widening the system coverage have already emerged. IoT devices can communicate
    with Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites through VHF and UHF transmissions [345].
    However, there are latencies up to three hours due to coverage gaps between LEO
    movements [345], [346]. Compared to LEO satellites, IoT data transmissions to
    Geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) satellites have a lower latency around two minutes
    [346]. These satellite systems initiate the exploration of the future space tier
    IoT network. Previous network coverage, network types, wireless spectrums, communication
    mediums, interactive functions, core services, and layers will be integrated to
    support the 6G architecture [347]. The 6G networks will be providing services
    to new mobile terminals such as smart cars and robots with disruptive communication
    technologies and distributed, intelligent base stations [348]. TABLE 18 Space-Air-Ground-Underwater
    Networks Tiers [344] Table 19 outlines the network performance requirements as
    a foundation of the 6G vision and future applications. Despite the performance
    requirements, there are also various service requirements. These services requirements
    are high security, secrecy and privacy, high affordability and customization,
    and finally, high intelligence [349]. TABLE 19 6G Network Performance Requirements
    [344] To fulfill the 6G requirements, the relevant technologies will evolve with
    three different directions: communication technology, network architecture, and
    network intelligence integration [350]. The authors of [348] promoted two candidates
    for 6G communication technology improvement. The first is photonic-defined radio.
    As a vision, 6G could leverage photonic technology to create a multipurpose network,
    converging different previous network types with full-spectral support [348].
    The second candidate is laser mm wave. This technology supports 100 Gb/s communication
    for communication between space and terrestrial networks [348]. The authors of
    [343] also provided two higher spectrum technologies as an extension to the current
    5G paradigm. These technologies are terahertz communications and visible light
    communications. To support communication in higher frequency spectrum, full-duplex
    communication stack enabling simultaneous signal transmission and reception, and
    novel channel estimation technologies to improve bandwidth efficiency are required
    to handle the high usage demands of 6G networks [350]. With the novel communication
    technologies and limitations of 5G networks, new network architectures need to
    be established to support 6G communications and applications. In [348], there
    are four 6G network architectures, including the hyperspectral space-terrestrial
    integration network discussed above as part of the 6G vision. Subsequently, an
    all-photonic radio access network leveraging photonic engines with all-photonic
    arrayed antenna units to break through the bandwidth and latency limitations of
    5G networks [348]. The third architecture, holographic radio, and photodiode-coupled
    antenna arrays exploiting interference to improve the spectrum efficiency and
    enhance the service quality [348]. Finally, the cognitive radio based on AI and
    photonics aims to further strengthen the current network performance with all-photonic
    arrayed antenna units, and AI is optimizing the network layers and services [348].
    The evolution of AI in 6G will be discussed next. As discussed in section IV above,
    AI and machine learning can be embedded in most layers of the communication network.
    In [351], applying AI in 6G networks is inevitable as the vast and complex network
    topology cannot simply be managed by humans. Also, AI simplifies the network model
    and portraits the unknown non-linearity [351]. Moreover, in [348], AI and machine
    learning can be combined with photonics-based cognitive radio to form a novel
    6G network architecture. In this architecture, AI is used for network deployment
    tasks such as precise capacity forecasts, coverage auto-optimization, network
    resource scheduling, and network slicing [348]. To optimize the AI models for
    these tasks, cross-layer models providing intralayer and interlayer functions
    are more suitable than the current layered designs [344]. B. Machine Learning
    Models This article reviewed machine learning implementations from the physical
    layer to the cloud layer. On the physical layer, the development of end-to-end
    machine learning models could reduce operation complexity. Thus, improving the
    physical layer efficiency [344]. The network layer applications provide services
    such as routing, traffic analytics and control, network management, network security,
    and network configuration. These services lead to the achievement of SONs. However,
    the generalization of these machine learning models is questionable, as most of
    these models are constructed using data generated from only one or a few networks.
    The generalization of network layer machine learning models on IoT networks could
    be a future direction. Furthermore, each implementation of machine learning in
    IoT presented in Section IV is only providing services within a single layer of
    the IoT network architecture. From [344], compared to current layered designs,
    cross-layer models are necessary to provide optimal performance. Therefore, cross-layer
    models should be investigated for future IoT networks. C. IoT Security Architecture
    Due to diverse IoT applications supporting heterogeneous IoT devices, there are
    numerous security challenges that require further investigation. Some of these
    significant issues are discussed here. 1) Vulnerability of Machine Learning and
    AI Technologies Since machine learning and AI are dominant technologies in future
    networks [350], it is essential to provide extra security on the data. Therefore,
    federated learning should be promoted to preserve the privacy of multiple edge
    and end devices [351], [352]. On the other hand, if cross-layer machine learning
    models are the mainstream of future IoT networks, future IoT security architectures
    could also evolve towards cross-layer security and benefit from cross-layer machine
    learning models to ensure safer network services. However, machine learning and
    deep learning based IoT systems are susceptible to “Butterfly Effect.” Where a
    minute change in the data being input to the learning system adversely affects
    the output (learned model). Hence, attackers can maliciously change the input
    data to make the system unstable [353]. Such attacks are difficult to protect
    against since the attackers do not need access to the system itself. Correspondingly,
    there is a need to devise a mechanism to ensure data integrity for different machine
    learning-based IoT applications. 2) POST-Quantum IoT Security As we are near the
    beginning of the era of quantum computing, research into the application of post-quantum
    cryptography on IoT is necessary. In this regard, classical cryptography could
    be vulnerable to quantum computers [354]. Moreover, quantum computing threatens
    the asymmetric encryption algorithms, including RSA, ECDSA, elliptic Curve DH
    (ECDH), and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). Most of which can be solved swiftly
    with Shor’s algorithm [355], [356] on a powerful quantum computer. Similarly,
    quantum computers can also speed up the brute force attacks on symmetric encryption
    ciphers by a quadratic factor using Grover’s algorithm [357]. However, irrespective
    of the recent research efforts in post-quantum cryptography by PQCrypto and SAFECrypto
    projects, very little focus has been on addressing the challenges in implementing
    the post-quantum schemes on resource-constrained (especially low power) IoT devices
    [356]. 3) Real-Time Updates The estimated increase in the use of IoT devices to
    a Billion devices in the near future, affirms the need for a secure software/firmware
    update mechanism. However, it seems challenging since not all the devices support
    OTA (Over The Air) updates. Consequently, IoT devices are to be manually updated,
    which is not feasible for real-time IoT applications [358]. Therefore, there is
    a requirement of developing an intelligent and secure protocol to enable IoT devices
    to periodically poll for software/firmware updates so that they are protected
    against the latest threats/attacks. D. Ubiquitous IoT Devices Ubiquitous IoT refers
    to the coverage of different IoT services in different scale of management [359].
    This includes local IoT maintained by regional management platforms, industrial
    IoT managed by particular industries, national IoT controlled by national level
    management unit, and global application IoT coordinated by a global coordinator.
    With this massive number of devices interacting with each others on these different
    scales, energy consumption and management could be issues [359]. To address the
    issues of energy consumption and management, in a future vision, ubiquitous IoT
    devices should conduct autonomous operations with no human intervention or maintenance
    and able to adapt to different scales of operations [360]. To achieve such autonomy,
    AI and machine learning models could be a vehicle automating many management and
    communication operations [361]. This automation can also be achieved from the
    SON methods mentioned in Section IV. On the other hand, energy harvesting methods
    are also an important solution reducing energy consumption and management costs.
    Other than these two important aspects of IoT, the authors of [360] concluded
    some major directions of ubiquitous IoT devices. One direction is multiservice
    IoT, which extends the idea of single service on single nodes towards multiple
    services on single nodes. This aims to increase the value of single IoT nodes.
    Another important direction is the ability of devices to deal with extreme conditions.
    This includes the prediction of energy consumption (and harvesting). Also, low
    energy communication methods technologies will support the development of battery-less
    devices with the aid of energy harvesting methods [360]. Finally, as energy harvesting
    methods are also an important aspect of ubiquitous IoT, the limitations and future
    development of energy harvesting techniques are presented in the next subsection.
    E. Energy Harvesting-Based Energy Efficiency Sensors and IoT devices have now
    become an integral part of the tool-set used to ensure effective monitoring and
    to maintain safety in societies. However, the dependency of these portable devices
    on batteries limits their operation time and range. Energy harvesting is a promising
    solution to provide a sustainable and cost-effective alternative energy source
    to extend the lifetime of IoT devices and reduce energy costs [362], [363]. As
    the number of IoT devices grows, deploying environmentally sustainable IoT devices
    integrated with EHs will lead to the long-term conservation of the environment
    and the global economy. Further, EH techniques can introduce more robust and trusted
    autonomous monitoring systems in the future [364]. The main challenge of implementing
    EHs in IoT networks is the low produced output power (for example, RF and piezo),
    which can be improved through well-designed structures and also applying hybrid
    techniques. Further, ambient sources may always not be available, hence, using
    Sun-synchronous satellites is a key solution to develop the next generation of
    sustainable IoT. Moreover, WPT concept is extended to the simultaneous wireless
    information and power transfer (SWIPT), which allows data and RF power to be transmitted
    via the same electromagnetic (EM) wave. However, the low efficiency of a SWIPT
    system is the main drawback in SWIPT system and can be improved by using novel
    solutions, such as 3D printed antenna array and beam steering based on the LWA.
    In the former, the radiation pattern of the antenna array is optimized on behalf
    of the efficiency and in the later, the beam direction of the antenna is managed
    according to the sensor location. In addition, many recent dispersion-engineered
    analog signal processing (ASP) systems have been introduced based on CRLH Transmission
    Line (CRLH TL) metamaterial-inspired structures [365]. Dispersion engineering
    involves manipulating the electromagnetic wave pathway to handle signals in an
    analog manner, contributing to applications such as real-time Fourier transformers,
    pulse shapers, and etc. Furthermore, several new dispersion-engineered CRLH TL
    metamaterial analog signal processing systems, exploiting the wideband dispersive
    features and design flexibility of CRLH TLs, have been presented [366]. This approach
    is particularly useful in applications where low-cost and low profile systems
    are needed or digital solutions are not available, as for instance in very high
    frequency and high speed ultra-wideband microwave systems, such as 6G technology
    [367]. These new methods will support large-scale WSNs and IoT devices in next
    generation smart grid field applications (for example, smart cities, and precision
    agriculture). F. IoT Reliability The reliability in mission critical applications
    are discussed in Section V of this article. The integration of SDN and NFV in
    mission critical communication networks are also discussed. Other than these aspects,
    IoT communication reliability can also be enhanced through advance error coding
    schemes, and network coding [368]. Advance error coding schemes such as polar
    codes can ensure communication reliability due to its ability of error correction
    [369]. This error correction functionality can operate with low computational
    complexity and decoding latency. Network coding gives intermediate nodes within
    a network processing ability to encode coming traffic [370]. With such ability,
    there are less packet re-transmissions and thus improving the reliability of IoT
    networks. Finally, IoT fault tolerance methods leveraging the concept of graceful
    degradation could also be enhanced for IoT reliability [368]. Achieving the desired
    requirements of mission critical communication in a dynamic environment is very
    challenging. In this regard, the knowledge available at the device level can also
    be utilized to reduce the computation burden at the base station, resulting in
    overall latency reduction [170]. The intelligence at the edge devices can enable
    them to adapt to the network dynamics without relying much upon the base station.
    Promising theoretical enablers for intelligence at the edge devices are presented
    in [371], which can be used to design mission critical communication systems.
    G. Tradeoff in Usability As future IoT networks promote full coverage and integration
    [348], [372], IoT scalability and interoperability between different devices and
    protocols should also be promoted to connect IoT as part of the network ecosystem.
    Using 6G networks as a platform, IoT system performance can be enhanced by 6G
    infrastructures, such as the coverage enhancement from satellites to provide better
    accessibility [372]. With the aid of machine learning and AI, managing these network
    connections and autonomous devices should not require much user attention and
    labor [351]. Therefore, this increases the usability of the system. On the other
    hand, the authors of [349] pointed out that the usage of AI reduces the magnitude
    of system customization. Thus, AI could decrease the usability for users with
    special requirements and preferences. In conclusion, the degree of system intelligence
    should be carefully designed in the future to satisfy general users and users
    with other system preferences. SECTION XIV. Conclusion The definition of IoT remains
    unchanged since the birth of the concept. As we are on the brink of the 5G era,
    the concept of IoT should follow this evolution towards IoT 2.0. This article
    summarizes the recent advancement of IoT technologies and defines it as IoT 2.0.
    First, a general architecture of IoT 2.0 is compared with previous architectures.
    From these architectures, edge computing is the driving force of architectural
    evolution. Current IoT technology is then discussed in seven dimensions as machine
    learning intelligence, mission critical communication, IoT scalability, IoT security,
    IoT sustainability, IoT interoperability, and user friendly IoT. The usage of
    machine learning algorithms is revealed in different layers of IoT applications.
    Then, mission critical communication systems are introduced, focusing on physical
    layer considerations and programmable mission critical communication networks.
    After that, hardware, network and service scalability is explored and lead to
    the discussion of SDN induced scalability. Security is an important aspect of
    IoT systems. In this article, security at different layers is analyzed. Followed
    by security, sustainability of IoT systems is also an essential component. Therefore,
    energy harvesting technologies providing longer lifetimes are evaluated. After
    that, due to the increase of device types and standards, interoperability and
    usability of IoT components are covered. The discussion of recent advancements
    ends with the outline of existing IoT applications. This whole discussion leads
    to the future directions of IoT, portrayed by the vision of future 6G networks.

    \a\nAbstract:\nA smart campus is an intelligent infrastructure where smart sensors\
    \ and actuators\ncollaborate to collect information and interact with the machines,\
    \ tools, and users of a university\ncampus. As in a smart city, a smart campus\
    \ represents a challenging scenario for Internet of Things\n(IoT) networks, especially\
    \ in terms of cost, coverage, availability, latency, power consumption, and\n\
    scalability. The technologies employed so far to cope with such a scenario are\
    \ not yet able to\nmanage simultaneously all the previously mentioned demanding\
    \ requirements. Nevertheless, recent\nparadigms such as fog computing, which extends\
    \ cloud computing to the edge of a network, make\npossible low-latency and location-aware\
    \ IoT applications. Moreover, technologies such as Low-Power\nWide-Area Networks\
    \ (LPWANs) have emerged as a promising solution to provide low-cost and\nlow-power\
    \ consumption connectivity to nodes spread throughout a wide area. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the\nLong-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) standard is one of the most recent\
    \ developments,\nreceiving attention both from industry and academia. In this\
    \ article, the use of a LoRaWAN fog\ncomputing-based architecture is proposed\
    \ for providing connectivity to IoT nodes deployed in\na campus of the University\
    \ of A Coruña (UDC), Spain. To validate the proposed system, the\nsmart campus\
    \ has been recreated realistically through an in-house developed 3D Ray-Launching\n\
    radio-planning simulator that is able to take into consideration even small details,\
    \ such as trafﬁc lights,\nvehicles, people, buildings, urban furniture, or vegetation.\
    \ The developed tool can provide accurate\nradio propagation estimations within\
    \ the smart campus scenario in terms of coverage, capacity, and\nenergy efﬁciency\
    \ of the network. The results obtained with the planning simulator can then be\n\
    compared with empirical measurements to assess the operating conditions and the\
    \ system accuracy.\nSpeciﬁcally, this article presents experiments that show the\
    \ accurate results obtained by the planning\nsimulator in the largest scenario\
    \ ever built for it (a campus that covers an area of 26,000 m2), which are\ncorroborated\
    \ with empirical measurements. Then, how the tool can be used to design the deployment\n\
    of LoRaWAN infrastructure for three smart campus outdoor applications is explained:\
    \ a mobility\npattern detection system, a smart irrigation solution, and a smart\
    \ trafﬁc-monitoring deployment.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287; doi:10.3390/s19153287\n\

    \ presented results provide guidelines to smart campus designers and developers,\n\
    and for easing LoRaWAN network deployment and research in other smart campuses\
    \ and large\nenvironments such as smart cities.\nKeywords: IoT; smart campus;\

    \ is an infrastructure similar to a smart city that makes use of Internet of Things\n\
    (IoT) solutions [1–6] to connect, monitor, control, optimize, and automate the\
    \ systems of a university.\nToday, a smart campus represents a challenging scenario\
    \ for IoT networks, especially in terms cost,\ncoverage, availability, latency,\
    \ security, power consumption, and scalability.\nThe area covered by a campus\
    \ varies substantially depending on the university, its location,\nthe ﬁnancial\
    \ endowment, and the year of founding. For example, Berry College (Floyd County,\n\
    Georgia, United States), is often considered the largest contiguous rural campus\
    \ in the world: it covers\n27,000 acres (109.26 km2) [7] of land. Other examples\
    \ are the suburban/urban campuses of Duke\nUniversity (Durham, NC, USA), which\
    \ are deployed on 9350 acres (37.83 km2) [8], and the campus\nof Stanford University\
    \ (Stanford, CA, USA), which covers 8180 acres (33 km2) [9]. Regardless of\ntheir\
    \ initial surface area, it is common that campuses grow considerably as time goes\
    \ by [10], hence\ninstitutions usually devise long-term sustainability plans to\
    \ envision their growth in the future [11–13].\nWhen a campus provides smart IoT\
    \ services, it is necessary to provide communications\nconnectivity to IoT nodes\
    \ and gateways. Such a connectivity can be provided in a quite straightforward\n\
    way indoors thanks to the use of popular technologies such as Wi-Fi, but, outdoors,\
    \ technology selection\nbecomes more complex, since it is not only necessary to\
    \ provide good coverage and a cost-effective\ndeployment, but also to decrease\
    \ the communications energy consumption to maximize IoT node\nbattery life.\n\
    To tackle such an issue in wide areas, a set of technologies grouped under the\
    \ term Low-Power\nWide Area Network (LPWAN) seem to be a good selection, since,\
    \ in comparison to other previous\ntechnologies, they provide a wider area communications\
    \ range and reduced energy consumption.\nIn fact, LPWAN technologies have emerged\
    \ as an enabling technology for IoT and Machine-to-Machine\n(M2M) communications\
    \ [14] mainly due to their capabilities related to range, cost, power consumption,\n\
    and capacity. Examples of such technologies are NB-IoT [15], SigFox [16], Ingenu\
    \ [17], Weightless [18]\nor LoRaWAN [19] (a detailed comparison of these and other\
    \ LPWAN technologies is given later\nin Section 2.2).\nIn the case of LoRaWAN,\
    \ it is gaining momentum from both industry and academia [20–22].\nLoRaWAN deﬁnes\
    \ a communications protocol and a system architecture for the network. In addition,\n\
    it uses LoRa for its physical layer [23], which is able to create long-range communications\
    \ links\nand makes use of a Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation that conserves\
    \ the power features\nof Frequency Shifting Keying (FSK) while increasing its\
    \ communications range. All these features\nmake LoRaWAN a good candidate for\
    \ providing wireless communications to outdoor IoT nodes in a\nsmart campus.\n\
    Traditionally, gateways connect the IoT nodes with the cloud and among them. The\
    \ cloud\nis basically one or more servers with large computational power, communication,\
    \ and storing\ncapabilities that receives, processes, and analyzes the data collected\
    \ from the IoT nodes by performing\ncomputational-intensive tasks. Although cloud-based\
    \ solutions are appropriate at a small scale, when\nthe number of IoT nodes grows\
    \ signiﬁcantly and, consequently, the network trafﬁc they generate,\ncongestion\
    \ may lead to increasing latency responses and slower data processing. Among the\
    \ different\nalternatives to confront this challenge and to guarantee a ﬂexible,\
    \ scalable, robust, secure, and\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287\n3 of 30\nenergy-efﬁcient\
    \ deployment of IoT networks, the design and implementation of a fog computing\n\
    architecture was chosen. Fog computing supports physically distributed, low-latency\
    \ (e.g., real-time\nor quasi real-time responses) and location-aware applications\
    \ that decrease the network trafﬁc and\nthe computational load of traditional\
    \ cloud computing systems by processing in the IoT nodes most\nof the data generated\
    \ by their sensors and actuators and unburdening the higher layers from data\n\
    processing [24].\nFurthermore, when designing a smart campus, it is necessary\
    \ to plan how LoRaWAN gateways\nand nodes are deployed to guarantee good IoT node\
    \ coverage while minimizing the number of\ngateways (i.e., minimizing the smart\
    \ campus communications infrastructure cost). The problem is that\nthere are only\
    \ a few examples of academic and commercial tools that create such a planning\
    \ [25,26], so\ndevelopers have to adapt tools previously optimized for other technologies\
    \ (e.g., Wi-Fi [27]) or have to\ncarry out tedious empirical measurements throughout\
    \ the campus [28,29].\nThis article confronts the mentioned challenges by designing\
    \ and implementing a cost-efﬁcient,\nscalable, and low-power consumption LoRaWAN\
    \ fog computing-based architecture for wide areas.\nSpeciﬁcally, the system was\
    \ designed with the aim of developing novel latency-sensitive IoT outdoor\napplications\
    \ that create more sustainable and intelligent campuses. The following are the\
    \ main\ncontributions of the article, which as of writing, have not been found\
    \ together in the literature:\n•\nTo establish the basics, it presents the main\
    \ characteristics of the so-called smart campuses\ntogether with a detailed review\
    \ of the state of the art of the main and the latest communications\narchitectures\
    \ and technologies, previous academic deployments, novel potential LPWAN\napplications\
    \ and relevant tools for radio propagation modeling and planning.\n•\nIt thoroughly\
    \ details the design, implementation, and practical evaluation of a scalable\n\
    LPWAN-based communications architecture for supporting the smart campus IoT applications.\n\
    •\nThe article presents the 3D modeling of a real 26,000 m2 campus whose LoRaWAN\
    \ wireless\npropagation characteristics are evaluated with an in-house developed\
    \ 3D Ray-launching\nradio-planning simulator. The results obtained by such a simulator\
    \ are validated by comparing\nthem with empirical LoRaWAN measurements obtained\
    \ throughout the campus.\n•\nIt details how the radio-planning tool can be used\
    \ to design the deployment of LoRaWAN\ninfrastructure for three smart campus applications:\
    \ a mobility pattern detection system, a smart\nirrigation solution, and a smart\
    \ trafﬁc-monitoring deployment.\nThus, it demonstrates the\nusefulness of the\
    \ proposed tools and methodology, which are able to provide fast guidelines to\n\
    smart campus designers and developers, and that can also be used for easing LoRaWAN\
    \ network\ndeployment and research in other large environments such as smart cities.\n\
    The rest of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the state\
    \ of the art on smart\ncampuses: their characteristics, technologies, architectures,\
    \ previous relevant deployments, potential\napplications, and the previous work\
    \ on modeling and planning a smart campus. Section 3 details the\narchitecture\
    \ of the proposed system and the characteristics of the LoRaWAN testbed implementation.\n\
    Section 4 describes the proposed planning simulator and the analyzed scenario.\
    \ Section 5 is dedicated\nto the experiments. Finally, Section 6 presents the\
    \ main discussion on the lessons learned from these\nexperiences, while Section\
    \ 7 is devoted to the conclusions.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Characteristics of a\
    \ Smart Campus\nIt is ﬁrst important to note that in the literature, some authors\
    \ use the term smart campus to refer\nto digital online platforms to manage learning\
    \ content [30,31] or to strategies or solutions to increase\nthe smartness of\
    \ the students [32–34]. In this article, the term smart campus is used for referring\
    \ to the\nhardware infrastructure and software that provides smart services and\
    \ applications to the campus\nusers (i.e., to students and to the university staff).\
    \ In this regard, a smart campus, such as a smart city,\ncan be modeled along\
    \ six different smart ﬁelds [35]:\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287\n4 of 30\n•\nSmart governance.\
    \ It provides users with mechanisms to participate in decision-making or in\n\
    public services.\n•\nSmart people. It deals with social issues, including the\
    \ engagement in campus events and\nlearning activities.\n•\nSmart mobility. This\
    \ ﬁeld is related to the accessibility of the campus, including the use of efﬁcient,\n\
    clean, safe, and intelligent transport means.\n•\nSmart environment. It contemplates\
    \ the monitoring and protection of the environment, as well as\nthe sustainable\
    \ management of the available resources.\n•\nSmart living. The technologies used\
    \ in these ﬁelds can monitor diverse living aspects in the\ncampus facilities,\
    \ such as personal safety [36], health [37] or crowd sensing [38].\n•\nSmart economy.\
    \ It is related to the competitiveness of the campus in terms of entrepreneurship,\n\
    innovation, or productivity.\nThese smart campus ﬁelds can be further reﬁned to\
    \ determine speciﬁc smart services and solutions\nthat should be ideally provided\
    \ by a smart campus [39]:\n•\nSmart living services:\nroom occupation, classroom/lab\
    \ equipment access control, health\nmonitoring and alert services, classroom attendance\
    \ systems, teaching interaction services, or\ncontext-aware applications (e.g.,\
    \ guidance or navigation solutions).\n•\nSmart environment solutions: they include\
    \ solutions for monitoring waste, water consumption,\nair quality (e.g., pollution)\
    \ or the status of the campus green areas.\n•\nSmart energy systems: they control\
    \ and monitor the production, distribution, and consumption\nof energy in a campus.\n\
    These novel smart services and solutions make use of a growing number of enabling\
    \ technologies,\nbeing the most relevant represented in Figure 1.\n \nSmart\n\

    Sensors 2019, 19, 3287\n5 of 30\n2.2. Smart Campus Communications Architectures\
    \ and Technologies\nIn the literature, different approaches to smart campus architectures\
    \ can be found, but it seems\nthat two main paradigms drive clearly the most popular\
    \ designs: IoT and cloud computing [40].\nFor instance, a cloud-based smart campus\
    \ architecture is presented in [41]. In such a work the authors\nstate that they\
    \ were able to build their smart campus platform within three months thanks to\
    \ the use of\nCommercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and Microsoft Azure cloud\
    \ services. Regarding IoT, it has\nbeen suggested as a tool to be considered in\
    \ the architecture of a smart campus to ease the development\nof learning applications,\
    \ access control systems, smart grids or water management systems [42,43].\nNonetheless,\
    \ cloud computing and IoT solutions are often helped by Big Data techniques and\
    \ Service\nOriented Architecture (SOA) architectures, since they ease the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected\ndata [44,45].\nSome authors have suggested alternative\
    \ paradigms for developing smart campuses. For example,\nin [46] a sort of opportunistic\
    \ communications architecture called Floating Content is proposed that\nshares\
    \ data through infrastructure-less services. The idea is essentially based on\
    \ the ability of each\nFloating Content node to produce information that is shared\
    \ with the interested users within a limited\nphysical area. Other researchers\
    \ propose similar architectures, but including enhancements in aspects\nsuch as\
    \ security [47].\nOther proposals revolve around the application of the Edge Computing\
    \ paradigm and its\nsub-types (e.g., Mobile Edge Computing, Fog Computing), which\
    \ have been previously applied\nto other ﬁelds [48,49]. Essentially, Edge Computing\
    \ ofﬂoads the cloud from a relevant amount of\nprocessing and communications transactions,\
    \ delegating such tasks to devices that are closer to the IoT\nnodes. In this\
    \ way, such edge devices not only ofﬂoad the cloud, but are also able to reduce\
    \ latency\nresponse and provide location-aware services [50]. For example, in\
    \ [51] the authors propose to enhance\na smart campus architecture by including\
    \ Edge Computing devices to provide trustworthy content\ncaching and bandwidth\
    \ allocation services to mobile users. Similarly, the authors of [52] harness\n\
    street lighting to embed Edge Computing node hardware to provide different smart\
    \ campus services.\nThe Mobile Edge Computing paradigm is used in [53], where\
    \ the authors present a smart campus\nplatform called WiCloud whose servers are\
    \ accessed through mobile phone base stations or wireless\naccess points. Furthermore,\
    \ other authors propose the use of fog computing nodes to improve user\nexperience\
    \ [54].\nDifferent wireless technologies have been used to interconnect IoT nodes\
    \ with smart campus\nplatforms. For instance, BLE and ZigBee were used in [41]\
    \ to provide both short and medium range\ncommunications, although ZigBee nodes\
    \ can be used as relays to cover very long distances. For this\nlatter reason,\
    \ in [55] the authors make use of a ZigBee mesh network to interconnect the nodes\
    \ of their\ncampus smart grid.\nWi-Fi has also been suggested for providing connectivity\
    \ [56], although the proposed applications\nare usually restricted to indoor locations\
    \ and nearby places. Bluetooth beacons give more freedom to\ncertain outdoor applications\
    \ [57], but they require deploying dense networks that may be difﬁcult to\nmanage\
    \ [58].\nMobile phone communications technologies (2G/3G/4G) have also been used\
    \ in the literature [59],\nbut in most cases just for the convenience of being\
    \ already embedded into smartphones. 5G is currently\nstill being tested, but\
    \ some researchers have already proposed its use for providing fast communications\n\
    and low-latency responses to smart campus platforms [60].\nAlthough 5G technologies\
    \ seem to have a bright future, as of writing, LPWANs are arguably\none of the\
    \ best alternatives for providing long-range and low-power communications. There\
    \ are\ndifferent LPWAN technologies such as SigFox [16], Random Phase Multiple\
    \ Access (RPMA) [17],\nWeightless [18], NB-IoT [15], Telensa [61] or NB-Fi [62].\
    \ Among such technologies, NB-IoT, SigFox and\nLoRa/LoRaWAN are currently the\
    \ most popular (their main characteristics are shown in Table 1).\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 3287\n6 of 30\nTable 1. Comparison of the three most popular LPWAN technologies.\n\

    \ of LoRa/LoRaWAN technology for certain\nscenarios, but only a few describe real-world\
    \ LoRaWAN deployments explicitly aimed at providing\ncommunications to a smart\
    \ campus. For instance, Loriot et al. [63] conducted LoRaWAN measurements\nin\
    \ a French campus both outdoors and indoors and showed that the technology can\
    \ provide good\nperformance over the major part of the campus. Another development\
    \ is presented in [64], where\nthe authors set up a LoRaWAN-based air quality\
    \ system in their campus. Other interesting paper\nis [65], which details the\
    \ design of a LoRa mesh network system within a campus. Finally, in [66]\nthe\
    \ authors brieﬂy describe a smart campus platform that includes a LoRaWAN network\
    \ to support\nfaculty research projects.\n2.3. Smart Campus Deployments\nDespite\
    \ the existence of many well-documented smart campus applications, there are only\
    \ a few\nacademic articles that describe in detail the deployment of real smart\
    \ campuses.\nFor instance, in [67] an overview of the neOCampus of the Toulouse\
    \ III Paul Sabatier University\n(France) is given. Such a smart campus runs different\
    \ projects to make use of collaborative Wi-Fi, it\nprovides an open-data platform,\
    \ it fosters the reduction of the ecological footprint related to human\nactivities\
    \ and it aims for protecting the biodiversity of the campus.\nAnother interesting\
    \ smart campus is detailed in [56], where an IoT platform deployed across\ndifferent\
    \ engineering schools of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in its Moncloa\
    \ Campus (Spain)\nis described. Such an IoT platform is based on a cloud that\
    \ provides services that follow the SOA\nparadigm. Two main applications are implemented:\
    \ one for monitoring people ﬂows and another for\nenvironmental monitoring.\n\
    The Sapienza smart campus (Italy) roadmap is described in [68]. Such a paper is\
    \ interesting since,\nalthough it is a theoretical approach, it indicates how\
    \ to structure the services to be provided by the\nsmart campus infrastructure\
    \ to scale it appropriately.\nIn [45] the author gives details on the Birmingham\
    \ City University smart campus (United\nKingdom). The smart campus platform integrates\
    \ diverse business systems and smart building\nprotocols thanks to an Enterprise\
    \ Service Bus (ESB) and to the use of a SOA architecture, which\nprovides scalability,\
    \ ﬂexibility, and service orchestration.\nIn the United States, an example of\
    \ smart campus can be found in West Texas A&M University [66].\nAccording to the\
    \ authors, the smart campus is based on the IoT principles and covers an area\
    \ of\n176 acres, requiring connecting more than 42 different buildings. The described\
    \ project is focused\non two main tasks: to foster IoT collaboration and to provide\
    \ an appropriate security framework.\nThe proposed system has already supported\
    \ diverse IoT projects, such as a LoRaWAN pilot for\nmonitoring environmental\
    \ conditions or an OpenCV-based smart parking system.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287\n\
    7 of 30\nFinally, a smart campus for Wuhan University of Technology (China) is\
    \ proposed in [69]. In such\na paper the authors depict an architecture based\
    \ on the IoT paradigm and in cloud-computing\ninfrastructure that supports multiple\
    \ applications.\n2.4. Potential Smart Campus LPWAN Applications\nAlthough a smart\
    \ campus can support multiple indoor applications [70], in general, in such\n\
    environments IoT nodes have access to power outlets and their communications can\
    \ be usually\neasily handled with already common communications transceivers (e.g.,\
    \ Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet).\nIn contrast, this article focuses on the challenging\
    \ environments that arise outdoors due the usual\ndependency on batteries to run\
    \ IoT nodes and the need for exchanging data at relatively long distances\n(at\
    \ least several hundred meters and up to 2 km), where LPWAN devices outperform\
    \ other popular\ncommunications technologies.\nThe following are some of the most\
    \ relevant outdoor applications that have already been\nimplemented by using LPWAN\
    \ technologies:\n•\nSmart mobility and intelligent transport services. These applications\
    \ require ubiquitous outdoor\ncoverage to provide continuous data streams. For\
    \ instance, in [71] researchers of Soochow\nUniversity (China) propose the deployment\
    \ of different smart mobility applications for their\ncampuses, which include\
    \ automatic vehicle access systems, a parking guidance service, a bus\ntracking\
    \ system, or a bicycle rental service. Other authors also proposed similar solutions\n\
    for providing campus services for smart parking [72], electric mobility [73,74],\
    \ smart electric\ncharging [75], the use of autonomous vehicles [76] or bus tracking\
    \ [77].\n•\nSmart energy and smart grid monitoring. Certain energy sources (e.g.,\
    \ renewable sources such\nas photo-voltaic panels or windmills) and smart grid\
    \ components may be in remote locations,\nso it would be helpful to make use of\
    \ LPWAN technologies to monitor them. For this reason, in\nrecent years, special\
    \ attention has been given to smart campus microgrids [78], smart grids [79]\n\
    and smart energy systems [80].\n•\nResource consumption efﬁciency monitoring.\n\
    These ﬁelds include waste collection [81],\nwater management [82], energy monitoring\
    \ [83], power consumption optimization [84] and\nsustainability [5].\n•\nCampus\
    \ user proﬁling. It is interesting for the campus managers to determine user patterns\
    \ and\nbehaviors to optimize the provided services. Thus, user proﬁling can be\
    \ helpful to obtain mobility\npatterns, student daily walks, user activities,\
    \ or social interactions, which can be obtained through\nopportunistic messaging\
    \ apps [85], Wi-Fi monitoring [86] or on-board mobile phone sensors [87].\n•\n\
    Outdoor guidance and context-aware applications. This kind of systems are usually\
    \ based on\nsensors and actuators spread throughout the campus and help people\
    \ to reach their destination.\nThere are examples in the literature of systems\
    \ for guiding hearing and visually impaired\npeople [88] or for navigating through\
    \ the campus paths [89]. There are also augmented reality\nguidance applications\
    \ [90], but it is important to note that LPWAN technologies could only help\n\
    in small packet exchanges (e.g., for transmitting certain telemetry or positioning\
    \ data), since the\nreal-time multimedia content that can be demanded by augmented\
    \ reality applications requires\nhigh-speed rates to preserve a good user experience.\n\
    •\nClassroom attendance. Some university events are carried out outdoors, what\
    \ makes it difﬁcult to\ncontrol classroom attendance. To tackle such an issue,\
    \ some researchers have proposed different\nsensor-based student monitoring systems\
    \ that can be repurposed to be used outdoors [91].\n•\nInfrastructure monitoring.\
    \ It is possible to monitor remotely the status of certain assets that are\nscattered\
    \ throughout the campus. For example, some authors presented smart campus solutions\n\
    for managing campus greenhouses [92] or for monitoring high power lines with Unmanned\n\
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) [93].\n•\nRemote health monitoring. Smart campus technologies\
    \ receive medical data in real time [94] or\nfor measuring student stress [95].\
    \ Some researchers have even proposed to monitor the health of\nthe campus trees\
    \ [96].\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287\n8 of 30\n2.5. Smart Campus Modeling and Planning\
    \ Simulators\nA smart campus is similar to an urban microenvironment where different\
    \ buildings coexist with\nstreets, open areas, parking lots, trees, benches, or\
    \ people, among others. Different propagation channel\nmodels have been presented\
    \ in the literature to characterize electromagnetic propagation phenomena\nin\
    \ this type of scenarios, ranging from empirical methods to deterministic methods\
    \ based on Ray\nTracing (RT) or Ray-Launching (RL) approaches.\nEmpirical methods\
    \ are based on measurements and their subsequent linear regression analysis.\n\
    These methods are accurate for scenarios with the same characteristics as the\
    \ real measurements,\nbut their main disadvantages are the lack of scalability\
    \ and the expensive cost in time and resources\nthat is required to perform a\
    \ measurement campaign. For example, in [97,98] empirical path loss\nmodels in\
    \ a typical university campus are proposed for a frequency of 1800 MHz. The authors\
    \ of [99]\npresent a spatially consistent street-by-street path loss model for\
    \ a 28 GHz channel in a micro-cell\nurban environment. The main drawback of these\
    \ results is that the suitability of these models for path\nloss prediction has\
    \ yet to be conﬁrmed by the literature in other campuses.\nOn the other hand,\
    \ deterministic methods are based on Maxwell’s equations, which provide\naccurate\
    \ propagation predictions. These approaches usually consider the three-dimensional\
    \ geometry\nof the environment and model all propagation phenomena in the considered\
    \ scenario. Their main\ndrawback is the required computational time, which may\
    \ not be afforded in large and complex\nscenarios. For this reason, RT or RL techniques,\
    \ which are based on Geometrical Optics (GO) and\nthe Uniform Theory of Diffraction\
    \ (UTD), have been widely used for radio propagation purposes\nas an accurate\
    \ approximation of full-wave deterministic techniques.\nFor example, the authors\n\
    of [100] modeled the dominant propagation mechanisms using advanced RT simulations\
    \ in an urban\nmicroenvironment at 2.1 GHz, showing that diffuse scattering plays\
    \ a key role in urban propagation.\nIn addition, in [101] the importance of scattering\
    \ when analyzing outdoor environments in the\npresence of trees is reported. In\
    \ [102,103] the authors present propagation analyses (at 949.2 MHz\nand 2162.6\
    \ MHz, respectively) that make use of RT tools in a university campus with a Universal\n\
    Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) base station placed on rooftops. Similarly,\
    \ in [104],\nthe radio-planning analysis of a Wi-Fi network in a university campus\
    \ is presented using an RT\napproach. In addition, it has also been reported in\
    \ the literature the calibration of RT simulators\nfor millimeter-wave propagation\
    \ analyses based on the measured results in a university campus\nat 28 GHz [105]\
    \ and 38 GHz [106]. However, all the presented works are focused on micro-cellular\n\
    environments and on analyzing the wireless propagation channel between a base\
    \ station at a certain\nheight in a building and a client in a pedestrian street.\
    \ In this work, a radio wave propagation analysis\nfor the connectivity of IoT\
    \ LoRaWAN-based nodes by means of an in-house developed RL algorithm\nis reported\
    \ (which is later detailed in Section 4).\n2.6. Key Findings\nAfter analyzing\
    \ the state of art, it is clear that a smart campus faces similar challenges to\
    \ smart\ncities and that they share certain use cases and communications technologies.\
    \ Table 2 summarizes the\ncharacteristics of the most relevant smart campuses\
    \ and related solutions, and compares them with\nthe proposed system for the University\
    \ of A Coruña.\nAs can be observed, the systems in the table make use of diverse\
    \ short-range and long-range\ncommunications technologies, multiple sensors and\
    \ actuators, different hardware and software\nplatforms, and provide services\
    \ for several practical use cases. Although some systems provide\na holistic approach\
    \ to a smart campus, devising potential outdoor use cases and applications, their\n\
    implementations are mainly focused on environmental aspects, missing other smart\
    \ ﬁelds such as the\nones deﬁned in Section 2.1.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287\n9 of\

    \ consider the use of fog computing, and even less made use of\nnetwork planning\
    \ tools. In comparison, the solution proposed in this article is one of the few\
    \ academic\nsolutions that deploys LoRaWAN infrastructure. Moreover, the proposed\
    \ smart campus is almost the\nonly one conceived from scratch to harness the beneﬁts\
    \ of fog computing.\nRegarding the efﬁciency in the network deployment in terms\
    \ of cost, coverage, and the overall\nenergy consumption, most of the academic\
    \ papers do not give any insight regarding the heterogeneous\nnetwork planning,\
    \ although in some cases it is speciﬁed that it is low cost (without further details).\n\
    Just a couple of systems give details for the hardware used to build the demonstrator\
    \ at the level that\nis described later in this paper in Section 3.\n3. Design\
    \ and Implementation of the Smart Campus System\n3.1. Architecture for Outdoor\
    \ Applications\nThe proposed communications architecture is depicted in Figure\
    \ 2. As can be observed, it\ncomprises three different layers. The layer at the\
    \ bottom consists of the different IoT LoRaWAN\nnodes that are deployed throughout\
    \ the campus. Such nodes communicate with LoRaWAN gateways\nthat comprise the\
    \ Fog Layer, since they also act as fog computing gateways, thus providing fast\n\
    location-aware responses to the LoRaWAN node requests. Every fog gateway is essentially\
    \ a Single\nBoard Computer (SBC) that embeds Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth interfaces\
    \ besides a LoRaWAN\ntransceiver. Finally, the top layer is the cloud, where user\

    To cover potential smart campus outdoor applications, a set of operational requirements\
    \ grouped\nby capabilities was deﬁned, including:\n•\nCoverage capabilities. The\
    \ coverage of the smart campus should be maximized. The typically\nexpected coverage\
    \ should be around 1 km2 considering both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and\nNo-Line-of-Sight\
    \ (NLoS) scenarios.\n•\nRobustness capabilities. The system should provide robustness\
    \ to signal interference and/or loss\nof network operation. The network should\
    \ provide redundancy and thus be robust against single\npoints of failure.\n•\n\
    Supported services and applications. The previously mentioned applications (in\
    \ Section 2.4)\nshould be supported. Quality of Service (QoS) requirements should\
    \ include support for high-peak\nrate demand, latency-sensitive trafﬁc, and location-aware\
    \ IoT applications. A transmission speed\nof up to 50 Kbps should be expected.\n\
    •\nDeployment features and cost. It should be expected that the deployment will\
    \ depend largely on\nlow-cost IoT nodes resource-constrained in terms of memory,\
    \ battery, computing capabilities, and\nenergy consumption.\n•\nNetwork topology.\
    \ The network architecture should support Point-To-Multipoint (PMP) and\nPoint-to-Point\
    \ (PtP) links. The system should be capable of establishing ad-hoc networking\
    \ for\nspeciﬁc scenarios (i.e., by using star or mesh topologies).\n3.3. LoRaWAN\
    \ Testbed Implementation\nA LoRaWAN network consisting on a gateway and several\
    \ nodes was deployed. A RisingHF\nRHF0M301 module [108] installed on a Raspberry\
    \ Pi 3 was selected as gateway. Such a module\nis equipped with a dual digital\
    \ radio front-end interface with a typical sensitivity of −137 dBm.\nThe module\
    \ is capable of simultaneous dual-band operation and supports Adaptive Data Rate\
    \ (ADR),\nautomatically changing between LoRa spreading factors. It can use a\
    \ maximum of 10 channels: 8 multi\nSpreading Factor (SF) channels (SF7 to SF12\
    \ with 125 KHz of bandwidth), one FSK channel and\none LoRa channel. Another interesting\
    \ feature of the module is its ability to operate with negative\nSignal-to-Noise\
    \ Ratios (SNRs), with a Co-Channel Rejection (CCR) of up to 9 dB. It also supports\n\
    LoRaWAN classes A, B, and C and its maximum output power is 24.5 dBm.\nA 0 dBi\
    \ antenna was used for the tests. The module is installed on a Raspberry Pi 3\
    \ using the\nprovided bridge (RHF4T002). To access the LoRaWAN RFID module, conﬁgure\
    \ the node, and access\nthe message and the transmission parameters, the following\
    \ software was installed on the Raspberry\nPi 3: Raspbian Stretch (Linux raspberrypi\
    \ 4.14.70-v7+), LoRa Gateway v5.0.1, LoRa Packet Forwarder\nv4.0.1 and LoRaWAN-Server\
    \ v0.6.0.\nThe LoRa gateway was conﬁgured as follows:\n•\nCoding Rate: 4/5.\n\
    •\nRX1 delay: 1.\n•\nRX2 delay: 2.\n•\nPower: 14 dBm.\n•\nRX Frequency: 869.5\
    \ MHz.\nA RisingHF RHF76-052 module [109] was used by the LoRaWAN nodes (one of\
    \ such nodes can\nbe observed on the right of Figure 3). The module has a maximum\
    \ sensitivity of −139 dBm with\nspreading factor 12 (SF12) and 125 kHz of bandwidth,\
    \ channels (0–2) at 868.1, 868.3 and 868.5 MHz,\nand a maximum output power of\
    \ 14 dBm. During the experiments presented in this paper, the module\nmade use\
    \ of the pre-installed wired antenna.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287\n16 of 30\nUSRP\

    \ Planning Simulator Setup\n4.1. Planning Simulator\nThe in-house developed 3D\
    \ Ray-Launching (3D-RL) technique is based on GO and the Uniform\nTheory of Diffraction\
    \ (UTD). The ﬁrst step of such a technique is the creation of the scenario under\n\
    analysis, which should consider all the obstacles within it, such as buildings,\
    \ vehicles, vegetation,\nor people. This design phase is essential for obtaining\
    \ accurate results for the real environment. Once\nthe scenario is properly created,\
    \ the frequency of operation, number of reﬂections, radiation pattern of\nthe\
    \ transceivers and angular and spatial resolution can be ﬁxed as input parameters\
    \ in the algorithm\nfor simulation. Then, the whole scenario is divided into a\
    \ 3D mesh of cuboids, in which all the\nelectromagnetic phenomena are saved during\
    \ simulation, emulating the electromagnetic propagation\nof the real waves. A\
    \ detailed description of the inner-workings of the 3D-RL tool is out of the scope\
    \ of\nthis article, but the interested reader can ﬁnd further information in [110].\n\
    It is worth pointing out that smart campus ecosystems are challenging environments\
    \ in terms\nof radio propagation analysis due to their large dimensions as well\
    \ as for the multipath propagation,\nwhich is caused by the multiple obstacles\
    \ within them. Hence, to achieve a good trade-off between\nsimulation computational\
    \ cost and result accuracy, it is important to determine the optimal parameters\n\
    for the number of reﬂections and the angular and spatial resolution of the RL\
    \ algorithm. For such\na purpose, an analysis of the optimal input parameters\
    \ for the RL tool applied in large complex\nenvironments is presented in [111].\
    \ Such previous results have been considered to obtain the simulation\nparameters\
    \ for the proposed smart campus scenario and the ﬁnal values are summarized in\
    \ Table 3.\nTable 3. 3D Ray-Launching parameters.\nParameter\nValue\nOperation\

    \ a case study conducted in the northwest of Spain at the Campus of Elviña of\n\
    the University of A Coruña. The campus covers an area of 26,000 m2 and includes\
    \ elements typically\nfound in an urban environment, such as buildings of different\
    \ heights, sidewalks, roads, green areas,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287\n17 of 30\n\
    trees, and cars, among others. Due to the large size of the environment to be\
    \ analyzed, two different\nscenarios were created for the simulations (in Figure\
    \ 4), which correspond to the two scenarios\ndelimited by a green and a red rectangle\
    \ in the real scenario shown in Figure 5. It must be noted\nthat the two rectangular\
    \ scenarios were selected within the campus (red on the left and green on the\n\
    right) to cover eight faculties. The rectangular shape is required by the 3D Ray-Launching\
    \ simulator.\nThe points marked as M, A, Q, R correspond to different reception\
    \ distances from the transmitter (T).\nTo obtain accurate results, the created\
    \ scenarios include the urban elements previously mentioned.\nFurthermore, realistic\
    \ object sizes as well as material properties (permittivity and conductivity)\
    \ were\ntaken into account. For the experiments, the LoRaWAN gateway explained\
    \ in Section 3.3 was placed\nat the spot indicated by the red dot in the two images\
    \ shown in Figure 4. Please note that the location\ncorresponds to a single position,\
    \ which is in the third ﬂoor of the faculty of Computer Science (located\nin the\
    \ intersection of the two rectangles of Figure 5, marked in such a Figure with\
    \ a blue T).\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4. Simulated scenarios of the smart campus. (a)\

    5. Experiments\n5.1. Empirical Validation: LoRaWAN Testbed\nTo evaluate LoRaWAN\
    \ performance in a real campus, the testbed described in Section 3.3 was\ndeployed\
    \ in the Campus of Elviña. A measurement campaign was designed and carried out\
    \ to\nvalidate the chosen hardware and the simulation results provided by the\
    \ 3D Ray-Launching algorithm.\nThe performed tests consisted on transmitting packets\
    \ from the LoRaWAN node to the gateway from\ndifferent spots throughout the campus\
    \ using acknowledgment messages. Figure 6 shows such spots\n(in yellow) together\
    \ with the LoRaWAN gateway location (in red) for one of the two parts of the\n\
    evaluated campus. The transmitter was placed near a window inside a building,\
    \ at a height of 3.5 m\nfrom the street ground level. In contrast, all the measurement\
    \ spots were located outdoors, at a height\nof 0.5 m. For every of the previously\
    \ mentioned spots, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 3287\n18 of 30\nand Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values were recorded both\
    \ at the LoRaWAN gateway and at the device\nthat acted as a node. A Debian Virtual\
    \ machine was connected to the LoRaWAN-server WebSocket\nendpoint. Nodes were\
    \ connected through an USB port and programmed to send a 6-byte payload ten\n\
    times. The ﬁrmware of the LoRaWAN node uses the USB port to create a serial interface\
    \ and write\nthe SNR and RSSI of the received acknowledgment. With this setup,\
    \ the LoRaWAN node was moved\nto different spots and at each of them the RSSI\
    \ and SNR values of the gateway and the node were\nrecorded for a total of ten\
    \ packages per location.\nTo test for possible interference in the used Industrial,\
    \ Scientiﬁc and Medical (ISM) sub-band,\na USRP B210 [112] with the same 0 dBi\
    \ antenna used by the LoRaWAN gateway was connected to a\nlaptop that acted both\
    \ as data-logger and spectrum analyzer (such a measurement setup is shown\nin\
    \ Figure 3). As an example, the result of one of the analysis during the empirical\
    \ measurements is\nshown in Figure 7, when the system was conﬁgured to monitor\
    \ a central frequency of 868.3 MHz with\na sampling rate of 1 MHz.\nFigure 6.\

    Sensors 2019, 19, 3287\n19 of 30\nFigure 8. Comparison between empirical measurements\
    \ and 3D-Ray-Launching simulation results.\nAfter the measurement campaign within\
    \ the campus, Radio Frequency (RF) power level\nestimations for the whole volume\
    \ of the scenario were obtained with the aid of the 3D Ray-Launching\nsimulation\
    \ tool. The transmitter element was placed at the same position of the real LoRaWAN\n\
    gateway (the red dot in Figure 6) and, using the simulation parameters shown in\
    \ Table 3, a simulation\nwas launched. The comparison between the measured RF\
    \ power values and the simulation estimations\nis depicted in Figure 8. As can\
    \ be seen in the Figure, the obtained estimations follow the tendency of\nthe\
    \ measured values, obtaining a mean error of 0.53 dB with a standard deviation\
    \ of 3.39 dB (taking\ninto account the 19 measurement points of Figure 6). The\
    \ standard deviation is higher than the usual\nvalues provided by the 3D Ray-Launching.\
    \ This effect could be due to size of the scenario (and the\nchosen simulation\
    \ parameters such as cuboid size and launched ray resolution), since it is the\
    \ largest\nscenario simulated so far by the developed 3D Ray-Launching tool. In\
    \ addition, it must be noted the\nfact that measurements were based on RSSI values\
    \ provided by the motes, which inherently add a\nreceived RF power level error.\
    \ Nonetheless, the simulation results are accurate, and the simulation tool\n\
    is validated satisfactorily. Regarding the results, it is worth noting the low\
    \ RF power levels measured\nin several points of the scenario. The RF power level\
    \ in many of these points is lower than −100 dBm,\nwhich is the typical ZigBee\
    \ sensitivity. However, one of the advantages of the selected LoRaWAN\ndevices\
    \ is that their sensitivity is much lower (in the usual operating conditions,\
    \ up to −137 dBm), as\ncan it be observed in Table 4. Thus, the radio link budget\
    \ for LoRaWAN has a higher margin, which\nmeans that longer communication distances\
    \ can be achieved.\nTable 4. Sensitivity values for LoRaWAN devices at 868 MHz.\n\

    \ the presented 3D Ray-Launching simulation tool was validated by comparing the\
    \ simulation\nresults with the measurements, three different outdoor use cases\
    \ were proposed for the smart campus\nenvironment, where LoRaWAN would have direct\
    \ connectivity with a gateway:\n•\nCrowdsensing/Mobility pattern detection. The\
    \ purple dots depicted in Figure 9 represent the\nlocation of SBC-type devices\
    \ (e.g., Raspberry Pi) that act as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sniffers that will\nhelp\
    \ to determine the mobility patterns of the users that move throughout the campus,\
    \ what will\noptimize the deployed location-based services. In the same way, the\
    \ devices could also help in\ncrowdsensing tasks in certain areas.\n•\nSmart irrigation.\
    \ In this case, due to the location of the campus green areas, devices will be\n\
    deployed only in one of the modeled scenarios. The device locations are represented\
    \ by yellow\ndots shown in Figure 10. The aim of this system is to remotely control\
    \ and automate the irrigation\nof green areas where the deployment of wired infrastructure\
    \ to control the valves is very expensive\nor even unfeasible.\n•\nSmart trafﬁc\
    \ monitoring. To detect vehicular trafﬁc, sensors are deployed at the points represented\n\
    by blue dots in Figure 11. In this way, the trafﬁc behavior within the campus\
    \ can be analyzed and\nthe degree of parking occupancy could be inferred. Sustainability\
    \ and ecological measurements to\nboost public transportation, to optimize routes\
    \ and resources, and to adapt to real-time demand\ncould be taken.\nFigure 9.\

    \ Aerial view of the spots monitored for the smart trafﬁc use case (Source: c⃝2019\
    \ Google).\nTo validate the three mentioned smart campus use cases, 3D Ray-Launching\
    \ simulations were\nlaunched for the proposed device locations. As an example,\
    \ Figure 12 shows the estimated RF power\ndistribution for bi-dimensional planes\
    \ at two different heights (ground level and building’s third ﬂoor\nlevel -at\
    \ the gateway’s height) for the smart irrigation use case (in Figure 12a, where\
    \ the transmitter is\nat the center of the Green scenario) and the smart trafﬁc-monitoring\
    \ case (Figure 12b, transmitter at the\nfurthest point of the Red Scenario). The\
    \ used simulation parameters are also those shown in Table 3.\nAs can be observed\
    \ in Figure 12, the transmitter location (marked as a white circle with a T) and\
    \ the\nmorphology of the scenario (mainly the building location) greatly affect\
    \ wireless signal propagation.\nNevertheless, the estimated RF signal strength\
    \ is quite high, taking into account the sensitivity of the\nemployed LoRaWAN\
    \ devices (i.e., −137 dBm) and the fact that the most common sensitivity value\
    \ is\n−148 dBm (see Table 4).\nTo determine whether the chosen gateway location\
    \ will comply with the required sensitivity\nfor the proposed LoRaWAN node locations,\
    \ 3D Ray-Launching simulation results were performed.\nAs an example, Figure 13\
    \ summarizes the sensitivity analysis carried out for the use case illustrated\n\
    in Figure 12b (i.e., for the furthest LoRaWAN node deployed for the smart trafﬁc-monitoring\
    \ use\ncase). Speciﬁcally, Figure 13a shows the estimations obtained when the\
    \ transmitter is operating at\n20 dBm for different heights: ground level, third\
    \ ﬂoor, and fourth ﬂoor. Figure 13b presents the same\nresults, but for a lower\
    \ transmission power (5 dBm). Finally, Figure 14 depicts the results for the\n\
    sensitivity analysis based on the results obtained when transmitting at 5 dBm.\
    \ This last Figure shows\nthe areas and spots of the scenario that comply (dark\
    \ blue) and do not comply (light blue) with the\nselected sensitivity value (in\
    \ this case, the typical −148 dBm). The results show that for the case of\ntransmitting\
    \ at 20 dBm, there is no problem in terms of sensitivity threshold, but for the\
    \ case of using\n5 dBm, potential problems with this threshold appear within the\
    \ building where the gateway is placed\n(this represented by the light blue surfaces\
    \ at the top and left sides of the bi-dimensional planes).\nTherefore, a trade-off\
    \ decision should be made to choose a transmission power level that ensures good\n\
    sensitivity and, at the same time, the optimization of the energy consumption\
    \ of the deployed motes.\nIn fact, the results show that the gateway location\
    \ could be improved by moving it from the third ﬂoor\nto the fourth ﬂoor. Thus,\
    \ the deployment of the LoRaWAN network can be optimized by the presented\n3D\
    \ Ray-Launching algorithm in relation to its coverage and the overall energy consumption\
    \ of the\nwireless communications system.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287\n22 of 30\n\

    \ the previous section indicate the impact that the campus scenario has in\nradio-planning\
    \ analysis and hence, in the determination of the optimal network layout. It must\
    \ be\nﬁrst pointed out that the obtained results are hard to generalize, since\
    \ the analyzed campus scenarios\nhave particular characteristics that make them\
    \ almost unique. Such characteristics include the size of\nthe campus or the distribution\
    \ of elements within it (mainly the buildings and their size and material\nproperties),\
    \ which have a great impact on radio signal propagation. Moreover, the topology\
    \ of the\ndeployed wireless network (i.e., the location of the nodes) has also\
    \ a great inﬂuence on wireless\ncommunications performance. Therefore, the proposed\
    \ methodology and solution have been validated\nin the presented paper, but it\
    \ has to be noted that site-speciﬁc assessments are needed (that is, the\nresults\
    \ obtained for a speciﬁc campus environment cannot be generalized for any other\
    \ campus\nscenario). Nonetheless, some aspects and results can be generalized\
    \ up to a point (e.g., the received RF\npower for LoS situations), which are discussed\
    \ in the following paragraphs.\nOne of the advantages in the use of LoRaWAN transceivers\
    \ is their inherent low sensitivity values\n(in the range of −135.5 dBm to −148\
    \ dBm), which improve the reception range in comparison to other\ntechnologies.\
    \ In all the observed simulation and measurement results, the received power levels\
    \ are\nabove −120 dBm, providing a sound margin to consider additional losses,\
    \ such as the ones due to the\nvariable fading related to user movements or to\
    \ the dynamic elements within the campus.\nIn the speciﬁc outdoor applications\
    \ considered for the smart campus, non-directional antennas\nprovide adequate\
    \ functionality, given the fact that theoretically, users and nodes can be located\
    \ at any\ngiven location within the scenario. Nonetheless, in certain applications\
    \ directional antennas may be\nhelpful (e.g., in telemetry applications where\
    \ the receiver is static, Yagi-Uda, helical or patch array\nantennas could be\
    \ used), increasing received power levels, thus improving the communications range.\n\
    As can be observed in the experimental results, a coverage level of 20 dBm is\
    \ appropriate for all\nthe considered scenarios. However, it is desirable to reduce\
    \ transmission power to reduce overall\nSensors 2019, 19, 3287\n24 of 30\nenergy\
    \ consumption as well as potential interference. For certain applications, tailored\
    \ antennas may\nbe considered during the network planning and the deployment phases.\n\
    The presented measurement results indicate that mainly due to the characteristics\
    \ of the scenario,\nthere is an appropriate coverage for a linear distance of\
    \ 450 m with LoS (measurement point #16) and\n330 m with NLoS (measurement point\
    \ #19). The obtained results conclude that the location of the\ngateway is appropriate\
    \ in terms of coverage estimation when there is LoS and in most situations where\n\
    there is NLoS. The latter case requires in-depth analysis of the potential locations\
    \ of the nodes, in order\nto consider effective losses related to building penetration,\
    \ which on average can vary from 7 dB to\nover 25 dB depending on the building\
    \ and wall structure [113].\nIn terms of capacity, LoRa/LoRaWAN provides a transmission\
    \ speed of up to 50 Kbps, which\nis enough for a wide range of remote monitoring\
    \ applications where users send small amounts of\ninformation or where nodes are\
    \ polled with a moderate periodicity (i.e., several seconds) to provide\ninformation\
    \ from sensors. Speciﬁc applications (e.g., real-time image monitoring) that require\
    \ higher\nbandwidths can make use of alternative wireless technologies that can\
    \ coexist together with the\nproposed LoRaWAN network.\n7. Conclusions\nAfter\
    \ a thorough review of the state of the art on the most relevant aspects related\
    \ to the\ndeployment of smart campuses, this work detailed the design and deployment\
    \ of a LoRaWAN\nIoT-based infrastructure able to provide novel applications in\
    \ a smart campus. The architecture\nproposed the deployment of fog computing nodes\
    \ throughout the campus to support physically\ndistributed, low-latency, and location-aware\
    \ applications that decrease the network trafﬁc and the\ncomputational load of\
    \ traditional cloud computing systems.\nTo evaluate the proposed system,\na campus\
    \ of the University of A Coruña was recreated realistically through an in-house\
    \ developed\n3D Ray-Launching radio-planning simulator. Such a tool was tested\
    \ by comparing its output with\nempirical measurements, showing a good accuracy.\
    \ The proposed solution meets the established\noperational requirements:\n•\n\
    The provided coverage is roughly 1 km2.\n•\nThe system provides robustness against\
    \ signal losses and interference by being able to deploy\nredundant gateways.\n\
    •\nThe use of fog computing nodes supports low-latency and location-aware IoT\
    \ applications.\n•\nThe maximum provided transmission speed reaches 50 Kbps.\n\
    •\nThe system has been devised to make use of low-cost resource-constrained IoT\
    \ nodes.\n•\nThe network topology support both PMP and PtP links.\nIn addition,\
    \ three practical smart campus applications were designed and evaluated with the\n\
    planning simulator (a mobility pattern detection system, a smart irrigation solution,\
    \ and a smart\ntrafﬁc-monitoring deployment), showing that the tool is able to\
    \ provide useful guidelines and insights\nto future smart campus designers and\
    \ developers.\nAuthor Contributions: P.F.-L., P.L.-I. and T.M.F.-C. conceived\

    technologies to target particular sectors with different requirements is becoming
    necessary. In this paper, we summarize the latest developments of application-specific

    Internet of Animal Things (IoAT), Internet of Waste Things (IoWT), Internet of
    Underwater Things (IoUWT), Internet of Underground Things (IoUGT), Internet of
    Nano Things (IoNT), and Internet of Mobile Things (IoMobT) such as the Internet
    of Vehicles). The paper gives contributions to ASIoTs from three perspectives:
    First, we offer a basic classification taxonomy for ASIoTs and discuss various
    representative studies and applications which can be found in the literature;
    Second, we discuss a use case for a biometrics-based ASIoT (termed IoBioT) for
    illustration and experiments of face-based biometric recognition on IoBioT are
    also performed; and Third, we give discussions and future directions for ASIoTs.

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Internet-of-Things (IoT) which combines advancements
    in sensing, mobile computing and cloud server technologies and platforms have
    in recent years become highly important and ubiquitous in the modern world [1],
    [2]. As more and more applications are deployed using IoT technologies, the fragmentation
    of general purpose IoT technologies to target particular sectors with different
    requirements is becoming necessary. For example, a customized IoT for environmental
    water monitoring would have different requirements from a customized IoT for medical
    patient monitoring. The latter IoT application would require much higher and stringent
    requirements for real-time data transfer and security. This leads to the emergence
    and development of IoTs to realize specific requirements for various domains,
    communications mediums and industry sectors which for convenience we term as application
    specific IoTs (ASIoTs). On observation, the development of ASIoTs is mirroring
    the development of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in digital
    electronics technology with the realization that different application domains
    (e.g. high speed logic processing, implementation on low power devices) required
    different design parameters to be optimized. In the case of ASICs, some requirements
    and parameters to be customized include clock speed, chip area, power consumption,
    etc [3]. For ASIoTs, some parameters and requirements to be customized include
    the end-to-end delay or network data latency, robustness of the network towards
    node failures, node power consumption, security aspects, etc. Although ASIoTs
    are an emerging research area, some examples of IoTs for customized and specific
    applications can be found in the literature. The authors in [4] proposed the medical
    Internet of Things which they termed mIoT. Further examples of ASIoTs are the
    Internet of Underwater Things (IoUWT) [5] as a network of smart interconnected
    underwater objects, the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) [6] worn by military
    personnel and embedded within military equipment, the Internet of Nano Things
    [7] and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) [8], [22] which utilizes vehicles on highways
    as mobile nodes and roadside sensing and computational infrastructure for intelligent
    transportation and safety applications. The design of the different ASIoTs will
    prioritize meeting different design factors. Some design factors will remain common
    towards most ASIoTs whereas others may only apply towards ASIoTs in particular
    domains. A common requirement for many ASIoTs is the requirement for low power
    and low complexity implementation in battery-powered sensor nodes or devices.
    Many IoT devices cannot afford resource demanding algorithms (e.g. cryptographic
    & video [9] protocols) to be implemented within the hardware constrained devices.
    For example, a medical sensor device to be authenticated with fingerprint recognition
    technology would need the biometric traits to be encrypted before transmission
    to the cloud server. This encryption would need to be performed on the device
    itself which would have severe constraints on computational power, memory storage
    and power consumption while still ensuring the requirements are met for secure
    communications. However, this requirement for low power consumption is not required
    in IoV applications as the chemical or electric batteries in vehicles can provide
    ample power for sensing, communications and information processing. In the case
    for IoV networks, the requirement is geared towards very low network latency and
    fast response time to meet the safety requirements for intelligent transportation.
    Here, we see a contrast between the design factors and tradeoffs (e.g. power consumption
    vs network response time) for different ASIoTs. This paper aims to spur researchers
    and facilitate the development of ASIoTs for different user-defined domains, communication
    mediums and technology constrained platforms. It gives contributions for ASIoTs
    from three perspective. First, a basic classification taxonomy for ASIoTs is presented.
    This is followed by the discussion on various representative studies and applications
    which can be found in the literature. Second, we present a use case for a biometrics-based
    ASIoT (termed IoBioT) for illustration. A case study of face-based biometric recognition
    and experiments is included to confirm our approach in the Big biometrics data
    computation layer of IoBioT. Third, the discussions and future directions for
    ASIoTs are presented. The paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses
    a basic classification taxonomy and several representative studies and applications
    for ASIoTs which can be found in the literature. A focus here is to identify some
    important design parameters and challenges to be addressed in these ASIoTs. A
    use case study for a biometric-based ASIoT (IoBioT) is discussed in Section III
    to illustrate some design parameters and customizations for security, key management
    and Big data information processing. Experiments are also included. Section IV
    gives future directions and discussions to spur researchers and facilitate the
    development of ASIoTs for different user domains, communication mediums and technology
    constrained platforms. Section IV concludes the paper. SECTION II. Studies in
    ASIoT Research This section surveys advancements made in the developments and
    applications of ASIoTs in eight representative studies (Internet of Battlefield
    Things, Internet of Medical Things, Internet of Animal Things, Internet of Waste
    Things, Internet of Underwater Things, Internet of Underground Things, Internet
    of Nano Things, and Internet of Mobile Things). An important focus is the identification
    of the various design factors and challenges to be prioritized for the different
    ASIoTs. We also offer a basic taxonomy and classification of ASIoTs into three
    categories: (1) User domain-driven; (2) Communications medium-driven; and (3)
    Technology constraint-driven. The design parameters for user domain-driven ASIoTs
    are optimized for parameters defined by the specific user domain. Examples of
    user domain-driven ASIoTs would be the Internet of Battlefield Things, Internet
    of Medical Things, Internet of Animal Things and Internet of Waste Things. The
    design of communications medium-driven ASIoTs are dominated by the network communications
    in the medium (e.g. terrestrial, underwater, underground mediums) with different
    properties and characteristics. Examples of these classes of ASIoTs are the Internet
    of Underwater Things and the Internet of Underground Things. The third classification
    for ASIoTs are the technology constraint-driven ASIoTs. An example of this class
    is the Internet of Nano Things where the constraints of the nanotechnology implementation
    drives the design factors for the ASIoT. Table 1 shows a summary of the different
    types of ASIoTs and its taxonomy classification, the smart things or objects in
    the ASIoT, the challenges and the design parameters to be prioritized and optimized,
    and some representative works discussed in this section. The lessons learnt from
    the case studies and the important factors and future directions for designing
    and building ASIoTs are discussed in Section IV. TABLE 1 Summary of ASIoTs Characteristics
    and its Taxonomy Classification A. Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) The Internet
    of Battle Things or also known as the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) [6],
    [10], [11], [12] is an illustrative example of an ASIoT which has been designed
    for military and defense applications. The design of the IoBT would be strongly
    influenced by two technologies (machine intelligence and networked communications).
    The “smart things” in the IoBT would include sensors, munitions, weapons, vehicles,
    robots, and human-wearable devices which are capable of collecting and processing
    information, acting as agents to support decision making and situational awareness,
    undertaking coordinated defensive actions, and unleashing a variety of effects
    on the adversary [6]. The IoBT can be seen as a user defined-domain ASIoT with
    extremely stringent requirements for fast and adaptively robust network communications,
    rapid real-time information processing to deal with a large volume and complexity
    of information for human decision-making and requiring very high security. As
    remarked by the authors in [6], the IoBT will itself become a battleground, as
    the adversary will attempt to take control and subvert the IoBT for its own ends.
    The authors identified three security challenges for the IoBT to be addressed:
    (1) Physical survival and functioning of IoBT from kinetic, directed-energy and
    electronic attacks against its things, jamming the RF channels, destroying fiber
    channels and by depriving IoBT of its power sources; (2) Threats to the confidentiality,
    integrity, availability of the information within IoBT, by electronic eavesdropping,
    and by deploying malware into IoBT; and (3) Human deceptions and loss of confidence
    that the information in the IoBT is trustworthy or that some elements of IoBT
    are being controlled by the adversary. Other authors have proposed various improvements
    to address the challenges faced by the IoBT. A significant challenge for the IoBT
    compared with other IoTs is the need for information dissemination in the presence
    of adversaries. The authors in [10] studied the problem of network connectivity
    for the IoBT in which an attacker aims at disrupting the connectivity of the network
    by choosing to compromise one of the IoBT nodes at each time epoch. The authors
    formulate the scenario as a dynamic multistage Stackelberg connectivity game that
    explicitly takes into account the characteristics and requirements of the IoBT
    network such as the IoBT latency and the sum of weights of disconnected nodes
    at each stage of the game. Their results showed that the expected number of disconnected
    sensors using the feedback Stackelberg equilibrium (FSE) decreased up to 46% compared
    to a baseline equal probability policy. Another approach for secure information
    dissemination in the presence of adversaries was proposed by [11]. In this work,
    the authors used stochastic geometry (SG) based models to characterize the connectivity
    of IoBT networks in terms of the degree distribution and employed epidemic spreading
    models to model data dissemination among different types of battlefield devices
    according to the assigned missions. Their results showed that the objectives of
    the battlefield mission could be achieved by either changing the deployment of
    the combat units or by changing their transmission power. The authors in [12]
    investigated the problem of detecting malware in the IoBT. Their approach employed
    eigenspace learning and deep learning methods to detect IoBT malware using the
    operational code sequences (OpCode) of the devices. The authors showed that their
    approach achieved an accuracy rate of 98.37%, a precision rate of 98.59% and also
    had the capability to mitigate against junk code insertion attacks. B. Internet
    of Medical Things (IoMT) The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is another example
    of a customized user domain-driven ASIoT for healthcare and patient monitoring
    with its own specific requirements and challenges. Examples of “smart things”
    in the IoMT would include sensor wearables (e.g. for Parkinson’s disease, multiple
    sclerosis), sensors and devices for diabetes, heart rate and electrocardiogram
    (ECG), and smart things for insulin and inhalers. The authors in [4] identified
    the requirement of interoperability as a major challenge for the IoMT. This important
    issue deals with the need for proprietary protocols from medical sensors/devices
    and smart things from one manufacturer to be able to communicate with devices
    and servers from other manufacturers in order that the collected data can be utilized
    fully for the diagnosis and health applications and not marooned on separate data
    islands. Other challenges identified by the authors for the IoMT include: (1)
    Simple connectivity for the smart things and devices to connect to and access
    the cloud-based services; (2) Easy device management for improved device availability
    and reduced maintenance; and (3) Informative analytics to gain insight from huge
    volumes of medical and healthcare data for better decision-making. Although the
    security requirements for the IoMT may not be as stringent as for the IoBT, the
    security and privacy of the patients’ records also require protection from unauthorized
    access. The privacy of patients’ can be breached if the personal and medical information
    are posted in the public domain or otherwise used without their consent. Similarly,
    attacks can be made to interfere with the proper functioning of essential medical
    devices such as pacemakers. The authors in [13] proposed authentication mechanisms
    for ECG monitoring signals from IoT devices using watermarking techniques. In
    their approach, a watermark is introduced into the ECG signal on the client side
    which is then authenticated on the cloud server. Their watermarking approach is
    based on dividing the ECG signal into a number of beats and applying the discrete
    wavelet transform singular value decomposition (DWT-SVD) on each beat. On the
    cloud side, seven features (heartbeat rate, P wave duration, PR interval, QRS
    complex, QT interval, shape and T wave) are extracted from the ECG signal and
    the classification is performed using a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM).
    The authors in [14] proposed the Wearable IoT (WIoT) for person-centered healthcare.
    The architectural composition of the WIoT includes three elements: (1) Wearable
    body area sensors (WBAS); (2) Internet-connected gateways; and (3) Cloud and Big
    data support. The WBAS serves as the frontend for the WIoT ecosystem and performs
    two functions: (1) Data collection from the body through contact sensors or peripheral
    sensors; and (2) Data preparation for on-board device analysis or remote transmission
    for comprehensive analysis and decision support. The Internet-connected gateways
    serves to exchange data with the wearable sensor devices via short range communication
    technology (e.g Bluetooth) and transmit the data to the cloud via heterogeneous
    networks communication technology (e.g. WiFi and GSM). The Cloud and Big data
    support provides the computing infrastructure for large-scale and advanced functionalities
    for medical data analytics, machine learning and data mining. C. Internet of Animal
    Things (IoAT) The Internet of Animal Things (IoAT) [15] is as an example of an
    ASIoT where the smart objects and devices are used to monitor living creatures
    (e.g. livestock such as dairy cows, sheep, cattle) within the IoT. The IoAT would
    have significant advantages for monitoring the health of livestock for smart farming
    applications. Examples of smart things in the IoAT would include smart cattle
    collars to monitor rumination, temperature and activity movements, RFID ear tags
    and sound analyzers for early detection of respiratory diseases [16]. A recent
    work by the authors in [26] proposed a method to detect and classify the screams
    of pigs for indications of stressful situations. Their approach used classification
    of sound spectrograms and achieved results of 71.83% sensitivity, 91.43% specificity
    and 83.61% precision. Some challenges for the IoAT include energy efficiency for
    the on-animal measuring devices. The authors in [15] proposed the use of sub-GHz
    long range (LoRA) for use in animal monitoring and characterized the off-body
    wireless channel in indoor (barn) environments at 868 MHz using LoRa nodes. D.
    Internet of Waste Things (IoWasteT) The Internet of Waste Things (or also known
    as the Internet of Bins [17]) is a very useful application for deployment in smart
    cities [18], [20]. The smart things and objects in the IoWasteT include smart
    garbage bins (SGBs) [19], RFID tags, sensors, cameras and actuators. The IoT-based
    smart garbage system (SGS) proposed in [19] was operated as a pilot project in
    Seoul for a one-year period. The battery-based SGBs communicated information with
    each other using wireless mesh networks and a router and server collected and
    analyzed the information for service provisioning. A header SGB (HSGB) located
    within each region was used to analyze and manage the other SGBs within its region
    after collecting their information. Their approach included a cooperation-based
    operation to increase the battery lifetime in the IoT for energy-efficient operations
    of the SGBs where the HSGB was adaptively selected according to the battery and
    memory status of each SGB in the region. An important challenge for the IoWasteT
    is the large scale data collection and delivery to thousands of sensors and actuators
    integrated within the smart objects. A potential solution is to use the Internet
    of Vehicles (IoV) to serve as data MULES (Mobile Ubiquitous LAN Extensions) [21]
    in smart city environments as a cost effective approach for the large scale data
    collection, transportation and information processing from smart objects within
    the smart city environment [22]. E. Internet of Underwater Things (IoUWT) The
    Internet of Underwater Things (IoUWT) is an example of a communications medium
    driven ASIoT targeted for application in oceans and other water-based domains.
    The “smart things” in the IoUWT would include underwater sensors, smart buoys,
    autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and ships. The design of the IoUWT would
    be strongly influenced by the unique factors for network communications in the
    water-based medium compared to communications in a traditional terrestrial medium.
    The network communications in the IoUWT would employ acoustic links compared to
    radio waves for a terrestrial-based IoT. The acoustic medium for network communications
    would suffer from long propagation delays, high bit error rates and short network
    bandwidth [5]. The authors in [23] identified some further challenges for the
    IoUWT: (1) Energy efficiency and difficulty to recharge. Due to the high deployment
    costs of the underwater sensors and the difficulty to recharge the devices, energy
    efficiency is an important challenge for the IoUWT; (2) Changes to network topology
    due to movement of the underwater sensors; and (3) Unstable and low reliability
    due to transmission loss of the acoustic signals being absorbed by the water environment.
    Two approaches for energy efficient medium access control (MAC) and routing protocols
    for the IoUWT can be found in the works by [24], [25]. Medium access control (MAC)
    protocols developed for terrestrial IoTs such as carrier-sense multiple access
    (CSMA) or time-division multiple access (TDMA) do not perform well underwater.
    The authors in [24] proposed an energy efficient MAC protocol for underwater sensor
    networks termed EE-MAC. The EE-MAC protocol achieves the energy efficiency by
    minimizing the idle listening period and reduces the energy loss due to packet
    collisions. The authors in [25] proposed an energy efficient routing protocol
    which is efficient in packet forwarding and energy consumption for the IoUWT termed
    E-CARP. The E-CARP protocol uses a greedy routing strategy to deliver packets
    hop-by-hop and reduces the number of control packets to lower the energy consumption
    and increase the lifetime of the sensor nodes in the IoUWT. F. Internet of Underground
    Things (IoUGT) The Internet of Underground Things (IoUGT) [27], [28] is another
    example of a communications medium-driven ASIoT targeted in this case for underground
    network communications. The IoUGT is particularly useful for applications in environmental
    monitoring, landslide and earthquake monitoring and precision agriculture (e.g.
    for real-time soil sensing and monitoring [27]). The smart things in the IoUGT
    include underground (UG) objects (e.g. buried soil sensors for temperature, moisture,
    pH sensing, buried seismometers), above ground (AG) smart objects (e.g. base stations
    and mobile sinks), smart interfaces for field machinery and irrigation systems.
    Being a communications-medium driven ASIoT, the design of the IoUGT would be influenced
    by the underground network communications (in this case through electromagnetic
    (EM) wave propagation through a dense substance such as soil or rock). The authors
    in [28] identified four design challenges for wireless sensor communications in
    underground channels: (1) Power conservation and recharge ability – The IoUGT
    faces similar challenges to the IoUWT for recharging or replacing the deployed
    smart devices (in this case, the smart devices would be buried underground with
    difficulty to access physically). The factors which affect communication with
    EM waves in underground environments include path loss due to material absorption,
    reflection/refraction, multi-path fading, reduced propagation velocity and noise
    [28]; (2) Topology design – The topology and deployment of the sink/relay objects
    could be completely underground or utilize a hybrid structure where field vehicles
    or machinery function as mobile sinks for data collection from the underground
    sensors; (3) Antenna design – some challenges include antenna size and directionality
    (e.g. using a single omni-directional or a group of independent directional antennas);
    and (4) Environmental extremes – threats from extreme temperatures, water, animals
    and insects. A recent work by the authors in [29] performed a comprehensive connectivity
    analysis of underground sensors in wireless underground sensor networks for the
    effects of environment parameters such as soil moisture and composition, and for
    system parameters such as node density and propagation techniques. The authors
    remarked that their connectivity analysis can be used as a framework when considering
    the connectivity of wireless underground sensor nodes with other kinds of environment
    and system parameters. G. Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) The Internet of Nano
    Things (IoNT) [7], [30] serves as an example of an ASIoT which is targeted towards
    realization for a specific technology constraint-domain (in this case nanotechnology)
    and the design parameters are strongly influenced by what communications and information
    processing can be performed in this (nanotechnology) domain. Communications on
    the nanoscale can take two forms: (1) Molecular communication – utilizing the
    transmission and reception of information encoded in molecules; and (2) Nano-electromagnetic
    communication – utilizing the transmission and reception of EM radiation based
    on novel nanomaterials [7]. The smart things in the nanotechnology domain include
    nano-sensors, nano-actuators, nano-nodes, nano-routers, nano-micro interface and
    gateways (e.g. smartphones) to connect the IoNT to the global Internet. The design
    challenges for the IoNT stems from the properties of the nanomaterials used (e.g.
    graphene nanoribbon (GNR) or carbon nanotube (CNT)). The works in [30] and [31]
    extended the concept of the IoNT to the Internet of Multimedia Nano Things (IoMNT)
    and the Internet of Bio Nano Things (IoBNT). The IoBNT requires the development
    of connections between the biochemical domain of molecular nanonetworks and the
    electrical domain of electromagnetic networks with the promise of continuous health
    monitoring and bacterial sensor-actuator networks inside the human body. The authors
    in [32] proposed the use of field effect transistor based biosensors (bioFETs)
    to construct a molecular antenna capable of transducing molecular messages into
    electrical signals. H. Internet of Mobile Things In the traditional IoT, the sensor
    nodes and devices are mostly static within the network. The Internet of Mobile
    Things (IoMobT) [33] represents an ASIoT where the smart things can move independently
    and remain accessible within the network. The “smart things” in the IoMobT would
    include mobile personal devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets), mobile robots and
    vehicles on highways. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a good example of the
    IoMobT. The authors in [33] identified four challenges to be addressed for the
    IoMobT: (1) Mobile Data Collection – Movement of the smart objects within the
    network generates unpredictability and an increased number of faults and disruptions
    for data collection; (2) Mobile Data Analytics – Characterizing and utilizing
    learnt mobility patterns of the smart objects to improve data analysis tasks;
    (3) Energy Management – Allowing the direct energy exchange among the different
    smart objects (e.g. an electric vehicle within the IoV can transfer available
    energy to another vehicle or to the smart grid (i.e. V2G technology)); and (4)
    Security and Privacy – Authenticating new smart devices and objects and preserving
    location privacy of the objects. The works in [34], [35] further proposed improvements
    towards the IoMobT. The authors in [34] proposed a middleware concept termed Mobile
    Hub for the IoMobT which allows the smart objects in the IoMobT to move autonomously
    and remain remotely accessible over the Internet. The authors in [35] proposed
    a platform as a service (PaaS) fog computing model termed Mobile Fog for the IoMobT
    that has the advantages of being geospatially distributed, large-scale and latency-sensitive.
    SECTION III. Use Case for a Biometrics-Based ASIoT This section gives an illustration
    for a user domain-driven ASIoT for biometrics termed IoBioT. The section first
    gives an introduction to biometric systems for the IoT. We then give discussions
    for a layer architecture for the IoBioT, and some design parameters and customizations
    for security, key management and Big data information processing. A. Biometrics
    and IoT Systems Biometric systems are becoming essential for authentication purposes
    particularly for usage in embedded devices such as the IoT. In 2000, the Gartner
    Group remarked that biometric identification (e.g. fingerprints, face and voice)
    will emerge as the only way to truly authenticate an individual, which will become
    increasingly important as security and privacy concerns grow. Initial systems
    for biometrics applications used standalone devices connected to a central server
    which performed the information processing and authentication tasks. With the
    rapid proliferation and increasing processing capability of smartphone and IoT
    devices, together with wide-scale network connectivity, distributed approaches
    where the processing tasks are performed at the edge of the network (or termed
    as edge or fog computing techniques) are becoming popular. Fig. 1 shows the Hype
    Cycle for Emerging Technologies from Gartner in 2017 [36]. FIGURE 1. Gartner 2017
    Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies showing IoT and edge computing technologies
    [36]. Show All An interesting observation as shown in Fig. 1 is the closeness
    for the technology trends for edge computing and IoT. This also motivates the
    development of the biometrics ASIoT (IoBioT) which requires fast response times
    to perform the authentication tasks. In the IoBioT, this can be achieved by performing
    the information processing on the IoT devices instead of having to transmit the
    biometrics data across the IoT network and waiting for the response from the central
    server. Some examples of works for implementing biometrics on the IoT or embedded
    devices can be found in [37], [38]. These works used the Raspberry Pi as the IoT
    device for implementation. Compared to the works in [37], [38] which focused the
    discussion on implementation in embedded devices, this section takes a broader
    perspective for the IoBioT to serve as an illustration for developing domain-driven
    IoT technologies and aims to spur researchers towards developing ASIoTs for different
    domains and platforms in general, and towards the development of the IoBioT specifically.
    B. Biometrics ASIoT Layer Architecture This section introduces the major elements
    in the Biometrics ASIoT (IoBIoT) infrastructure. Fig. 2 shows a diagram of the
    Biometrics ASIoT elements and the building blocks components in its layers. Fig.
    3 shows an overview of the IoBioT layer architecture. There are seven core layers
    within this architecture (Identification Layer, Biometrics Object Layer, Device
    Layer, Communication Layer, Cloud Services Layer, Big Biometrics Data Computation
    Layer and Application layer). We will give particular focus for two customizations
    which are important for the biometrics IoT domain: (1) End-to-end security and
    key management; and (2) Big data information processing using divide-and-conquer
    approaches. The layer customizations for end-to-end security and key management
    for the IoBioT will be discussed in Section III-(C). As shown in Fig. 3, the Big
    Biometrics Data Computation Layer is designed specifically for biometrics processing
    and contains dedicated computational units for data centralization, data aggregation,
    divide and conquer feature extraction, data fusion and decision making. This customized
    layer for Big data information processing will be discussed further in Section
    III-(D). FIGURE 2. Elements and components in the Biometrics ASIoT (IoBIoT) layers.
    (a) Biometrics ASIoT elements. (b) IoBIoT components. Show All FIGURE 3. The proposed
    Biometric ASIoT (IoBioT) architecture. Show All The first layer in the IoBioT
    is the Identification (ID) Layer. The ID layer functions to uniquely identify
    the smart things and objects within the IoBioT. Examples of ID codes are electronic
    product codes (EPC), uCodes and IP addresses (e.g. IPv6 addresses can be used
    to uniquely identify billions of objects and devices). The second layer (Biometrics
    Object Layer) functions to gather data from multiple biometrics sensors (e.g.
    face, fingerprint, voice/speech, iris and palm data) or objects from users within
    the network, and transmits the data to a central cloud for further processing.
    The biometric data can be collected from various locations (e.g. smartphones,
    smart cars, smart devices, smart appliances and smart homes). Some biometrics
    data are not scalar data and may involve different types of sensors. Multi-biometrics
    authentications would require data from multiple modalities to be collected from
    various biometrics sensors. The Device Layer in the IoBioT consists of components
    (e.g. wearable devices, body sensor nodes, wireless motes, etc.) to transmit the
    sensed biometrics data to the higher layers of the IoBioT. An important issue
    in this layer is to secure the biometric data before an attacker can get hold
    of it. Security issues and challenges in this layer include the need to avoid
    resource-demanding cryptographic protocols to meet the hardware-constrained (e.g.
    low computational power, memory and limited energy resources) requirements for
    IoT devices. Lightweight cryptography protocols [39], [40] which are suitable
    for implementation on hardware-constrained devices can be utilized in this layer.
    Security issues for the IoBioT nodes in this layer include attacks from an adversary
    to deplete the energy resources of the nodes by repeatedly making excessive requests
    or transmissions so that the nodes would have to make unnecessary transmissions.
    The fourth layer (Communication Layer) in the IoBioT serves the same function
    as that within the conventional IoT with three sub-layers or components: (1) Link
    sub-layer – responsible for the MAC protocols to be used within the IoBioT; (2)
    Network sub-layer – responsible for connectivity and routing decisions within
    the IoBioT (e.g. can utilize RPL protocol for routing over low Power and lossy
    networks [41]); and (3) Transport sub-layer – responsible for end-to-end communications
    by providing flow and congestion control mechanisms (e.g. can utilize UDP or TCP
    protocols). The Cloud Services Layer provides the core hardware infrastructure,
    servers, platform and storage and gives flexibility and scalability for the IoBioT
    applications. Using virtualization technology, it provides a system architecture
    with distributed parallel environments which can run multiple computational units
    to give fast computational response and high reliability. The elements in the
    IoBioT cloud could be formed from the private cloud within an organization or
    the public cloud (e.g. can utilize Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure). The Big Biometrics
    Data Computation Layer functions as a customized processing layer in the IoBioT
    to serve the need for Big data information processing. It contains the hardware
    components (e.g. data centers, GPUs, parallel platforms, FPGAs, SOCs) and software
    components (e.g. MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark) to perform computations in the IoT.
    For the IoBioT, we also include a software component to perform the multimodal
    Big data analytics using a divide and conquer paradigm which is discussed in Section
    III-(D). The smart objects send their data to the cloud for processing in real-time
    and then deliver results to end users from the extracted Big data. The final layer
    (Application Layer) in the IoBioT is responsible for providing services and determines
    a set of protocols for message passing. The IEEE 802.15.4 proposes the CoAP [42]
    as a key component for the low power IoT to reduce overheads and enhance packet
    delivery. The CoAP has two layers where the first layer is the messaging layer
    and the second layer is the request/response layer. The CoAP protocol uses the
    Datagram Transport-Layer Security (DTLS) to secure the CoAP messages. The authors
    in [43] proposed a fully implemented end-to-end application layer security architecture
    for the IoT based on existing Internet standards and communication stacks that
    use UDP/IPv6 networking for Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs).
    C. IoBioT Customizations for Security and Key Management This section gives some
    customizations for end-to-end security and key management for the IoBioT for securing
    the biometrics data from the device to the central collector (e.g. gateway) at
    the edge of the wireless network. The gateway provides the nodes in the IoBioT
    access to the global Internet. As in wireless sensor networks, messages are relayed
    from node to node until it reaches the gateway. There is also no requirement that
    all nodes in the network are under control or there may be imposter nodes as shown
    in Fig. 4. Thus, end-to-end security is essential to ensure that messages cannot
    be intercepted on the route from the sending IoBioT node to the gateway. FIGURE
    4. Adversary or imposter nodes and gateways in the IoBioT. Show All The authors
    in [44] identified a security issue to be addressed when a malicious compromised
    node forges a communication message and transmits to the gateway. The issue of
    forged nodes or gateways is highly important for the IoBioT especially for biometrics
    applications requiring high security such as hospital and medical monitoring systems.
    We consider the scenario when both malicious adversary nodes ( N A ) and gateways
    ( G A ) are forged and inserted into the IoBioT as shown in Fig. 4. Thus, there
    is a need to authenticate a new IoBioT node to the gateway, as well as to authenticate
    the gateway to an IoBioT node. We assume the presence of a Trusted Authority (TA)
    in the network for the following approach to authenticate IoBioT node i ( IoBio
    T i ) to Gateway j ( G j ) and vice versa. The secure data transfer from node
    to gateway can then take place using a shared key ( K ij ) after successful authentication.
    Initally, the TA generates a master secret key (sk) and public key (pk). The p
    k is made available to all devices on the network. When a new IoBioT node is added
    to the network, it first needs to authenticate itself to G j . The node sends
    to TA its node identity ( IoBio T i ), G j and the current timestamp ( T c ) all
    encrypted by pk. IoBioT i →TA:{ IoBioT i , G j , T c }pk (1) View Source The TA
    checks the timestamp, and if valid sends back to IoBio T i the shared key (Kij),
    a nonce ( N 1 ), the timestamp and a message encrypted with s k Gj all encrypted
    by the public key of the node. TA→ IoBioT i :{ K ij , N 1 , T c ,{ K ij ,pk} sk
    Gj } pk IoBioTi (2) View Source IoBioTi checks T c and N 1 and if valid sends
    to G j the shared key ( K ij ), a new nonce ( N 2 ), the timestamp and the secret
    message for G j received from the TA all encrypted by the public key of G j .
    IoBioT i → G j :{ K ij , N 2 , T c ,{ K ij ,pk} sk Gj } pk Gj (3) View Source
    G j checks T c and if valid decrypts the message encrypted with s k Gj from the
    TA and retrieves the shared key ( K ij ). G j then replies to IoBio T i with N
    2 and another new nonce ( N 3 ) encrypted by the public key of IoBio T i all encrypted
    by the shared key K ij . G j → IoBioT i :{{ N 2 , N 3 } pk IoBioTi , T c } K ij
    (4) View Source IoBio T i checks T c and N 2 and if valid, it is assured that
    G j is authenticated with the TA. IoBio T i sends to G j N 3 and the timestamp
    all encrypted by the shared key K ij . IoBioT i → G j :{ N 3 , T c } K ij (5)
    View Source G j checks T c and N 3 and if valid, it is assured that IoBio T i
    is authenticated with the TA. IoBio T i and G j can then communicate securely
    using the shared key K ij and be assured that they are communicating with legitimate
    and not forged entities within the IoBioT. These security and key management customizations
    would enable the realization for biometrics applications requiring high security.
    The generation of the sk and pk could use low complexity elliptic curve techniques
    [45]. D. IoBioT Customizations for Big Data Processing This section gives some
    customizations for Big data information processing and analytics for the IoBioT.
    This is performed in the Big Biometrics Data Computation Layer as shown in Fig.
    3. The processing layer caters for all kinds of biometric data. It also allows
    the multi-modalities fusion and decision making at the final stage. The divide
    and conquer feature extraction mechanism is presented to process these data blocks
    to obtain the feature blocks. The proposed structure of this layer is composed
    of four units: (1) Biometrics Data Centralized Unit (Bio_Data_CU); (2) Biometrics
    Data Aggregation & Pre-processing Unit (Bio_Data_APU); (3) Divide & Conquer Biometrics
    Feature Extraction Unit (D&C_Bio_FEU); and (4) Biometrics Decision Making Unit
    (Bio_DMU). The Bio_Data_CU is the first component in the Computation Layer and
    processes the raw data from various biometrics objects or devices with their own
    identity. The data from these objects can be video, images, voice, etc. This unit
    is also responsible for combining the objects data with their unique identity.
    This process of the Bio_Data_CU is illustrated in Fig. 3. After the raw data pre-processing
    in Bio_Data_CU has been completed, the processed data is passed to the Bio_Data_APU.
    This unit is responsible to perform data aggregation and arranges the data into
    blocks for the same object source based on its identity and biometrics modality
    and tries to create equal sizes of data blocks. In this unit, the aggregation
    and compilation service is supported by various algorithms that compile, organize,
    store and transmit the results. It also has some pre-processing functions for
    different modalities of biometrics data before performing the data analytics in
    the next units. The Bio_Data_CU and the Bio_Data_APU serves different functions
    in the Big Biometrics Data Computation Layer for the IoBioT. As illustrated in
    Fig. 3, The focus of the Bio_Data_CU is towards data arrangement and processing
    for biometric objects, whereas the focus of the Bio_Data_APU is towards data arrangement
    and processing for the different modalities (e.g. face, fingerprint, iris, etc.)
    found in multimodal biometrics data. The D&C_Bio_FEU is the third component in
    the layer. The divide and conquer mechanism in this unit plays an important role
    to enhance the scalability of the IoBioT architecture and improve the computational
    efficiency of the processing. The divide and conquer mechanism with their own
    servers processes the data of each biometrics modality efficiently for performing
    the parallel processing or tasks. The deployment of the specific feature extraction
    function depends on the biometrics data and its modality to extract the target
    features (e.g. ridge features for fingerprints, visual features for face biometrics
    and audio features for audio signal/speech). Fig. 5 shows the flow chart of the
    proposed divide and conquer mechanism for the aggregated biometrics data blocks.
    FIGURE 5. Customized divide and conquer mechanism to extract important features
    of different biometric data. Show All The type of biometrics data of the aggregated
    data blocks decides which feature function for the divide and conquer mechanism
    in the D&C_Bio_FEU is to be deployed. There are three main functions in the general
    mechanism: (1) Divide function; (2) Conquer function; and (3) Customized feature
    extraction function to target the specific feature. The divide function is responsible
    for divisions of block recursively until the block size reaches its threshold.
    The function takes the aggregated data block and divides the incoming block into
    two equal parts or sub-blocks (e.g. horizontally or vertically) recursively until
    it reaches to the block size threshold. Then the target feature extraction function
    is called for each divided or sub-block to extract the local features. The type
    and number of features vary and depends on the need of the biometrics application
    (e.g. minutiae for fingerprint features, spectral, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
    (MFCC), zero-crossing rate (ZCR), linear prediction coefficients (LPC) for audio
    or speech features, optical flows and motion patterns for gait features). Other
    biometric features include hand geometry, palm print, knuckle print, vein patterns,
    etc. These features are extracted from the sub-blocks during the divide and conquer
    mechanism. The conquer function then is initiated to combine and process the features
    in reverse order by taking each two neighbors’ sub-blocks local features. These
    feature blocks will be sent to the next stage of Bio_DMU for combination or fusion
    of feature blocks before decision making. Some examples for divide and conquer
    approaches for feature processing can be found in the works by [46], [47]. The
    Bio_DMU is the final stage of the computation layer. It contains fundamental support
    components (e.g. features/results storage devices, decision-making servers and
    communications infrastructure). The servers are supported by various algorithms
    that organize, store, and transmit the features/results with the intention that
    the data can be used by any server for its processing at any time. The algorithms
    to be used depend on the user domain biometric requirements. The Decision Making
    Server is also supported by various algorithms in order to make decisions for
    different scenarios and requirements. The decision making algorithm should be
    intelligent and efficient enough to efficiently produce a good decision. After
    the decision has been made, Bio_DMU returns the final desired output so that any
    application can utilize these decisions at real-time or offline for their respective
    requirements. The decision-making in the Bio_DMU depends on the data modality
    of the biometrics data: (1) Single modality; and (2) Multi-modality. The feature
    blocks of biometrics data with single modality are sent to the Single Modality
    Decision Making module in the Bio_DMU. The decision making process is straightforward.
    There is a customized design of decision mechanism for the single modality and
    also specific applications. This unit can operate in two modes with built-in functionalities:
    (1) Verification; and (2) Identification. The verification process is described
    as a 1–to–1 matching system because the system tries to match the biometric presented
    by the individual against a specific biometric already in the database. The identification
    process is described as a 1-to- n matching system, where n is the total number
    of biometric templates in the database. Biometrics templates stored in the database
    can be obtained from the cloud and this computation layer also provides the access
    to the cloud database in the previous cloud services as illustrated in Fig. 3.
    The decision making for the modality can be made using machine learning techniques
    such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning.
    If the decision involves more than one type/modality of biometrics data, the sets
    of multimodal features blocks for each input multimodal partitioned data block
    are sent to the Multimodal Decision Making module in Bio_DMU. The final process
    is required to integrate and perform fusion of the features from different modalities
    in order to make the decision. Two scenarios need to be considered: (1) Decision
    Level Fusion; and (2) Feature Level Fusion. For decision level fusion and decision
    making, the target analysis first provides the local decisions based on individual
    modality feature blocks. The local decisions are then combined using a final decision
    fusion module to make a fused decision vector that is analyzed further to obtain
    a final decision. For feature level fusion and decision making, the feature blocks
    are first combined and then sent as input to the feature fusion module which merges
    the sets of features blocks from different modalities before the decision making.
    E. Biometrics Face Recognition and Experiments Sections III(B)–(D) have proposed
    the architecture of Biometrics ASIoT (IoBIoT) and customizations for Big Data
    Processing. One of the main components in the proposed architecture is the Biometrics
    Data Divide & Conquer Feature Extraction Unit which consists of the divide and
    conquer sub-systems. This section provides a case study of biometrics face recognition
    where the single modality is the face image. In many biometrics applications,
    principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are
    two well-known and widely used feature extraction techniques. PCA and LDA are
    normally used together in a cascade operation to extract features in biometrics.
    The original versions of PCA, LDA or PCA-LDA (Fisherface technique) and their
    current extensions were not designed for Big data computation and do not scale
    well for Big data applications. To conduct the experiments for biometrics face
    recognition in Big biometric data computation layer in IoBIoT, our previous research
    work on divide-and-conquer approaches [55], Divide and Conquer PCA (DC-PCA) and
    Divide and Conquer LDA (DC-LDA) for Big data information processing are applied
    as shown in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. Experimental approach of Biometrics Face Recognition.
    Show All Experimental results using the ORL [56] and Yale [57] datasets containing
    real-world variations for face recognition are presented to validate the approach
    and comparisons are given for the classification performance of the approach versus
    other traditional techniques which do not use the divide and conquer approach.
    The ORL dataset contains 400 images of 40 people containing 10 samples for each
    person with variations such as facial expressions and appearance. The experiments
    used five samples for each person for training and the remaining samples were
    used for testing. The Yale face database demonstrate variations in lighting conditions,
    facial expressions and facial details. The database contains 11 different images
    for each of 15 people. The experiments used 90 samples from the 15 people for
    training and the remaining samples were used for testing. Table 2. shows a summary
    of the performance comparisons. For the ORL dataset, the DC-PCA+LDA gave a recognition
    rate of 86% compared to 71% and 83% for PCA and Fisherface respectively, while
    for the Yale dataset, the DC-PCA+LDA gave a recognition rate of 62% compared to
    18% and 60% for PCA and Fisherface respectively. The results validated the performance
    efficacy of the DC-PCA+LDA compared with the traditional PCA and Fisherface methods.
    Although the experimental objectives were to validate the divide and conquer feature
    extraction approach for Big data computation, the results for DC-PCA+LDA gave
    better performance than the established Fisherface approach. TABLE 2 Summary of
    the Performance Comparisons for ORL and Yale Datasets SECTION IV. Future Directions
    and Research for ASIoTs This section discusses lessons learnt from the use case
    studies and some important challenges and future directions for designing and
    building ASIoTs. From the discussions in Section III and the observations in Table
    1, we identify four areas and perspectives towards future research for ASIoTs:
    (1) Interoperability among ASIoTs; (2) Energy efficient operation in ASIoTs; (3)
    Edge and fog machine learning models for ASIoTs; and (4) Security and privacy
    challenges for ASIoTs. A. Interoperability Among ASIoTs ASIoTs may contain a wide
    range of sensors, smart objects/devices and platforms from different manufacturers
    and vendors to be deployed within a specific domain. To achieve deployment of
    the ASIoT on a large-scale, these smart objects which may come from different
    manufacturers and vendors require the capabilities to interoperate and communicate
    with other smart objects within the IoT. The authors in [48] discuss a useful
    taxonomy for interoperability in IoT from five perspectives: (1) Device interoperability
    – mechanisms for integrating new devices into the IoT and message exchange among
    heterogeneous communication protocols within devices; (2) Network interoperability
    – mechanisms for end to end communication through diverse (wireless and wired)
    and heterogeneous communication networks; (3) Syntactical interoperability – interoperation
    of the data structure, format and interface for information exchange among the
    IoT entities; (4) Semantic interoperability – data and information models to allow
    IoT systems, services and applications to exchange information, data and knowledge
    in a meaningful way; and (5) Platform interoperability – mechanisms for information
    exchange across cross-platforms and cross-domains IoTs with diverse operating
    systems, architectures, access mechanisms for smart objects and data. The authors
    in [49] proposed a novel interoperability deployment for the industrial IoT domain
    using software-defined networks (SDNs) to manage different types of physical devices
    (industrial robot, automated guided vehicle, RFID reader, etc.), industrial wireless
    networks and cloud services and provide an interface for information exchange.
    B. Energy Efficient Operation in ASIoTs Many smart objects and devices in ASIoTs
    may rely on battery-powered sources with limited energy and/or may not be easily
    accessible for recharging purposes (e.g. in communications medium-driven IoUGTs
    and IoUWTs). Similar as for WSNs, the energy efficient operation and the need
    to optimize the network lifetime remains a critical challenge for ASIoTs. Novel
    and customized solutions for energy efficiency can be designed for different ASIoTs
    based on their specific deployment environment and requirements. The energy efficient
    solution used for one ASIoT may be different from solutions for other ASIoTs.
    The authors in [50] give an illustrative example of analyzing and designing an
    energy efficient ASIoT for the user domain of heritage artwork conservation. Their
    design considered the measurement requirements (e.g. sampling rate), aspects of
    the node design (e.g. sleep modes), gateway design, cloud infrastructure and user
    interface to determine the energy efficient requirements of the IoT operation.
    Using a small 1.7 mAh lithium-thionyl battery, their design was able to achieve
    a node lifespan of over twenty years by utilizing LoRa technology without the
    need for battery replacement. C. Edge and Fog Machine Learning Models for ASIoTs
    The authors in [51] remarked on the importance of cross-domain and multimodal
    inference and analytics for large-scale networked sensor systems which is also
    applicable towards ASIoTs where data is collected from a variety of sensing sources
    and domains. It is expected that new machine learning algorithms, data science
    and analytics will play a key role to extract value from the next generation of
    IoTs. A recent survey of machine learning techniques for the IoT can be found
    in [52]. A critical challenge for IoTs is to implement the machine learning algorithms
    (which can be computationally and/or storage intensive) on the resource-constrained
    smart objects or devices itself (or termed as edge or fog computing models). The
    authors in [53] remarked that the implementation of machine learning inference
    analytics on edge devices has huge potential and is still in its early stages.
    They also demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing and testing
    three machine learning algorithms (random forests, support vector machine and
    multi-layer perceptron) on the Raspberry Pi to profile their performance in terms
    of speed, accuracy and power consumption. The implementation of new machine learning
    algorithms such as deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks
    on edge devices remain a significant challenge to be addressed. D. Security and
    Privacy Challenges for ASIoTs The security requirements for different ASIoTs may
    vary considerably and this gives opportunities for cost-effective and energy efficient
    customizations (e.g. the requirements for the IoBT would be much stringent and
    higher than for the IoAT). The IoAT can be deployed with less stringent and computationally
    lower (or no) cryptographic protocols to reduce the power consumption requirements
    for the sensor nodes. Similarly, the security and privacy requirements for an
    IoT-based smart home would be different from that for an IoT to be deployed in
    a manufacturing environment. The number of potential threats, vulnerabilities
    and attacks towards an IoT is wide ranging due to the large number of attack surfaces
    and domains. The authors in [54] give a survey of potential security attacks and
    countermeasures in three IoT domains: (1) Sensing domain (e.g. jamming, vampire,
    selective forwarding, sinkhole attacks); (2) Cloud domain (e.g. hidden channel,
    VM escape, theft of service, VM migration, insider attacks); and (3) Fog domain
    (e.g. authentication and trust issues, privacy issues, denial-of-service (DoS)
    attacks). The privacy issues in the fog domain occur because fog devices will
    be able to infer the location of all the smart objects that are connected to the
    fog device and by extension track the location of users that are operating the
    devices. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper has reviewed and summarized the emerging
    area of application specific Internet of Things (ASIoTs) and given a basic taxonomy
    into three categories (user domain-driven, communications medium-driven, and technology
    constraint-driven ASIoTs). Several representative examples of the different classes
    of ASIoTs have been drawn from the literature for illustration of the challenges
    and design parameters to be optimized for the various ASIoTs. The design parameters
    for user domain-driven ASIoTs will require optimization for parameters defined
    by the specific user domain. The design parameters for communications medium-driven
    ASIoTs wil require optimization for the network communications in the medium (e.g.
    terrestrial, underwater, underground mediums) with different properties and characteristics.
    The design parameters for technology-driven ASIoTs will require optimization to
    meet the constraints of the technology implementation. The paper has also given
    a use case illustration for a biometrics-based ASIoT (IoBioT) and some layer customizations
    for security, key management and Big data information processing. Experiments
    on face-based biometrics have been performed to validate the Big biometric data
    computation layer in the IoBioT. Finally, perspectives and directions have also
    been discussed for future research covering interoperability, energy efficient
    operation, edge/fog machine learning models, and security/privacy challenges for
    ASIoTs. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This A

    Abstract: Continuous growth in software, hardware and internet technology has
    enabled the growth

    of internet-based sensor tools that provide physical world observations and data
    measurement.

    The Internet of Things(IoT) is made up of billions of smart things that communicate,
    extending the

    boundaries of physical and virtual entities of the world further. These intelligent
    things produce or

    collect massive data daily with a broad range of applications and ﬁelds. Analytics
    on these huge

    data is a critical tool for discovering new knowledge, foreseeing future knowledge
    and making

    control decisions that make IoT a worthy business paradigm and enhancing technology.

    Deep

    learning has been used in a variety of projects involving IoT and mobile apps,
    with encouraging

    early results. With its data-driven, anomaly-based methodology and capacity to
    detect developing,

    unexpected attacks, deep learning may deliver cutting-edge solutions for IoT intrusion
    detection.

    In this paper, the increased amount of information gathered or produced is being
    used to further

    develop intelligence and application capabilities through Deep Learning (DL) techniques.
    Many

    researchers have been attracted to the various ﬁelds of IoT, and both DL and IoT
    techniques have

    been approached. Different studies suggested DL as a feasible solution to manage
    data produced by

    IoT because it was intended to handle a variety of data in large amounts, requiring
    almost real-time

    processing. We start by discussing the introduction to IoT, data generation and
    data processing.

    We also discuss the various DL approaches with their procedures. We surveyed and
    summarized

    major reporting efforts for DL in the IoT region on various datasets. The features,
    application and

    challenges that DL uses to empower IoT applications, which are also discussed
    in this promising

    ﬁeld, can motivate and inspire further developments.

    1. Introduction

    Applications based on smartphones, sensors and actuators are becoming more and

    more intelligent over the past decade and facilitate communication between devices
    and

    the performance of more complex tasks. The number of network devices exceeded
    the

    world population [1] in 2008 and the ﬁgure continues to increase exponentially
    until today.

    In the age of the Internet of Things (IoT), smartphones, built-in systems, wireless
    sensors

    and most every device are connected by a local network or the internet. The growth
    in

    Internet-of-Things (IoT), which includes smartphones [2], sensor networks [3],
    sensors

    unusual aerial vehicles (UAV) [4,5], cognitively smart systems [6], and so on
    has created a

    multitude of new applications across various mobile and remote platforms. The
    amount

    of data obtained from such devices often increases with the growing number of
    devices.

    New technologies are emerging that evaluate data gathered for practical connections
    and

    decision making, progressing to Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) using Machine Learning(ML)

    and Deep learning (DL) algorithms.

    We generally adopt a work ﬂow model, which consists of collecting data, analysis
    of

    data, visualizing data and evaluating data [7,8], in order to build successful
    IoT applications.

    Data analysis is a crucial, computer-intensive dimension in which historically
    developed

    technologies typically combine technical expertise and ML (e.g., logistical regression,

    vector support, and the random forest) for classiﬁcation or regression problems
    such as

    trafﬁc conditions forecast [9], tracking vehicles [10], estimating delivery time
    [11], etc.

    Furthermore, as society enters the “big data” generation, these traditional methods
    are not

    strong enough to process huge, volatile, and irregular data from invisible, heterogeneous,

    IoT-based databases. Nearly all conventional systems focus on fully enclosed features
    and

    their efﬁciency relies heavily on the previous knowledge of particular areas.
    Most learning

    techniques used in those systems usually use shallow architectures, whose modeling
    and

    representational capacity are very small. As such, it is essential to have a much
    more

    effective analytical tool to exploit the maximum potential of the invaluable raw
    data

    produced in various IoT operations.

    The annual economic effect of IoT in 2025 will range from $2:7 to $6:2 trillion
    based

    on McKinsey’s study on the IoT global economic consequences [12]. Healthcare is
    the

    largest share of this sector about 41%, followed by industry and oil with 33%
    and 7%,

    respectively, of the IoT sector. Additional ﬁelds such as transport, irrigation,
    public infras-

    tructure, security and retailers account for approximately 15% of the entire IoT
    sector. Such

    expectations mean the immense and rapid growth of IoT services, their data generation
    and,

    therefore, their corresponding demand in the upcoming years. In McKinsey’s report
    [12],

    the economic impact of machine learning is characterized by automated learning;
    ’the

    use of computers to carry out tasks that rely on complex assessments, precise
    evaluations

    and innovative problem solving’. The study addresses the key proponents of information

    automation in ML techniques, such as DL and neural networks.

    Communication from Machine-To-Machine can be short distance using Wi-Fi, Blue-

    tooth and ZigBee technologies or broad-band mobile networks such as LoRa, M1 CAT,

    Sigfox, GSM, 4G, LTE and 5G [13].Since IoT devices are used extensively in all
    sorts of ev-

    eryday applications, the cost of IoT devices needs to be kept low. Furthermore,
    IoT devices

    should be able to handle fundamental tasks such as collection of data, M2M interaction,

    etc. IoT is also tightly linked to “big data” as IoT devices collect and exchange
    vast data

    continuously. In general, therefore, an IoT infrastructure uses methods to manage,
    store

    and evaluate massive data [14,15]. In order to facilitate the communication of
    the M2M

    with protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, CoAP and HTTP [16], it has become necessary
    in

    IoT infrastructure to use IoT-platforms such as Thingsboard, Thingspeak DeviceHive
    or

    Mainﬂux. It is often necessary for certain data processing to occur on IoT devices
    instead of

    other centralized nodes in the “cloud computing” network according to the application.

    As the processing moves partially to the end network elements, a new data processing

    model, called “edge computing”, is introduced [17]. Furthermore, they may not
    be ideal

    for heavy workloads due to these devices often being low-end devices. Therefore,
    an in-

    termediate node with enough resources is required to manage advanced processing
    tasks

    which are physically close to the end network components so that the burden caused
    by

    massive transmission of all data to a number of the internal cloud nodes is reduced.
    Here,

    “Fog nodes” [18] are introduced to assist big data management on IoT devices through

    the provision of storage, processing and networking services. Finally, the data
    is stored in

    cloud storage, where advanced testing by means of different ML and DL technologies
    and

    sharing with other devices leads to the establishment of smart apps with modern
    value

    added. DL has this intense publicity because conventional methods of machine learning
    do

    not meet the current analytical criteria of IoT systems. Instead, according to
    the structure of

    data generation and processing of IoT as shown in Figure 1, IoT systems require
    speciﬁc

    conventional data analytic methods, and AI methods. Dl methods used to analyze
    the big

    data in IoT cloud and streaming and fast data analysis in the edge or fog computing
    and

    data from IoT devices.

    Figure 1. Data generation and processing of IoT.

    While an IoT has been conducted in recent years, the entire ﬁeld of deep learning
    in

    IoT applications remains in infancy. Few researchers [19–24], reviewed papers
    in wireless

    sensor network(WSN) with ML, implementation of DL methods for healthcare department,

    mai DL approaches and applicability in IoT applications focusing on Big and streaming
    data

    analysis and DL Algorithms with its applications to make smart development, respectively.

    After taking the survey on existing papers, there is still no survey that explores
    a wide range

    of IoT devices thoroughly using DL. We also agree that it is time to review and
    inspire future

    study recommendations in current literature. To this end, this paper summarizes
    current

    research developments and patterns in using DL techniques to promote IoT applications.

    We will demonstrate how using DL to enhance IoT applications can be implemented

    from various perspectives. For example, monitoring of safety, analysis of diseases,
    indoor

    locations, artiﬁcial control, predicting the trafﬁc, residential robots, drive
    automation, fault

    assessment and inspection of manufacturing. The issues, challenges and possible
    research

    directions for DL in IoT applications are also discussed to encourage future developments

    in this promising area and empower them.

    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 includes a variety of
    popular

    and common DNN architectures. This also offers a concise overview of advances
    and

    fast DL architectures along with state-of-the-art DL algorithms. Section 3 will
    review IoT

    applications and challenges in various domains (e.g., education, manufacturing,
    smart city,

    healthcare, and Intelligent Transportation Systems(ITS), agriculture) using DL.
    This article

    concludes in Section 4.

    2. Deep Learning Techniques

    Stakeholders must clearly grasp the meaning, building blocks, potentials and chal-

    lenges of the IoT and its derivatives big data. IoT and Big Data connect in two
    ways; an IoT

    is one of the leading producers and a major target for Big Data research in order
    to enhance

    IoT processes and services [25]. In addition, IoT Big Data Research has shown
    that it gives

    value to society. The IoT data is distinct from the overall big data. We need
    to explore the

    properties of IoT data [26] and how they vary from the traditional big data to
    analyze the

    requirements of IoT data analytics.

    Here, discussing the advantages of DL over conventional methods of ML, which

    highlight the beneﬁts of DL in IoT applications [27,28]. DL has more powerful
    capacity

    to generalize the dynamic relation of vast raw data in different IoT applications
    when

    Electronics 2022, 11, 1604

    4 of 23

    compared with normal ML methods. The ability to process data is generally dependent

    upon the depths and the different architectures of learning models, including
    convolutional

    architectures; thus, in big data, DL models can most likely perform better while
    common

    learning models can easily be over-touched when dealing with a ﬂood of data. Deep

    learning is an end-to-end process that is capable of learning how to derive successful

    features from raw data, without taking time and labor-intensive hand-made applications.

    In recent years, DL models have been more conscious than the other conventional
    ML

    approaches. Figure 2 shows the search pattern in Google trends, in which DL is
    increasingly

    popular amongst other ML algorithms such as random forest, k-means, SVM and decision

    tree. Moreover, as per the Google trend, Figure 3 shows that the CNN method became

    more popular out of all DL methods.

    Figure 2. Google trend shows more interest on DL in recent years.

    Figure 3. Google trend shows more interest on CNN in recent years.

    Deep learning is a recently developed multilayer neural network learning algorithm.

    It has revolutionized the concept of machine learning, propelling artiﬁcial intelligence

    and human–computer interaction forward in leaps and bounds. They have performed
    the

    Electronics 2022, 11, 1604

    5 of 23

    evaluation test for CNN and DBN on the MNIST database and the real-world handwritten

    character database which gave 99.28% and 98.12% accuracy [29]. Despite its complex

    structure and the diversity of registered user data, the researchers [30] work
    here assumes

    the MIA in a semi-white box scenario where system model structures and parameters
    are

    available but no user data information is available, and veriﬁes it as a serious
    threat even

    for a deep-learning-based face recognition system. The impact of power plants
    on GEP

    over their lifetime is studied in this article [31]. Deep learning-based techniques
    are also

    commonly employed for time series forecasting.

    DL contains powerful methods for boosting knowledge which allow a large number

    of unstructured information to be processed [32]. These techniques are ideal for
    managing

    big data and for computer intensive processes such as image pattern recognition,
    voice

    acknowledgment and analysis, etc. DL needs strong computing skills and is known
    to take

    up time in the model training cycle, which has been one of the biggest challenges
    in the past.

    Efﬁcient GPUs are widely used to carry out DL tasks with increased requirements
    for CPU

    capacity. Thus, in the period of big data, DL has become a popular form of data
    processing

    and modeling [27]. In the DL methodology, the number of layers is tight with determined

    characteristics. In DL, the functionality is automatically estimated and feature
    calculation

    and extraction are not required before such a method is applied. In addition,
    the progress

    of DL introduces a wide range of network structures. The goal of the authors [33,34]

    project is to quantify EEG features in order to better understand task-induced
    neurological

    impairments caused by stroke and to assess biomarkers to distinguish between ischemic

    stroke patients and healthy adults.

    In the two phases of training and forecasting, DL models typically offer two major

    improvements over conventional ML approaches [21]. Initially, they minimize the
    need for

    human training and then remove those features that may not be obvious for the
    human

    view [35]. DL methods also improve the accuracy. DL, like traditional ML, can
    be parti-

    tioned into two cases: non-supervised learning (unlabeled data models) and supervised

    learning (labeled data models).

    2.1. Supervised Learning

    The system model for supervised learning is built into a labeled training set.
    The

    backpropagation method is the primary approach used in supervised learning [36].

    2.1.1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

    The RNN is a discriminative categorical method which can process the serial and

    time series data mainly. In several tasks, the estimation relies on many previous
    tests

    in order to evaluate the sequences of inputs, besides the classiﬁcation of individual
    tests.

    A neural feeder network does not apply in such applications because it does not
    rely on

    input and output layers. The RNN data contains the present sample as well as the
    previous

    observed sample as the input. The output at stage m can be affected by the output
    at stage

    m-1. Every neuron has a feedback loop that produces the output to the next step
    as an

    input. This step says that each neuron has an internal memory to store the previous
    level

    data estimates in RNN. We can not use the original back propagation here, despite
    the

    presence of neuronal cycles, because it works depending on loss derivation in
    relation

    to the weight in the previous layer even though we do not have a stacked layer
    model

    in RNNs. The center of Backpropagation Through Time(BPTT) [37] is a technique
    called

    “unrolling the RNN”, so that we build a feeder network over time. Figure 4 depicts
    the

    structure of an RNN and unrolled concept.

    Electronics 2022, 11, 1604

    Figure 4. The Structure of Recurrent Neural Network Model.

    However, due to the diffusion of gradient problems and longer term dependency,

    RNNs are constrained by looking back only a few steps. New methods are proposed,
    such

    as GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) [38], LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) [39], designing

    the hidden state simulation to decide what to hold in past and present memory.
    In order

    to tackle problems sequentially such as text or speech and time-series data problems
    in

    different lengths, RNNs were developed. The RNNs can be applied to processes include

    detecting drivers’ actions in intelligent cars, deﬁning the patterns of movements
    of individ-

    ual persons and estimating household consumption. Consequently, RNN is mainly
    used in

    the ﬁeld of natural language processing (NLP) [40–42]. Table 1 shows the where
    RNN used

    in IoT ﬁelds.

    2.1.2. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

    The LSTM is discriminative method which can work on time-stamp, sequential and

    long time-dependent data. Figure 5 shows the model of LSTM. LSTMs are a form of
    RNN

    that can learn order-dependence in series estimation. LSTM uses its unit gate
    deﬁnition,

    each based on its input calculating a value from 0 to 1. Every neuron having four
    gates to

    maintain the data such as feedback loop, multiplying forget, read and write gates.
    These

    Electronics 2022, 11, 1604

    7 of 23

    gates control the accessing memory cells and preventing distractions by unrelated
    inputs.

    The neuron writes its data into itself when the gate forget is working, otherwise
    it forgets

    its last data by sending a 0. The other neurons that are inter connected will
    write to it and

    read the content of it, when write and read gate is ﬁxed to 1. By knowing what
    LSTM

    data are to be recalled, the stored memory cell computations will not be corrupted
    over

    time. The common way to reduce the error by training network is BPTT. LSTM models
    are

    stronger than RNN models if the data is characterized by a long time dependence
    [38].

    Figure 5. The Structure of Long Short Term Memory Model.

    Generally, LSTM is the expanding model of RNN. Various LSTM methods are pro-

    posed based on the original network [39,56]. LSTMs and standard RNNs were implemented

    for predicting sequence and sequence labeling tasks successfully. These models
    performed

    better than RNNs on context-sensitive(CS) and context free(CF) languages [57].
    For con-

    nected models with small sizes, LSTMs converge rapidly and provide state-of-the-art

    machine translation, voice recognition efﬁciently [58]. LSTM networks are not
    well devel-

    oped for larger networks on one single multi-core computer. Table 2 shows where
    LSTM is

    used in IoT ﬁelds.

    2.1.3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN’s)

    The CNN is a discriminatory method which can used more for identifying images

    and differentiating one from the another. The CNN is made up of an input, an output
    and

    some hidden layers. The sub sample layers, pooling layer, convolutional layers,
    pooling,

    fully connected (FC) or non-linear layers are hidden layers in the architecture
    of CNNs.

    The CNN is the main version of the FCs. All neurons are connected from one layer
    to

    the each and every neuron in the another layer. So, FCs makes them overwrite the
    data.

    Figure 6 depicts the structure of a CNN.

    Figure 6. The Structure of Convolutional Neural Network model.

    DNNs with a dense relation between the layers are difﬁcult to train and do not
    test well

    for vision-based tasks due to the characterization of the translation-invariance
    [77]. These

    problem can be solved by the CNN with the support of the above said property.
    A CNN

    will obtain a 2D input and will extract high quality characters from a range of
    hidden

    layers (e.g., image or speech). The convolution layer is the heart of a CNN which
    contains

    ﬁlters with the same input shape but small size. In order to streamline the underling

    computing, complex networks can involve global or local pooling layers which decrease

    the data dimensions by integrating neuron cluster outputs into one neuron in one
    layer

    in the next. Usually, a RELU layer is the activation function [78,79], accompanied
    by

    additional convolutions such as pooling layers, FC layers and hidden layers since
    the

    activating feature and the ﬁnal convolution cover their inputs and outputs. Table
    3 shows

    where the CNN is used in IoT ﬁelds.

    2.1.4. Transformer-Based Deep Neural Networks

    In the deep learning context, the transformer denotes a sequence-to-sequence archi-

    tecture of neural networks that depend on the self-attention process to capture
    global

    dependencies [112]. It attracted the thoughtfulness of several researchers from
    the ﬁeld

    of natural language processing (NLP) due to the transformer being designed to
    take se-

    quence data as input. One of the most successful transformer-based models which
    achieved

    state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks is Bidirectional Encoder Representations

    from Transformers (BERT) [113]. Recently, the transformer is also charming progressively

    standard in the computer vision community. Image classiﬁcation with the transformer

    that takes patches of images as input was proposed by Dosovitskiy et al. [114].
    One of

    the successful project works carried out for an end-to-end object detection framework

    based on the transformer named it as a detection transformer (DETR) [115]. DETR
    sim-

    pliﬁes the object detection pipeline by dropping multiple hand-designed components

    that encode prior knowledge, such as spatial anchors and non-maximal suppression.
    So,

    the transformer-based deep neural network is also a promising mechanism to handle
    the

    artiﬁcial intelligence tasks such as NLP and computer vision related areas.

    2.2. Unsupervised Learning

    Unsupervised learning must be used as a complement to traditional learning methods

    to deal with massive unlabeled data. Training can be performed using stacked restricted

    Electronics 2022, 11, 1604

    10 of 23

    Boltzmann machines (RBMs) or stacked auto-encoders to initialize, replicate back
    and

    modify globally.

    2.2.1. Autoencoder (AE)

    The AE is a generative method which can be suitable for extracting the features
    and

    reducing the size with same number of input and output units. These input and
    output

    layers are connected with one or more hidden layers. A neuronal network conﬁgured
    to

    copy its input to its output is an auto-encoder [116]. The layer of the code is
    private (hidden)

    to show the input. The layer is made up of two major parts: an encryption encoder
    which

    maps the code input and a decoder which maps the code in order to decrypt the
    original

    input. The auto-encoder is equipped by reducing input-output errors. The AEs are
    used

    mainly for diagnostics and fault identiﬁcation due to their action in creating
    the input at the

    output layer. It will shows many application in IoT. Sparse auto-encoders [117],
    denoising

    auto-encoders [118] and contractive auto-encoders are included in the AE variants.
    Figure 7

    shows a brief architecture of an auto-encoder and a concrete example. Table 4
    shows where

    the AE is used in IoT ﬁelds.

    2.2.2. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)

    The RBM is a generative method which can work on various kinds of data and its
    suit-

    able for classifying data, reducing the dimensionality, extracting features, etc.
    RBMs [128]

    are probabilistic graphic models which can be viewed as deep stochastic networks.
    A Boltz-

    mann version of the RBMs is a constraint on the fact that their neurons can form
    a bipartite

    chart; there can be a symmetrical relation between a pair of nodes in both visible
    and

    hidden groups. However, there is no connection among the nodes in the same group.
    In

    addition, all visible and secret (hidden) neurons are linked to the bias device.
    It may be

    necessary to stock RBMs to make DNNs. They are also the backbone of the networks
    of

    DBNs. DBNs can be built in particular by stacking RBMs and alternatively ﬁne-tuning

    the associated deep gradient descent and backpropagation networks. The goal of
    RBM

    training is to optimize the product for the visible units in all probabilities.
    RBM has a

    similar feature to AEs, which is used to measure the latent parameters, which
    are used in

    turn to reconstruct the data input with the backward stream. Figure 8 shows the
    structure

    of an RBM. Table 5 shows the where RBM used in IoT ﬁelds.

    2.2.3. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)

    The DBN is a generative method which can work on various types of data. DBNs can

    be seen as a combination of basic, unsupervised networks (e.g., RBMs and AEs),
    where a

    hidden layer of each sub-network is used as a visible layer for the next one.
    Such a network

    has connections between the layers, but not inside the layer. DBNs can also be
    trained

    greedily layer by layer. This composition leads to a rapid and unregulated training
    process,

    which is carried out by the “lowest” layers, where contrasting divergence is applied
    in turn

    for each sub-network. The DBN training is performed layer by layer to view each
    layer as

    an RBM trained above the previously trained layer. Hence, DBN can be fast and
    efﬁcient

    in DL methods. The ﬁrst is intended for learning about data processing with unlabeled

    data, and the second attempts to achieve an optimum solution through the harmonization’s

    of DBN with marked data [135]. DBN combines unsupervised training and supervised

    methods to create model designs. Figure 9 shows the structure of a DBN model.
    Table 6

    shows the where the DBN is used in IoT ﬁelds.

    3. IoT Applications and Challenges

    The data analysis leads signiﬁcantly to IoT as discussed in the previous section.
    In this

    section, we ﬁrst review the IoT data features and its applications. Then, we review
    several

    issues (challenges) important for the implementation and development of IoT analysis

    from the point of view of DL.

    3.1. Data Features of IoT

    As data is the basis for the extraction of knowledge, high-quality information
    is

    important. The IoT has many features and is a complex program. The features vary
    from

    domain to domain. Here, some features are discussed.

    Connectivity allows the Internet of Things to bring ordinary objects together.
    Such

    objects are important for their communication since simple interactions of the
    object level

    lead to IoT collective intelligence. With this connection, the networking of smart
    devices

    and applications will build new business opportunities for the IoT. The key operation
    of

    the IoT is the gathering of data from the world, accomplished through the complex
    changes

    across the devices. Dynamically, the state of such devices varies, such as sleep
    and wake up,

    connection and/or disconnection and the contexts of devices such as temperature,
    position

    and speed and also number of machines can change with time, place and person.

    IoT is nothing without sensors which can detect or quantify any changes in the

    environment in order to produce data that can report on their status or even communicate

    with the environment. IoT sensors and machine learning techniques combined have
    taken

    a major role in health informative systems such as discovering heart failure,
    lung infections,

    brain movement and many more [142,143]. The sensing data give a rich view to the

    dynamic world, even though it is basically equivalent to the input from the physical
    world.

    Sensors can be used in many applications including our daily life activities.
    For example,

    an Automatic Aircraft Control System is made up of multiple sensors that are used
    for

    a variety of activities such as speed control, height monitoring, position tracking,
    door

    status, avoid obstacles, fuel level, navigating, and more. A computer analyzes
    the data

    from all of these sensors by comparing it to predetermined values. IoT is smart
    because of

    its group of smart computing methods, software and hardware. Despite smart technology’s

    widespread popularity, IoT intelligence is only concerned with the interaction
    between

    devices while traditional input methods and visual user interface ensure the user
    and

    system interaction. Securing endpoints, networks and data that are passed over
    all of this

    means developing a security framework is critical.

    Several papers deﬁned the overall characteristics of big data in terms of volume,
    speed

    and variety from different aspects [144–146]. However, to characterize the IoT
    big data by

    the following 6V features:

    Electronics 2022, 11, 1604

    14 of 23

    1.

    Volume: In IoT, a billion devices will generate the huge data.

    2.

    Velocity: How the IoT data can be accessed quickly and efﬁciently in real time?

    3.

    Variety: Basically, IoT data is text, video, audio, sensor data, etc. It may be
    structured

    or unstructured data.

    4.

    Veracity: Refers to the accuracy, consistency and trust of data, which leads to
    precise

    analytics in effect.

    5.

    Variability: Basically, Data ﬂow rate depends on IoT applications, generating
    data

    components, time and space.

    6.

    Value: To transform IoT big data into useful information and insights that offer
    many

    advantages to organizations.

    3.2. Deep Learning Using IoT Devices

    The availability of the latest IoT frameworks and their open source libraries
    for con-

    tinuous monitoring, real-time edge-level processing and encrypted storage of generated

    data such as text, tabular data, audio and video leads to enormous increasing
    rate of IoT

    datasets [147]. Such data are produced by diverse hardware systems working in
    outdoor

    and indoor ground-works which includes smart city sensors, smart organization
    ﬁelds,

    AR/VR practice centers, etc. In order to do the training of such large scale high-quality

    IoT datasets that have been collected over a period of time within a reasonable
    amount of

    time, we need a distributed training system which is scalable and efﬁciently utilizes
    the

    hardware resources of millions of IoT devices. Speciﬁcally, such a system environment

    should consider the current network connectivity among these devices, and be able
    to

    work together during training to generate the ﬁnal deep learning (DL) models at
    very high

    speeds for real-time problem-solving [148].

    The authors in [149] proposed distributed training on multiple IoT devices instead
    of

    following the traditional approach that loads such large scale datasets to train
    and build a

    model locally within a data center or GPU cluster. In this method, instead of
    using a GPU

    cluster available within a data center, the DL model trains and builds on the
    hardware

    of millions of medium-sized IoT devices across the context of the infrastructure.
    They

    addressed model convergence of the subsequently generated model and scalability
    of the

    system. The key issues during involvement of the all IoT devices for training
    are privacy to

    the data, time consuming dataset loading I/O, the slow exchange of model gradients
    while

    training, and high computational operations. These are the some of the challenges
    yet to

    address elaborately in order to train and build a DL model using global infrastructure.

    3.3. Applications of IoT

    The IoT application is classiﬁed according to its basic attributes and characteristics.

    Some problems should be taken into consideration for the effective operation of
    IoT data

    analysis. Some of the IoT applications shown in Figure 10. The IoT applications
    may be

    categorized in the following ways:

    1.

    Smart Home: Probably, the ﬁrst application of the IoT is smart home. As per the
    IoT

    analytics, more than 70,000 people are searching about the ‘smart home’ every
    month.

    Many big companies funding the IoT startup for smart home projects. The smart

    home appliances include washing machines, refrigerators, bulbs, fans, televisions,

    smart doors which can built and communicate online each other with approves users

    to provide better monitoring and managing the appliances and also optimizing the

    energy consumption.

    2.

    Smart City: The hypothesis of the optimized trafﬁc system I mentioned earlier,
    is one

    of the many aspects that constitute a smart city. This category is most speciﬁc
    to the

    cities. Mostly, the problems are common in all cities. However, sometimes, they
    may

    vary city to city. Global problems are also emerging in numerous cities, including
    safe

    drinking water, declining air quality and rising urban density. The IoT applications
    in

    city areas are water management, waste management, security, climate monitor,
    trafﬁc

    Electronics 2022, 11, 1604

    15 of 23

    management, etc. We can reduce the noise, pollution, accidents, parking problems,

    street light problems and public transport because of the smart transportation
    in cities.

    3.

    Health care: Relevant real-world knowledge is missing in the tools of modern medical

    science. It uses the remaining data, managed environments and medical examination

    volunteers mainly. By research, real-time ﬁeld data, and testing, IoT opens the
    door to

    a sea of useful data. To improve the health of a patient, new technologies have
    been

    developed using the IoT in the medical ﬁeld [150,151]. The sensors can monitor
    a

    wound’s state, blood pressure, heart rate, sugar and oxygen levels, body temperature,

    etc., without the presence of the doctors and medical practitioners. In the article
    [152],

    physiological signals are instantaneous and sensitive to neurological changes
    caused

    by the cognitive load imposed by diverse driving conditions, and are used to assess

    the relationship between neurological results and driving environments.

    4.

    Security: IoT can improve security everywhere in the world using smart cameras.

    Smart security systems can identify criminals or avoid dangerous situations by
    means

    of real-time digital image recognition. Security is the biggest challenge in the
    IoT ﬁeld.

    5.

    Smart Retail: It is one of the biggest applications in the IoT ﬁeld. Solutions
    for

    tracking goods while they are on the road, or getting suppliers to exchange inventory

    information have been on the market for years. However, it is also limited. The
    use

    of intelligent GPS and RFID technologies makes it easy to track the product between

    the output and the store and greatly reduce costs and time. The applications of

    IoT in retail are tracking location, inventory management, equipment maintenance,

    analyzing mall trafﬁc, etc.

    6.

    Agriculture: Many researchers have already worked in this emerging application
    of

    IoT [153,154]. Through the growing use of the IoT, connected devices have penetrated

    everything from health and well-being to home automation, car and logistics to

    intelligent cities, security, retail and industrial IoT. However, since farming
    operations

    are remote and there are many resources that the IoT can monitored, the way farmers

    operate can be completely changed. Here, the major problem is to change farmers

    to smart farming. They can be beneﬁted in many ways such as checking soil quality,

    weather conditions, cost management, reducing wastage, managing crop etc.

    7.

    Wearables: Now a days, we can see wearables with anyone which can monitor heart

    rate, sugar and oxygen levels, blood pressure, temperature, sleeping status, walk

    distance, etc. Wearable technology is an excellent aspect in IoT applications
    and is

    undoubtedly one of the ﬁrst industries to use IoT.

    8.

    Industrial Automation: Remote access and control are enabled with industrial IoT

    networking, but more signiﬁcantly data extraction, processing, sharing and analysis

    by various data sources. This has tremendous productivity and performance improve-

    ment potential. Their low cost and rapid development characterize the IIoT solutions.

    In order to achieve a better result in cost and customer service, IoT Applications

    can also re-engineer devices and their packages with IoT automation easily. Some

    applications are product ﬂow monitoring, digitization, quality control, safety
    and

    security, package optimization, logistics and supply chain optimization.

    3.4. Challenges

    Data sources are a foundation for the success of DL methods. To apply DL to IoT
    is

    having a problem with the lack of big datasets, to make DL more accurate, we need
    more

    data. Another difﬁculty in IoT applications is to generate raw data in a suitable
    form to

    be fed into DL models. Many DL methods need preprocessing data to get more accurate

    results. For IoT applications, preprocessing is more complex since the system
    deals with

    data from different sources that may have various formats and distributions while
    showing

    missing data. The way data collection systems are applied is really a vital research
    topic.

    The number of sensors working and the way the sensors are deployed have an inﬂuence
    on

    data quality. Even if the model architecture is well built, you must build a data
    collection

    Electronics 2022, 11, 1604

    16 of 23

    module for the entire IoT system layout. It should be more reliable, cost effective
    and

    trustworthy model.

    Security is the biggest challenge in the IoT ﬁled as we collect data from many
    sources.

    In many IoT applications, maintaining data protection and conﬁdentiality is a
    major concern

    as IoT large data is distributed for review through the Internet, making this
    accessible

    worldwide. In several applications, anonymization can be used, but these methods
    can be

    exploited and re-identiﬁed as anonymized data. DL models are learning the characteristics

    of raw data and thus can beneﬁt from any invalid data stream. Here, DL models
    must be

    updated using certain methods for ﬁnding irregular or invalid data.

    Figure 10. IoT Applications.

    For IoT system designers, designing DL is a great challenge to meet the needs
    of man-

    aging DNNs on resource-restricted devices. This is expected to increase as the
    dimensions

    of the datasets expand daily and new algorithms are included in DL’s IoT solutions.
    DL

    also has many limitations. The authors [155] published on DDN’s false faith in
    human-

    recognizable images. The other drawback is that DL models concentrate on classiﬁcation,

    while other IoT applications have a sort of regression in their analysis core.
    Few researchers

    attempted to introduce regression capabilities to DNNs, for example, in [156]
    proposing

    the DBN and Support Vector Regression (SVR) ensemble.

    Off-road vehicles’ digital monitoring is hampered by their sophisticated and pricey

    IoT sensor technologies. In remote off-network locations, the high reliance on
    cloud/fog

    compute, network availability, and expert knowledge make it a handicap. The answer
    that

    has yet to be commercialized is the use of edge devices, such as smartphones,
    with compu-

    tation capability. The researchers offer a hybridized computational intelligence
    technique

    for developing an edge-device-enabled AI system for off-road vehicle health monitoring

    and diagnosis (HM&D) using super-cheap microphones as sensors [157]. The authors

    have shown their results as the taxonomy clearly demonstrates how an EC method
    may be

    utilized to improve and optimize DL. Furthermore, this survey addresses potential
    research

    avenues that could lead to the development of EDL in the future [158] .

    Deep learning is a strong tool to process IoT big data and thus requires high-level

    hardware requirements. The design of a DL model of an embedded system with limitations

    on resources remains a challenge. We may get network failure, data disclosure
    while

    collecting and transferring data to the servers and analyzed. A movement to develop
    a

    cloud-based learning framework that includes leading devices and the cloud is
    emerging.

    A cloud-based device will use the edge to reduce delay, maximize safety and protection

    Electronics 2022, 11, 1604

    17 of 23

    and use smart techniques for data retention [159]. It can also use the cloud to
    exchange

    data around cutting edges and to train high-quality computational models [160].

    4. Conclusions

    In this paper, a review has been presented on the DL and IoT techniques exploited

    in various domains such as smart home, smart city, smart transport, energy, localization,

    health sector, security, agriculture, etc. In recent years, DL and IoT have attracted
    the

    attention of researchers and business units, both of which have shown their positive
    impact

    on our life, cities, and the earth. Many IoT applications are obviously supported
    by DL

    resources. DL models are effective methods for solving large-scale problems with
    data

    analysis. We addressed the issue of training and building the DL model using large
    scale

    datasets which are being produced at ever increasing rates due to the availability
    of the

    latest IoT frameworks and open source libraries to collect the same. The literature
    suggested

    that using distributed IoT devices themselves for training a model is better than
    centralized

    cluster-like infrastructure. However, distributed approach needs to address the
    challenges

    such as data privacy, time consuming for IO operations and high complex operations.
    We

    reviewed the latest research on how supervised (RNN, LSTM, Transformer-based deep

    neural networks and CNN) and unsupervised (AE, RBM and DBN) can create a profound

    DL model for IoT applications. Deep learning ensures that attempts to construct
    speciﬁc

    characteristics are futile. In addition, the major advances in various domains
    have been

    made with IoT and DL, while a further development is expected in the next few
    years.

    Moreover, how to design a highly accurate and resource-efﬁcient architecture remains
    a

    challenge, and exploration of this area has not yet ended.

    Accesses 58 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT)
    is driving the digital revolution. AlSome palliative measures aremost all economic
    sectors are becoming “Smart” thanks to the analysis of data generated by IoT.
    This analysis is carried out by advance artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    that provide insights never before imagined. The combination of both IoT and AI
    is giving rise to an emerging trend, called AIoT, which is opening up new paths
    to bring digitization into the new era. However, there is still a big gap between
    AI and IoT, which is basically in the computational power required by the former
    and the lack of computational resources offered by the latter. This is particularly
    true in rural IoT environments where the lack of connectivity (or low-bandwidth
    connections) and power supply forces the search for “efficient” alternatives to
    provide computational resources to IoT infrastructures without increasing power
    consumption. In this paper, we explore edge computing as a solution for bridging
    the gaps between AI and IoT in rural environment. We evaluate the training and
    inference stages of a deep-learning-based precision agriculture application for
    frost prediction in modern Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier in terms of performance and
    power consumption. Our experimental results reveal that cloud approaches are still
    a long way off in terms of performance, but the inclusion of GPUs in edge devices
    offers new opportunities for those scenarios where connectivity is still a challenge.

    15 February 2024 1 Introduction Smart agriculture is an emerging field where the
    concepts, techniques and systems of Industry 4.0 are applied to the agrarian world
    [10]. The combination of both IoT and AI provides sustainable procedures to optimize
    crops, reduce the use of pesticides, optimize irrigation and, in general, avoid
    the most egregious problems in agricultural processes [6, 28, 29, 38]. Of particular
    interest to us is the prevention of frost. In Mediterranean areas, low temperatures
    at certain times of the agricultural cycle are a major problem that can result
    in losses of millions of euros. 1 However, it is not an easy task as it depends
    on several factors, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. [30], but
    also on the particular location of the plot. Actually, the global weather forecast
    provides coarse grain information which is not valid to predict frost at the plot
    level. Some palliative measures are available to avoid crop loss, such as connecting
    windmills and stoves or connecting heating in a greenhouse to avoid crop losses.
    However, these measures need to be activated some time in advance, between 2 and
    4 h, to be really effective. Therefore, this is a scenario where both accuracy
    and performance are equally critical. A false positive, i.e., the application
    predicts a frost but eventually does not occur, means an economic and environmental
    impact, as these techniques are often too costly in both terms. A false negative,
    i.e., the application does not predict a frost but eventually occurs, can mean
    the loss of the crop which usually has dramatic consequences. Equally important
    is to predict the frost early enough in order to be able to take palliative actions,
    because otherwise, the consequences would be the same. Deep Learning is a area
    within machine learning which relies on a set of artificial neural networks organized
    as complex hierarchical levels [11]. Deep learning models are applied in agriculture
    to deal with problems such as the automatic identification of plant disease through
    images or yield predictions in crops [19]. In the field of deep learning, Long
    short-term memory (LSTM) [18] is a recurrent neural network (RNN), first proposed
    by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, which has feedback connections. LSTM goes beyond
    processing single data points such as images, but also entire sequences of data
    such as speech, video or time-series data in general. Thus, they are well suited
    to classifying, processing and making predictions based on data capture from IoT
    infrastructures [26]. In our previous work, an IoT system was proposed to obtain
    fine-grained information from a particular plot area [15] and some prepossessing
    tasks were carried out to remove outliers and out-of-range values. Moreover, we
    develop a deep learning model for the frost prediction based on a long short-term
    memory (LSTM) with satisfactory accuracy results, i.e., an average quadratic error
    of less than a Celsius degree and a determination coefficient \(R^{2}\) greater
    than 0.95 [14]. However, the computational cost of this model was too high and
    therefore it should be executed offline. This limits the success of this technique
    of because several reasons. The IoT infrastructure should be connected to the
    Internet with high-speed connection or, at least, with a minimum number of cloud
    outages. This is actually not the scenario in rural areas where IoT infrastructures
    are often found in inhospitable conditions, where high temperatures, lack of connectivity
    and security are just a few examples that limit the existence of responsive Web
    services. With a low-bandwidth connection plus the training and inference time
    of the LSTM model in the cloud, the maximum prediction window allowed for decision
    making (i.e., 2–3 h) would be difficult to achieve. Edge computing [32] is an
    emerging area where processing in close proximity to mobile devices or sensors
    may provide energy savings, highly responsive Web services for mobile computing,
    scalability and privacy-policy enforcement for the Internet of Things, as well
    as the ability to mask transient cloud outages. Indeed, edge computing platforms
    are designed to be energy efficient and therefore performance is not their primary
    objective. Some computing platforms are emerging to enable edge computing with
    a reduced power budget and ever-increasing performance. Among them, we may highlight
    Nvidia Jetson family which can run between 7.5 and 10 W of power, offering a good
    performance ratio [17]. In this article, we provide a performance and energy evaluation
    of edge vs. cloud computing platforms for a LSTM deep learning model to predict
    the possibility of frost in crops, taking as input data captured from an IoT system.
    The main contributions of this paper include the following: 1. The LSTM model
    for frost prediction previously published in [14] has been adapted to be executed
    on high-end and low-power GPUs. 2. CPU and GPU code is evaluated in terms of performance
    and power on the Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier to find out whether the inclusion of
    GPUs on the edge devices is a compelling alternative for running heavy workloads
    like the LSTM model. The GPU-based code of out LSTM model shows 1.6x speedup factor
    compared to multicore counterpart version. 3. We also compare the edge solution
    with its cloud-based counterpart for both stages: training and inference, showing
    that Nvidia Jetson may offer enough computational horsepower to create an autonomous
    decision support systems for frost prediction. Training could be developed during
    the warmest part of the day when frost is unlikely to occur and inference can
    be made from midday. 4. The quality of the results obtained is also evaluated
    to ensure that our version of the GPU draws similar conclusions to its CPU counterpart.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 shows the necessary
    background to better understand our proposal. Section 3 introduces the deep learning
    model based on LSTM to predict temperature. Section 4 includes the empirical results
    in which both quality and performance evaluations are presented. Section 5 summarizes
    the conclusions and gives some directions for future work. 2 Background 2.1 Edge
    versus cloud computing Since the early days, computing has alternated between
    centralization and decentralization. At the beginning, batch processing and time-sharing
    prevailed in a centralized fashion. With the advent of personal computing in the
    1980s, we then move to a decentralized approach that was centralized again in
    the mid-2000s through the cloud. Nowadays, cloud computing is established as the
    most obvious infrastructure to leverage from a mobile device. However, the optimal
    cloud infrastructure may be too far away from the mobile device. Li et al. show
    the average round trip time from 260 global vantage points to their optimal Amazon
    EC2 instances was 74 ms [24]. In addition, the latency of the wireless first hop
    should be added. Therefore, in some emergent applications, this latency is not
    tolerable and some authors pointed out the necessity of moving again toward distribution.
    Satyanarayanan et al. [32] propose two-level architecture to look for mobile applications''
    interactive performance. The first level was the unmodified cloud computing architecture,
    and a second level was a network of dispersed elements called cloudlets with state
    cached from the first level [33]. Moreover, Bonomi et al, motivated by IoT infrastructure
    scalability instead, introduced the term fog computing that consists again of
    a multilevel hierarchy of fog nodes spanning from the cloud to IoT edge devices
    [4]. As stated in [32], the proximity of cloudlets (or fog nodes) provides different
    benefits but of particular interest to us are two of them: 1. Highly responsive
    cloud services, achieving low end-to-end latency, high bandwidth and low jitter
    to services located on the edge. Edge computing brings, through cloudlets, computational
    power within one wireless hop of sensors or mobile devices. Indeed, applications
    that are both latency-sensitive and computation-intensive would not become possible
    without this technology. Interactive mobile applications such as virtual or augmented
    are leading examples. 2. Scalability via edge analytics, lowering the bandwidth
    required by high-data-rate IoT sensors processing applications. Reducing the amount
    of information to be transferred to the cloud through a data analytics on the
    edge may avoid network overloading and may provide energy saves. A leading example
    of this is GigaSight framework [35] where video from mobile devices only goes
    to the nearby cloudlet. The cloudlet runs computer vision application and sends
    the results and some metadata to the cloud, reducing drastically the application
    bandwidth. Edge computing is a compelling alternative to enable smart environments
    in agriculture ubiquitously. Actually, agriculture procedures are usually developed
    in rural areas where several technological challenges often cohabit. Among them,
    we may highlight technical issues such as bandwidth, connectivity, power supply
    and scaling sensors but also environmental issues that complicate the deployment
    of IoT, such as extreme weather conditions. Some recent works have carried out
    studies considering edge computing for smart agriculture or farming. For instance,
    Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [36] proposes a platform to deal with soilless culture
    needs in full recirculation greenhouses using moderately saline water. Edge computing
    here is in charge of monitoring and managing main PA tasks near the access network
    to increase system reliability against network access failures. However, they
    do not introduce computationally heavy workloads such as deep learning models
    at this level as they require higher computational horsepower. Singh, Chana and
    Buya propose Agri-Info, a cloud-based autonomic system for delivering agriculture
    as a service. They do provide intelligent procedures to diagnose the agriculture
    status automatically using fuzzy logic but they execute so in the cloud, offering
    a mobile interface to see the output. Indeed, this is a good approach as long
    as high connectivity is guaranteed. Moreover, they do not use information from
    the ground; they use expert knowledge taken from their mobile or tablets where
    connectivity is somehow guaranteed. Finally, a survey on the role of IoT in agriculture
    for the implementation of smart farming is provided in [9]. They clearly state
    that IoT-based solutions are at the forefront of automatically maintaining and
    monitoring agricultural farms with minimal human involvement. Indeed, this requires
    the involvement of AI models that can provide predictions in real time. 2.2 Deep
    learning in precision agriculture Deep learning is made up of a set of techniques
    that allow the construction of models with great potential and outstanding results
    [19]. Recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures have been widely applied for
    regression [20]. RNNs are a type of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in which
    connections between nodes create a graph directed over a time sequence, allowing
    to have a temporal dynamic behavior. The main difference between RNNs and other
    ANNs architectures is that they use their internal state (memory) to process input
    sequences. RNNs work well in problems with short-term dependencies where the model
    only needs to look at recent (or close) information to carry out the current task
    [12]. However, there are some problems that require less recent or more distant
    information to perform the current task. This is called long-term dependency,
    and RNNs do not work well in such scenarios. The long short-term memory (LSTM)
    is type of RNNs, which is designed to deal with long-term dependencies such as
    those within time series based on learning from previous observations to predict
    the next value in the sequence [18]. While Standard RNNs are based on chain of
    very simple ANNs, such as a single tanh layer, LSTMs are also based on chain of
    ANNs, but the ANNs has a different structure. Deep learning models have drastically
    improved the state of the art in many sectors of industry including agriculture
    [25]. In the field of agriculture, different deep learning techniques (mainly
    convolutional neural networks for image classification and LSTM for the prediction
    of temporal variables) are applied to multiple problems such as plant diseases
    [27], the classification of plant species [13], identification of soil cover and
    classification of crop type [22], estimation of yields [23], identification of
    weeds [3], predictions on climatology [31], just to mention a few recent studies
    within the umbrella of precision agriculture. Focusing on the problem of climatology,
    some works have been published for climatic prediction, showing very good results.
    For instance, Salman et al. [31] propose the construction of a robust statistical
    model to predict meteorological visibility based on other intermediate variables
    (temperature, pressure, humidity and dew point). They use two- and four-layer
    LSTM networks. The data are normalized and rescaled in the range of [0, 1] and
    using a moving average. Here, the multilayered LSTM model was most effective.
    However, this work was not applied to precision agriculture but for forecasting
    visibility based on temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point in airport area
    context. LSTM was also used to predict climate variables in [37]. The targeted
    variables used as an input were temperature, humidity and wind speed. In this
    case, the network architecture consists of two LSTM layers with the activation
    function being the RELU and the optimizer RMSProp. The data were also normalized
    and rescaled in the range of [\(-1\), 1]. The results were generated for a coarse-grained
    prediction in cities. Again, it is not applied to precision agriculture context
    and therefore data were obtained for historical datasets instead of real-time
    information like us. Kratzert et al. [21] proposed a model for rain and runoff
    also using LSTM, which predicts discharge for a variety of watersheds. The authors
    demonstrate the potential of this method by using some variables such as day length,
    rainfall, temperature or humidity. Here, the LSTM is composed of two LSTM layers,
    and between them is a dropout layer to avoid overtraining of the network but in
    the context of water management scheduling not in precision agriculture. Finally,
    we have explored the bibliography of combining deep learning methods with edge
    computing architectures. Chen et al. [7] propose ThriftyEdge, a resource-efficient
    edge computing for intelligent IoT applications, and one of the case studies is
    precision agriculture. However, this work is not tailored to deep learning-based
    applications. Boubin et al. [5] explore fully autonomous precision agriculture
    where fully autonomous aerial systems (FAAS) map crop fields frequently. They
    develop the full-stack architecture, including a software driven by reinforcement
    learning and ensemble models. The early results presented in this paper do not
    show any relevant results in the field of edge computing. Actually, they work
    at simulation level, running their experiments in a Laptop. Finally, we refer
    the reader to [39] for a review in Edge Intelligence, where efforts for bridging
    the gaps between deep learning and edge computing are summarized. Even though
    the area of precision agriculture is cited as one of the main domains for edge
    intelligence, it is worth highlighting that any work is cited for this domain.
    3 LSTM model for temperature prediction on IoT infrastructures This section introduces
    the proposed LSTM model for the temperature prediction in IoT infrastructures.
    First of all, we briefly introduce the IoT infrastructure to capture information
    from a plot that was previously introduced in [15]. Next, the proposed LSTM model
    for the prediction of temperature is explained in depth. Fig. 1 IoT system architecture
    Full size image 3.1 The IoT infrastructure Figure 1 shows the IoT architecture
    previously presented in [15]. This infrastructure is deployed in two different
    crops at Murcia (South East Spain). The system monitors the hydro-climatological
    information of a plot, and depending on the data and models developed, the system
    can alert farmers to take appropriate action if necessary. The infrastructure
    is based on three main components: (1) hydro-climatological sensors, (2) an intelligent
    data processing system and (3) a monitoring component. The intelligent data processing
    system only performs a preprocessing of outliers values to avoid showing incorrect
    values to the farmer. In this article, we are evaluating the possibility of introducing
    the computation of intelligent algorithm at the edge of the network. Therefore,
    the intelligent data processing system would be physically at the edge or in the
    cloud, depending on the requirements set by the users. The algorithm will allow
    farmers to obtain a temperature prediction in real time at their plots. The workflow
    begins at the sensor level in which the climate data are captured. The sensor
    network is the 4H remote control system of Hidroconta. 2 Figure 2 shows the IoT
    node composed of temperature, humidity and wind speed sensors. They are connected
    to the analog inputs available on the IoT node. In our case, we only use the information
    provided by the temperature sensor. Sensors provide information every 10 min.
    Fig. 2 IoT node (we refer the reader to [15] for insights) Full size image The
    IoT node has connectivity capabilities. For this study, there are three IoT nodes
    where one of them is acting as a gateway to send data to the cloud via GPRS connection.
    The slave nodes are connected to the gateway using LoRa technology. 3 Moreover,
    all of them have a 6 volts (V) and 12 amp (A) battery and a 12V and 5 watts solar
    panel. Finally, each IoT node has a microcontroller with 256 KB of firmware storage
    and 96 KB of volatile memory for data, and it is able to store up to 20.000 records.
    Therefore, the IoT nodes store the information in their internal memory for fault
    tolerance. Fig. 3 Two computing models are presented; a a cloud-based approach
    where the computation is carried out in the backend and b an edge computing approach
    where the computation is carried out in the IoT node Full size image Figure 3
    shows the different computing schemes under evaluation for air temperature prediction
    using LSTM deep learning model. On the one hand, a centralized computing system
    has been used where the IoT nodes have sent the temperature by means of GPRS to
    the centralized module, in which an outliers cleaning has been carried out to
    be able to estimate the temperature using the LSTM. Also, this module allows to
    visualize the data (3a). The second scheme presents the computational component
    within the IoT module. In this way, the LSTM is executed locally, which allows
    temperature prediction without the need to send the information to a centralized
    module. Finally, the prediction is sent by GPRS to a module that allows data to
    be displayed (3b). 3.2 The LSTM model for temperature prediction Analysis of sensor
    data from IoT infrastructures as the one described above can provide valuable
    information for creating new applications to deal with the emergent problems that
    are currently unsolved. We are particularly interested in air temperature modeling
    for early identification of frost on crops. In our previous work, we designed
    a deep learning model, which offered very good results in the prediction of this
    variable. In what follows, we introduce this model and refer the reader to [14]
    for insights. In the Mediterranean area, there is a large diurnal temperature
    variation, which implies that the data time series of air temperature is nonlinear,
    containing sensitive information, making very difficult to predict with traditional
    autoregressive (AR) models such as ARIMA [2]. As previously explained in Sect.
    2, the LSTM is type of RNNs which is designed to deal with long-term dependencies,
    and therefore, it has shown very good results for predicting values in time series.
    LSTM is usually composed of four layers, interacting in several ways, and the
    key idea of LSTMs is the cell state which is basically like a conveyor belt. The
    information runs through the entire chain, with only some minor linear interactions.
    The LSTM can add or remove information to the cell state through the Gates. They
    are an optional way to let information pass and are based on a sigmoid neural
    network layer and a point multiplication operation. The sigmoid layer produces
    numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component must pass.
    An LSTM has three of these gates in order to protect and control the cell state.
    Figure 4 shows the interaction of the three gates in detail, as well as how the
    LSTM modules exchanges information with each other. An LSTM module receives the
    temperature at time t as input, which is processed together with the temperature
    prediction at time \(t-1\), received from the previous LSTM module. Both temperatures
    are processed and sent to the next module, which also receives the temperature
    at \(t+1\). As an example, let us assume that the LSTM receives the temperature
    at the instant t, where \(t=3.41\,^\circ \)C. After processing this temperature,
    which is now considered as the previous temperature (\({t-1}\)), it returns as
    output the temperature at the instant \(t+1\), let us assume the temperature \({t+1}\)
    = 3.05 °C, that is, the output of the temperature for the next 10 min interval
    would be 3.05 °C. Fig. 4 LSTM scheme developed to deal with the frost prediction.
    Each LSTM module interacts with the previous and subsequent one. The schema shows
    the three gates that compose each LSTM module, which allow it to remember or delete
    the information that passes through them Full size image The first step in our
    LSTM is to decide the input layer. This is an importance decision as it decides
    what information goes through the cell state. In our case, it is a sigmoid layer,
    which receives as input the air temperature taken from the sensors (see Fig. 3a).
    Moreover, a hidden stacked LSTM layer that is made by LSTM blocks contains four
    interacting layers. These four neuronal layers are made up of three sigmoids and
    a hyperbolic tangent, which have been tested from 50 to 200 neurons. So in each
    step, the LSTM block has to decide what information will be stored in the state
    of the cell. To do this, the two types of neural networks work differently: the
    neural layers with sigmoids decide which values of air temperatures have to be
    updated, while the neuronal layer of the hyperbolic tangent creates a vector of
    new values of candidate air temperatures that could be added to the state. The
    two processes are combined to create a status update. Finally, the output layer
    gives the predicted air temperature based on previous air temperatures. The parameters
    used have been optimized, such as learning factor (0.001), optimizer (Adam), activation
    function (hyperbolic tangent), etc. A more detailed explanation of the parameters
    (batch size, number of epochs, number of delay sequences...) used for the experiments
    is shown in Sect. 4.1.1. 3.3 CPU and GPU implementation Two different implementations
    of the LSTM model previously described have been developed for this article. Both
    of them are based on Keras (version 2.2.4) [16]. Keras is a Python-based open-source
    neural network library, which is capable of running on top of many neural network
    frameworks such as Tensorflow [1] or CNTK [34], just to mention a few. Keras contains
    implementations of commonly used neural networks, including convolutional and
    RNN neural networks. Moreover, it includes the main building blocks such as objectives,
    optimizers, layers, activation functions. Algorithm 1 shows the code baselines
    of our LSTM implementation. First, we create the model as a linear stack of layers
    with the sequential function from Keras. Then, different layers are added to the
    model, depending on an input parameter which is actually defined by the user.
    The influence of this parameter in terms of performance will be studied in Sect.
    4.2. Moreover, the code is able to decide wheather the user wants to build the
    model on GPU through cuDNNLSTM or on CPU through LSTM. cuDNNLSTM is a Keras function
    which offers fast LSTM implementation with CuDNN [8]. It can only be run on Nvidia
    GPU, with the TensorFlow backend. cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives
    for deep neural networks created by Nvidia. It provides GPU counterpart versions
    for standard routines such as forward and backward convolution, pooling, normalization
    and activation layers. LSTM function is the standard LSTM model defined by Hochreiter
    [18]. Finally, once the model has defined your model, it is compiled with compile
    function. This creates the structures previously defined by the underlying backend
    (in our case TensorFlow 10.11.1) in order to efficiently execute your model during
    training. 4 Results and discussion This section introduces the performance, energy
    and quality evaluation of our LSTM model as applied to predict the air temperature
    of a particular plot in an IoT infrastructure with edge computing capabilities.
    First of all, the experimental environment is described, providing the main metrics,
    hardware and software environment and datasets used in the experiments shown below.
    Then, the execution time and power consumption of the edge computing platform
    and the high-performance server are shown and discussed in detail before the quality
    evaluation of the LSTM to predict air temperature is provided. 4.1 Experimental
    setup 4.1.1 Metrics The performance and energy evaluations are carried out by
    varying the most relevant parameters of the LSTM model, i.e., number of epochs
    and number of neurons. Moreover, this study analyzes the two main stages of this
    model, i.e., training and inference, which are carried out in both an edge computing
    platform (Nvidia Jetson Xavier) and a high-performance computing server. Energy
    of the system is measured by polling once every second the power supply of the
    Jetson architecture with the Watts Up Pro power meter, which provides individual
    energy measurements for the server connected to it, and therefore, energy measurements
    refer to the entire node executing the LSTM model. As for the quality of the results,
    the prediction of temperature is a regression task and the metric measures used
    to assess the quality of the results obtained with the LSTM model are the root
    mean quadratic error, the mean absolute error (MAE), the Pearson correlation coefficient
    (PCC) and determination coefficient (R\(^2\)). The results are positive when the
    RMSE and MAE measurements are less than one degree Celsius and PCC, and the closer
    to one \(R^2\) is, the more acceptable and suitable the model is. For both experiments,
    95% of the data are used to train the model and 5% of the data are used to perform
    the inference task. The optimum parameters used for the experiments are shown
    in Table 1. Parameters that do not influence the computational performance of
    the LSTM have been validated in previous experiments. Table 1 LSTM parameters
    used for the different proposed experiments Full size table 4.1.2 Datasets Table
    2 Each row’s format collected every 10 min. 6 per hour. 144 per day Full size
    table The dataset to evaluate the LSTM model is obtained from the IoT system previously
    described in Sect. 3.1. Table 2 shows an example of the data collected by this
    architecture. The IoT infrastructure generates 144 rows per day (i.e., 1 row each
    10 min), and the data layout is as follows: Date: in dd/mm/aaaa format. Hour:
    in hh:mm format. Air temperature: decimal number in Celsius degrees. Wind speed:
    decimal number in m/s. Relative air humidity: decimal number in %. Our LSTM model
    only works with air temperature, which is collected every 10 min. For the experimental
    environment, four different datasets have been created to test scalability of
    edge and cloud solutions. They include a number of air temperature measurements
    from different periods, including 3,6,12 and 18 months, respectively (see Table
    3). Table 3 Description of the datasets used in the experiments. It shows the
    number of instances, the start and end date period of the air temperature data
    Full size table 4.1.3 Hardware and software environment Experiments have been
    carried out in two different GPU-based platforms: The former is the edge computing
    like architecture Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit. It has four-core ARM v8.0 64-bit
    CPU, 8MB L2 + 4MB L3, 512-core Volta GPU with Tensor Cores and 16GB 256-Bit LPDDR4x
    running at 137GB/sec. The latter is called HETEROLISTIC, and it is composed of
    two hexa-core Intel Xeon E5-2650 at 2.20 GHz, 128 GB of RAM, private L1 and L2
    caches of 32 KB and 256 KB per node, and a L3 cache of 32 MB shared by all the
    cores of a socket. It includes an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti(Pascal), with 12 GB and 3584
    cores (28 SM and 128 SP per SM). The software environment is based on gcc 7.4.0
    and cuda 10 and Python 3.6.5. The design of our LSTM model is based on Tensorflow
    1.10.1 and Keras 2.2.4. 4.2 Evaluation Fig. 5 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM
    training stage with multicore CPU and GPU on AGX Xavier, varying the number of
    epochs for training. The training is carried out with information of 3 months
    with 150 neurons Full size image Fig. 6 Energy (in KWh) on AGX Xavier of LSTM
    training stage with multicore CPU and GPU on AGX Xavier, varying the number of
    epochs for training. The training is carried out with information of 3 months
    with 150 neurons Full size image One of the main goals of this paper is to validate
    edge computing for complex tasks such as those under the umbrella of deep learning.
    Computational devices at the edge are traditionally low power and therefore have
    limited computational horsepower. Recently, more powerful edge computing devices
    have emerged, such as those from the Nvidia Jetson family, which include an accelerator
    to speed up parts of the code. Figure 5 shows the performance difference between
    a GPU-based code of our LSTM model compared to multithreaded CPU counterpart version,
    executed in the Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier for the training stage and varying the
    number of epochs. Although the GPU architecture included in Xavier only includes
    a multiprocessor with 512 cores, more than 1.6x speedup factor is reported. Moreover,
    Fig. 6 shows the energy in KWh of the two implementations. Xavier’s power consumption
    is higher when the GPU is enabled. Actually, the Xavier consumes 10W when the
    GPU code is running and only 8W when only CPU code does. However, the performance
    difference between these codes makes the GPU code more efficient compared to the
    CPU code in terms of energy consumption. Fig. 7 Execution time (in seconds) of
    LSTM training stage, varying the number of epochs for training. The training is
    carried out with information of 3 and 6 months with 150 neurons Full size image
    Fig. 8 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM inference stage, varying the number
    of epochs for training. The inference is carried out with information of 3 and
    6 months with 150 neurons Full size image Figures 7 and 8 show the execution time
    of the proposed LSTM model to predict the temperature of a plot. Experiments are
    carried with the GPU version of the LSTM model on the edge computing platform
    Jetson AGX Xavier and the high-performance computing server HETEROLISTIC. Two
    performance figures are provided for main stages of the LSTM model, i.e., training
    and inference, and in both scenarios, HETEROLISTIC is defeated by a wide-margin
    Jetson Xavier (peak performance difference of 3.5x speed-up factor). However,
    the magnitude of the execution time for each of these stages is very different.
    Computationally speaking, the training process is more time-consuming than the
    inference process; a difference reaches up to five orders of magnitude, and thus
    different conclusions can be drawn. As previously explained, the LSTM is designed
    to be a part of intelligent component of an IoT infrastructure. The IoT infrastructure
    sends information periodically every 10 min, and therefore, this is time limit
    for making instantaneous predictions. Otherwise, the prediction will become obsolete,
    and the farmer would not be able to take actions before a temperature drops. Therefore,
    the execution time obtained for inference in Xavier is valid for performing instantaneous
    prediction on edge computing. There are scenarios where the deadline to obtain
    the prediction is, at least, 12 h or even more. This is the case of frost prediction
    in places where there is a large diurnal temperature variation as it is the targeted
    region (South East, Spain). Frost prediction is a scenario where the farmer needs
    to know the prediction several hours in advance to activate the antifreeze mechanisms.
    In addition, climate change makes the weather even more unpredictable and changing.
    Therefore, the deep learning models need to be retrained periodically. Execution
    time for the training stage for 3000 epochs and 6-month dataset is less than 12
    h (i.e., 11.01 h) in the case of Jetson Xavier, which is actually the worst of
    the cases presented in Figs. 7 and 8. The execution time is drastically reduced
    when the dataset size and the number of epochs are reduced. For instance, it takes
    less than 6 h to train with 3-month dataset, running 3000 epochs and less than
    1 h if the training is performed with 3-month dataset and 200 epochs. Therefore,
    Jetson Xavier can offer great performance to enable an autonomous decision support
    system for frost prediction, in which both training and inference are performed
    at the edge. Fig. 9 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM training stage, varying
    the number of epochs for training. The training is carried out with information
    of 12 and 18 months Full size image Fig. 10 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM
    inference stage, varying the number of epochs for training. The inference is carried
    out with information of 12 and 18 months Full size image Figures 9 and 10 show
    large-scale (12- and 18-month datasets) training and inference on both Jetson
    Xavier and HETEROLISTIC. The training execution time grows exponentially along
    with the number of epochs, and inference stays flat. Table 4 Execution time (in
    seconds) of LSTM training and inference stages, varying the number of neurons
    for training and setting the number of epochs to 2500 Full size table Finally,
    Table 4 shows the scalability of the LSTM when the number of neurons increases,
    setting the number of epochs to 2500. The execution time is not affected too much
    by increasing the number of neurons. The usage of GPUs allows high-performance
    data training of the LSTM on both architectures. 4.3 Quality evaluation This section
    shows the results obtained from the LSTM model designed to predict the temperature
    from IoT information. First, we show and analyze the results of the three cross-validations
    and then we show the results of the test of 95% for training and 5% for testing
    (considering 24 consecutive hours). Table 5 Quality results for 3-month, 6-month
    and 12-month datasets varying the number of epochs. RMSE (root-mean-square error),
    MAE (mean absolute error), PCC (Pearson correlation coefficient) and \(R^2\) (determination
    coefficient) Full size table After analyzing the results of the computational
    performance of the models in their training phase and given the high computational
    cost with the 18-month datasets, we have only analyzed the quality of the results
    for the 3-, 6- and 12-month datasets, since the time of 18 months was excessive,
    even the time for the 12-month datasets is considered excessive for an autonomous
    system, but we have considered it necessary to study the quality of the results,
    in case the prediction results were very remarkable. Table 5 shows the error after
    model inference by setting the number of neurons to 150 and varying the number
    of epochs for 3-, 6- and 12-month datasets. The most suitable models are those
    obtained by the 3-month dataset, whose value of \(R^2\) is 99%. For datasets of
    6 and 12 months, the value is also acceptable but it is much better that of the
    3-month dataset. Regarding the error, both RMSE and MAE, there is a remarkable
    fact and it is the increase above a Celsius degree of the 6-month dataset. This
    error increase is due to the fact that the datasets include summer months, which
    causes the model to have noise since the objective is to predict low temperatures.
    As can be seen, this error decreases for the 12-month dataset. Analyzing in depth
    the results, we see how the smallest error and the most adjusted model are produced
    with 3000-epoch configuration. Nevertheless, looking at the difference in time
    in the experiment of computational performance between the configurations of 2500
    and 3000 epochs, we have an hour of difference, being slower the training with
    3000 epochs. Studying the difference of error between 2500 and 3000 epochs with
    the increase of 1 h, we consider more satisfactory considering performance vs.
    quality the result obtained with 2500 epochs. The two best results are highlighted
    in Table 5. Once the quality of the results has been studied after varying the
    number of epochs, Table 6 analyzes the quality of the model by varying the number
    of input neurons to the model between 50 and 200. This is done for 3-, 6- and
    12-month datasets. The behavior obtained is similar to the variation in the number
    of epochs. The 6-month dataset obtains a greater error than the 3-month and 12-month
    datasets. The most suitable model taking into account the determination coefficient
    \(R^2\) is the 3-month dataset with 150 neurons. Already with 200 neurons, the
    model starts with overlearning and the error increases slightly. Table 6 Quality
    results for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month datasets, varying the number of neurons.
    RMSE (root-mean-square error), MAE (mean absolute error), PCC (Pearson correlation
    coefficient) and \(R^2\)(determination coefficient) Full size table Therefore,
    in view of the results, we can conclude that the data indicate that it is possible
    to run the prediction model of the LSTM at the edge, since with a training of
    5 h, there is enough time between frost and frost, even if these occur on consecutive
    days. The most optimal configuration found is to train the data with the last
    3 months collected by the node IoT taking as input 150 neurons and making a maximum
    of 2500 epochs. With this configuration, the mean quadratic error obtained is
    less than 0.8 Celsius degrees. 5 Conclusions and future work Prior knowledge of
    low temperatures can help the farmer to anticipate resources and apply frost control
    techniques early enough to ensure maximum efficiency. The overall objective is
    to create an autonomous decision support system for precision agriculture, and
    in such hostile environments, connectivity is limited and there are transient
    clouds that limit the effectiveness of these systems. Edge computing provides
    a framework in which connectivity and security problems are addressed by computing
    at the edge of the network, but today’s edge computing architectures are not able
    to handle heavy workloads. This article evaluates edge computing for frost prediction
    in crops by estimating low temperatures through LSTM deep learning models. LSTM
    deep learning models are computationally heavy workloads, but provide very good
    results for predicting time series. Our results demonstrate that novel edge computing
    platforms including low-power GPUs such as Nvidia Jetson Xavier provide an excellent
    framework for driving edge computing as a real alternative to smart applications.
    Our best LSTM model obtains a deviation less than 1 degree centigrade, being trained
    with information of 3 months, 2500 epochs and 150 neurons, and its execution time
    is less than 5 h which allows training before the prediction is required. As future
    work, new variables will be incorporated into the LSTM to create a multivariate
    LSTM and study the influence of other variables on temperature prediction, as
    well as the network adjustment creating a new architecture with more layers and
    different activation functions and different learning factors. Notes https://www.laverdad.es/murcia/ultimas-heladas-region-20190404113101-nt.html.

    Abstract: Fog and edge architectures provide a link between centralised clouds
    and the world of IoT and sensors. The architectures consist of devices of different
    sizes that coordinate the communication with sensors and cloud services, and that
    process data from or for the sensors and the cloud locally. In dynamic settings
    that allow resources to be created, placed, used and removed at any time, advanced
    orchestration techniques are needed for the activities. Often, these architectures
    cross organisational boundaries, which causes trust concerns. The origin of data
    and the identity of sensors or actuators needs to be identified. Additionally,
    data needs to be stored securely. Orchestration activities across boundaries are
    subject to a contractual perspective. We present here an architecture pattern
    that supports trusted orchestration for edge clouds. The W3C Provenance standard
    is the conceptual foundation of the pattern. Permissioned blockchain technology
    serves as the platform to implement the provenance framework. Published in: 2018

    Spain SECTION I. Introduction An IoT edge cloud architecture is a distributed
    system, typically consisting of an outer rim of IoT, sensor devices and networks,
    an intermediate layer of local processing capabilities and more centralised cloud
    systems for data processing and storage [17]. We specifically consider containerised
    edge orchestration, since this introduces mobile containers [28] as an additional
    challenge into this architectural setting. Key benefits of such a platform are
    (i) a lightweight virtualisation platform for flexible configuration and (ii)
    a dynamic cluster architecture where devices might join or leave, which are suitable
    for varying data processing needs for sensors and actuators [19]. The orchestration
    of all activities, i.e., the management of joining and leaving IoT devices, the
    dynamic placement and change of containers as software devices [3], the creation
    and processing of data, all need to be managed in a secure and trustworthy way
    in an inherently insecure, untrusted fog or edge computing environment. An important
    concern for edge architectures is the secure management of orchestration tasks.
    IoT networks are distributed environments, in which trust between sensor owners,
    network and device providers does not necessarily exist. Equally, infrastructure
    devices might be owned and managed by parties that do not trust each other. In
    order to support key orchestration activities from a trust perspective, we need
    to consider different security concerns: Record the identity of all entities in
    the system Record the provenance of sensor data and other entities entering the
    processing system Record the fact that certain processing steps (in the form of
    smart contracts) have actually been carried out. We employ blockchain technology
    to manage the security concerns by recording the above information in a tamper-proof
    way to create trust. Our aim is to propose a conceptual reference architecture
    that enables secure, trustworthy processing of IoT edge architectures. Furthermore,
    provenance is the central concept to organise the storage of orchestration information.
    We present an architectural pattern, with its underlying principles, that combines
    IoT edge orchestration with a blockchain-based provenance mechanism. We formalise
    the architecture pattern in the format of a state machine that describes the basic
    processing of the orchestration activities, supported by a blockchain to enable
    trusted orchestration management (TOM). We discuss several use cases to motivate
    the needs, picking one of them later in order to validate the state machine definition.
    Our paper is organised as follows. We start with basic architecture, trust and
    blockchain concepts in Section II, before identifying requirements and architectural
    principles in Section III. Section IV then defines the architecture pattern conceptually,
    before we formalise it as a state machine in Section V. We validate the design
    through a use case in Section VI and discuss implementation options in Section
    VII, before ending with related work and conclusions. SECTION II. Architecture,
    Trust and Blockchain Basics An architectural pattern, sometimes called an architectural
    style, is a set of principles and coarse-grained structures that provides an abstract
    framework for a family of software systems [8]. Architecture styles are sets of
    principles and patterns that shape an application. Garlan and Shaw define an architectural
    style as ‘a family of systems in terms of a pattern of structural organisation.
    More specifically, an architectural style determines the vocabulary of components
    and connectors that can be used in instances of that style, together with a set
    of constraints on how they can be combined’ [6]. To make principles and patterns
    more explicit, we follow [7]: ‘an architectural style consists of a set of architectural
    principles and patterns that are aligned with each other to make designs recognisable
    and design activities repeatable: The principles express architectural design
    intent; the patterns adhere to the principles and are commonly occurring in practice’.
    A key element of our architecture pattern is the incorporation of assured, maybe
    certifiable security to enable trust [5]. Edge/fog and cloud computing infrastructures
    allow users to cut costs by distributing and outsourcing computations on-demand.
    However, users of these services have often no means of verifying the confidentiality
    and integrity of data and computation as well as the identity of the service providers
    [1], [2]. Thus, the trustworthiness of the environment is undermined. Blockchain
    technology is a solution for security needs in an untrusted environment. Many
    security problems can be addressed using the decentralised, autonomous, and trusted
    capabilities of blockchains, which provide inherent security mechanisms capable
    of operating in an unreliable network, without relying on a central authority
    [13]. Furthermore, blockchains are tamper-proof, distributed and shared databases
    in which all participants can append and read transactions but no one has full
    control over it. Every new transaction is digitally signed and timestamped, which
    means that all operations can be traced back, and their provenance can be determined
    [24]. The security model implemented by blockchains insures data integrity using
    consensus-driven mechanisms to enable the verification of all the transactions
    in the network [15], which makes all records easily auditable. This is particularly
    important since it allows tracking all sources of insecure transactions in the
    network (e.g., vulnerable IoT devices) [25]. Additionally, blockchains can strengthen
    the security of edge components in terms of the identity management and access
    control and prevent data manipulation. Key blockchain principles are: Blocks (transactions)
    are appended to the chain. Each transaction is hashed/digitally signed to maintain
    integrity and enforce non-repudiation. Then this is sent to all nodes to obtain
    consensus using a specific consensus method and respective coordination protocol.
    Consensus is essentially driven by collective self-interest. Finally, the result
    is passed on to the recipient. Public keys act as addresses in this context. A
    key concept here is a smart contract: if there is agreement (condition met) then
    contracts (operations) are executed. These contracts are attached to the blockchain.
    The problem is that due to massive data replication, performance and scalability
    need to be evaluated. This is of course a challenge in the constrained environment
    in question here. SECTION III. Trusted Orchestration Management (TOM) Requirements
    and Principles The orchestration of data, software and hardware components in
    edge clouds is the key architectural concern in behavioural terms that will be
    addressed through the pattern [18]. This will be combined with a security layer
    to enable trust. We start gathering functional and platform requirements in order
    identify the core principles that guide the pattern. A. Core Requirements and
    Platform Assumptions We now look at security requirements for IoT edge architectures
    in more detail. There is a lack of trust in these architectures that requires
    security features to be applied. Things (be that sensors, devices or software)
    might dynamically join and need to be identified. Data is generated and communicated,
    but needs to be traceable to its origin (provenance). Decisions in the architecture
    management and orchestration need to be taken dynamically and locally, and need
    to be agreed by all participants involved. What is needed is a trustworthy mechanism
    for the secure management of edge architectures that focuses on the transactional
    aspects, but including here identity, provenance and orchestration as aspects
    of a facetted smart contracts approach. To explore this setting deeper, we make
    some assumptions regarding the specific devices and software platform, although
    these do not impact on the generality of the approach. We assume a cluster-based
    architecture for the outer and middle layers, allowing for some hierarchical organisation
    of the edge architecture to take place. We also introduce lightweight smaller
    devices such as single-board computers, while we still assume that more capable
    gateway servers and cloud infrastructures are also integrated into the scenario.
    Basic cluster orchestration for containers could be provided by platforms like
    Kubernetes or Docker Swarm [9], [10], [12]. At the core are classical orchestration
    activities such as deploying activities on nodes of the network. Since all entities
    (devices, containers, data producers/consumers) can join and leave the system
    at any time, two additional activities need to be supported: identification and
    recording of activities, resulting in the following activities to be supported:
    identify, orchestrate and record. B. Architectural Principles In this IoT edge
    cloud context, a number of key principles arise from the requirements that are
    security-related: Identification: Identify all things as authentication and data
    origin are issues. Data Provenance: important if, for instance, incidents happen
    and records need to be examined. Non-Repudiation of architecture management operations
    in a contract situation, e.g., change of software in maintenance or emergency
    situations. The key aim is to manage trust without central authorities in lightweight
    edge clusters and possibly limited connectivity. We need technologies that can
    be applied to identity management, data provenance and transaction processing.
    What is required is advanced distributed trust management including concepts such
    as smart contracts of identity and orchestration management in an environment
    that is constrained in terms of computational power and connectivity. C. Application
    Areas and Secure Orchestration Needs To demonstrate the need for a trusted orchestration
    management (TOM), we look at different application scenarios. We summarise in
    a schematic way the key entities and orchestration needs. Lightweight sensor architectures
    are about data collection and processing with containers and data input/output.
    First, we briefly look at an agricultural domain: Devices: RPi clusters in remote,
    exposed areas (assumed to be in fixed locations) Sensors: rain, temperature, sun,
    humidity Actuators: irrigation system Containers: regular sensor data collection,
    data filtering and analysis, local storage, maintenance and testing Data: sensor
    data (raw, filtered), analysis results, actuator instructions Orchestration: data
    provenance, container identification, container orchestration on devices (contract
    execution). Logistics is another use case with vehicle-based mobile sensors that
    could detect loading/unloading in different locations: Devices: mobile (moving
    vehicles that might join or leave locations), single-board computers Sensors:
    e.g., RFID to detect item movement Actuators: none Containers: item movement (origin
    and target), system testing and maintenance Data: item movement, from and to locations
    Orchestration: data provenance, device identification, container identification,
    orchestration of containers on devices (smart contract execution). Our proposed
    pattern addresses security needs as described in the above use cases. D. Suitability
    of Blockchains to Support Security Requirements and Principles We now discuss
    the suitability of blockchain technologies for providing a secure platform that
    addresses the above requirements and principles for IoT edge architecture orchestration.
    Blockchain management forms a distributed software architecture, where agreement
    on shared state for decentralised and transactional data can be established across
    a network of untrusted participants-as it is the case in edge clouds. This approach
    avoids to rely on central trusted integration points that control the system in
    question-which is a single point of failure. Edge platforms that build trust on
    blockchains can take advantage of common blockchain properties such as data immutability,
    integrity, fair access, transparency, and nonrepudiation of transactions. By building
    on container-based orchestration, software becomes another artefact that is subject
    to identity and authorisation concerns, since edge computing is essentially based
    on the idea to bring software to the edge (to process data locally) rather than
    to bring data to the cloud centre. Often, large amounts of data are collected
    at the edge, transferred to and stored in the cloud, causing high resource consumption
    there without a clear need for all the data. Edge cloud computing involves resource-constrained
    devices that link sensors with central cloud processing. These devices can carry
    out critical filtering and processing activities, relieving the central components
    of the architecture from overload. SECTION IV. A Blockchain-Based Architectural
    Pattern for Trusted Orchestration Management (TOM) The two extended trusted orchestration
    management (TOM) activities in addition to deployment and execution of the components
    that we need to take care of are identity management and logging (recording) of
    all orchestration-related actions. Identity management is supported for instance
    in cluster management tools like Docker Swarm. Here authentication is used in
    the cluster setup to define the capabilities of processing nodes. Logging orchestration
    actions and generated data supports auditability, which is of importance in untrusted
    environments. As explained, we propose a blockchain to record all orchestration
    actions. A. Blockchains for Edge Architecture Orchestration Blockchain technology
    has been applied for transactional processing, but the novelty here is the application
    to lightweight dynamic edge architectures, i.e., blockchain methods and protocols
    in localised clusters of edge devices. Smart contracts define orchestration decisions
    in the architecture (as transactions). We use blockchains to manage security (identity,
    origin, non-repudiation) in distributed autonomous clusters. Specifically, the
    following blockchain architectural configurations [14] are proposed: Permissioned
    blockchains with brokers to enable a degree of local control by the orchestrator.
    Partially centralised/decentralised settings with permissioned blockchains with
    permissions for fine-grained operations on the transaction level (e.g., permission
    to create assets such as data). Consider both permissioned blockchains with permissioned
    miners (write) and also permission-less normal nodes (read). With respect to concerns
    such as cost efficiency, performance, and flexibility, a key problem for an orchestrator
    is choosing what data and computation should be placed on-chain and what should
    be kept off-chain. This might, however, be decided depending on the concrete implementation
    of the pattern. Smart contracts are another aspect of blockchain configuration.
    Smart contracts are not processed until their invoking transactions are included
    in a new block. Blocks impose an order on transactions, thus resolving non-determinism
    which might otherwise affect their execution results. This can be implemented
    for device and container orchestration [16], [22] within the contract transaction
    of the blockchain. B. Provenance to Enable Trust We singled out data origin and
    provenance, identity management and orchestration non-repudiation as important
    security concerns in our framework. We describe now how a blockchain can be utilised
    to support the requirements. Provenance actually plays the key role here, as it
    is the mechanism to capture all identity, orchestration and data origin actions
    in a systematic uniform way. Our starting point is the W3C PROV standard (https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/).
    According to PROV, provenance is information about entities, activities, and people
    involved in producing in our case data. This provenance data in general aids the
    assessment of quality, reliability or trustworthiness in the data production and
    processing. The goal of PROV is to enable the representation and interchange of
    provenance information. Fig. 1. W3C PROV provenance model [based on https://www.w3.org/tr/2013/note-prov-primer-20130430/].
    Show All Fig. V-B shows the PROV conceptual model with entities, activities and
    agents. Here, entities are data objects as well as software containers and hardware
    devices. Provenance records describe the provenance of entities. An entity''s
    provenance can refer to other entities, e.g., compiled sensor data to the original
    records. Activities, which are the dynamic parts (i.e. processing components),
    create and change entities, often making use of previously existing entities to
    achieve this. The two fundamental activities are generation and usage of entities,
    which are represented by relationships in the model. There are also two types
    of activities-usage and generation. Those carried out by devices (sensors): sensors
    can generate data, actuators can consume/use them. Those carried out by containers
    (deployed on devices), which can also generate and use data. Activities are carried
    out on behalf of agents that also act as owners of entities, i.e. are responsible
    for the processing. An agent takes a role in an activity such that the agent can
    be assigned some degree of responsibility for the activity taking place. Actors
    are for instance orchestrators in charge of deploying software and managing the
    infrastructure. All entities (device, container, data) are dynamic, i.e., can
    join (be created or deployed) or leave (be destroyed or terminated) the system.
    Three operations arise: (i) on joining, or before accepting data as a processing
    component, they need to be identified; (ii) data origins need to be remembered
    (stored); (iii) placement of entities, which is an orchestration decision. C.
    An Architecture Pattern for TOM We propose to implement TOM through provenance-based
    orchestration logging. 1 Following Section II, we define the architecture pattern
    for trusted orchestration management in terms of: (i) a structural architecture
    consisting of entities: orchestrator (agent), containers (running on devices,
    implementing services on data), data (being processed by container-based services),
    (ii) a set of core activities, (iii) a behavioural architecture (interaction of
    key entities). Furthermore, we provide a mapping of PROV to the architecture pattern
    in this section, which we formalise as a state machine in Section V. Fig. 2. Structural
    architecture: Sample configuration Show All We first outline some core properties
    of the architectural pattern. The orchestrator decides where the data and activities
    are located. Data processing means to identify a source of data, create a PROV
    record and orchestrate (i.e., assign a target service for the data processing
    by orchestrator), which is based on the execution of a smart contract. The smart
    contract is based on the provenance record (which is in our case more declarative
    in nature, but the orchestrator can interpret this). Table 1 (Section V) will
    formalise this. We note that in case of orchestrator failure, other nodes can
    be promoted to a manager role, or a if an orchestration mechanism such as docker
    swarm is used, multiple nodes can be defined with a manager role, then a consensus
    mechanism (i.e., raft) can be used to make sure that all the managing nodes have
    an exact copy of the orchestration configuration. This removes the problem of
    single point of failure. In the sample architecture scenario in Fig. 2, the orchestrator
    is the agent that orchestrates, i.e., deploys in this case the collector and analyser
    containers on some available computing devices. This effectively forms a contract
    between orchestrator and nodes, whereby the nodes are contracted to carry out
    the activities, i.e., in this case the collection of data into a joint representation
    and the consecutive analysis, providing some results. We can define a set of principle
    activities for the collection and analyser functions from Fig. 2 based on the
    PROV relationships USES and GENERATES: the collector USES sensor data and GENERATES
    the joint data; the analyser USES the joint data and GENERATES the results. This
    sequence of activities forms an orchestration plan. This plan is enacted based
    on the blockchain smart contract concept, requiring the contracted activity to
    (i) obtain permissions (credentials) to retrieve the data (USES) and (ii) create
    output entities (GENERATE) as an obligation defined in the contract. A smart contract
    is defined through a program that defines the implementation of the work to be
    done. It includes the obligations to be carried out, the benefits (in terms of
    SLAs) and the penalties for not achieving the obligations. Generally, fees paid
    to the contractor and possible penalties to compensate the contract issuer shall
    be neglected here. Each processing step based on the contract is recorded in the
    blockchain: (i) the generation of data through a provenance entry: what, by whom,
    when; (ii) the creation of a credentials object defining, based on the identity
    of the processing component, the authorised activities; (iii)the formalised contract
    between the orchestrator and the activity node. The obligations formalised include
    in the IoT edge context data-oriented activities such as storage, filtering and
    analysis and container-oriented activities such as deploying or redeploying (updating)
    a container. Fig. 3. Structural architecture: Blockchain-based orchestration-with
    an orchestration layer (based on prov) and a trust layer (based on blockchains,
    reflecting the PROV activities) Show All The structural architecture is presented
    in Fig. 3. Some key assumptions are as follows: sensors are also considered as
    devices, as are computational devices such as gateway servers or smaller computers.
    Sensors in this way are also considered as being service providers, e.g. providing
    monitored data as a stream or in discrete packages. Actuators are in a similar
    way services that process incoming instructions and configuration data. We assume
    the computational devices to host containers that are dynamically updateable.
    Sensors and actuators might not have that dynamic capability. Next, we provide
    a PROV-to-Pattern Mapping, focusing on the Orchestrator (PROV-AGENT) and the Orchestration
    Plan (formalised by a BCOR state machine in the next section). The orchestration
    plan is based on the following ORCHESTRATION operations (PROV-ACTIVITY) on the
    entities (PROV-ENTITY) in Fig. 3: IDENTIFY (Device/Host, Container/Service, Data)
    PLACE (Container on Host; Data on Service), which is a send/deployment action
    EXEC (Host. Container → Service; Service. Data → Results), which is one of two
    processing actions, CONsuME and PROVIDE, that are applicable to hosts (con-sumes
    container or provides service) or services (con-sumes (in)data and provides (out)data/results).
    Sample operations are Collect and Analyse. These correspond to PROV.USES and PROV.GENERATES.
    Additionally, the following BLOCKCHAIN STORAGE operations from Fig. 3, generally
    for accountability, are needed for the following entities to be stored: Identity:
    for authentication Data Provenance: for data origin and integrity Orchestration:
    for contract non-repudiation Table I summarises the dependencies between the PROV
    elements ENTITY, ACTIVITY and AGENT. Fig. 4. Behavioural architecture of the blockchain
    orchestration integration. Show All Table I Entity to activity, managed by orchestrator
    (agent) Fig. 4 shows the behavioural interaction architecture of the solution
    focusing on the interactions between the components. All actions are recorded
    in the blockchain to guarantee data provenance. Additionally, the identity of
    all entities is stored. The actions are executed by invoking the appropriate smart
    contract. For instance, when a sensor container collects data, it invokes the
    send_collected_data smart contract defined by the collector container by passing
    a signed hash of the collected data. At this point the collected container checks
    the identity of the sensor container (e.g., signature) and the integrity of the
    data (e.g., the hash of the data), then downloads the data in order to process
    it. SECTION V. Formalisation-a State Machine for Blockchain-Based Orchestration
    In the previous sections we introduced the principles of our architecture and
    the basic characteristics of the architectural pattern. Now, we formalise the
    concept using a state machine definition: we start with the data structures underlying
    the operation and the introduction of key features of the operations. We introduce
    the syntax of the state machine specification and specify the state transitions
    in a table format. We finally define the full state machine based on the transition
    table. A. Data Structure and Operations The blockchain data structure is a timestamped
    sequence of blocks, which records and aggregates data about transactions that
    have occurred within the blockchain network. A block consists of: (i) a hash for
    maintaining integrity, (ii) a pointer to the previous block and (iii) the stored
    content. The data structure for the stored content on the blockchain contains
    one of following three structures: PROV (data: entity, origin:activitity-generates,
    receiver: activity-uses) IDENTITY(object:identity, id-proof:proof) ORCHESTRATE(deployed:
    entity, location: entity) Operations on blockchains include in principle Read
    (extract content or execute smart contract), Validate and Insert. The second is
    concerned with the chain management and validation process and shall be ignored
    here. Our focus is reading/executing and creating/inserting blocks. We can detail
    them according to their task in the IoT edge orchestration context. The full list
    of actions includes (in three categories): Orchestration Actions: Device-identify,
    Device-terminate, Container-identify, Container-terminate, Activity-invoke SmartContract-execute
    Blockchain Actions: store prov(id-create), store prov(id-delete), store prov(data),
    store prov(orchestrate) Auxiliary: Ack-Acknowledgements of received input B. State
    Chart Definition We assume a basic state machine here that formalises the sequence
    of Fig. 4. States reflect the results of IoT processing and are stored on the
    blockchain. Outcomes of the transitions below that result in blocks added to the
    blockchain, i.e. the state is reflected in the blockchain through a new block.
    All transitions are orchestrator-managed: triggered through previous states, constrained
    by conditions and having an orchestration action executed. The state machine syntax
    is based on transitions in the form Show All The BC-based ORchestration (BCOR)
    State Machine is defined as a 5-tuple: BCOR−SM=[S,T,C,A,δ] where: S = (BCS1, BCS2,
    … BCSn) is the set of (blockchain-oriented) states that indicate the record created
    in the blockchain, i.e., (PROV-ID-create, PROV-ID-delete, PROV-DATA, PROV-ORCH);
    δ:S×T×C×A→S is the high-level state transition function. It specifies the next
    state depending on the present state and the conditions; see Table 1; T = (T1,
    T2, … Tk) is the set of triggers, i.e., events that initiate the state transition
    for entities joining or leaving (container-join/leave, device-join/leave); C =
    (C 1, C2, … Cl) are control conditions that constrain a transition depending on
    a previous state, e.g., devices or containers need to be joined before they can
    leave or data needs to have left its generating entity, i.e., the conditions are
    (joined(device), joined(container), left(data)); A = (A1, A2, … Am) is the set
    of actions carried out by the orchestrator, which here are (identify-device, identify-container,
    terminate-device, terminate-container, determine-activity, orchestrate(smart contract)).
    SECTION VI. Validation Example In order to validate the architectural pattern,
    we discuss a use case-smart cities-to illustrate the need for identity management
    (for devices, software, data), contracts, and data provenance. As an example,
    we take a closer look at cars. These are mobile devices, which can determine their
    position (e.g., consume information from beacons). They can also provide location
    and direction of travel to traffic management, which results in some requirements.
    For identification of the device, they need to register to a local network (similar
    to mobile phone hand-over). Traffic management is a component that might use an
    analyser function (which might be a third-party service). This needs the identification
    of the software service. The platform could use a flexible software infrastructure
    with frequent updates of the containers that run the analysis and other features.
    Another separate component is the road infrastructure management, which requires
    data identification. Data structures-as defined above-provide structure for the
    parameters of the orchestration and blockchain actions. We can make good use of
    contracts in this example. For instance, the traffic management could invoke a
    contract on the traffic infrastructure, i.e., could instruct the traffic lights
    to be changed (actuator setting). A dynamic contract management scenario is, e.g.
    a car connecting to traffic management: in this case a passive contract is created:
    Show All In a second scenario, the traffic management connects to the traffic
    infrastructure: in this case an executable contract is created: Show All The benefits
    include a tamper-proof record that can be examined in the case of accidents. SECTION
    VII. Implementation-Orchestration and Blockchain Engines In this section, we discuss
    possible implementation platforms for the architecture pattern. In Fig. 3, we
    identified two layers: orchestration and blockchain. We illustrate them in the
    next two subsections. A. Orchestration Engines Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are
    possible container cluster engines. Container technologies are lightweight virtual-isation
    mechanisms. Docker and Kubernetes as the most prominent examples have been successfully
    placed on edge devices such as Raspberry Pis [20], [26] to form local computation
    clusters. We note that our architecture is orchestration engine agnostic, meaning
    that any engine that implements an orchestration mechanism can be used. As our
    focus is here on edge cloud architectures, we investigate the core components
    for a container middleware platform for edge clouds. Different containers for
    a specific processing problem are composed, which forms an orchestration plan.
    This plan defines the edge cloud topology on which the orchestration is enacted.
    Table II State machine definition 1) Swarm Cluster Architecture and Security To
    illustrate the orchestration need better, we select Docker Swarm that we also
    used to carry out experiments [12], [26]. The cluster nodes can have different
    roles. A selected node becomes the user gateway into the cluster. Docker Machines
    can manage remote hosts by sending the commands from the Docker client to the
    Docker daemon on the remote machine over a secured connection. When the first
    Docker Machine is created, in order to create a trusted network, new TLS protocol
    certificates are created on the local machine and then copied to the remote machines.
    For the management of the cluster we use Docker Swarm. Normal nodes run one container
    that identifies them as a Swarm node. The Swarm managers deploy an additional
    dedicated container that provides the management interface. There are mechanisms
    to avoid inconsistencies in the Swarm that could lead to potential misbehaviour.
    If several Swarm managers exist, they can also share their knowledge about the
    swarm by communicating information from a non-leading manager to the one in charge.
    While some identity and reliability management is in place, provenance of these
    activities is important to enable trust. These activities can be captured in the
    form of smart contracts, e.g., ORCH(create(DockerMachine)), ORCH(deploy(Container))
    or ORCH(retrieve(Statuslnformation)) in our solution. 2) Orchestration Information
    Information about a Swarm needs to be shared. In a multi-host network, we can
    use a key-value store that keeps information about network state (e.g., discovery,
    networks, endpoints and IP addresses). Information about an image and how it can
    be reached needs to be provided. The orchestrator uses this key-value store for
    selecting a lead node in a cluster and managing information distribution across
    the nodes. This is similar to data generated by sensors subject to provenance
    activities. The data can be used in the smart contracts that implement the orchestration:
    Network-State(Endpoints, lPAddresses) or ManagerInfo(Status). B. Blockchain Engines
    While a container engine can form the core of the orchestrator, we need a blockchain
    engine to run the provenance layer. A permissioned blockchain platform supporting
    smart contracts is Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger fabric is an open-source, distributed
    ledger computing platform featuring smart contract (Chaincode) functionality.
    It provides a decentralised environment replicated across different network participants.
    Hyperledger fabric employs smart contracts to manage controlled access to the
    ledger as well as a modular and extendable architecture that allows plug-in/out
    of different components to perform specific functions. As a permissioned blockchain,
    it supports different types of transactions and variable block sizes, while maintaining
    a high level of control over transaction execution and validation time. Within
    fabric, nodes assume different roles (i.e., clients, peers and orderers), where
    clients act on behalf of the client applications, the peers maintain copies of
    the ledger and orderers provide the communication channels and generate the new
    blocks (mining). This approach reduces latency and increases throughput. Since
    in a permissioned blockchain all the parties are known (identity vs anonymity),
    to increase privacy fabric uses channels, which are private subnets of communication
    between two or more participants in the network. SECTION VIII. Related Work Our
    pattern resembles a reference architecture for an edge cloud. For instance, Kratzke
    has investigated lightweight architectures for cloud environments, focusing on
    the clustering mechanism [11], without considering security and trust in-depth.
    In [27], Zhu et al. have used the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain as a platform
    to implement a distributed control system based on the IEC 61499 standard. The
    standard is designed to support distributed automation control systems through
    the implementation of function blocks containing the logic of each participating
    component of the system. The function blocks are implemented as Docker containers
    and Kubernetes is used for orchestrating the execution of the containers. The
    blockchain layer is used to secure and validate all transactions as a result of
    executing the different containers. If we want to consider a management platform
    for an IoT edge architecture, be it in constrained or mobile environments, the
    functional scope of a middleware layer needs to be suitably adapted [4], [21].
    Key requirements are robustness and security-both significant contributors to
    trust. In [29], Stanciu presents a blockchain-based architecture named EdgeChain,
    with the corresponding algorithm to manage a decentralised placement service for
    mobile edge applications (MEC). While in traditional cloud computing environments
    the resource management is the responsibility of the cloud provider, in MEC, a
    degree of collaboration between service providers is needed for an effective use
    of resources. The main aspects addressed by EdgeChain are i ) providing a transparent
    selection process for hosts to process the incoming requests, ii) a trustworthy
    and democratic environment to determine the best place to deploy applications,
    and iii) high service availability independent from vendors or service providers.
    Robustness is a requirement that needs to be facilitated through fault tolerance
    mechanisms that deal with failure of connections and nodes. Flexible orchestration
    and load balancing are such functions. Security is another requirement, here relevant
    in the form of identity management in unsecured environments. Other security concerns
    such as data provenance or smart contracts accompanying orchestration instructions
    are also relevant. De Coninck et al. [23] also approach this problem from a middleware
    perspective. Dupont et al. [21] look at container migration to enhance the flexibility,
    which is an important concern in IoT settings. In [30], Hardjono and Smith present
    a privacy preserving technique that relies on blockchain to anonymously record
    device commissioning. The technique assures the different parties about the identity
    of the devices and their manufactures while incentivising device owners to share
    sensor data in a privacy-preserving fashion. SECTION IX. Conclusion Trust is an
    essential ingredient to make the Internet of Things work. Edge and fog computing
    can provide an operational platform to manage the behavioural aspects. However,
    in an open environment that is subject to security problems and that crosses organisational
    boundaries, trust needs to be addressed. The problems are the identity of hardware
    devices and software applications, the origin and integrity of data and the contractual
    nature of orchestration in this context. We have presented an architecture pattern
    for trusted orchestration management (TOM) in an edge cloud, guided by the security
    principles identity, data provenance and nonrepudiation. An architecture pattern
    was presented in terms of its structural and behavioural properties. A state machine
    definition formalises the conceptual architecture presentation. We have demonstrated
    that a blockchain-based solution can ideally map trust concerns to an architecture
    level, which are conceptually captured by the W3C Provenance framework. We have
    presented an architecture pattern, i.e., a solution that is abstracted from more
    specific performance and other implementation concerns. For instance, the complete
    storage of extensive sensor data in a blockchain is not feasible due to the performance
    problems of most blockchain solutions. Here, off-chain storage and other specific
    blockchain configurations, which we only briefly touched, need to be further investigated.

    Explore all metrics Abstract Due to recent advancements and the success of versatile
    mobile applications, more and more services around the globe are being moved to
    the cloud. As a result, its limitations have become more evident. The major issues
    that cloud-based applications face include large latency, bottlenecks because
    of central processing, compromised security, and lack of offline processing. The
    drawbacks of cloud computing are reduced by fog and edge computing, where data
    are processed near the places where it is generated—at network edges or fog nodes—most
    importantly in a distributed way. Smart agriculture is an approach based on the
    Internet of Things (IoT) where cloud computing is not an option as the internet
    is usually not available at remote sites. In addition, pure edge computing also
    is not practical, as most sensor nodes are very small and they do not have enough
    computing power. Intermediate fog computing also is not a good choice, as fixed
    fog nodes (getaway nodes) do not work well with high node fluctuation caused by
    bad weather or harsh conditions. Considering these issues and limitations, we
    have proposed the idea of flying edge computing where an unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) acts as an edge-computing machine. This can be an ideal solution for smart
    agriculture, given the size and remoteness of many agricultural areas. This technique
    can be called “wind or breeze computing” because the data are “blown” or moved
    by the current of computing. The Flying-Edge offers fast deployment of edge facilities
    in challenging locations and it can be a major step to accomplish the goal of
    IoT-based smart agriculture. Similar content being viewed by others Enabling Edge

    The agriculture sector faces continuous pressure to feed the population of over
    9 billion that is expected by 2050 amid challenges like climate change and the
    limited availability of arable land. To address this situation, scientists and
    researchers have suggested augmenting this sector with modern technologies including
    the Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [1]. For example,
    IoTs provide updates about crop health, which helps farmers make the right decision
    at the right time. Precision agriculture is all about collecting the right data
    at the right time so that the use of resources can be optimized by considering
    the requirements of every inch of farmland. To make agriculture sustainable using
    the IoT has moved to the forefront of various agricultural operations. Moreover,
    UAVs are being used for various purposes in agriculture like monitoring, aerial
    sensing, tracking, data collection, communication, and security. UAVs, more precisely
    called flying-robots, are used in a wide range of applications where they often
    act as the first responder because of their fast, cost-effective, and safe deployment
    capabilities [2,3,4]. Further, with improved technology and facilities like three-dimensional
    maneuverability, UAVs are playing the crucial role of airborne base stations in
    almost all emerging networks. Because of their involvement in a wide range of
    daily applications, UAVs have become the best candidates to achieve the goal of
    precision farming [5]. Due to these capabilities, UAVs can be used throughout
    the life cycle of crops in such functions as soil health inspections [6], plantation
    [7], plant counting [8], crop health monitoring [9] [10], irrigation, spraying
    fertilizers and pesticides [11], and estimating crop yield. This technology has
    become the point of interest for all the stakeholders related to agriculture—including
    farmers, agronomists, crop insurers, and researchers—because of its suitability
    and advanced functionalities. These include the variety of models, longer flight
    times, greater payload capacities, and the ability to fly in varying conditions.
    In this article UAVs are proposed as an option to overcome the wide range of challenges
    from remote agriculture: They need to cover large geographical areas. A wide range
    of sensors and other devices are needed to monitor various parameters in this
    highly heterogeneous environment. They need to operate in remote locations, where
    sensors operate unattended. Connecting the sensors is a challenge because of unreliable
    and fluctuating communications. Some parameters must report in real-time. Many
    parameters require scalable data storage and processing capabilities. In this
    article, UAVs provide communication and data collection service to IoT nodes.
    Once data are collected, the next question is where to process it and what computation
    model is best suitable to provide the required services to the IoT nodes. For
    instance, cloud services can be used to access information from predictive analysis
    institutes so farmers apply products according to their specific requirements.
    However, for critical IoT-based agriculture applications to operate in such challenging
    areas, they need a reliable communication medium between the deployed objects
    and processing devices, which cannot be guaranteed in large and remote areas.
    Under these circumstances, cloud computing is not a good option because the internet
    may not be available in wide agriculture fields [12]. Furthermore, so-called fog
    computing also does not fit well since fog nodes are difficult to fix in harsh
    environments where node fluctuations are often. Most importantly, when we talk
    about specific applications in agriculture, edge computing may suffer from the
    fact that most nodes are very small, and they might not have sufficient processing
    capabilities. The need for scalability, economy, and node updates can generate
    more challenges. In short, in large farming areas where no reliable communication
    network is available to connect a large number of sensors to provide timely data,
    it is difficult to use existing fog and edge computing platforms. Considering
    the challenge, this paper presents the idea of a Flying-Edge, a UAV-based computing
    platform that aims to fulfill the requirements of smart agriculture. Flying Edge
    platforms, which can comprise one or multiple UAVs, offer the computing capabilities
    of IoT applications operating in remote locations. The proposed platform is highly
    dynamic and flexible, so it can be deployed and can collect data quickly. Most
    importantly, it can be used in tough terrains like the desert and hilly areas,
    removing the barriers to smart agriculture in such locations. The proposed edge
    platform builds an IoT network to collect crop data that will then be used to
    analyze crop health so, ultimately, the farmer can take timely smart actions.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a short background
    of mobile edge computing. Section 3 provides the details of the proposed platform
    along with all the design and functionalities it can perform. Section 4 evaluates
    the proposed idea and compares the results of different parameters while, Section
    5 presents concluding remarks and thoughts for future study. 2 Related work Using
    mobile edge computing is not new. Various authors have proposed mobile systems
    that offer computing facilities. Prominent efforts include mobile fog computing
    [13] [14], mobile cloud computing [15], and mobile edge computing [16]. However,
    these platforms work differently from the proposed idea of flying edge computing.
    The system proposed in [13] offers mobile edge services from a fixed machine.
    It enables integrating mobile devices such as smartphones and vehicles to the
    cloud, but only from a certain geographical area. The important thing about that
    work is that it offers low-latency with the facility of mobility and location
    awareness. Further, [15] [17] proposes mobile cloud computing that offers an infrastructure
    where both data storage and data processing occur in the cloud to support mobile
    devices. In that approach, mobile cloud computing frees mobile devices from storing
    large data and conducting heavy processing. In [13], mobile edge computing extends
    cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the cellular network. Different services
    with low latency can be provided to smartphones and other applications that rely
    on cellular communications. Using UAVs in smart agriculture also is not new. These
    flying robots are used in many ways. Authors in [18] present a hierarchical structure
    based on the collaboration between the UAVs and associated wireless sensors for
    crop monitoring in precision agriculture. That integration of UAVs with ground
    sensors and IoT applications proved to be a robust and efficient solution for
    data collection, control, analysis, and decisions in such specialized applications.
    Key advantages lay in online data collection and relaying the data to a central
    monitoring point, while effectively managing network load and latency through
    optimized UAV trajectories and in situ data processing. Two important aspects
    of the collaboration were considered: designing the UAV trajectories for efficient
    data collection and implementing effective data processing algorithms (consensus
    and symbolic aggregate approximation) at the network level to transmit the relevant
    data. Considering the worth of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
    for smart agriculture, researchers have begun to use edge computing to enhance
    crop production. In a similar effort in [19], the authors proposed a data link
    management solution based on mobile edge computing (MEC) to monitor water requirements
    for agriculture. The results showed that the scheme realizes the network and intelligence
    of agricultural water monitoring system management, and it has a broad market
    prospect. Edge computing plays an important role in smart agriculture, and it
    can be considered an ideal paradigm because of features like its ability to operate
    in remote locations, cover large areas, endure hostile conditions, provide sufficient
    bandwidth, and address connectivity issues. Collecting data at the right time
    and then performing the right steps for a given situation is possible only by
    using edge computing. So, it is crucial for agriculture. Edge computing can be
    the appropriate choice whenever there are connectivity issues. According to the
    proposal in [20], sensors and edge devices collect data from the monitoring area
    and send the data to an edge node. The node conducts a preprocess analysis of
    the data needed then sends the outcome to a server. The server collects and accumulates
    the results to predict and estimate the total harvest yield. By using this framework
    many decisions can be taken according to circumstances. Authors in [21] focus
    on an efficient solution for collecting data and exploiting tasks using edge computing
    for smart agriculture, global food security, and the pervasive issue of internet
    access. Further, [22] presents a platform that can manage the minerals for agriculture
    using saline water. It relies on transferable low-cost hardware which operates
    with edge computing to interact with crop sensors and devices to collect the data
    and perform atomic control actions in real-time monitoring scenarios. In all these
    studies, various features and services are provided to mobile devices to integrate
    with the cloud. However, they rely on fixed locations, such as stationary fog
    machines, fixed wireless stations, or fixed cellular towers. By contrast, Flying
    Edge offers these facilities from a mobile device instead of using only stationary
    devices. 3 Proposed flying edge computing The traditional model has been to use
    cloud computing to acquire and process data from the edge to offer useful services.
    Large cloud data centers provide different services (computing, platform, security,
    and storage) to edge devices through high bandwidth connectivity. Two key challenges
    emerge with this hub-and-spoke model. Public cloud data centers are globally distributed,
    but they are typically limited to one or a few per country (depending on its size).
    The network distance from the edge to the cloud can result in a long round trip
    time (RTT) in the order of thousands of milliseconds. For latency-sensitive cloud
    applications, this may compromise their performance. To overcome this, fog, mist,
    and edge computing have been introduced as extensions of cloud networks, which
    are collections of servers comprising a distributed network. Cloud, fog, and mist
    computing are also known as wet computing in the literature. The difference between
    them is the degree of distribution of services from the internet cloud to edge
    devices. We are introducing a new concept called Flying Edge computing (FEC).
    In contrast to previous forms of computing, we name it “dry” computing because
    data are blown along and dried by with the current of the computing wind. The
    speed and direction of the wind also matter. The faster the speed, the more the
    throughput. At slower speeds, a network is more tightly squeezed to collect the
    data. 3.1 Data evaporation UAV activates ground sensor nodes and provides them
    local computation, database, and communications infrastructure services. In contrast
    to typical fixed-edge computing machines installed near or inside the edge node,
    the UAV acts like a flying edge that moves between edge nodes to provide them
    the desired local and global services. Typical cloud, fog, and mist computing
    are called wet computing, but for Flying Edge we name it dry, wind, or breeze
    computing where data are evaporated from the sensor node to the air and collected
    by a UAV. UAV generates a computing wind in its vicinity, and data are evaporated
    (extracted from sensors) with the current of computing (movement of UAV). The
    speed of the UAV is taken as the current of computing wind, while several UAVs
    act like wind temperature. The more the UAVs, the faster the evaporation process
    (more throughput). Fast-moving UAVs produce shorter clusters with fewer sensor
    nodes, so slowing the computing wind ensures that the sensor nodes are squeezed
    well. We have taken agriculture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) as a case
    study. Crops are mostly grown in circular farms to save water. Our contribution
    is to modernize the KSA agriculture with state-of-the-art technologies to monitor
    crop health so resources can be managed tightly, especially the maximal use of
    water. We map flying edge computing with the perspective of KSA agriculture. Hundreds
    of crop fields are dispersed in a very large and remote area where there is no
    fixed communications infrastructure. It is assumed that all fields are equipped
    with a large number of sensors that monitor crops, soil, and environmental parameters
    at the same time. However, predefined network topologies (cluster heads, communication
    routes) are not possible because of the high fluctuation of sensor nodes caused
    by harsh water. In this scenario, cloud computing does not fit well as IoT devices
    do not have cloud access. In this presentation, a flying edge machine (UAV) moves
    in a predefined path. As it blows the computing wind, the underlying sensors form
    a cluster in the direction of the wind, and they choose a Cluster Head (CH) dynamically.
    As a result, the data are evaporated from CH to UAV, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig.

    of computing techniques Full size image As mentioned above, the Flying Edge is
    a UAV-based platform that acts as an edge node. Most importantly, the acting edge
    node can be reallocated to different locations where various sensors or devices
    need some edge node to complete certain IoT tasks. Moreover, it can provide the
    facility of a gateway to link or integrate IoT services and cloud computing. The
    Flying Edge can be equipped with resources like processors, storage facilities,
    communication devices, and an edge computational platform. This edge platform
    can execute several services to support IoT applications required for smart agriculture.
    One possible configuration for flying edge computing is shown in Fig. 3. In that
    figure, a UAV with edge computing facilities can move in any area where IoT services
    are required. It provides a set of services like low latency to the IoT applications
    in that area while it enables the integration of the IoT applications and the
    cloud. Fig. 3 Flying Edge supporting the smart agriculture Full size image The
    Flying Edge can facilitate smart agriculture based on IoT applications. Major
    opportunities that it can provide are: Fast deployment: because of its nature,
    the Flying Edge can be deployed at remote locations to facilitate IoT services.
    It is a turnkey system that can be used even where there is no communications
    infrastructure. Scalability: the system can be upgraded or enhanced in terms of
    coverage area, number of sensing devices, number of UAVs operated, and services
    provided. Flexibility: the system is flexible enough to adapt to any change in
    applications, required services, or the geography of the monitoring area. Location
    awareness: location services are provided by the flying edge machine, so IoT nodes
    do not require a GPS device. Power effectiveness: this scheme is very power efficient
    for end nodes (IoT nodes), as most of the services that require computation are
    provided by flying edge robots (UAVs). Because the Flying Edge can be deployed
    in an area where IoT devices are already deployed, most of the communication between
    these IoT devices and UAV is done through a personal area network (PAN) such as
    IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) and 801.15.1 (Bluetooth). Both protocols are characterized
    by lower bandwidths and shorter communication ranges. However, they also need
    low energy during the communication phase. Depending on the requirements, communication
    can be done through alternative protocols that support longer ranges like a local
    area network (LAN) such as IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi). On the other hand, all the communication
    between the Flying Edge and the cloud is done through protocols that are commonly
    used for wide area networks (WANs) including IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) and cellular.
    The choice of communications medium and protocol depends on the nature of the
    application and its location. 3.3 Proposed system architecture The proposed system
    has two components: an edge device and the Flying Edge computing machine, as shown
    in Fig. 4. The edge device (sensor or actuator) can get services from a UAV through
    a services request interface. Most of the computational services required by the
    IoT are provided by the local service response module, which is connected to several
    services built into the flying machine. In rare cases, the IoTs might require
    global services from the cloud, and they will be granted through a global services
    response module. Fig. 4 Flying Edge computing architecture Full size image 3.4
    Proposed system models Mobile devices and Internet-of-things (IoT) have been introduced
    in our lives very rapidly. They have brought ease to our work, but they also raised
    new challenges that needed cloud-based solutions including i) the need to transfer
    huge amounts of data to the cloud, ii) high communication latencies, and iii)
    the inability of this model to respond in some domains that require a rapid reaction
    to events. Different computing techniques like cloud, fog, and mist/edge computing
    have been introduced to address these issues and provide three basic services
    to the IoT devices: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), “Platform as a Service
    (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). The basic difference between these techniques
    is the layer in the network hierarchy from which the service is provided. This
    means the distance between the services and the source of data, as shown in Fig.
    5. In cloud computing, all the services are provided from the cloud (a central
    location) while fog computing is a distributed computing technique in which services
    are provided in network fabrics. In edge or mist computing, processing and services
    are provided near the end node (the source of data). Fig. 5 Typical cloud-to-edge
    computing hierarchy Full size image A typical computing hierarchy is shown in
    Fig. 5. As far as WSN is involved, many factors (lack of a communication link,
    limited processing capabilities, insufficient power) may restrict the use of any
    kind of computing technique. In such conditions, a UAV can replace any of the
    computing layers. In this article, we introduce four basic types of UAV replacement:
    1- UAV as a flying cloud 2- UAV as a flying fog 3- UAV as a flying edge 4- A swarm
    of UAVs as a distributed services provider 3.4.1 UAV as a flying cloud This configuration
    is applicable in a scenario where all the ground sensing nodes can communicate
    with each other but do not have access to the outer world (no internet). This
    type of scenario is applicable in battlefields, disaster areas, wildlife habitats,
    and remote farm fields. As all sensors are connected with each other, they maintain
    their local network in terms of clusters and routes independently. Local decisions
    are made either at the edge or the fog layer. Global services (data collection,
    localization, security, or software) and decisions are provided by the UAV as
    a Flying Cloud Machine (FCM) on a demand basis (see Fig. 6). Fig. 6 UAV a Flying
    cloud machine Full size image 3.4.2 UAV as a flying fog In this configuration,
    field sensors are equipped with local services (network and storage) through edge
    nodes. The UAV provides only communication services as a flying fog machine (FFM)
    to approach the cloud layer where all global services exist. FFM provides a bridge
    between the edge layer and the cloud layer, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Flying
    fog computing Full size image 3.4.3 UAV as a flying edge In this scheme, UAV provides
    computation and services to the IoT nodes by visiting them, and it provides services
    and computation close to the data source. It helps to improve latency and bandwidth,
    and it also enhances the network life by improving battery utilization of end
    nodes. All the sensors’ nodes are dump nodes. Their functionality is limited to
    sense and log parameters from the environment only. All the services (clustering,
    network, storage) and computation are provided to them by a UAV. If the UAV cannot
    fulfill a demanded service, it can render it from the cloud. A flying edge machine
    (FEM) is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Flying edge computing Full size image 3.4.4 UAV
    as a distributed flying edge machine A coordinated swarm of UAVs can provide edge
    services as shown in Fig. 9. Different services like network, storage, and localization
    are provided by separate UAVs. Hence each service will be provide by a specialized
    flying machine which will enhance the provided quality of service, throughput,
    and data collection. Swarm of UAVs can also work in a coordinated way such that
    they can share or take over the responsibilities if any one fails, distracted
    or power exhausted. This model will provide robust solutions in hardship conditions.
    Fig. 9 Distributed flying edge computing machine Full size image 4 Simulation
    and results A Flying Edge prototype was implemented using a distributed Java agent
    environment. This environment provides a middleware infrastructure that enables
    the implementation of different distributed programming models and advanced platform
    services for distributed heterogeneous environments. These heterogeneous environments
    may comprise multiple heterogeneous nodes with different capabilities. In addition,
    this middleware infrastructure provides scalability solutions to deploy, operate,
    monitor, and control large-scale distributed applications. Each agent in the environment
    can provide runtime support to securely execute some code. An edge machine provides
    broker services, invocation services, and location-based services. There is also
    a mechanism that allows each edge broker to forward a service search request to
    other brokers if it does not have the requested service. Both local and remote
    service invocations also are implemented and added to the prototype implementation.
    For the IoT side, we used the Arduino board, which is open-source hardware for
    embedded systems. For this prototype implementation, the Arduino was used as the
    IoT payload subsystem—the onboard device requesting services. Some sensors were
    connected to the Arduino board, such as the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature
    and humidity. Some LEDs and a buzz were installed to represent actuators. In addition,
    we installed an Adafruit CC3000 Wi-Fi board to connect the Arduino to a local
    area network and the Flying Edge machine. The Arduino code was developed using
    the Arduino IDE with the Adafruit CC3000 library. Each IoT service was implemented
    with a RESTful API. At the UAV edge computing side, there is a service that represents
    each sensor or actuator attached to the Arduino. The primary function of these
    services is to map a call from the SOAP APIs to RESTful APIs. All sensor and actuator
    services are registered with the local broker. In addition, the global broker
    is periodically updated with these services. For the experiments, we used three
    computers, which represented the cloud, the Flying Edge machine, and the IoT node.
    In addition, we used WAN emulators among these machines to introduce the effects
    of using long distances and/or the internet to connect the machines. Experiments
    were conducted for four configurations: Call1: a local IoT service call responded
    by the distributed flying edge machine Call2: a local IoT service call responded
    by the flying edge machine Call3: a remote IoT service call responded by the cloud
    through a flying fog machine Call4: a remote IoT service call responded by the
    flying cloud The experiment was repeated for two types of services. The first
    was to get the current temperature (CurTemp) and the second was to turn on the
    LED (LEDon). The average results of 10 runs of multiple service calls are shown
    in Fig. 10. The recorded times for these calls do not include the service lookup
    times. The response times for all service calls are shown in Fig. 10. It is evident
    that flying edge shows best results in term of response time by adding the benefits
    of battery efficiency of end nodes. It is also analyzed that the services provided
    by flying fog machine or through flying fog machine gives same results and are
    better than cloud. Fig. 10 IoT service call response time Full size image The
    average service lookup times for three services are shown in Fig. 11. Local services
    were provided by the local network. Remote 1 services were provided by the flying
    machine UAV to the end node. Remote 2 services were provided by the cloud through
    flying machines. There is a big difference between Remote 1 and Remote 2 service
    lookup times. This means that flying computing machines (UAVs) can provide services
    to IoT devices in a much faster way. Fig. 11 IoT service lookup Full size image
    5 Conclusion In this research article, we proposed a new concept of a computation
    mechanism for IoT devices. The processing and the services will be provided to
    the end devices neither from central location (cloud) nor by end device itself.
    Both cloud and edge computing have different pros and cons ranging from bottlenecks
    to poor resource utilization. The proposed system fulfills the service demand
    very close to the point of data generation without using additional network resources
    (energy, memory, or processor). Our aim is to provide these services to the IoTs
    by using the Flying Edge machine. This means the computational machine itself
    goes closer to the data-generation node and provides the demanded services. The
    architecture of the proposed Flying Edge machine is introduced, and the performance
    of the system is evaluated through simulation and lab test bed. The results showed
    the effectiveness of the proposed computational mechanism. As a result, we can
    say this system is very suitable for implementation in the case study presented
    (agriculture) but it is not limited to that use. References Friha O, Ferrag MA,

    Part of the book series: Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics ((PROMS,volume
    401)) Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved and penetrated in different
    sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and logistics.
    The IoT services are deployed in the cloud for accessing it virtually independent
    of location. The data-intensive IoT applications when deployed in the cloud have
    high response time. To overcome this challenge, the fog computing techniques is
    proposed to access the data from the sensors in real time. In this paper, the
    Fog-enabled IoT architecture for precision agriculture is presented. Precision
    agriculture is the usage of information technology to increase yield of crops
    and improve health of plants by ensuring accurate and controlled supply of nutrients.
    The sensors are deployed in the fields, and data is sent to the edge devices used
    for improving the produce. The different services available are automated irrigation
    and fertigation, recommendation by experts, decision support system, and protection
    from rodents. The farmers can subscribe to the service and make the best use.
    The advantage of Fog-enabled IoT is the reduction in round-trip time (RTT) compared
    to Cloud IoT architecture. The result demonstrates 40% reduction in RTT when Fog-enabled
    IoT architecture is used for different services. Keywords MQTT Raspberry Pi Publish

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction The Fog-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) architecture
    is used for resource optimization. The agriculture sector use case is considered
    for providing service to the farmers. The farmer can enable the services using
    the mobile application. The lightweight protocol is chosen for communication between
    the devices for energy-efficient transmission of the data. The network topology
    consists of heterogeneous nodes such as things and edge devices. The nodes in
    the network are power constraint devices; hence, the lightweight protocol is opted
    for the communication. The Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is the lightweight
    protocol that is used for communication between the edge devices such as Raspberry
    Pi. The MQTT protocol uses publish-subscribe communication model. It is assumed
    that the service provider will have the infrastructure for facilitating the different
    services mentioned. The recommendation by experts regarding which crop to be grown
    in the field based on region, season, and climate conditions is available to the
    farmers. Advice related to the appropriate time for sowing the seed to get better
    yield is facilitated on request through mobile. This paper outlines the use of
    IoT devices such as rain sensor, soil moisture sensor, and temperature sensor
    to sense the agricultural data and store into edge device database. The stored
    data is monitored through big data analytics, and prediction is performed using
    data mining techniques. The energy efficiency is computed in terms of the packet
    size and the round trip time for the transmission of the data between the devices.
    The organization of the paper: In Sect. 2, related work on Fog IoT services is
    presented. In Sect. 3, the architecture for Fog IoT taking precision agriculture
    as a use case is described. The energy model for the Fog IoT devices is discussed
    in Sect. 4. The distance between the Fog IoT nodes, a factor to reduce latency,
    is presented in Sect. 5. The result analysis and conclusion is presented in Sects.
    6, and 7, respectively. 2 State of the Art in Fog-Enabled IoT Services In [1],
    the system that collects soil properties and stores it in cloud for further analysis
    is mentioned. It also speaks about building a scalable sensor data analysis for
    smart farming with commercially available IoT devices which reduces maintenance
    cost and provides data analytics resulting in increased crop yield. In [2], cloud-based
    IoT application for precision agriculture with three-layer architecture is described.
    The top layer deals with collecting information and applying necessary agricultural
    actions. The next layer connects the top layer to IoT. The last layer deals with
    data storage and processing. AgroTick, a novel hybrid system for smart agriculture,
    is discussed in [3]. AgroTick is an Internet of Things (IoT) system with a mobile
    interface that was created using technological modules such as cloud computing,
    embedded firmware, hardware, and big data analytics. AgroTick is built to increase
    agricultural efficiency, develop a well-connected farming network, and provide
    a knowledge-sharing platform for farmers. In [4,5,6,7], the lightweight protocol,
    Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), is the communication model used. It
    has opened its way in many sectors since its invention in 1999. The different
    cloud deployments and services available for the Internet users are presented
    in [8]. The various applications of IoT such as smart parking, waste management,
    and home automation are described in [9]. The power efficiency for IoT devices
    is enhanced using the software-defined networks (SDN) architecture [10]. The energy
    efficiency of the IoT devices is improved using load balancing and fault tolerance
    techniques [11]. The IoT services of the smart city are described in [12]. The
    6LoWPAN and CoAP protocol in development of the applications are presented in
    [13]. The security issues are concerns in the IoT network presented in [14, 15].
    3 Fog Computing-Enabled IoT Architecture The Fog computing-enabled IoT architecture
    for precision agriculture using lightweight protocol is shown in Fig. 1. The objective
    is to provide different service for farmers that aid in precision agriculture
    such as: 1. Irrigation and fertigation as a service 2. Crop-related decision support
    system as a service 3. Recommendation as a service 4. Pest control as a service
    The farmers have to subscribe for the services by registration process. The metering
    and billing module at the service provider (SP) side keeps track of the unit amount
    of resource utilized by the farmers. Irrigation and Fertigation As a Service:
    This service is used by farmers to irrigate and fertigate the land. The controlled
    amount of water and fertilizers are supplied to the plants based on the different
    parameters such as soil moisture content, temperature, and rainfall in the region.
    Crop-Related Decision Support System As a Service This service aids the farmer
    in making decisions related to the type of crop to be sowed or the suitable time
    for sowing in the region. To facilitate this service at the SP side, big data
    analytics technique are applied as shown in Fig. 1. Recommendation As a Service
    The farmers who have subscribed to this service get recommendation related to
    the crop. The data related to each farmers land is collected using sensors and
    stored at the data center for analysis. The data mining techniques are applied
    for recommendation to the farmers. Pest Control As a Service This service enables
    the farmers to combat the loss in yield due to pests and rodents. The automated
    fertigation unit is installed at the service provider location. The metering unit
    aids in determining the amount of unit consumed by the farmers for accounting
    and billing. The virtualization technique is applied for efficient utilization
    of resources at the data centers. The virtual private network (VPN) component
    enables the user to have private network for security reasons. These services
    are deployed at the edge device closer to the sensors to minimize the latency.
    In the Fig. 1, end devices could be the mobile, laptop, or the tablet. The services
    could be accessed using a browser or an application. The service response time
    could be greatly enhanced by deploying these on the edge devices closer to the
    sensors. In the next section, the energy efficiency model for fog IoT architecture
    is presented. Fig. 1 Fog-enabled IoT architecture using lightweight protocol Full
    size image 4 Energy Model for the Fog IoT Devices The evolution of Fog computing-enabled
    Internet of Things is at its peak as represented in Gartner’s predictions in the
    recent days. Here, the things connect to the Internet anytime, anywhere providing
    the ubiquity to the users. These things are fueled by energy sources. Hence, energy
    efficient utilization of the IoT resources is an important research domain. With
    the invention of Industrial IoT, the need for low power technology is increasing
    tremendously. Thus, the power consumption model for IoT applications plays an
    important role in network resource optimization. A trade-off is to be achieved
    between cost incurred, network lifetime, and the power consumption of the devices.
    The power efficiency model for IoT devices is presented in [16]. The effect of
    power consumption based on the traffic pattern in IoT devices of smart city applications
    is described in [17]. In an IoT application, energy is consumed during data acquisition,
    processing, and communication. The alternate to save energy is to use energy harvesting
    technologies, which is out of the scope of this paper. The analysis of energy
    in the life cycle of an IoT application is presented here. The objective is to
    minimize the power consumption of the IoT applications. In the literature, system
    level conservation of energy is described vastly. The focus of this paper is mainly
    from the perspective of energy consumption during communication between the devices.
    In an IoT application, the pattern observed is data acquisition by the sensors/things,
    processing performed by the controller, and the transmission of the data. Based
    on this pattern, the power consumption of the IoT application is broken into four
    different blocks. The first block being the power consumed at the system/device
    level (PSYS) to perform the operations at the operating system level. The second
    block being the power consumption during the data acquisition by the sensors/things
    (PDACQ). The third block is power consumed for processing (PPROC) and finally
    the power utilized for communicating between the networking devices (PCOMMN).
    The mathematical representation of the observed pattern in IoT application is
    given in Eq. (1). $$ {P}_{NDEV}={P}_{SYS}+{P}_{DACQ}+{P}_{PROC}+{P}_{COMMN} $$
    (1) With the main objective being the power conservation during communication,
    the lightweight protocol is used in the development of the IoT applications. The
    payload in case of lightweight protocol such as MQTT for IoT applications is 2
    bytes. Since the IoT devices are battery powered, the objective is to minimize
    the power consumed during transmission for increasing the network lifetime. 4.1
    Power Consumption Model for Data Communication The average power consumed during
    communication is represented as energy required to send a message (EM) and the
    time interval between consecutive messages (TM) as given in Eq. (2). $$ {P}_{COMMN}=\sum
    \limits_{k=1}^n\frac{E_M^{(k)}}{T_M^{(k)}} $$ (2) where n is the number of messages
    sent during the experimental period and k varies from 1 to n. The factors that
    influence EM are based on whether it is a wired medium or wireless medium for
    transmission, embedded chip type on the sensor/thing and the period for every
    transmission. The IoT applications can be categorized into two types such as periodic
    and event trigger-based reporting. In case of periodic reporting such as temperature
    monitoring, the value for \( {T}_{\textrm{M}}^{(k)} \) is constant. Therefore,
    Eq. (2) is rewritten as: $$ {P}_{COMMN}=\frac{1}{T_M^0}\sum \limits_{k=1}^n{E}_M^{(k)}
    $$ (3) Here, \( {T}_M^0 \) is constant time interval between consecutive reporting
    instances. 4.2 Power Consumption Model for Data Acquisition The IoT applications
    are classified into two types such as periodic reporting and nonperiodic or event
    trigger-based reporting. The power consumption for the data acquisition is given
    by Eq. (4): $$ {P}_{DACQ}=\left\{\begin{array}{c}{P}_{DACQ-1- SAMPLE}\cdot {SN}_1.\dots
    (periodic)\\ {}{P}_{DACQ-1- SAMPLE}\cdot {SN}_2\cdot \Pr ob(E)\end{array}\right.
    $$ (4) where SN1 and SN2 are the number of samples for periodic and event trigger-based
    reporting, respectively. In case of the event trigger-based reporting, the probability
    of occurrence of an event (E) is taken into consideration. 4.3 Power Consumption
    Model of a System/Device The different states of a networking device are active,
    idle/sleep, transmit, and receive. The power consumption of a networking device
    (PSYS) is given as: $$ {P}_{SYS}={P}_{active}+{P}_{sleep/ idle}+{P}_{transmit}+{P}_{receive}
    $$ (5) The power consumption during each of these states is presented in this
    section. Data Transmission The power consumption for transmission of data in an
    IoT environment, considering periodic transmission, is represented as: $$ {E}_{DataTx}={P}_{DataTx}(mW)\times
    {T}_M^0(ms)\vspace*{-1.5pc} $$ (6) Data Reception Similarly, the power consumed
    to receive the data is given as: $$ {E}_{DataRx}={P}_{DataRx}(mW)\times {T}_{Rx}(ms)
    $$ (7) where TRx(ms) is the duration for data reception. Active/Sleep Modes Based
    on the active and sleep modes of the networking device, power consumption is modelled
    as: $$ {P}_{active+ sleep}={P}_s\times {T}_s+\left({T}_{total}-{T}_s\right)\ast
    {P}_{active} $$ (8) where Ttotal and Ts are the total time spent and time spent
    in sleep mode, respectively. The power consumption of an IoT device can be reduced
    by increasing the sleep modes. Based on the deviation of the sensed data, the
    sleep modes can be increased for prolonged network lifetime. The deviation of
    the sensed data is computed as: $$ Deviation\mbox{\_ }of\mbox{\_ }sensed\mbox{\_}data=\frac{\sqrt{\sum
    \left({y}_i-\mu \right)}}{\mu } $$ (9) where yi is the sensed data and μ is the
    mean computed for “n” sensed data values. μ is computed as \( \sum \limits_{i=1}^n{y}_i/n
    \). The data reduction is performed by monitoring the deviation in the data sensed.
    The voluminous data, variety of sensors, and velocity of data generated are the
    aspects to be considered in Fog computing. 4.4 Power Consumption Model for Data
    Processing The power consumed for data processing depends on the number of operations
    performed such as arithmetic operations. It depends on the hardware architecture
    chosen for the deployment of the IoT applications. In this section, the different
    units of power consumption in the IoT applications are outlined. With the proposed
    architecture, the latency for the services is reduced which aids in decreasing
    the power consumed. 5 Distance Between Nodes in Fog IoT Assuming there exists
    “M” routers between the source and destination, the end-to-end delay (dE-to-E)
    is given by Eq. (10), when the queuing delay is negligible: $$ {d}_{E- to-E}=M\ast
    \left({d}_{proc}+{d}_{trans}+{d}_{prop}\ \right) $$ (10) where dproc is the processing
    delay, dtrans is the transmission delay, and dprop is the propagation delay [18].
    If the link length is doubled from d to 2d, the propagation delay is dprop = 2
    * dprop. The propagation delay is proportional to the distance between the nodes.
    Hence, the Fog computing reduces the end-to-end delay when the distance between
    the data gathering nodes and edge devices is reduced. 6 Result Analysis The Raspberry
    Pi 3 is used as the end node at the fog computing layer for aggregation, computation,
    and processing. The lightweight protocol is used for data transmission between
    the nodes. MQTT protocol is chosen as the lightweight protocol for transmission
    of the sensor-captured data. The “publish-subscribe” communication model is applied
    in MQTT. The mosquito broker is utilized to send the sensor-captured data between
    the subscriber (farmers) and publisher (SP). The mosquito broker is configured
    to function as a broker on Raspberry Pi system. An instance is created on broker
    with the port number. The topic with name as “IrrigationFertigation” is created.
    The subscribers connect to the broker using this topic. The message to “ON” the
    irrigation/fertigation unit is sent using this topic. The Wireshark tool is used
    to capture the packet information. The filter is applied to compare the packet
    length during transmission using “http” and “mqtt” protocol. The area covered
    with blue represents the packet length for HTTP, and the red color presents the
    packet length for MQTT as shown in Fig. 2. The other lightweight protocol is CoAP
    (Constrained Application Protocol) used for power-constrained devices. In Fig.
    3, the average, minimum, and maximum packet length of non-lightweight protocol
    – Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) – and lightweight protocol (MQTT) is represented.
    In Fig. 4, the round-trip time comparison for Cloud IoT and Fog IoT architecture
    is presented. Fig. 2 Comparison of packet length for HTTP and MQTT protocol Full

    size image 7 Conclusion The Fog-enabled IoT architecture proposed reduces the
    round-trip time as the edge devices are closer to the sensor devices. The case
    study presented benefits the farmer to deploy precision agriculture techniques
    in the farm for increasing the crop yield. This model could be scaled to the entire
    rural area. The lightweight protocol is selected for service providing, because
    it aids in lowering the latency and achieving higher throughput. References S.

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: In 21st century, Internet of Things (IoT) is playing
    an important role in developing Smart cities. With the growth of IoT, data is
    growing with acceleration. As the data is growing the need to store data is also
    increasing. More the data, the latency will be high to store and retrieve data
    from the cloud. The concept of fog computing was originated to diminish the latency
    for accessing the data to and from the cloud. Fog computing imparts the storage,
    computing as well as networking services at the end point of the network. Fog
    nodes also have limited computational capabilities. Due to some weaknesses, fog
    computing and cloud computing cannot sustain alone, so both these technologies
    are integrated to build smart IoT infrastructure for Smart city. Fog computing
    have a major role and supreme responsibility in development of a Smart city. This
    paper discusses various applications of fog computing and their implementations
    in a Smart cities. It also proposes a prototype for Waste management system in
    a city. Fog computing can help to govern the waste collection of the city in a
    smart way. On the basis of our review, several open concerns and challenges of
    fog computing are discussed, and the directions for future researchers have also
    been discussed. Published in: 2018 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing

    Melbourne, VIC, Australia SECTION I. Introduction In the modern computing age,
    use of IoT has been increased with a very high speed. IoT requires portability
    reinforcement and geo-distribution in addition to locality recognition and low
    latency. The numbers of edge devices providing computational services are three
    to four billion approximately. This evaluation is expected to increase to a trillion
    in coming years [1]. The IoT connect real world things to the internet and allow
    the connected device to exchange statistics with minimal human interference. In
    IoT architecture, sensors that are interconnected with some applications produce
    data and send it to nearest sensor nodes [2]. In the smart city environment, due
    to global deployment of sensors, extreme data is produced, which increased the
    need of an architecture which can fulfill the requirement of devices to maintain
    data. Cloud computing possess a genre which is known as “Fog computing”. This
    genre brings the services provided by cloud near to the edge devices. Fog computing
    not solely executes latency-sensitive operations but also execute latency-tolerant
    task at powerful computing nodes at the intermediate of network. The genre of
    Cloud computing was introduced to fulfill the requirements of distinct segments
    of IoT i.e. Internet of Everything (IoE), Internet of Me (IoM). For example wearable
    gadgets, commercial, customer, transportation, healthcare, buildings, energy,
    consortium [6]. The concept of fog computing was introduced by Cisco in year 2012[7].
    The initial target of fog computing is to enhance the productivity and to decrease
    volume of data which is transferred to cloud for processing. For ease management
    of all resources fog layer act as an intermediate among devices and cloud data
    centers. Fog computing can provide services in various areas i.e surveillance,
    transportation sector, intelligent cities, health care and smart buildings. Fog
    computing can be used in different types of IoT services [7] [8]. First, Smart
    E-Health Gateway can be used for patients to monitoring their health status [10].
    Second, Smart homes can be improved by detecting the changes in temperature and
    air conditioning system. Emergency alarm can be activated and send the warnings
    to the owner [11]. Third, Smart cities can monitor traffic and transport systems
    with the help of IoT and fog. Fourth, Smart waste management system can be developed
    with the help of fog computing which can diminish the problems of increasing waste
    in the cities. A fog based Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a comprehensive
    virtualized gadget equipped with the storage, transmission and computing capacity
    [7]. Further sections of the article are explained as follows: Section II contains
    Motivation of the study, Section III Fog computing introduction, Section IV explains
    the Layered architecture of fog computing, Section V discusses applications of
    fog computing, Section VI explains load balancing in fog computing environment,
    Section VII discusses Review of Literature, Section VIII contains proposed methodology,
    Section IX is about the open issues and encouragements and finally Section X conclude
    the paper and explains the Future Scope. SECTION II. Motivation The motivation
    of this paper is to provide a smart waste management system which includes load
    balancing on the fog layer. This paper gives a brief discussion of the application
    areas of fog computing. The basic concepts of fog computing are discussed which
    includes advantages, disadvantages and architecture of fog computing. Fog layer
    requires load balancing to achieve resource efficiency, avoid overload in the
    network, to improve system performance and also to protect the system against
    failures. There are various existing smart waste management systems, but no system
    includes load balancing at the fog layer. This paper also discusses various open
    issues and challenges faced in fog environment. SECTION III. Fog Computing According
    to Cisco, fog computing is extension of cloud computing from network to edge devices.
    Fog computing is defined as a framework where a large number of heterogeneous
    devices collaborate with the network to execute a number of tasks without the
    intervention of arbitrator [3]. Satyanarayanan, et.al. [4] introduced the term
    “Cloudlets” for fog computing. But it was made known by Cisco as resourceful layer
    that is placed between the cloud and edge device. Fog brings the compute, communication
    and networking services near to the origin of data to speed up the process time
    and reduce the required cost. 1. Attributes of Fog Computing As the fog sector
    expands, virtualization is considered to be its key to success. There is requirement
    of fog to act as bridge between cloud and IoT devices because of few issues faced
    by cloud i.e. latency, versatility, security and transmission capacity. Concurrently,
    entire things cannot be executed from the edge due to capacity, reliability, energy
    consumption, overloaded nodes and security reasons. Fog computing is the emerging
    technology which has many characteristics. A few of them is discussed as follows:
    Distributed architecture: Architecture of Cloud computing is more centralized
    whereas architecture of fog is distributed. Nodes of fog can be arranged and can
    be accessed anytime within time, for example pipeline monitoring [5]. Reduced
    latency: The fog layer provides less response time because fog nodes are available
    near to the edge device. So fog computing provides less latency as compared to
    the cloud computing. One network node away from the edge: The fog layer is just
    one hop away from the edge due to which less bandwidth is required [4]. Quick
    mobile application support: Extension in storage and offloading in computation
    for various mobile applications are given support by fog computing. For example
    connected rail. End-user support: Fog nodes will be positioned at the edge device
    with heterogeneous end-user support [6]. Support for mobility: Any movable device
    can become a fog node. i.e. cars, mobile phones etc. 2. Need of Fog Computing?
    In cloud computing the users have to store data in the datacenters which are located
    far away from them. The storage locations of datacenters are kept confidential
    from the users. It also took an abundance of time to store and retrieve from the
    server. IoT demands less latency and higher bandwidth for data transmission to
    and from the cloud. Sometimes there is network problem and we cannot access the
    cloud in the way we want to, then it is very hard to access the data in case of
    emergency. Fog computing is the term used to provide solutions to the problems
    faced in cloud computing. It provides the computing, storage and other facilities
    near to the user''s end. Fog Computing is a genre of cloud computing that provides
    services to the edge device [9]. With the help of network connectivity, fog nodes
    can be distributed everywhere: On industrial level. Above the power pole. Beside
    rail lanes. In the smart grids [10]. 3. Interface of Fog with the Cloud and IoT
    As fog layer acts as intermediate layer to the IoT and the cloud, so it is required
    to be known in advance, that which data is to be stored on which storage location.
    It should be known that which data should be stored in fog nodes, which data should
    be sent to cloud layer. The real time data that needs fast processing should be
    stored on the fog layer. In the same way bulk storage and heavy duty computational
    data should be stored on the cloud [13]. Figure 1 Fog interface with cloud and
    IoT Show All 4. Existing Computing Technologies Compared to Fog Computing Existing
    computing technologies that depend upon cloud and on end-user devices for their
    computing and storage have to face various challenges like security, latency,
    data storage and maintenance. Fog can provide effective ways to overcome many
    limitations of the existing computing technologies. Fog can be compared to the
    other technologies in terms of various Quality of Service (QoS) based parameters
    i.e. Latency, bandwidth, security etc. The table below shows the comparison of
    fog computing with the cloud computing and IoT. Table 1: Comparison of fog with
    other related technologies 5. Advantages of Fog Computing Fog computing was introduced
    to overcome the problems faced by cloud computing, so it has some advantages that
    are listed below: Concurrence to end users: Fog is different from cloud by its
    concurrence to final-users. QoS Services: It provides reduced latency, location
    alertness, and boosts Quality of Services (QoS). Real time applications: Because
    of its low latency feature fog computing is used in real time applications i.e.
    municipal networks that hold vulnerable traffic and native data [15]. 6. Cons
    of Fog Computing The main disadvantage of fog computing is the complexity it brings
    to the computation, storage, and networking as part of the overall architecture.
    Few disadvantages of fog computing is explained as bellow: Security: Fog computing
    faces security issue as malicious users can attack on the gateways. Sometimes
    unauthenticated user enters in the network and tries to thieve the important information.
    Privacy: The privacy issue deals with hiding the details from the unauthorized
    persons. Anyone can access the fog nodes because they are easily accessible due
    to presence on the edge, sometimes unauthorized person can try to temper the data.
    Complexity: Fog computing contains a web of nodes which increases the complexity
    of the system. In fog computing environment everything can become fog node, so
    due to large number of fog nodes in the system, it increase the complexity. SECTION
    IV. Layered Architecture of Fog Computing The genre of cloud computing i.e. Fog
    computing have three layer architecture. The lower layer contains IoT devices.
    Fog layer is the middle layer. IoT devices are coupled to cloud layer via fog
    layer. Whole devices store their data on the cloud. The fog layer filters data,
    and the data which is not immediately required is redirected to the cloud. The
    frequently accessed data is stored on the fog layer. Layered architecture of fog
    computing is explained as below: Smart IoT Devices The millions of sensors nodes
    and embedded systems having low bandwidth and very low latency are used at this
    layer. Smart devices like smart buildings, smart phones, laptops, smart electricity
    bulbs, smart cars etc. can be considered as IoT devices which collect the data
    and send this data to the fog layer [14]. Fog Layer Network layer of fog is further
    subdivided into two parts: Fog network and Core network Fog Network: It includes
    3G/4G/5G/LTE/Wi-Fi etc multi edge services that are used to connect different
    sensing devices with the fog nodes. Fog nodes are used to filter data gathered
    by way of IoT devices and not frequently used data is redirected to the upper
    layer i.e. cloud layer. Core Network: Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), QoS,
    multicast and security are considered at this layer [15]. Cloud layer: This layer
    includes a lot of datacenters and cloud hosting IoT analytics. The huge data gathered
    through different IoT devices are stored in the large data centers located at
    various locations in the world. Figure 2 Architecture of fog computing Show All
    SECTION V. Applications of Fog Computing Fog works in distributed environment.
    It provides services to the final user at the edge device. Fog computing have
    various application areas that can be discussed as follows: a) Smart Healthcare
    Because of polluted environment various kinds of bacteria are being spread in
    the air which causes various diseases. Every person is busy today because of fast
    lifestyles. Smart Healthcare is the smart IoT which keeps track of activities
    of people and measures various parameters of their body and keeps on uploading
    the data on the fog nodes, which are being observed by the doctors. The data stored
    on the fog nodes are being used by doctors to treat the patients within time.
    The people are wearing perceptive devices and these are further linked to fog
    nodes which are continuously sending the measurements of body parameters (temperature,
    blood pressure etc.) in order to the fog nodes. These intelligent wearable devices
    help to keep track of people''s health [9]. Figure 3 Smart healthcare system [9]
    Show All b) Smart Parking Due to much increase in transportation in the cities,
    more parking spaces are required. People have to wander here and there to find
    the appropriate parking space for them. Fog computing introduced a new idea of
    Smart parking. With the use of fog computing the parking slots can be installed
    with the sensors which keep on tracking weather the parking lot is empty or full.
    These sensors continuously keep on sending data towards the fog nodes which can
    be further connected to the smart vehicles. Vehicles can get indication through
    fog nodes about their nearby free parking space[14]. c) Smart Agriculture Agriculture
    is the broad area to be given attention because this area is from where all the
    cities are getting food. Smart agriculture concept has been inaugurated in last
    few years. Smart sensing and computing are playing a significant responsibility
    in smart agriculture. A few smart agriculture approaches are invented in this
    area. Smart irrigation systems have been provided. Smart sensors are being fixed
    up in the fields [5]. Fog computing provides a platform for operating the sensors
    in the fields, which are continuously observing the crops. The sensors detect
    requirements of the crops and continuously store data in the fog nodes which send
    the alerts to the farmers about the requirements of the crops. The smart agriculture
    plays a crucial role for building a smart city. d) Smart Waste Management The
    earth is degrading day by day, and to conserve the planet we require keen attention
    towards the natural resources. Now days, daily growing waste and water depletion
    from the earth seeks more attention. Smart garbage management system can be classified
    as the solutions for betterment of environment in this time. Such smart systems
    will be developed with the help of cloud as well as fog computing to collect and
    manage the waste more efficiently [10]. Figure 4 Waste management system Show
    All SECTION VI. Load Balancing in Fog Computing Environment In a network, few
    systems remain under-loaded at some time interval, while the others carry the
    entire load of the network. To maintain the load in a balanced scheme, “Load Balancing”
    becomes necessary. “Load Balancing strives to distribute the load in identical
    proportions throughout resources depending on recourse capability in order that
    every useful resource isn''t overload or underutilized in a cloud device” [24].
    Load balancing also required to be done to avoid deadlock and reduce the server
    overflow problem [25]. Some of the goals of fog based load balancing are discussed
    as below: In case of any system failure, load balancing provides the backup plans.
    Performance substantially can be improved. Figure 5 Load balancing Show All SECTION
    VII. Review of Literature This section includes the review of some researchers
    based upon introduction and architecture of fog computing, waste management system
    and load balancing in fog environment. Simmhan et. al. [5] highlighted the gaps
    between capability and existence of fog computing, and diagnoses challenges that
    is required to be swamped for the sustainable resolution. They also discussed
    fog computing system architecture as well as resource characteristics of cloud,
    fog and edge computing systems. In the deployment of fog devices it is difficult
    to predict the user''s demand and according to that determine the quantity of
    resources required at different locations. We can resolve this problem by optimally
    placing the fog devices at appropriate locations to serve the requests of nearby
    mobile users. Charith Perera et.al.[14] has surveyed the various fog computing
    applications. They have discussed in detail about various applications and their
    implementation systems. According to them fog computing have scope in various
    areas like smart city, healthcare system, smart cultivation, Smart garbage management
    system and smart transportation etc. According to them sensing technology is improving
    day by day which is helpful in costs reduction. Sensing technology is helping
    in daily routine to build the smart city. Chiang et.al.[15] summarized the fog
    research opportunities, concentrates essentially on context networking of IoT.
    According to them fog is a legitimate extension of cloud. They correlated cloud
    and its genre i.e. Fog in distinct factors like size, distribution and utilization
    and bandwidth. Rajni [16] have studied about the variation in cost and makespan
    for execution of scientific applications due to increase in file size and network
    bandwidth. They also analyzed the impact of bandwidth; increased data file sizes,
    data transfer on total execution time and cost of scientific workflow application.
    They explained provisioning strategies and investigated the impact of Virtual
    Machine (VM) provisioning strategies by using different file sizes. The role of
    data and communication being interpreted here as other costs in case of scientific
    workflow applications has been taken here as a comprehensive study. Aazam et.al.[25]
    presented Smart Gateway based architecture of fog computing. The concept was tested
    based upon the upload time delay, synchronization delay, bulk-data and jitter.
    They have explained Smart Gateway into two types i.e. Single-node and multi-node
    communication with the Intelligent Gateway. According to the article, trimming
    and pre-processing of the data before transmitting to the Cloud data center is
    very important for better and quick service furnishing. Few of Existing Waste
    Management Systems have been Reviewed as Below Pooja V. Garach et al.[17] has
    developed a smart waste management system. They have advanced automated system
    in which ultrasonic sensor is being placed inside the trash cans and weight sensor
    at the bottom of trash cans. The sensors in trash cans detect whether the cans
    are empty or full, so that the collectors may get to know in advance about that.
    The data gathered through the sensors is then transferred to the cloud for storage
    and further use for various authorities. They have also surveyed algorithm implementation
    for Smart waste management (i.e. Dijkstra''s Algorithm and Ant Colony System).
    They have also suggested shortest path route for the garbage collector to collect
    the discarded matter. Dr. Latha Venkatesan et al [18] in their paper have developed
    smart alert system for garbage clearance by giving an alert signal to the cleaner.
    They have implemented real time waste management system to check whether the dustbins
    are full or not. They have used ultrasonic sensor along with arduino uno to check
    the level of garbage filled in the dustbin and also send alerts to the cleaners
    on their mobiles. People can get information through this system and can act accordingly.
    This system is implemented to reduce the cost, resource optimization and the traffic
    in the city. Harshita Chugh et al. [19] developed an intelligence bin which can
    be used to monitor waste through sensors and send the related detailed information
    to the internet. They have installed sensors in the bins and these bins are connected
    with each other''s, and they send data about the amount of discarded matter to
    the cloud from where higher authorities can take data to take suitable action
    about the discarded matter in the city. G. K. Shyam et. Al [20] presented a waste
    collection management solution by developing intelligent waste bins, using an
    IoT prototype with sensors. These intelligent bins can read, collect, and transfer
    a large volume of data over the internet. Real GIS (Global Information System)
    data is used for the simulation results. Table 2: Comparison of existing waste
    management systems Few Load Balancing Based Research Reviews are Given Below B.
    Sotomayor et. al. [28] explained that Round Robin algorithm is used for load balancing
    in static environment. In this the resources are provisioned to the task on first-cum-first-serve
    (FCFS-i.e. the task that entered first will be first allocated the resource) basis
    and scheduled in time sharing manner. The resource which is least loaded (the
    node with least number of connections) is allocated to the task. L. D. Dhinesh
    Babu [29] proposed an algorithm that is named as Honey Bee Behavior based Load
    Balancing (HBB-LB), which aims to achieve thoroughly balanced load across virtual
    machine. The proposed algorithm considers the priorities of the tasks which are
    assigned to VMs. The load balancing in VMs is based upon the honey bee''s self-organized
    behavior of foragers in honey bee colonies. D. Puthal et al. [30] proposed a novel
    load balancing technique to authenticate the Edge Data Centers (EDCs) and find
    less loaded EDCs for task allocation. An adaptive EDC authentication technique
    is proposed with the help of a centralized cloud data center. The proposed approach
    brings a sustainable and dynamic load balancing technique by considering the load
    of the destination EDCs. Breadth First Search method is used to design the proposed
    load balancing technique. N. Song et al. [31] presented a framework in which cloud
    atomization technology is used to convert the physical nodes in fog computing
    environment into virtual nodes. They represented a graph model of fog computing
    in which the vertex of the graphs represents the various fog nodes and the edges
    represents the task dependencies and the bandwidth consumed. The layered model
    of fog and a graph repartitioning algorithm is created for fog computing with
    the use of cloud automation system. They also compared the operating time between
    the dynamic repetition algorithm and the classical hybrid strategy in terms of
    increasing number of tasks. With the increase of number of tasks in fog computing
    environment, the load balancing becomes mandatory. X. Xu et al. [32] suggested
    a dynamic resource allocation method for load balancing in fog environment. They
    presented a system framework for fog computing and the load balance analysis for
    various types of computing nodes. They also designed resource allocation method
    in the fog environment through static resource allocation and dynamic service
    migration to achieve the load balance for the fog computing systems. The proposed
    method aims at high load balancing for all types of computing nodes i.e. cloud
    and fog nodes. They designed a global resource allocation strategy to enhance
    load balancing during the execution of the fog services. SECTION VIII. Proposed
    Methodology This article proposes a prototype of waste management system implementing
    load balancing at fog layer. The proposed prototype model contains three layers:
    Smart sensor devices, fog nodes/servers, Cloud datacenters. Smart bins will be
    deployed which will contain the sensors. These Smart bins will be further tied
    up to the fog layer which filters the data to be passed to the cloud. Load balancer
    will balance the load on the fog nodes. It will divide the load equally on all
    the nodes. Fog nodes will generate alert messages to notify the garbage carriers
    to collect the waste. Security sensors will also be installed in the bins which
    will inform about the safety of the bins. If anyone will try to temper the bins
    then these sensors will start playing loud noise signals which can save the stealing
    of bins. The Smart bins will be connected through Wi-Fi, 3G/4G, LTE to the fog
    layer. An application will be generated to operate the whole scenario. Fog layer
    will further connected to the cloud. CloudSim will be used to manage the cloud
    and the fog nodes. The subsequent figure shows the proposed prototype of waste
    management system Figure 6 Prototype of waste management system Show All Smart
    waste management system can help to develop a clean and green city. Figure 7 Proposed
    city to implement the prototype of waste management system Show All SECTION IX.
    Open Issues and Encouragements In the preceding sections we have explained few
    application scenarios of fog computing. There are various research work have been
    done in the explained field. Both IoT and fog computing are developing fields.
    There are few limitations of existing systems. Therefore, a fog platform should
    be developed in a manner that anyone can compose approaches for backing of new
    applications. Now a days, mobile marketing apps and fog computing are similar.
    In a mobile marketing app, number of apps are being designed to perform similar
    tasks but with the higher level of performance. Each application is different
    from each other. On the basis of requirement user can install or uninstall app
    at any time. Whereas mobile marketing apps, pays attention towards rules and guidelines
    which are worthy to be followed. Alike plug-ins to work consistently in fog platform,
    there ought to be some standardization, but applications should be accessible
    for resourcefulness. There are various open challenges that can be further worked
    upon. The following can be further explored: Communication between fog nodes:
    It can be further explored to find an architecture through which fog nodes can
    interface with each others. Detection of stolen Devices: Smart devices are costly
    than the other simple devices in the market. These can be stolen easily. So further
    work is required to be done to protect these gadgets. Security: Security is the
    biggest challenge in today''s world. Fog nodes need more security algorithms to
    be implemented. Load balancing: Load balancing is must in fog environment. Because
    it will cause problem if the few servers will be overloaded and the others will
    be underloaded. Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency can be a huge challenge in
    the fog computing. Power consumption of fog needs to be reduced. SECTION X. Conclusion
    and Future Scope Fog Computing can be efficiently used to construct Smart city
    scenario. The sensor technology has been developed nowadays, which can help us
    to generate smart things. All IoT devices send data to the cloud. Due to centralization
    of Cloud environment, it is becoming hard for different IoT devices to access
    data within time. Fog computing technology has been introduces which reduce the
    latency and provide the storage facilities at edge device i.e. near user device.
    Fog computing helped to create sustainable Smart cities. This research discussed
    about fog computing architecture and implementation of its applications in the
    Smart cities. This paper proposed a prototype for waste management system which
    includes the concept of load balancing on the fog layer. In further studies this
    prototype will be implemented to develop a smart city scenario, and energy consumption
    of fog nodes will be reduced. There are still more open areas for the future researchers
    i.e. Fog networking, resource provisioning, more advancement in transportation,
    security of fog nodes. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    \ (A.R.O.)\nAbstract: With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural\
    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\
    \ developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends\non the\
    \ farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with\
    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\
    \ ground sensors to the compute nodes in a\ncost-effective way by keeping the\
    \ data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In\nthis regard,\
    \ this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed\
    \ in\nprecision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with\
    \ respect to heavy metal in\nagricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly,\
    \ this manuscript illustrates the processing of data\ngenerated from the sensors.\
    \ In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from\ncloud computing\
    \ has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model\n\
    of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efﬁcient ofﬂoading\
    \ of data with smooth\nworkﬂow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims\
    \ to open a new corridor for the farming\nsector in developing nations by tackling\
    \ challenges and providing substantial consideration.\nKeywords: food security;\
    \ precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture; heavy metal;\nwireless\
    \ sensors; edge computing\n1. Introduction\nThe agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n2 of 37\n\
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\
    Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration rate [69].\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\
    \ such as heavy metal toxics. In addition, the next\nsubsection also highlights\
    \ the various wireless nodes and the associated microcontroller\nand transceiver.\n\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\

    \ measure barometric pressure, seismic waves,\netc. [172–174].\nFigure 11. Mica2\
    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\
    \ for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix,\nthread, and C programming environment\
    \ and is built using a hybrid programming model\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n20\
    \ of 37\nwhich allows programming, both event-driven and thread-driven. Some of\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\
    will also be possible to determine whether the treated wastewater is suitable\
    \ for irrigation at\na given point in time and what are the relevant crops on\
    \ which the treated wastewater can\nbe used, depending upon its composition [212].\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\
    \ expense of\ndelivering these services to the farmers. The government lacks substantial\
    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ into a wide range of modern\nIoT applications. The growing number of networked\
    \ IoT devices generates a large amount of data.\nHowever, processing and memorizing\
    \ this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed\ncritical challenges,\
    \ especially when using artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit\n\
    valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged\
    \ as a way to bring\ncloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to\
    \ address computation-intensive ofﬂoading\nand latency issues. This paper provides\
    \ a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works\nrelated to UAV technology\
    \ applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details\n\
    the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications\
    \ and the role of\nboth deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting\
    \ various limitations related to latency,\ntask ofﬂoading, energy demand, and\
    \ security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains\nan insight\
    \ into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges\
    \ to be\ntackled when using AI.\nKeywords: UAVs; IoT; cloud computing; edge computing;\
    \ MEC; AI; review\n1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is constantly\
    \ expanding to cover many ﬁelds\nand applications. IoT devices present many beneﬁts\
    \ for improving services in a broad\nrange of contexts. The number of connected\
    \ devices is forecasted to reach impressive\nheights in the coming years. According\
    \ to CISCO, more than 70 billion devices will be\nconnected by the end of 2025\
    \ [1,2]. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), typically\nknown as drones,\
    \ have attracted considerable attention from academia and industrial\ncommunities\
    \ due to their excellent capabilities and attractive features. They promise to\n\
    bring an ideal contribution to the ﬁeld of IoT, based on their unique characteristics.\
    \ They\noffer elastic and ﬂexible mobile features, as required in many omnipresent\
    \ IoT applications,\nmaking their integration into wireless network communication\
    \ easy and feasible.\nMoreover, integrating embedded intelligent devices such\
    \ as cameras and sensors on\nUAVs offer many advantages when monitoring hostile\
    \ and unreachable environments.\nIn addition, they can potentially provide many\
    \ services in the context of modern IoT\ninterconnection, such as smart cities,\
    \ smart farming, smart factories, smart grids, and\nintelligent transportation.\
    \ The development of communication protocols and networks\nhas also improved the\
    \ tracking and maneuverability of drones to cover many application\nrequirements,\
    \ as well as their contribution as a critical component of the communication\n\
    network [3]. UAVs can also guarantee reliable connectivity in hostile areas with\
    \ limited\nDrones 2021, 5, 148. https://doi.org/10.3390/drones5040148\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n2 of 30\nor unavailable communication infrastructure. Typically,\
    \ UAVs can be deployed as aided\ncommunication networks by integrating them into\
    \ the peripheral network as ﬂying base\nstations (BSs) [4,5], relay nodes [6],\
    \ or terminal nodes [7]. Therefore, they act primarily as a\nmeans of enabling\
    \ ﬂexible communication services in remote areas when interconnections\nwith existing\
    \ networks are lost. To this end, UAVs can be used in edge-computing (EC),\nfog-computing\
    \ (FC), and as crucial equipment in cellular networks [8].\nIoT networks enable\
    \ comprehensive connectivity for many mobile users by enabling\nvarious emerged\
    \ application services (e.g., automatic surveillance, unmanned control\nvehicles\
    \ and object recognition). Centralized servers, such as cloud computing (CC)\n\
    facilities and data centers, generally process and analyze the generated data\
    \ by carrying out\ncomputational intelligence based on artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI). These centralized systems\nare quick to deploy, inexpensive to maintain,\
    \ and practical when data need to be centrally\ncontrolled. However, they are\
    \ mostly constrained by their high failure rate, security risks\nand access delay.\
    \ Data processing at the central level causes considerable time delays that\n\
    affect the overall system quality of service (QoS), especially regarding the response-time\n\
    requirement for latency-sensitive applications. Decentralized and distributed\
    \ systems have\nemerged to solve the issue of centralized system constraints.\
    \ The decentralized system relies\non servers that are supposed to store a copy\
    \ of the resources. Users in distributed systems\nhave equal access to data, yet\
    \ user rights can be enabled as necessary, and data ownership\ncan be shared efﬁciently.\
    \ Hardware and software resources are also allocated between\nusers, increasing\
    \ truthfulness, reducing component failure, and enhancing reliability.\nEC has\
    \ recently been introduced to provide intermediate devices between the data\n\
    generator and CC services. This reduces latency and provides efﬁcient bandwidth\
    \ uti-\nlization. However, due to their limited computing power and battery life,\
    \ mobile devices\nstruggle to provide these services. To this end, mobile edge\
    \ computing (MEC) solutions\nhave been employed to ameliorate the intensive computation\
    \ and ofﬂoading bottlenecks\nbetween end-nodes and centralized data servers [9].\
    \ They allow mobile devices to ofﬂoad\ntheir computation duties onto servers at\
    \ the edge of the IoT network, such as cellular BSs\nor access points. In contrast\
    \ to traditional CC, MEC servers can be close to end-users. As a\nresult, MEC\
    \ servers can deliver low latency and secure services, while saving energy for\n\
    mobile users.\nRecently, UAVs have been integrated as air–ground equipment to\
    \ fulﬁll the processing\nand storage needs at IoT network edges. As a promising\
    \ solution, they could provide ultra-\nlow latency support for latency-sensitive\
    \ applications, facilitate the distribution of big data\nprocessing and analysis,\
    \ improve the scalability and management of massive mobile con-\nnectivity, as\
    \ well as content caching and mobile delivery [10]. The advantage presented by\n\
    their ﬂexible mobility has facilitated the integration of UAVs with MEC services\
    \ to provide\nUAV-enabled MEC networks. UAV-enabled MEC is typically deployed\
    \ in unpredictable\nenvironments such as in wild, desert, and complex landscapes.\
    \ Furthermore, the computa-\ntion performance may be adapted based on the distance\
    \ that UAVs can smoothly control.\nThis combination of UAV technology with MEC\
    \ makes the system more advantageous\nand ﬂexible than traditional MEC systems,\
    \ which are constrained by high deployment\ncosts due to their ﬁxed architecture.\
    \ In addition, the integration of UAV-enabled MEC\nwith the most recent security\
    \ approaches, such as the blockchain structure, increases the\nsecurity level\
    \ [11]. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that gives a secure, immutable,\n\
    transparent, and trustworthy environment for the UAVs to store their data as a\
    \ transaction\nin a chain of blocks [12]. This is a viable solution to mitigate\
    \ the security and privacy issues\nrelated to UAV networks. Therefore, integrating\
    \ blockchain into UAVs ensures the MEC\nsystem’s trustworthiness with the additional,\
    \ advantageous features of automating data\ntransaction, decision-making, storage,\
    \ and veriﬁcation [13]. Therefore, UAVs can play a\ncrucial role in enabling MEC\
    \ capability in IoT applications. However, many critical issues\nhave yet to be\
    \ addressed to improve the performance of UAV-enabled MEC. Most of the\nimpairments\
    \ are related to drones as they are autonomous and battery-powered, with\nlimited\
    \ resources. Furthermore, given the broadcast nature of communications between\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n3 of 30\nground-based users and UAVs, many performance aspects\
    \ should be addressed, including\nsecurity, task ofﬂoading, energy consumption,\
    \ resource allocation, computing capacity, and\nuser latency performance under\
    \ various channel circumstances.\nSince this topic is revolutionary in the IoT\
    \ research ﬁeld, reviewing the current sci-\nentiﬁc achievements and technological\
    \ limitations of UAV-enabled MEC networks is of\nparamount importance. Furthermore,\
    \ the limits of existing surveys on UAV-enabled MEC\nin IoT applications have\
    \ motivated us to put forward a detailed review. This paper explores\nthe use\
    \ of UAVs in emerging IoT applications and the utility of both deep learning (DL)\n\
    and machine learning (ML) in UAV-enabled MEC systems. For instance, the authors\
    \ of [14]\nhave elaborated a review about the energy efﬁciency constraints related\
    \ to UAV-enabled\nMEC systems for IoT devices. Additionally, the authors of [15,16]\
    \ have presented a survey\nabout communication and networking technologies for\
    \ UAVs. The research work presented\nin [17] has addressed both fundamental and\
    \ recent advances of computation ofﬂoading\nin UAV-enabled MEC. However, only\
    \ a few of the challenges are mentioned in the above\nworks, including energy,\
    \ communication facilities, and limited resource allocation issues.\nIn this paper,\
    \ the most critical issues and challenges of UAV-enabled MEC based on AI are\n\
    accurately outlined and discussed.\nIndeed, there are several recent reviews about\
    \ the UAV-enabled MEC paradigm. How-\never, most of the previous reviews have\
    \ focused on UAV energy efﬁciency, communication\ntechnologies connecting various\
    \ UAVs, and computation ofﬂoading in UAV-enabled MEC.\nOur review considers a\
    \ more practical and recent scenario wherein massively generated\ndata need to\
    \ be processed and analyzed using AI algorithms for decision-making at the\nedge\
    \ of networks. This has not been considered in the previous works. Adopting AI\n\
    methods would affect all the requirements that have already been investigated,\
    \ such as\nenergy efﬁciency, communication technologies, processing capacity,\
    \ privacy and security,\nand the autonomy of UAV-enabled MEC. Almost all domains\
    \ are currently relying on AI\nto outperform the traditional systems and provide\
    \ decision-making systems. For instance,\nIndustry 4.0 has newly emerged as a\
    \ revolutionary paradigm in which intelligent and\nautonomous drones based on\
    \ AI would be the key element. However, the integration of\nautonomous UAVs based\
    \ on AI is not obvious in most practical cases. This is why UAV-\nenabled MEC\
    \ based on AI would enable many applications in the industry community to\ndeploy\
    \ their solutions, by cooperatively executing and processing the massive volumes\n\
    of conﬁdential data near the users at the edge of the network. Consequently, the\
    \ current\nreview highlights the most recent challenges and open issues of UAV-enabled\
    \ MEC based\non AI, considering their various architectures and applications.\
    \ We will discuss the most\nrecent related works on data processing at the edge,\
    \ based on AI, and their advantages and\ninconveniences regarding the UAV environment.\
    \ We will even emphasize the effect of AI\non energy efﬁciency, communication\
    \ technologies, processing capacity, and security when\nUAV-enabled MEC architecture\
    \ is considered. In addition, we propose a list of applications\nwith open issues\
    \ that have to be taken into account when considering a UAV-enabled MEC\narchitecture.\n\
    The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of\
    \ UAVs and\nhighlights some of their related applications. Section 3 focuses on\
    \ the possible opportunities\nenabled by UAVs, focusing on MEC servers. Section\
    \ 4 highlights the UAV-enabled MEC\nbased on AI. Section 5 lists signiﬁcant issues\
    \ and open research directions related to UAV-\nenabled MEC systems. Finally,\
    \ Section 6 presents a conclusion.\n2. UAV System Model\nRecently, there has been\
    \ an increase in customer demand for airborne intelligence\nmissions, which has\
    \ led to the design and development of various types of UAVs in various\nshapes\
    \ and ﬂight modes. This section highlights the different styles and characteristics\
    \ of\nUAVs and their application scenarios.\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n4 of 30\n2.1.\
    \ UAVs Classiﬁcation\nDeploying a UAV network (known as swarms in IoT contexts)\
    \ is becoming a practical\nand necessary requirement for many applications. Various\
    \ UAVs are currently available\non the market, with distinctive features such\
    \ as supportable altitude, speed, and battery\nautonomy, for multiple applications.\
    \ Generally, the selection of any UAV model should\nfulﬁll many of the criteria\
    \ of the targeted application, such as QoS, energy capacity, envi-\nronmental\
    \ restrictions, and federal rules [18]. There are three types of UAVs: low-altitude\n\
    platforms (LAPs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and satellites. Since this work\
    \ focuses\non UAV-enabled MEC, UAVs are described based on many aspects.\nFigure\
    \ 1 categorizes UAVs into the LAPs category based on their type, size, range,\n\
    and type of rotors. Figure 2 shows the shape and form of three kinds of commercialized\n\

    UAVs: a rotary-wing drone (Figure 2a), a fixed-wing drone (Figure 2b), and a fixed\
    \ wing \nhybrid VTOL UAV (Figure 2c). \nTypically, UAVs present unique characteristics,\
    \ being dynamic, agile, easy to repair, \neasy to deploy, and offering the potential\
    \ to provide various measurements wherever and \nwhenever required. They provide\
    \ a low-cost alternative for collecting and providing \ninformation to intelligent\
    \ systems that can undertake the necessary data analysis (e.g., \nreal-time image\
    \ or video analysis). UAVs will substantially promote the progress of \nfarming,\
    \ defense, insurance inspection, law enforcement, emergency assistance, pollution\
    \ \nmonitoring, disaster recovery, and package delivery. \nThe data are collected\
    \ remotely through controllable devices installed on UAVs, each \ntriggered via\
    \ the platform. The collected data are processed locally onboard the UAVs or \n\
    are offloaded to cloud servers, based on the required power. Deploying a practical\
    \ UAV-\nbased IoT framework requires an orchestrator platform that recognizes\
    \ various contextual \ninformation about UAVs, such as flight trajectories, IoT\

    \ measurements wherever\nand whenever required. They provide a low-cost alternative\
    \ for collecting and providing\ninformation to intelligent systems that can undertake\

    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n6 of 30\n2.2. UAV-Enabled Services\nUAV technology’s appealing\
    \ ﬂexibility and mobility characteristics have drawn atten-\ntion in terms of\
    \ integration with other networks as a way to address various challenging\napplications.\
    \ UAVs can be a part of IoT networks, referred to as the Internet of Flying\n\
    Things (IoFT) [25]. The IoFT can improve the availability of IoT services in areas\
    \ with poor\ncommunication coverage and limited infrastructures. For instance,\
    \ UAVs can provide FC\nand EC services and cellular communications in rural or\
    \ developing regions and submarine\nenvironments. As a result, reaching hostile\
    \ and congested environments has become easier\nand faster, thus improving emergent\
    \ intervention wherever and whenever it is required.\nAs support to communication\
    \ networks, UAVs can be dispatched as peripheral nodes with\nvarious operating\
    \ units, such as ﬂying BSs, relay nodes, or end-node stations [7]. UAVs act\n\
    as relay/terminal nodes related to disconnected nodes, stabilizing communication\
    \ links\nin an ad hoc manner. A set of deployed UAVs can thereby form a ﬂying\
    \ ad hoc network\n(FANET), which is a subclass of the mobile ad hoc network (MANET)\
    \ [26].\nIn IoT networks, UAVs can potentially adopt many recent cellular and\
    \ non-cellular\nwireless communication networks to control the UAV on the one\
    \ hand, and to enhance\nthe coverage and latency services on the other. The most\
    \ prominent communication pro-\ntocols that can be used with UAVs are IEEE 802.11\
    \ (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMax), IEEE\n802.15.4 (LRWPAN), cellular networks (3G/4G),\
    \ IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), LoRaWAN\n(LoRa), SigFox and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ [27–31]. Typically, the choice of communica-\ntion protocol depends on the desired\
    \ achievable throughput, power consumption, range,\nimplementation cost, reliability,\
    \ delay, and security. Grouped according to application\nrequirements, the characteristics\
    \ of the most-used communication protocols are presented\nin [32]. As described\
    \ in Table 2, there are various available communication protocols that\ncan be\
    \ used in UAV-enabled MEC. Each protocol is given a list of advantages and disad-\n\
    vantages regarding data rate, coverage, deployment cost, energy consumption, latency,\n\
    spectrum availability, and the number of supported users. Thus, the use of communication\n\
    technology depends literally on the application requirements.\nAlong with high\
    \ mobility and scalability, UAVs can offer many potential opportu-\nnities in\
    \ terms of enabling services such as pervasive connectivity, aerial intelligence,\n\
    self-maintenance capabilities for communications, and sensor deployment. Therefore,\n\
    UAVs act as airborne BSs [33], data collectors, relay nodes [34], jammers [35],\
    \ monitors [36],\nedge- and cloud computing servers [37], and power suppliers\
    \ [38] to support IoT applica-\ntions. These will extend network coverage and\
    \ provide diversiﬁed and ﬂexible intelligence\nfacilities for new potentialities\
    \ in modern IoT applications. In summary, as illustrated\nin Figure 3, UAVs can\
    \ facilitate a wide range of solutions in IoT applications. They can\nprovide\
    \ intelligent communications by establishing wireless networks in inaccessible\
    \ and\nhazardous environments; they also enable parallel intelligent areal services,\
    \ such as CC,\nEC, and LC.\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n7 of 30\nTable 2. Characteristics\

    Table 3 shows a list of UAV applications in various domains, their advantages\

    Drones have been used to monitor large agricultural fields to detect specific\
    \ diseases \nthat threaten the quality of plants at an early stage. The implemented\
    \ system can predict \nfarm diseases in real-time by exploiting image processing\
    \ and AI classification based on \nIoT architecture, using real-time data acquisition\
    \ [39]. In ref. [40], the authors have \nproposed an architecture combining UAVs\
    \ and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with \nIoT approaches to provide precise\
    \ ecological agriculture. Another architecture for crop \nmapping monitoring and\
    \ disease assessment-based satellite imagery using the DL \napproach has been\
    \ proposed to analyze the images acquired through UAV airborne \nmultispectral\
    \ sensors [41]. Additionally, UAVs can efficiently enhance the productivity of\
    \ \nfarming activities, as referenced in [42–44]. In addition, UAVs play an exciting\
    \ role in crop \nmonitoring by facilitating many tasks previously restricted to\
    \ the laborer and farmer [45–\n47]. \n• \nIndustry 4.0: \nUAV\nIntelligent communications\n\

    Drones have been used to monitor large agricultural ﬁelds to detect speciﬁc diseases\n\
    that threaten the quality of plants at an early stage. The implemented system\
    \ can predict\nfarm diseases in real-time by exploiting image processing and AI\
    \ classiﬁcation based on IoT\narchitecture, using real-time data acquisition [39].\
    \ In ref. [40], the authors have proposed an\narchitecture combining UAVs and\

    \ agriculture. Another architecture for crop mapping monitoring\nand disease assessment-based\

    \ can efﬁciently enhance the productivity of farming activities, as referenced\n\
    in [42–44]. In addition, UAVs play an exciting role in crop monitoring by facilitating\
    \ many\ntasks previously restricted to the laborer and farmer [45–47].\n•\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0:\nThe increasing demand for fast and low-cost productivity has encouraged\
    \ the indus-\ntrial and research communities to incorporate robotics into the\
    \ industrial process. UAVs\nhave recently attracted the attention of industrial\
    \ solution providers in response to the\nincreased need for productivity; for\
    \ instance, the authors proposed an industrial IoT-based\nsystem that collects\
    \ data by a UAV camera and sends it to a cloud server for process-\ning [48].\
    \ The design aims to monitor the industrial zone to prevent undesirable incidents\n\
    in the production process, relying on the robust intelligence of computer vision\
    \ (CV) ap-\nproaches [49,50]. The mining industry has also increased the level\
    \ of interest in drones for\n3D mapping, mine safety, and mine management [51].\n\
    •\nEnvironment:\nUAVs are being adopted as a means to monitor and survey various\
    \ environmental\nareas. They can be used for the monitoring and data aggregation\
    \ of archeological sites. For\nexample, the authors of [52] have reported that\
    \ UAVs can present accurate and precise\nimages of the studied archeological space,\
    \ compared to terrestrial measurements. UAV\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n10 of 30\ntechnologies\
    \ can also be deployed in ecological monitoring systems to track wildlife in\n\
    heterogeneous territories and topographically challenging areas as a supporting\
    \ platform\nfor traditional techniques [53]. Besides, this technology may facilitate\
    \ geological researchers\nwhen collecting remote data about many species and animals\
    \ [54]. Moreover, the authors\nof [55] proposed an intelligent model based on\
    \ UAV, dedicated to monitoring several types\nof plants using the latest computer\
    \ vision algorithms and cloud computing technologies.\nUAVs are also used to track\
    \ wild animals over large areas [56].\n•\nHealth and emergency:\nDrones can offer\
    \ several beneﬁts for public health emergencies, for instance, tackling\nepidemics\
    \ and contagious diseases such as COVID-19. For instance, during the COVID-19\n\
    pandemic, some governments and countries adopted drones to survey the rapid spread\n\
    of the virus, diagnose patients, and then predict the mortality risk factor by\
    \ applying AI\napproaches to the collected data. The drones have been used to\
    \ observe crowds, broadcast\ncritical public announcements and information, spray\
    \ disinfectants, and carry out extensive\ntemperature measurements in several\
    \ residential areas [57]. Additionally, the lifeguard\ncommunity uses UAVs for\
    \ search and rescue missions requiring rapid intervention. Their\nversatility\
    \ also allows obtaining a quick overview of the rescue situation instead of using\n\
    human-crewed airplanes that may take extra time to deploy [58]. Relying on UAV-enabled\n\
    MEC, AI, and CV schemes could lead to new applications that simulate visual reality,\n\
    thus enabling faster and real-time decisions in emergency interventions. For instance,\n\
    UAVs typically detect obstacles by ﬂying over them, gathering data, extracting\
    \ the most\nprominent features, and making decisions based on machine vision and\
    \ pattern recognition\ntechnologies. In this manner, people with visual impairments\
    \ can maneuver comfortably.\nThis technology is expected to be a key solution\
    \ in the healthcare revolution [58].\n•\nSmart cities and smart homes:\nThe urban\
    \ environment is expected to acquire a massive number of dynamically\nconnected\
    \ devices due to diverse activities wherein UAVs as mobile vehicles will have\
    \ many\npivotal roles, including real-time trafﬁc control [59], transportation\
    \ [60], infrastructure\ncontrol and management [61], and buildings observation\
    \ [62]. Accordingly, UAVs are\nexpected to provide communication services to heterogeneous\
    \ smart devices in urban\nareas, to improve the smart city from application perspectives\
    \ [63]. For example, the\nauthors of [64] have proposed an architecture for 5G\
    \ hierarchical IoT networks where the\nUAVs play a fundamental role as a data\
    \ fusion center, formation controller, and network\ngateway. In another context,\
    \ UAVs were used to perform lightweight parts delivery to\nworkstation operators\
    \ within a manufacturing plant, where GPS could not provide a\npractical solution\
    \ for indoor positioning, in addition to intelligent shipping, intelligent\nmonitoring,\
    \ and intelligent control [65].\n•\nNatural disaster tracking:\nDuring natural\
    \ disasters, a rapid and effective response is required to assist the popu-\n\
    lation, avoid increasing the number of victims, and minimize the economic impact.\
    \ UAVs\ncan respond quickly to earthquake help requests, ﬁnd missing people, and\
    \ facilitate the\nmonitoring and rescue of victims in danger of drowning during\
    \ ﬂoods [66,67]. Collecting\na large amount of data from different sensors deployed\
    \ in the environment, using UAV-\nenabled MEC with AI algorithms, can help to\
    \ rapidly predict and intervene in natural\ndisasters such as tornadoes, volcanic\
    \ eruptions, tsunamis, and storms.\n•\nConstruction:\nUAV-enabled MEC and computer\
    \ vision techniques are promising solutions for the\ncondition assessment of civilian\
    \ and public infrastructures. UAVs are being used increas-\ningly in many construction\
    \ tasks, such as building inspections [68], building condition\nmonitoring, damage\
    \ assessments of buildings after disasters [69], public site surveying\nand mapping\
    \ [70], safety inspections of construction sites and workers, and monitoring\n\
    the progress of construction [71].\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n11 of 30\nTable 3. Comparative\

    \ to harnessing the full potential of UAV communi-\ncations for cellular and wireless\
    \ communications in the networks industry. The research\ncommunity explored the\
    \ opportunity of UAV-mounted utilization via ﬂying relays and BSs\nthat can dynamically\
    \ reposition themselves to boost network coverage, increase spectral\nefﬁciency,\
    \ and improve user QoS. The UAVs enable low-altitude supports beyond line-of-\n\
    sight (LOS) control and reliable communications [72]. Furthermore, UAVs can bring\
    \ many\nfacilities to cellular IoT-based networks by providing processing facilities\
    \ near the ground\nfor users.\n2.4. UAV-Enabled and -Assisted MEC Architecture\n\
    Centralized networks are easy to maintain because they have just one point of\
    \ failure.\nHowever, due to the instability of the system categories, this design\
    \ is insufﬁcient to\nrespond to ubiquitous applications. A single issue affecting\
    \ the core server might destroy\nthe entire system. Unlike centralized networks,\
    \ distributed networks are deemed more\nstable due to their decentralized architecture,\
    \ since the entirety of the information system\nis dispersed among a vast number\
    \ of nodes that maintain similar conditions. This feature\nimproves distributed\
    \ system security by making it challenging to target many users.\nFurthermore,\
    \ blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed ledger that provides a\nsecure,\
    \ immutable, transparent, and trustless environment due to its distributed architec-\n\
    ture. Integrating this approach with UAVs allows them to record their data in\
    \ the chain of\nblocks as a transaction, ensuring their trustworthiness [74].\
    \ The essential foundations of\nblockchain technology are intelligent contracts\
    \ and consensus mechanisms. This method\neliminates the requirement for a trusted\
    \ third-party system to protect data privacy since\nconsensus techniques maintain\
    \ data integrity. The use of cryptographic methods guaran-\ntees that data on\
    \ blockchains are secure. These exciting blockchain characteristics increase\n\
    the applicability of UAVs in a variety of civil and mission-critical applications\
    \ that use\nUAV-enabled MEC architecture. Moreover, distributed systems outperform\
    \ centralized\nsystems in terms of network speed, since the information is not\
    \ stored in a central lo-\ncation, and the number of users attempting to access\
    \ a server is more signiﬁcant than\nthe server can support, causing long waiting\
    \ times and slowing down the system for\ndecentralized architecture.\nMoving all\
    \ computing activities to the cloud has proven an effective mechanism to\nprocess\
    \ data since the cloud offers greater processing capacity than network edge devices.\n\
    However, data-processing speeds have risen rapidly due to the size of communicated\
    \ data\nand the networks’ bandwidth. Therefore, CC suffers from bottlenecks due\
    \ to the massive\nvolume of data generated in real time. Cameras in UAVs capture\
    \ a tremendous amount\nof video data, which the system should process in real-time\
    \ to enable good decision-\nmaking. Sending data from UAVs to the cloud server\
    \ would mostly result in longer\ndelays. Deploying a large number of IoT devices,\
    \ such as UAVs, would restrict bandwidth,\nreliability and security. Therefore,\
    \ processing data at the network edge would yield shorter\nresponse times, more\
    \ efﬁcient processing, and less pressure on the network.\nMEC is widely acknowledged\
    \ as a vital technology to implement many methods for\nnext-generation IoT applications.\
    \ Due to their versatility and ease of deployment, UAVs\ncan play various roles\
    \ in delivering edge computing services. UAV-enabled MEC designs\ncan be classiﬁed\
    \ and dedicated to a speciﬁc application scenario. A UAV can be considered\nas\
    \ a mobile EC server, an IoT node, or a relay. Firstly, UAVs can participate in\
    \ the system as\nmobile devices when they ofﬂoad their computing to an MEC server.\
    \ Secondly, the UAV\ncan act as the MEC responsible for monitoring a group of\
    \ mobile end nodes. Thirdly, the\nUAV can serve as a relay or gateway between\
    \ mobile end nodes and an MEC server.\nThe UAV may be regarded as a speciﬁc user\
    \ that could ofﬂoad those computing tasks\nexceeding its memory and processing\
    \ capacity to a MEC server, as shown in Figure 4a.\nUAVs typically have limited\
    \ battery capacity and insufﬁcient memory and computing\npower to execute complex\
    \ computational tasks. As a result, ofﬂoading their processing to\nDrones 2021,\

    \ once the ground-based users ofﬂoad their\ncomputation responsibilities to the\
    \ latter. In the third scenario depicted in Figure 4c, the\nUAV serves as a central\
    \ relay, assisting mobile users to ofﬂoad their computing tasks to a\nspeciﬁc\

    \ of UAV-enabled MECs \nto provide low latency and high-reliability services to\
    \ IoT devices, numerous challenges \nremain. These challenges are found in intra-UAV\
    \ communication, UAV security, air data \nsecurity, data storage, and management.\
    \ Moreover, the coordination between UAVs and \nground-based users requires considerable\
    \ improvement due to the system’s mobility \ncharacteristics, which complicate\
    \ communication. Another significant limitation of UAVs \nis found in their low\
    \ onboard battery capacity. In addition to the energy spent in hovering, \naccelerating/decelerating,\
    \ and climbing up/down, additional energy is consumed due to \nonboard computations.\
    \ Therefore, designing efficient methods for resource and energy \nmanagement\
    \ is urgently required. \nFurthermore, one of the major design problems regarding\
    \ computation task \nrequirements is the joint trajectory design in UAV-enabled\
    \ MEC networks. In this regard, \nresearch efforts should emphasize how to forecast\
    \ mobile user movement and follow the \ntrajectory so that computing activities\
    \ can be offloaded quickly, and computation results \nmay be sent back to users\
    \ on time. The trajectory design is especially challenging when \ndealing with\

    \ the\nlatency delay, including recalling the computation resources from the cloud\
    \ to the edge of\nthe network.\nAs an extension of the edge concept, recently,\
    \ MEC was intensively investigated.\nMEC can bring information technology (IT)\
    \ services and cloud-computing capabilities\nto a mobile network, guaranteeing\
    \ ultra-low delays and offering high bandwidth to the\nuser [76]. UAVs can be\
    \ embedded with lightweight CPUs (central processing units) or\nGPUs (graphics\
    \ processing units) to offer computation services. Therefore, UAVs ﬂy MEC\nservers\

    \ MEC and Assisted MEC Based on AI\nMEC is an effective method for overcoming\
    \ time-constrained computing challenges\nin resource-constrained mobile IoT devices.\
    \ The objective is to bring CC services closer\nto customers to minimize latency\
    \ and backhaul network congestion. UAVs with storage\nunits, processing, and communication\
    \ capabilities can function as ﬂying MEC servers at\nthe IoT system’s edge. In\
    \ this context, resource-constrained IoT devices may ofﬂoad their\nDrones 2021,\
    \ 5, 148\n19 of 30\ncomputing activities, either partially or totally, to MEC-server-mounted\
    \ UAVs through\ndirect line-of-sight connectivity. Nevertheless, the system faces\
    \ many challenges related to\ntask prediction, UAV deployment, users’ association,\
    \ signal processing, and joint resource\nallocation. Considering the EC architecture,\
    \ UAVs with ﬂexibility and mobility are likely\nto deliver decentralized solution\
    \ perspectives signiﬁcantly. The ﬂying edge architecture is\nintended to improve\
    \ the CC capabilities of latency-sensitive and real-time IoT applications.\nThis\
    \ enables computing ofﬂoading at the edge of IoT devices rather than centralized\
    \ data\ncenters, reducing communication latency and facilitating real-time decision-making\
    \ and\ncontrol. Since the IoT system operates with many end-devices, a large quantity\
    \ of data\nis ofﬂoaded to the edge devices; this requires developing mechanisms\
    \ that manage and\nexploit the data for various purposes, such as auto-maintenance,\
    \ self-monitoring, and\nprediction. There is a considerable difference between\
    \ EC devices and centralized cloud\nservers regarding their processing capacities\
    \ and memory, limiting multiple AI technolo-\ngies for data processing at the\
    \ edge. Therefore, numerous criteria should be considered\nwhen incorporating\
    \ any AI technique to proﬁt from their robustness, due to memory ca-\npacity and\
    \ energy consumption constraints [111]. EC delivers resources in a decentralized\n\
    manner, allowing faster addressing of user demands than a regular CC, even with\
    \ limited\ncomputational capability. Various challenges arise, such as task scheduling,\
    \ resource allo-\ncation, and ofﬂoading, substantially inﬂuencing the overall\
    \ performance. Nevertheless,\nmost of the proposed solutions are characterized\
    \ by non-convexity and complexity, as\nthey enable continuous learning ability\
    \ for the dynamic environment and make a real-time\ninference with low computational\
    \ complexity. Applying AI to networking challenges has\ngained popularity over\
    \ the past few decades. For instance, ML has been widely used\nin the networking\
    \ domain due to its ability to interact with complex environments and\nmake decisions.\
    \ It may also provide eminent solutions to improve network performance in\nmany\
    \ subdomains, such as resource allocation, network trafﬁc prediction and classiﬁcation,\n\
    congestion control, and routing [32].\nIn most UAV-enabled MEC architectures,\
    \ a controller called the follow-me cloud\n(FMC) collects information about overall\
    \ system states (i.e., users, UAVs, and MEC servers).\nThis control unit is in\
    \ charge of managing ofﬂoading activities using AI technologies.\nFigure 5 displays\
    \ an example of a cloudlet mounted on a UAV for a UAV-assisted MEC\nsystem. The\
    \ UAV receives ofﬂoaded tasks from an IoT device and sends the results back\n\

    \ not require labeled training data for resource allocation. Thus,\nit may enhance\
    \ the process of ofﬂoading choices based on various states of the channel en-\n\
    vironment. This results in reducing the energy bandwidth and computations. To\
    \ that end,\nan MDP method was provided to reduce the delay, energy consumption,\
    \ and bandwidth\nin UAV-assisted MEC by analyzing the instability of energy arrival,\

    \ have proved that the deep supervised learning (DSL) method min-\nimizes the\
    \ computation and ofﬂoading overheads and cost of mobile users in the MEC\nsystem.\
    \ This technique allows terrestrial users to obtain an optimal ofﬂoading policy,\
    \ with\nenergy-saving and processing speed enhancement.\nThe authors of [91] have\
    \ investigated the challenges associated with applying AI\ntechniques to UAV-NOMA-MEC\
    \ networks. They proposed an architecture that relies\non AI-based approaches,\
    \ particularly on federated learning and reinforcement learning.\nThe proposed\
    \ framework was dedicated to enabling terrestrial mobile users to ofﬂoad\ntheir\
    \ computational tasks simultaneously, intelligently, and ﬂexibly, thus enhancing\
    \ their\nconnectivity and reducing their transmission latency and energy consumption.\n\
    The authors of [135] used RL and transfer learning algorithms to reduce the latency\
    \ and\nenergy consumption in UAV-enabled MEC networks. They proved that transfer\
    \ learning,\nwhen combined with RL, could signiﬁcantly enhance the system training\
    \ performance\nwhen the users operated dynamically.\nAn optimization problem based\
    \ on MDP was formulated by the authors of [35] to\naddress UAV trajectory optimization\
    \ in UAV-mounted MEC networks. The approach\naimed to enhance the overall system\
    \ QoS, maximize the long-term system reward, and\nmeet the QoS constraint, including\
    \ the computation tasks of mobile users. In [136], the\nauthors have used the\
    \ semi-Markov process and DRL-based algorithms to address the\nUAV-enabled MEC\
    \ networks’ ofﬂoading decisions and resource management policies.\nThe authors\
    \ of [137] have developed a platform known as a ﬂying UAV MEC, in which\nUAVs\
    \ are outﬁtted with computing resources and provide task-ofﬂoading services to\
    \ users.\nThe suggested architecture’s primary purpose was to maximize UAV aerial\
    \ trajectory,\nuser association, and resource allocation. The trajectory control\
    \ method has been used\nto address the optimization issue, assisted by an RL-based\
    \ technique. The results of this\napproach outperformed the results of the equivalent\
    \ benchmark methods. Moreover, the\nauthors of [138] formulated an ML-based novel\
    \ framework to optimize UAV trajectories\nby estimating the user’s mobility data\
    \ to ﬁnd optimal initial UAV placement locations.\nThe joint problem, consisting\
    \ of UAVs trajectories and power control to improve the sum\nrate and maintain\
    \ the data rate requirements of mobile users, was also addressed in the\nemployment\
    \ of a multi-agent Q-learning-based technique. A smart ofﬂoading based on the\n\
    deep Q-learning approach was proposed by the authors of [139] to optimize performance\n\
    in terms of the delay perceived by ground devices connected to the FANET, to enable\
    \ MEC\nin the 5G ﬁeld.\n5. Discussion and Open Issues\nComputational intelligence,\
    \ when combined with UAVs, has improved the underlying\ntechnologies and implementations\
    \ of IoT applications. Nevertheless, researchers should\naddress the remaining\
    \ challenges. Therefore, some signiﬁcant issues need more attention\nin order\
    \ to beneﬁt from UAVs for the realization of ﬂying ECs. These issues may be\n\
    related to scientiﬁc, technological, and societal problems, including challenges\
    \ regarding\nthe technical aspects of the technology, security and privacy concerns,\
    \ and standardization.\nThe challenges concern both the UAVs themselves and EC\
    \ devices. Therefore, great effort\nis needed to address the following challenges.\n\
    Energy consumption: In any UAV-enabled IoT system, most sensors, edge devices,\
    \ and\ndrones are battery-powered and can only remain powered for a limited period.\
    \ Therefore,\nefﬁcient energy consumption protocols and mechanisms are essential\
    \ for UAVs and IoT de-\nvices to ensure a long network lifetime. Improvement efforts\
    \ should address the hardware\nand software architecture of the IoT components\
    \ by integrating energy-harvesting solutions\nor efﬁcient routing protocols. For\
    \ example, AI schemes can be adopted to predict a UAV’s\nresidual energy and energy\
    \ dissipation through the precise adjustment of transmission\nand control parameters\
    \ concerning channel changes. The processing energy dissipation,\ncommunication\
    \ energy, storage energy, and environmental reliability should be considered\n\
    to mitigate the energy of UAVs [115,140]. Moreover, the issues listed below should\
    \ also\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n22 of 30\nbe considered to mitigate energy consumption,\
    \ to extend the on-air ﬂying time of the\nUAVs employed.\nInterference: The communication\
    \ links between UAVs and IoT devices may become\ndisconnected due to interference,\
    \ which reduces latency performance and may also affect\nthe overall network,\
    \ especially when the UAVs act as a mobile BS. Therefore, the problem\nof interference\
    \ should be addressed, especially in urban and industrial environments,\nwhere\
    \ the number of interconnected devices on the same frequency band is very dense.\
    \ An\nAI-based solution can be applied in UAV-enabled MEC to predict the signal-to-interference\n\
    ratio, based on the collected channel state information (CSI). It is then possible\
    \ to decide on\nthe most appropriate scheme to combat the impact of interference\
    \ or to adjust transmission\nparameters in order to reduce power consumption.\n\
    Interoperability: In any IoT environment, many devices are expected to handle\
    \ the\nrequired tasks without any effort from the end-users. These devices try\
    \ to connect and\ninteract with each other using different protocols and communication\
    \ paradigms. With\nthis diversity, it is sometimes challenging to orchestrate\
    \ the system smoothly. Therefore,\nfurther investigations are necessary to unify\
    \ the controller and communication protocols to\nensure interoperability among\
    \ them.\nMobility and path planning: UAVs require auto-maneuvering without distant\
    \ hu-\nman pilot intervention in random dynamic IoT applications. Therefore, many\
    \ intelligent\nmethods should be considered to enable autonomous UAV ﬂights that\
    \ include collision\navoidance. AI algorithms are the most viable solutions that\
    \ can be used to detect obsta-\ncles and avoid collisions [141]. For instance,\
    \ DL techniques can enable learning from the\ngathered data, which makes their\
    \ integration into UAV a signiﬁcant solution. A serious\neffort should be considered\
    \ to develop green-federated AI solutions, such as RL, to ensure\naccurate auto-ﬂying\
    \ decisions and path and trajectory planning [35,132].\nScalability: The scalability\
    \ challenges concern resources, applications, load balancing,\nand connections.\
    \ Enabling high scalability requires designing efﬁcient schemes that could\neffectively\
    \ manage heterogeneous mobile devices and servers in a UAV-enabled MEC\nenvironment,\
    \ with its highly dynamic demand behavior. For example, some mobile appli-\ncations,\
    \ such as UAVs and autonomous driving, require high data throughput ofﬂoading\
    \ to\nsuccessfully provide such services, despite heterogeneity in the number\
    \ of mobile devices\nand the dynamic demand behavior of the applications mentioned\
    \ in the MEC environment.\nThe MEC system should have an acceptable degree of\
    \ scalability regarding the number\nof servers and services required. As a result,\
    \ it is challenging for difﬁcult areas to estab-\nlish connections and communications\
    \ between mobile devices and servers. To achieve\nconvenient and cost-effective\
    \ mobility and scalability, resulting in continuous service, it is\nnecessary\
    \ to have a stable connection, even in adverse environmental conditions.\nSecurity:\
    \ Drones enable ubiquitous services on an IoT scale. The communications\nand controls\
    \ are realized through P2P wireless transmissions and thus are open to many\n\
    security threats. Therefore, unauthorized connections threaten the system’s privacy.\
    \ It is\nnecessary to propose and design security mechanisms to improve UAV-enabled\
    \ MEC sys-\ntems’ security [142]. The effort should focus on the physical, application,\
    \ and MAC layers.\nThe solutions should integrate recent robust techniques such\
    \ as blockchains, especially\nin IoT applications where UAVs are expected to facilitate\
    \ communication networks. The\ncombination of UAVs with blockchain and AI is now\
    \ an exciting avenue of research to\npredict all sorts of attacks and malware\
    \ that threaten the system’s privacy [127]. However,\nwhile there has been signiﬁcant\
    \ progress in this area, more work needs to be done. Power\nconsumption might\
    \ be a critical constraint for blockchain-based applications as they need\nmore\
    \ computing power. Increasingly complex attacks, such as quantum attacks, ML,\
    \ and\ntheory-based game attacks, could challenge the privacy of blockchain systems\
    \ [143]. More\nresearch is needed to make private blockchain networks more immutable\
    \ and secure in\nUAV-enabled MEC architectures. Moreover, blockchain-enabled softwarization\
    \ for secure\nUAV network systems is also a critical challenge. Blockchain implementation\
    \ in UAV\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n23 of 30\nsystems presents a complex system integration\
    \ problem requiring rigorous testing before\nconcrete implementation [12].\nIntegration\
    \ of AI schemes: Recently, the utilization of AI schemes among DL, ML, and\nRL\
    \ has become increasingly of interest, to beneﬁt from their powerful performance.\
    \ AI\nschemes are being integrated into UAV-enabled MEC systems as a way to make\
    \ contextual\ndecisions and learn from aggregated data gathered from previous\
    \ tracking experiences. The\ndata collected by the sensors in real-time can be\
    \ proﬁtably exploited for the autonomous\npiloting of UAVs. Therefore, processing\
    \ tasks demand strict computing and storage\nrequirements at computing facilities,\
    \ to be executed exceptionally at the edge. UAVs\nalso have energy and storage\
    \ limitations; thus, portable and lightweight RL, ML, and DL\nalgorithms should\
    \ be designed to cope with these constraints.\nRegulations: Despite the rapid\
    \ emergence of this technology, UAV regulations are\nstill in their infancy, and\
    \ a lack of heterogeneity of national rules and varying levels of\nimplementation\
    \ can be observed. These regulations differ from state to state, and the type\n\
    of regulation is based on the requirements of that use. Several problems are associated\
    \ with\nUAV regulation, including delays in ﬂight approval and poorly documented\
    \ administrative\nprocesses limiting the desired ﬂexibility, preventing widespread\
    \ use of the technology [144].\nLatency and computation issues: Communication\
    \ latency and computing optimization\nremain concerns in MEC-enabled UAV applications,\
    \ affecting transmission efﬁciency and\nreaction time under communication and\
    \ computing constraints. UAV transmission success\nmay be accomplished by offering\
    \ effective methods that decrease response delay. In\none study [145], for example,\
    \ stochastic geometry and queueing theory approaches were\nstudied to minimize\
    \ the response delay for a MEC-enabled UAV network.\nResource allocation: Due\
    \ to UAV battery concerns and trajectory constraints, resource\nallocation is\
    \ critical in UAV-enabled MEC networks. Resources allocation is involved in\n\
    three processes: computing task ofﬂoading, local computing, and UAV hovering.\
    \ Design-\ning an appropriate trajectory can ultimately compromise the calculated\
    \ performance and\noperating costs. According to the authors of [146], resource\
    \ allocation may be structured to\nmeet various goals, including computing bit\
    \ maximization, energy minimization, compu-\ntational efﬁciency maximization,\
    \ cost minimization, completion time minimization, and\nthe consideration of fairness.\n\
    UAV-enabled IoT for B5G and 6G issues: Data-gathering faces several problems in\
    \ IoT\nthat extend beyond the ﬁfth-generation (B5G) and upcoming sixth-generation\
    \ (6G) wireless\nmobile networks. A large amount of data will be generated by\
    \ heterogeneous devices,\nparticularly IoT devices and smartphones at the mobile\
    \ edge; these data are fragmented and\ndispersed among several machines. Therefore,\
    \ distributed solutions such as UAV-enabled\nMEC should be leveraged near mobile\
    \ users to ofﬂoad and process the data. Meanwhile,\ngrowing privacy concerns make\
    \ data collecting increasingly challenging. This consumes\nmore energy and decreases\
    \ the system’s ofﬂoading time [147].\n6. Conclusions\nThe development of wireless\
    \ communication technologies and IT services has made\nthe role of drones more\
    \ ubiquitous in various ﬁelds of application. Drones can serve\nas a link between\
    \ smart devices and cloud data centers, to provide many services that\ncan increase\
    \ the performance of a given IoT system. To the best of our knowledge, this\n\
    paper is considered the ﬁrst work that provides a review of drone-enabled MECs\
    \ based on\nAI. This work discusses the current research trends and provides future\
    \ insights into the\npotential uses of UAV-enabled MEC in the ﬁeld of IoT. It\
    \ highlights the potential roles that\nUAVs can play in enabling communications\
    \ and intelligent computing in the IoT era, by\nreferring to the most widely emerging\
    \ AI techniques that are employed. As mentioned,\nUAVs as MECs are attracting\
    \ considerable interest in scientiﬁc research, to address the\nvarious problems\
    \ and challenges experienced in order to improve the performance of such\napplications\
    \ in different scenarios, such as resource allocation, energy efﬁciency, latency,\n\
    task ofﬂoading, and security. UAV-enabled MEC present an emerging concept that\
    \ require\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n24 of 30\nmore effort to achieve the necessary\
    \ performance in every scenario of UAV application in\nIoT environments, especially\

    ((EAISICC)) Abstract The domain of the internet of things will encompass a wide
    range of technologies. Thus, single reference architecture cannot be used as a
    blueprint for all possible concrete implementations. While a reference model can
    probably be identified, it is likely that several reference architectures will
    coexist in the internet of things. In this context, architecture is specifically
    defined as a framework for specifying the physical components and functional organization
    and configuration of a network, operational principles, and procedures, as well
    as data formats used in its operation. In fact, IoT is like an umbrella around
    all possible computer devices around us. Therefore, the IoT architecture should
    be open enough with open protocols to support a variety of existing network applications.
    Additionally, some middleware for scalability, security, and semantic representation
    should also be included to promote data world integration with the internet. This
    chapter provides a comprehensive review of the internet of things architectures.
    Keywords Architecture Domain Platform Framework Access provided by University
    of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download chapter PDF 1 Introduction The internet of things
    is a network of physical objects, intelligent devices, vehicles, buildings and
    sensors, communication protocols, and software which collect, exchange, store,
    analyze, and process data. The IoT is based on the strict connectivity between
    the digital and the physical world by the sensor [1]. According to the Gartner
    report, by 2020, 25 billion devices will be connected to the internet and these
    communications will make it easier to use data independently for analysis, preplanning,
    management, and decision-making [2]. In this context, architecture is defined
    as a framework to define the physical components of a network and its functional
    organization and configuration, its operating principles and procedures, and the
    data formats used in its operation. IoT architecture comprises a collection of
    physical objects, sensors, cloud services, developers, actuators, communication
    layers, users, business layers, and IoT protocols. Because of the wide domain
    of internet objects, there is no single consensus on IoT architecture, which is
    universally agreed. Different architectures were proposed by different researchers.
    This chapter describes a range of domain-specific architectures based on RFID,
    supply chain management, industry, service-oriented architecture, wireless sensor
    network, logistics, healthcare, smart cities, connected living, big data, social
    computing, security, and cloud computing. IoT Functional Blocks The sensing layer,
    communication layer, management layer, cloud layer, services, and application
    layer are the number of IoT systems functional blocks [3]. Sensing Layer The main
    function of the sensing layer is to detect changes in the physical condition of
    connected things in real time. It includes sensors that are the main components
    of this layer. The sensor is responsible for measuring the physical environment,
    identifying and locating intelligent objects, collecting data, and sending data
    to the cloud layer for processing and storage. The actuators in this layer are
    generally mechanical devices, such as switches, which execute the desired device.
    Communication Layer The layer of communication is responsible for the interaction
    of the IoT architecture layers. The data collected in the sensing layer are transferred
    directly to the cloud or the service and application layer. It comprises routers,
    switches, and gateways connected to devices that cannot connect to the cloud directly.
    Protocols such as CoAP [4], Message Queuing Telemetry Transportation (MQTT) [5],
    and Lightweight Machine to Machine (LwM2M) connect different IoT devices to send
    data to upper layers [6]. Cloud Layer It is also known as the IoT system processing
    unit. Data collected from sensors and devices are ingested into the cloud layer.
    Data storage, processing, and analysis are its functions. In general, the cloud
    uses a data center as a central server to process the data generated by the edge
    device. Cloud computing research in the next generation is continuing to decentralize
    certain processing tasks from cloud to edge nodes to improve computing performance
    [7]. Management Layer It is responsible for operating and monitoring all other
    layers with the features of the cloud management tools, which are normally implemented.
    Services and Applications Layer The layer of services and applications provides
    applications and a variety of services, including data collection, data analysis,
    data visualization, and security. They depend on the use cases and the desired
    features for the end-users. IoT Device Management Tools In this section, we have
    selected a variety of tools on the market, which have the potential to play an
    essential role in monitoring smart things in the IoT solutions. These tools were
    selected because they are suitable stand-alone IoT device management tools with
    extensive implementation in several industrial use cases. Xively CPM Xively Connected
    Product Management (CPM) is a tool that offers solutions for enterprises building
    connected products and services. Moreover, it enables companies to easily build
    and manage IoT security, connected devices, and products including home automation
    and capturing their IoT data. It provides a simple and scalable platform enriched
    with tools necessary to connect, manage, and engage things. It has standard APIs
    for integrating data with primary enterprise systems, such as Customer Relationship
    Management (CRM) [8, 9]. DevicePilot DevicePilot implements locating, monitoring,
    and managing connected devices at scale. It is completely agnostic, providing
    platform connectivity to any device, and easily integrates with IoT platforms.
    It is a cloud-based application, which scales with the deployed infrastructure,
    schemaless, and provides all functionalities via a REST API [10]. Wind River HDC
    Wind River Helix Device Cloud (HDC) is a tool that helps reduce the complexities
    of building and managing large-scale IoT deployments. It enables device health
    monitoring, bidirectional file transfer, remote access to help service engineers
    detect, and diagnose problems before they impact critical data collection. HDC
    provides tools one needs for deploying, monitoring, servicing, updating, and decommissioning
    IoT devices [11]. QuickLink IoT QuickLink is a resource efficient device management
    solution based on LwM2M and OMA-DM standards. It supports device provisioning,
    configuration, diagnostics management, and over-the-air updates. It has a plug-in
    API architecture with encrypted data collection using CoAP with Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) [12]. ThingWorx Utilities ThingWorx Utilities is a set of tools
    rich in features that enable and support the rapid deployment and adoption of
    powerful IoT applications. It provides device management capabilities for day-to-day
    management of the connected devices and includes utilities to provide, remotely
    monitor, and update the connected devices and assets. With its standard framework,
    it is also possible to integrate new IoT applications into existing business systems
    [13]. Particle Particle is a full-stack IoT device management platform that provides
    all the necessary tools to securely and reliably connect IoT devices to the web/cloud.
    The solution can be used on different scales of deployment from large enterprises
    to innovative start-ups and everyone in between. It is secured by using encrypted
    communication protocols, easy to use, and provides an interface to see devices,
    push software updates, and make changes and improvements on an ongoing basis.
    It offers several development tools, such as Web IDE, Desktop IDE, and a Command
    Line Interface (CLI). The device management console can manage team permissions
    from a single administrative interface. Support for cross-vendor devices are limited
    and continuously developed [14]. Losant Helm Losant Helm is a fully integrated
    IoT device management and connectivity tool directly embedded in the Losant IoT
    platform, an enterprise-ready cloud platform that enables developers to easily
    make use of real-time data by rapidly developing smart, connected solutions for
    IoT. It serves as a control hub for connecting production facilities and its hardware
    agnostic platform is easily integrated with a broad variety of sensors, controllers,
    machines, and device gateways. This enables many-to-many interoperability across
    disparate systems and technologies. Its open communication standards (REST, MQTT)
    provide simple connectivity to millions of devices [15]. DataV IoT Device Management
    This tool makes equipment and device management a priority as industrial companies
    connects more business-crucial assets together with IoT. It gives the power to
    manage the full lifecycle of all assets from a centralized location, including
    configuration, inventory, and OTA software updates and configuration [16]. 1.1
    Three-and Five-Layer Architectures According to most of the researcher’s opinions,
    IoT architecture is considered to be three layers. Figure 2.1 represents the conventional
    IoT architecture. Fig. 2.1 Conventional IoT architecture Full size image 1. The
    perception layer is the physical layer with environmental information sensors.
    In the environment, some physical parameters are sensed, or other intelligent
    objects are identified. 2. The network layer connects to other intelligent devices,
    network devices, and servers. Its functions are also used for transmitting and
    processing sensor data. 3. The application layer is responsible for providing
    the user with specific application services. It defines different applications
    for the IoT, such as smart homes, smart cities, and intelligent health. The three-layer
    architecture defines the main idea of IoT, but it is not sufficient for IoT research,
    because research often focuses on the finer aspects of IoT. Hence, the five-layer
    architecture is defined. Figure 2.2 shows the five-layer architecture of IoT.
    Fig. 2.2 The five-layer IoT architecture Full size image The role of the perception
    and application layers in this architecture is the same as three-layer architecture.
    The functions of the other three layers are as follows [17]: 1. The transport
    layer transfers sensor data from the perception layer to the processing layer
    and vice versa via networks such as Bluetooth, wireless, 3G, LAN (Near Field Communications),
    NFC, and RFID. 2. The processing layer is also referred to as the middleware layer.
    It can store, analyze, and process large quantities of transportation data. Also,
    it can manage and provide a variety of lower layers of services. It uses many
    technologies, such as databases, cloud computing, and big data processing modules.
    3. The entire IoT system is managed by the business layer, including applications,
    business and business models, and user privacy [18]. Another architecture proposed
    by Ning and Wang [19] is inspired by the processing layers in the human brain.
    It is inspired by the intelligence and ability of human beings to think, feel,
    remember, take decisions, and react to the physical environment. It consists of
    three parts. First, the human brain is similar to the processing and data management
    unit or data center. Second, the spinal cord is analogous to the distributed network
    of nodes and intelligent data processing gates. Third, the nerve network corresponds
    to the network components and sensors [20]. 2 Survey on Domain-Specific Useful
    IoT Architectures As presented at the beginning of this chapter, the internet
    of things has a wide range of objects. Therefore, there is no particular architecture
    for it and it is based on different domains of different architectures provided
    by the researchers. Figure 2.3 shows IoT application domains. Fig. 2.3 IoT application
    domains Full size image 2.1 RFID Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN),
    NFC, Wireless Platforms for Identification and Sensing (WISP), and RFID will show
    a new horizon for IoT. Recently, a report by the United Nations (UN) reported
    that humanity is approaching a new decade of ubiquitous RFID-enabled systems in
    which people are dwarfed by internet-oriented objects, as they are the majority
    [21]. Appropriate IoT-based modeling can solve the situation through valuable
    savings and communication [22]. In this context, RFID readers and tags [23] are
    a new holistic system in which a unique identity can characterize each tag. These
    forms of tags are suitable for the monitoring of cattle in remote homes and for
    human personification. The RFID reader transmits a signal to its periphery, which
    activates the nearby tags to respond with its unique key. The transmission of
    real-time information may help to implement rigorous stratification between objects
    of interest [24]. The RFID tag acts as an ID of concern device in the form of
    an adhesive sticker [25]. Many manufacturers are currently producing smaller versions
    of RFID tags. 2.1.1 Electronic Product Code Based IoT Architecture The first introduction
    to IoT comes from a “things-oriented” perspective, where very simple RFID tags
    are considered. The concept of IoT architecture for several scenarios, such as
    Auto-ID laboratories, Electronic Product Code (EPC), and Object Name Service (ONS),
    is all designed for architecture IoT with a global design. The EPC objective supports
    the use of RFID and extends it to the global network for the modern future of
    the network, and also creates the intelligent industry as a global standard for
    the EPC global network. EPC was developed by Auto-ID from the Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology to share data in real-time by finding a unique identifier and using
    RFID, wireless communication technology, via internet infrastructure and platform
    [26]. In the EPC global architecture, the EPC is the unique identifier associated
    with a physical object. The EPC Global Tag Data Standard defines its structure
    and code rules. The unique structure of the encoding (to avoid collisions between
    names) is guaranteed by the use of a central registration authority. In Fig. 2.4,
    the EPC Network Services are the responsibility of the EPC’s global central authority
    and are responsible for providing discovery services to global EPC parties (end-users).
    The root management of the Object Naming Service (ONS) is also responsible for
    the central authority since it allocates the EPC blocks. Local ONS is the responsibility
    of the EPC manager (one per registered end-user) [27]. Fig. 2.4 EPC global system
    architecture Full size image Upon receipt of the address of the EPC Information
    Service (EPCIS), which is responsible for the EPC of interest, the EPCIS Accessing
    Application will use the EPCIS query interface (i/f) to request additional information
    on the EPC (e.g., class/instance level or transactional data on the EPC). The
    EPCIS query interface uses both push and pulls mode, so observations concerning
    a particular EPC can also be notified. The EPCIS Repository is a functional block
    located on the “end-user A” side of the EPC Global Network, which deals with the
    storage of information (of any kind) that it wishes to share with other parties
    (e.g., end-user B). All interfaces must be implemented according to EPCglobal
    standards, but “end-users” have a certain degree of freedom to implement these
    blocks [27]. The ONS block is a simple search service mapping an EPC to the address
    of a designated EPCIS service containing EPC information. The functional block
    Filtering & Collection is responsible for collecting raw tag data in accordance
    with the policies of the EPCIS Capturing Application Box. Example of this policy
    is: The collection of all EPCs of a certain class read at a certain date, location,
    and time interval. The EPCIS Capturing Application monitors the operation at the
    lower level of the model and provides a business context through coordination
    with other components involved in a particular business process. Once again, the
    end-user has a great deal of freedom to implement this box, since the Application
    Level Event (ALE I/f) and the capture of I/f are implemented in accordance with
    EPCglobal standards. The Data Capture Device Box (Tag Reader) is the only observing
    event related to RFID tags that completes the lower level. These events are provided
    by the corresponding reader i/f in the Filtering & Collection box [28]. The reverse
    mapping is intended to verify that the EPCglobal architecture is compatible with
    the IoT reference model. The EPCglobal architecture shown in Fig. 2.4 above is
    not a specific EPCglobal domain model, but a high-level diagram of a specific
    architecture. Since the two models are not exactly similar in nature (i.e., the
    IoT domain model is clearly “concept” while the EPCglobal is a description of
    the high-level system architecture), the reverse mapping of the EPCglobal architecture
    to the IoT domain model is not easy or simple [29]. 2.2 Service-Oriented Architecture
    (SOA) Service-Oriented Architecture is a software system architecture (Fig. 2.5)
    that can be achieved by connecting to an independent functional entity that can
    perform specific tasks to meet the needs of business integration in the internet
    environment. SOA is a component of the model. It connects the different functional
    application units through well-defined interfaces and contracts between these
    services [30]. Fig. 2.5 Thing-based SOA Full size image SOA is an architectural
    pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services
    to other components via a communication protocol, usually over a network. The
    principles of service orientation are independent of any supplier, product, or
    technology. In the IoT domain, the integrated SOA approach is currently invoked
    using the concept of middleware, i.e., a software layer superimposed between the
    application and the technology layer, which hides unnecessary relevant details
    from the development time of the developed product, helping the design workflow
    to simplify the process of marketing commercial results [31]. 2.2.1 IoT Middleware
    Architecture A three-layer middleware architecture based on RFID relies on three
    associative functionalities, such as Tag association, place association, and user
    antenna association. The three layer structure consists of device access layer,
    event processing layer and application interaction layer. The device layer can
    collect data from the entity. It does not have a simple processing and filtration
    function. The equipment layer consists of IoT perception, such as the barcode,
    RFID, ZigBee, sensors, PDA, and wireless network. In the computer world and the
    information system, these devices can display physical world information in real
    time in digital form [32]. However, the difficulty in program development is increased
    by different types, different manufacturers, and different device models. The
    addition or reduction of all types of equipment can make many system changes [33].
    Process and store information for the upper application based on the application
    system or user requirements for secondary processing. The middleware layer consists
    of the device’s access layer, the information processing layer and the application’s
    interaction [34]. It is connected by a web interface between different layers.
    The application layer consists of the ERP, the business system, and each connection
    of the intelligent logistics system subsystems, including an intelligent management
    system based on UHF RFID technology, an intelligent shelf system, a storage environment
    monitoring system, and an intelligent inventory system. ERP or other business
    systems provide business orders to the middleware system, each warehouse subsystem
    coordinates with each other homework, each subsystem also requests and subscribes
    business orders to the middleware system according to the different operations,
    middleware system releases the corresponding incident reporters after completing
    the corresponding business operations (Fig. 2.6). Fig. 2.6 IOT middleware architecture
    Full size image A holistic IoT architecture consisting of heterogeneous devices,
    Embedded Internet Systems (EIS), standard communication protocols, and the SOA
    paradigm using the CoAP protocol and standard services enables the exchange of
    sensor data with an IoT-based cloud and a private cloud while disseminating web-based
    human–machine interfaces for configuration, monitoring, and visualization [35].
    The INOX platform [36] advocates a similar approach consisting of three layers,
    such as (a) the service layer supports and contains services using APIs; (b) the
    platform layer contains the necessary management and orchestration to enrich the
    hardware layer for the deployment of services and virtualization technologies;
    and (c) the hardware layer contains sensors and intelligent objects. The authors
    advocate the reuse of integrated techniques during the joint composition of hardware
    and software in the establishment of the company at the time of the implementation
    of SOA. A common connection between the SOA and the middleware was proposed with
    an integrated architectural approach that improves the functionality of the device,
    communication, and integrated services. Buckl et al. (2009) and Spiess et al.
    [37] show an IoT middleware architecture based on five-layer SOA, where objects
    are located at the bottom of an object abstraction, service management (provides
    services such as dynamic discovery, status monitoring, and configuration of objects).
    Semantic operations [38], such as QoS, lock, police, and context management (Hydra
    Middleware Project), service layer composition, and application layers are in
    a row. In addition, a domestic infrastructure based on SOA-oriented IoT is developed
    in the literature, in which the logic of automatic energy consumption based on
    sensors and actuators is implied. From this point of view, the authors of Spiess
    et al. [37] and Buckl et al. used two advanced computer languages, such as: Business
    Process Execution Language (BPEL) (defined as: Business processes that interact
    with external entities via Web Service (Web Service Definition Language (WSDL))
    (OASIS) and Jolie (target application, specific set of objects or limitations)).
    2.3 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) The wireless sensor network is a network of
    sensor nodes where each node is equipped with a sensor to detect physical phenomena
    such as light, heat, and pressure. WSNs are considered a revolutionary method
    of collecting information to create an information and communication system that
    greatly improves infrastructure systems’ reliability and efficiency. WSNs feature
    easier deployment and better device flexibility compared to the wired solution
    [39]. WSNs will become the key technology for IoT with the rapid technological
    development of sensors. WSN [40] is one of the IoT system’s key components. It
    consists of a limited number of sensor nodes (mote) mastered using a multi-layered
    protocol organization using a special purpose node (sink) [41]: energy efficiency,
    scalability, reliability, robustness, etc., in particular. When designing a WSN-powered
    system, parameters are sought. The IEEE 802.15.4 protocol for the provision of
    wireless personal area networks (WPAN) is the most commonly used WSN systems for
    communication purposes. The most important standard for WSN communication is IEEE
    802.5.14. It defies the physical and connecting layer for wireless short-range
    transmission, low power consumption, low complexity, and low cost. It uses 800/900
    MHz and 2.4 GHz ISM frequency bands. IEEE 802.15.4 is the basis for other standards
    such as ZigBee, Wireless, Hart, WIA-PA, and ISA.100.11a that challenge regional
    or market-specific versions. The base standard was published in 2003 and revisions
    in 2006 and 2011. Several changes have been added to cover additional protocols
    for the physical layer, regional frequency bands, and specific application areas.
    Current work includes other frequency bands (e.g., TV white space and regional
    bands), ultra-low power operation, and specific applications such as train control
    [42]. 2.3.1 Agricultural Monitoring IoT Architecture Agriculture is the primary
    occupation in our country for ages. But now due to the migration of people from
    rural to urban, there is a hindrance in agriculture. So to overcome this problem
    we go for smart agriculture techniques using IoT. This project includes various
    features like GPS-based remote controlled monitoring, moisture and temperature
    sensing, intruders scaring, security, leaf wetness, and proper irrigation facilities.
    It makes use of wireless sensor networks for noting the soil properties and environmental
    factors continuously. Various sensor nodes are deployed at different locations
    on the farm. Controlling these parameters are through any remote device or internet
    services and the operations are performed by interfacing sensors, Wi-Fi, and a
    camera with a microcontroller. This concept is created as a product and given
    to the farmer’s welfare [43]. Agriculture-based IoT is envisaged by developing
    a prototype platform [44] that controls network information integration to study
    the actual situation of agricultural production while operating from a remote
    location. This study employs WSN as the backbone of the implementation. Recent
    work has proposed a six-layered agriculture architecture that incorporates WSN
    as a subsidiary element to enhance multi-culture analysis, user experience, and
    predictive analysis [45]. 2.4 IoT Architecture for Smart Cities By leveraging
    innovative IoT architectural concepts, the present world can be shaped into a
    well-connected, intelligent society. This section develops research to bring the
    world to an intelligent place where logistics and intelligent living formulations
    can live and develop into an intelligent city. Figure 2.7 shows an IoT platform
    that could serve as a generic architectural basis for the development of smart
    cities. The main element is the integrated information center, which an IoT service
    provider operates. At the bottom, this center is linked to a range of services,
    including electricity, water, central heating and gas, Intelligent Transport (ITS),
    urban fire protection and security, cooperative medical services, commercial and
    tourism services, and the payment of taxes and fees. Additional platforms in this
    architecture include support for these services: cloud computing and data center,
    management center, application platform, urban eGovernment development platform,
    controlling emergency plans, a mobile service platform, and internet infrastructure
    [46]. Fig. 2.7 A generic IoT architecture for a smart city Full size image 2.5
    IoT-Fog Architecture The intelligent network uses numerous IoT applications to
    support its intelligent network monitoring and control. The requirements of IoT
    applications vary due to different tasks in the intelligent grid. Fog computing
    extends computing to the edge of a network that matches IoT applications perfectly.
    However, the distributed coordination within fog computing nodes in the intelligent
    grid cannot be met by existing schemes. Figure 2.8 presents an architecture based
    on fog for IoT applications in the smart grid architecture consisting of three
    layers: the terminal layer, the fog layer, and the cloud layer [47]. Fig. 2.8
    Fog computing-based architecture for IoT application in smart grid Full size image
    The terminal node layer is the lower layer consisting of intelligent devices that
    transmit sensed data and event logs to the top layer. The middle layer of Fog
    Nodes (FN) is the layer of fog. The FN is deployed on a network edge to expand
    the processing capacity of a cloud center. The cloud layer is the architecture’s
    top layer. This layer consists of powerful servers that analyze massive historical
    data, such as data centers. There is a fog layer in this architecture. Our fog
    layer is divided into sub-layer FN and sub-layer FN Coordination (FNC) compared
    to the traditional fog computing model. The FNs in the FN sub-layer provide a
    mechanism for migrating processing logic to the edge of the network with computing
    and storage capabilities. The FN sub-layer can also aggregate sensed data from
    the terminal node. After collection and analysis, some of the data are returned
    to the active nodes in the terminal node layer to complete the response and process
    in real time to the emergency event. The rest of the data are sent to the FNC
    sub-layer. The FNC sub-layer consists of several coordinators in service areas.
    FNs are divided into several clusters in this layer, some of which are computerized
    and stored in accordance with certain principles. For simplicity, such equipment
    is called Fog Computing Coordinators (FCN). The FCNs are focused on coordinating
    the FNs for complex tasks [47]. 2.6 IoT-Based Architecture for Healthcare Development
    IoT devices can mainly be used to facilitate further monitoring of health and
    emergency health systems. The internet and the World Wide Web (www) were the main
    drivers of globalization, promoting the convergence of electronic communications
    and media services. The internet is now a medium of social interaction. It is
    an important development that can change the way people work, learn, and live
    [48]. The authors proposed the iHome Health-IoT in home health services platform
    based on IoT, which illustrates a three-layer open platform intelligent medicine
    box (iMedBox) for various medical facilities integrated with sensors, devices,
    and communication via WAN, GPRS, and/or 3G [49]. RFID and performance capabilities
    enabled by functional materials, flexible and wearable biomedical sensors (Bio-Patch)
    enable services such as intelligent pharmaceutical packaging (iMedPack). Bio-Patch
    decides when to call remote doctors, emergency centers, hospitals, test clinics,
    and retailers in the supply chain. The Home Health Hub IoT (H3IoT) is intended
    to disseminate elderly health care at home (see Fig. 2.9) [50]. It is a five-layer
    approach (i.e., Information Processing Layer (IPL), Local Communication Layer
    (LCL), Internet Application Layer (IAL), Physiological Sensing Layer (PSL), and
    User Application Layer (UAL)) in order to assess and monitor the physiological
    changes of the elderly and to carry out subsequent health checks by doctors and
    caregivers. Fig. 2.9 Fog Home Health Hub IoT (H3IoT) platform Full size image
    2.7 Object-Based Security Architecture (OSCAR) The object-based security architecture
    is based on the concept of the security of objects related to the security of
    the application. The architecture includes authorization servers that provide
    customers with secrets of access that allow them to request resources from restricted
    CoAP nodes. OSCAR supports facilities such as caching and multicasting, while
    providing a mechanism to protect against attacks by replaying DTLS with the CoAP,
    and does not affect the operation of restricted objects by radio cycling. The
    authors evaluate OSCAR in two cases: (a) 802.15.4 Lossy Networks enabled by low
    power (LLN) and (b) communication between machine and machine (M2M) for two different
    hardware platforms and MAC layers on a real testbed using the Cooja emulator.
    The architecture was evaluated according to an intelligent city paradigm. This
    work is based on the concept of object security related to the application’s payload.
    Researchers move expensive radio communications from restricted CoAP nodes to
    more powerful servers in the proposed OSCAR architecture. They introduce authorization
    servers that store certificates and provide consumer access secrets to enable
    producers to request resources [51]. 2.8 Cyber-Physical and Social Security Architecture
    A cyber-physical–social security architecture (IPM) proposed to address information,
    physical and management security perspectives on the basis of the IoT and Ubiquitous
    IoT (U2IoT) model. Figure 2.10 shows the U2IoT security architecture (IPM) in
    three perspectives. Fig. 2.10 Security architecture (IPM). Information security
    includes two perspectives (i.e., security layer and security requirement). P:
    Physical security relates to monitoring of the environment, detection of movement,
    location, monitoring, perimeter control, and monitoring of consumption. The artificial
    immunity concept is used to detect passive and active homeostasis defenses. M:
    Management security provides the recommended requirement for human social activities
    and events, industry/local/national regulations, and international policies and
    standards. In order to guarantee U2IoT security and privacy, IPM realizes the
    union of the cyber world, the physical world, and human society [52] Full size
    image 2.9 Hierarchical Architecture of Security This architecture covers most
    security technologies and ensures full compatibility of various security mechanisms.
    The proposed architecture aims to improve the entire security system’s efficiency,
    reliability, and controllability. In order to combat vulnerability, a coarse-grained
    security cell is designed to protect the IoT-enabled system in the form of information,
    data, control, and behavior together with a refined secure subject. The security
    of the longitudinal 2D security architecture is further classified according to
    the environment: security of the perceptual layer, network layer security, middleware
    layer, and application layer security. In each layer, division by function consists
    of identity security, data security, control security, and security behavior [53].
    Vertically, in a complicated environment, the hierarchical security architecture
    can isolate various subjects and analyze the relevant security technology in a
    relatively closed application and attack scene. The security mechanism sorted
    by the data flow processing sequence consists of identity security, data security,
    and control security horizontally in the same layer. A brief analysis of the security
    architecture structure is as follows: First, because of its controllable and closed
    backbone network and mature technology, network layer security is the simplest
    compared to the other layers. Second, although the application layer environment
    is open, its mature infrastructure (e.g., web and database server and operating
    system) and the absence of a unified security mode have led to numerous studies
    of its security technology. Cloud computing is an important technology in the
    middleware layer. Although the technology itself remains incomplete, related field
    research focuses on security technology (especially user data and privacy protection).
    In contrast, for several reasons, the perceptual layer environment is the most
    complicated. First, the difficulty of using only one type of security technology
    is determined by different perceptual networks. Second, the perceptual environment
    is open, which means that security measures previously used in closed environments
    can cause open environmental problems. Limited resources, poor performance, and
    heterogeneity of several perceptive nodes can eventually lead to numerous security
    problems. However, related studies of these perceptive layer characteristics are
    limited. Therefore, security research in the perceptual network is essential [54].
    From the point of view of application logic, the perceptual layer and the application
    layer of the mechanism are closely related. Therefore, perceptual security, together
    with the security of the entire system, must be considered rather than separated
    from the safety of other layers. Privacy protection, terminal identity privacy,
    and perceptual layer privacy are, for example, closely linked to storage security
    and user data protection in the application layer. Intrusion detection also requires
    cross-layer cooperation to effectively identify malicious terminals, facilities,
    and institutions [53]. 2.10 Media-Aware Traffic Security Architecture Zhou et
    al. [55] propose an efficient Media Traffic Security Architecture (MTSA) that
    facilitates various IoT multimedia applications. Multimedia applications running
    on IoT can use MTSA as one of the first traffic management strategies with security
    awareness. MTSA provides a general security architecture that is aware of the
    media, taking into account the characteristics of multimedia traffic, security,
    and IoT. MTSA uses a context-aware multimedia service security framework. The
    MTSA framework is shown in Fig. 2.11. The distribution of the inactive paradigm
    of visual sharing is used in this architecture. It uses a visual confidentiality
    measure that degrades proportionally to the number of shares in an eavesdropper’s
    possession [55]. Fig. 2.11 Media-aware traffic security architecture (MTSA) Full
    size image 2.11 HIMMO-Based Security Architecture “HIMMO” is a comprehensive,
    lightweight safety architecture designed to protect IoT throughout the device’s
    life cycle. HIMMO is not only resourced efficiently but also allows advanced IoT
    protocols and deployments. HIMMO can be integrated into existing communication
    protocols such as IEEE 802.15.4 or OMA LWM2 M with a number of advantages, such
    as performance and operation. The main features of this type of security architecture
    are full collusion resistance, device authentication, and verification and backend,
    an agreement between key pairs, support for multiple TTPs and key controls, or
    protection from DoS attacks [56]. Some of the HIMMO architecture features are
    presented below. A solution that is light (time and energy) and scalable and compatible
    with the life cycle is required to protect IoT. Security architecture based on
    HIMMO allows: Key pair agreement + implicit certification and verification of
    credentials Multiple TTP support While being Lightweight Scalable Resistant to
    collusion and possibly quantity safe The identity-based security of HIMMO is easily
    integrated with existing protocols (DTLS, IEEE 802.15.4) with many advantages.
    For other primitives, such as stream cipher, HIMMO algorithm can be reused. Implementation
    of HIMMO open source available for research (Oscar dot Garcia at Philips dot com)
    Operation Easy integration in protocols Collusion resistance Key agreement Credential
    verification Infrastructure Efficient resistance to root capture Ensures privacy
    Key escrow Facilitates secure manufacturing Long-term security Network access

    Device identification/blacklisting [56]. 2.12 Security Architecture Based on IoTNetWar
    The architectural framework of IoTNetWar has a defense basis to introduce advanced
    network-based technologies into defense. This architecture (Fig. 2.12) has four
    layers: the physical sensing layer, the gateway communication layer, the C4ISR
    management layer (transport protocol), and the application layer invasion designed
    to assimilate integrated military communication, intellectual intelligence, and
    control of C4ISR under one roof. C4ISR layer monitors the interaction between
    the defense headquarters and its data center through voice cooperation [57]. Fig.
    2.12 IoTNetWar architectural framework Full size image 3 Conclusion The objective
    of this chapter was to provide a review of the most critical aspects of IoT with
    a specific focus on IoT device architecture. Therefore, first the background and
    definition of IoT are given. Second, thorough discussions on the fundamentals
    behind IoT architectures are elaborated. Next, several key domains where IoT-based
    research works are currently going on are visited. References L. Atzori, A. Iera,
